It would have been easy for Alex Perez to become discouraged.
Perez is set to make his big show debut at UFC Fresno this Saturday, but making it to the Octagon took longer than expected.
With 15 wins in his last 17 fights dating back to January 2012, the 25-year-old Team Oyama product seemed like a sure bet to bolster the UFC's flyweight ranks at some point. Somehow the promotion and Perez kept passing each other by even as he repeatedly popped up on their radar.
Not only was Perez one of countless fighters who have auditioned for The Ultimate Fighter only to miss out on being selected, he also found himself competing in front of none other than Dana White when the UFC president was making the rounds to film his Lookin' for a Fight series. The intention of White's show is to scour every nook and cranny of the United States to find hidden talent, and while Perez actually managed to pick up a win with White in the building, he wasn't the focus of the episode and admits that he could have done more to capture White's attention.
“They weren't looking at me specifically, they were looking at somebody else, but Dana White and all those guys were there,” Perez recently told MMA Fighting. “I dominated my performance, I just didn't do it the way I should have done it to get a contract.”
Undeterred, Perez returned to the regional scene where he expected to take a booking with Tachi Palace Fights; instead, his manager threw him a curve ball that Perez readily knocked out of the park.
“I was getting ready for another fight,” said Perez. “I was getting ready to fight at 135 at Tachi Palace for the title and I had just got done doing my medicals in California and my manager calls me, he's like, ‘Hey, can you make ‘25?' I'm like, ‘Depending on the offer, you know?' And he told me about Dana White's Contender Series, he told me what it was about and I was like, ‘Yeah, I'm down.' So that's how that opportunity came about. I was just fortunate that my manager did a great job getting me that fight.”
The Tuesday Night Contender Series is another Dana White vehicle used to discover talent, more akin to a traditional fight card after which White chooses one or two fighters to receive contracts. Perez finally earned his with a slick first-round submission of Kevin Gray in August.
Now Perez (18-4) gets to make his UFC debut at the Save Mart Center in Fresno, Calif., less than an hour's drive from his hometown of Lemoore. He expects to have about a hundred seats filled by friends and family, who will be there to witness Perez fulfill a dream that he's had for years.
“I set goals for myself to be in the UFC at a young age, I have all these goals I want to accomplish, but a good friend told me ‘things take time and when it happens, that's your time,'” said Perez. “It couldn't happen any better. I get signed to the UFC and then the UFC all of a sudden decides to be in Fresno so that has to be a sign that it was my time to be in the UFC.”
Perez's athletic career began as a high school wrestler in Lemoore, though he described himself as “average” compared to the abundant talent in the Central Valley region of California. If anything, he's beginning to be recognized more for his MMA exploits, something that he's not exactly thrilled about.
“I don't like all the ‘oh, is that you?' I usually try to say no at first, I've had some people recognize me,” Perez explained when asked if his fighting career had boosted his local profile. “‘Is that you?' I'm like, ‘No, that's not me.' ‘Wait, you're lying,' and my friend is like, ‘Oh yeah, that's him.' I'm like, ‘Aw, s**t.' I don't like all that too much. It's been weird.”
Though Perez is uncomfortable with celebrity, he may have to get used to it if he continues his winning ways in the UFC. A spectacular debut could go a long way towards establishing his name, which is a good thing since he recently shed the uninspiring moniker of “The Decision” that may have played a part in UFC officials overlooking him for so long.
“Actually, my friend gave me the nickname,” said Perez. “I don't know why I let him give me the nickname. My first amateur fight, I TKO'd the kid, and then the next two were decisions and after that they just called me The Decision. People thought it was funny and to me, I couldn't care less what people think. It's about what I do in the cage. Yeah, I do have decision wins, but to me a nickname is a nickname. If you're called ‘The Great' and you go out there and get knocked out in 10 seconds, it doesn't matter, the nickname don't matter. It's a person who's fighting.
“They just told me to change the name and I was like, ‘Okay', and they're like, ‘What's your new nickname?' I'm just going to be Alex Perez, no other other nickname. I'm not changing my name 400 times, I just dropped the ‘Decision' part.”
Perez (not to be confused with TUF: Latin America winner Alejandro Perez or fellow newcomer Markus Perez, both of whom will also be competing this weekend) meets Carls John de Tomas in preliminary bout at UFC Fight Night 123 on Saturday that will now be contested at 135 pounds due to health concerns related to both fighters' weight cuts.
Subsequently, when Eisenstaedt approached Goebbels for a candid portrait, the politician's expression was very, very different. Instead of smiling, he scowled for the camera, and the famous photo that resulted shows the man wearing “eyes of hate”. His tense posture transmits an almost palpable enmity.
In the 1985 book, “Eisenstaedt on Eisenstaedt: A Self-Portrait”, the then-87-year-old photographer discussed how the Goebbels picture came about:
I found him sitting alone at a folding table on the lawn of the hotel. I photographed him from a distance without him being aware of it. As documentary reportage, the picture may have some value: it suggests his aloofness. Later I found him at the same table surrounded by aides and bodyguards. Goebbels seemed so small, while his bodyguards were huge. I walked up close and photographed Goebbels. It was horrible. He looked up at me with an expression full of hate. The result, however, was a much stronger photograph. There is no substitute for close personal contact and involvement with a subject, no matter how unpleasant it may be. He looked at me with hateful eyes and waited for me to wither. But I didn't wither. If I have a camera in my hand, I don't know fear.
But how did Goebbels found out that the photographer was Jewish? No one know for sure but maybe the surname is what gave it away and Eisenstädt is a distinctly Jewish surname. It's entirely possible that Goebbels was told his name and drew the easy conclusion that he was Jewish or at least of Jewish heritage.
A quote from Joseph Goebbels diary showing his hatred toward Jews: “The Jews are now being deported to the east. A fairly barbaric procedure, not to be described in any greater detail, is being used here, and not much more remains of the Jews themselves. In general, it can probably be established that 60 percent of them must be liquidated, while only 40 percent can be put to work […] A judgment is being carried out on the Jews which is barbaric, but fully deserved”.

Now while the saying goes, “the eyes are the windows to a person's soul”, and while some may doubt this statement, we can now say that the eyes can certainly be the windows to one's inner thoughts. Why? Because fortunately, neurological research has put a lot of effort into trying to discern the connection between eye movements and thoughts over the past few years; Thanks to a technology called “Eye Tracking” and ongoing experiments, researchers have now come up with a general pattern of eye movements that most people follow when processing different types of information. And so, the mysterious code of the eye-mind connection has finally been deciphered!
From psychologists to neurobiologists to visual scientists to NLP practitioners and body language experts, eye movements have provided a powerful research tool to investigate the workings of the brain; one of which was the ability to detect specific learning disabilities such as Dyslexia, ADHD, Autism and Alzheimer's at the earliest stage possible using “Eye Tracking”.
Whether we interact with others at work or in interviews or at a poker game, we never cease to examine people's eye movements at an aim from us to try to decode what they are actually thinking.
This may sound skeptical until you actually take a ride with me into my quest of some of the most reliable investigations I came across; one of which was a very interesting and reliable study that was done by the American Psychological Association called “Attentional Mechanisms in Judging Genuine and Fake smiles: Eye-movement patterns” and which was published in the PsycINFO Database Record.
They were investigating where, when, how frequently and how long viewers look at each face region especially the eyes for faces with genuine, fake or no smiles. And the results were fascinating!!
The first discovery was:
When viewers fixated on the mouths of the faces with fake smiles before they fixated on their eyes, the face was judged as genuinely happy which means that the viewer was likely to misinterpret the emotional state underlying these blended expressions.
In other words, fixating on other face regions was not as accurate as fixating on the eyes to try to decipher whether something was genuine or not.
The Second discovery was:
The eyes of faces with fake smiles received more fixations and longer dwelling times than those of faces with genuine smiles
Which proves that people make more efforts on observing and analyzing the eye movements of others when they feel skeptical about something as a way to uncover these masks that were hiding the truth of the matter.
Keeping pace with this flood of new information is challenging and hence, our goal is to provide an accessible summary of these “Eye Pattern” concepts and their implications in our daily lives whether analyzing people during conversations or political figures during their interviews.
And so, NLP practitioners and Body Language Experts have come up with the following general evidence-based eye pattern movements:
Remembering an image means people will access their “visual memory” which will make their eyes tend to move to their upper left Sounds people are familiar with will make their eyes tend to move to their middle left as here they will try to access their “auditory memory” Processing linear information like data, statistics, adding up numbers or constructing an image they are not familiar with means they are accessing their “visual constructed” area which will make their eyes tend to move to their upper right. Accessing the “auditory constructed” area; this is associated with sounds they are not familiar with i.e. Not part of their memory and mainly sounds that they are trying to construct in their minds like a new musical piece. The eyes here will tend to move to their middle right. Having an inner dialogue to try to formulate an answer will make people's eyes tend to move to their lower left.
And last but not least,
6. Feelings or bodily sensations in other words the “kinesthetic” side; here people will tend to move their eyes to their lower right.
However, some left-handed people and a few right-handed ones may have a reversed pattern. Moreover, when a certain answer is very easy and quick to retrieve, people tend to not move their eyes as they look at you.
Remember that while for example, pain relieving medications may be compatible for the whole population, there are a few exceptions of people who are incompatible developing serious allergic reactions as a result. The same goes for these eye patterns, the majority of people follow the above pattern however there are a few exceptions;
In these rare cases, we cannot seek the answer in the theory itself but rather in the person right in front of us. So better test first by asking questions that tackle the different areas we talked about earlier to try to decode their personalized eye pattern system.
Eye Patterns Applied In Real Life Situations
*(Picture 1- On his 100th day in office, President Donald Trump discusses his new role with CBS News' John Dickerson in an interview at the White House)
At that moment Trump was saying, “I got a very nice call from the President of Mexico” and then moved his eyes to his middle left which is consistent with the eye pattern discussed above as the call was not visual, it was auditory and it is not constructed, it was an actual memory
You will notice in this interview that Trump was mostly moving his eyes to his upper right since he was constantly thinking about what he was supposed to say while constructing images in his head
*(Picture 2- On his 100th day in office, President Donald Trump discusses his new role with CBS News' John Dickerson in an interview at the White House.)
Notice here how his eyes moved to his upper left as he was about to say, “First of all if you looked at my statement”- “look” is an indication that he remembered his “statement” in a visual image which is consistent with how he moved his eyes to his upper left as he tried to access his visual memory
*(Picture 3- Interview with Sherrina Navani – Mommy Helper show)
Melania was telling Sherrina at this moment of how her husband was supportive of her as she looks to her bottom right which means she was accessing her kinesthetic or feelings side
Other Implications of the Eye Pattern Technique
Getting in rapport with a person upon understanding his preferred representational system
For example, If you notice someone looking mostly to the upper side whether left or right, then these persons most probable preferred representational system would be the visual system so what might help you in getting in rapport with that person is using visual words like “this looks good” instead of “this sounds good”.
And vice versa, if the person mostly looks to the middle side whether left or right, then it's the auditory system that's dominant here and you would you use auditory words like “this sounds good”
Now if the person looks mostly to his bottom right, then this is a kinesthetic person and words like “this feels great” would make him “feel” more connected
Political figures these days are deliberately expressing certain body postures and signs to send unconscious messages of dominant power (P.S. the power handshake). Eye movements, on the other hand, can be very hard to control and so they might hold the key that unlocks their hidden thoughts.
I do hope there will be more credible and further studies on these techniques in the near future so that we can start integrating them while analyzing people. And yes! I think the eyes really are the windows to one's mind!
A crowd of masked people are taking to the streets today, not to cause chaos, but to advocate for vegan lifestyles and animal rights.
Anonymous for the Voiceless will be demonstrating in Regina, forming what they call a Cube of Truth. Four or so members of the group, decked out with Guy Fawkes masks, will hold screens or placards depicting slogans, images of animal cruelty and videos of the mistreatment of animals.
A member of the group forgoing anonymity is Shelton Livingstone, one of the events organizers. "It's basically just to show people what their food looks like before it's a nicely wrapped product on supermarket shelves," said Livingstone.
He admits the videos are challenging, but that's part of the point. "We show the truth, no matter what it is," he said. The people taking part in the event opt to hide their identity partly because of the scorn faced by people who forego animal-based products.
For Livingstone, opting to use terms like "pig flesh" and "cow flesh" instead of pork or beef is one small way he tries to change people's minds about eating meat. Though the event is a way to stoke compassion and encourage people to live a cruelty free lifestyle, he says cutting out meat from your diet has other benefits.
"If you go into a vegan diet, you use way less water. It's a no brainer, if you're an environmentalist you're obliged to go vegan," he said. He said he initially adopted a vegan diet "for the animals," but the greater environmental impacts of no longer eating meat are a huge motivator now.
This afternoon from 3 p.m. CST until 6 p.m. he'll be part of a Cube of Truth in front of the Cornwall Centre in downtown Regina, weather permitting.
Deir Ezzor/Hama, SANA – Army and Armed Forces units working in Deir Ezzor city on Monday killed several ISIS terrorists and destroyed a bulldozer and a heavy vehicle of theirs to the southwest of the city .
SANA reporter said that the army targeted with airstrikes and tanks' fire the fortifications of ISIS in Hill 17, the Electricity Company, and in the vicinity of Liwa al-Tamin on the southern axis of the city, where a vehicle equipped with a heavy machinegun and fortified centers for the terrorist organization were destroyed.
In the countryside of Hama province, army units repelled an attack by ISIS terrorists on a military position east of al-Sa'an town.
SANA's correspondent in Hama said that army units clashed with terrorists from ISIS that had attacked a military position in al-Majbal area east of al-Sa'an town on Sunday night, which resulted in thwarting the attack, destroying a vehicle equipped with a 23mm machinegun, and killing two terrorists, while the remaining terrorists fled toward al-Badiya desert, leaving their weapons and ammo behind, which included an RPG launcher, two PKC machineguns, and two armor-piercing artillery pieces.

Canberra is on the verge of securing rights to host the last Anzac rugby league Test before it is scrapped from the NRL schedule, with the ACT government locked in negotiations to bring the game to the capital.
Fairfax Media can reveal the NRL is keen to link with the capital for the Australian Kangaroos clash against New Zealand to be played in April next year.
It comes a week after the Kangaroos beat New Zealand in the Four Nations final in Europe – a match in which Canberra Raiders winger Jordan Rapana fractured his cheekbone – and would add another marquee event to Canberra's 2017 sporting calendar.
Canberra Stadium already has a jam-packed schedule with an A-League match in February, the ACT Brumbies' Super Rugby season, the Raiders' NRL campaign and three rugby league World Cup games involving Australia, France, Lebanon, Fiji and Italy between October 29 and November 10.

Oregon Ducks women's basketball is ranked for the first time since 2003, while Oregon State has dropped out of the Associated Press poll for the first time in more than two seasons.
The Ducks (7-1), who were the first team receiving votes in last week's poll, moved in at No. 25 after throttling Portland 81-41 Friday night at Matthew Knight Arena. Oregon will next play at Clemson Monday night, before traveling to Ole Miss for a Wednesday-night contest.
"It's nice to be back in the top-25 because it means we are having success this season," Oregon coach Kelly Graves said in a release. "But the reality is we don't focus on the polls. It's a very long season and we continue to focus on improving each game. If we continue to do that, the rankings will take care of themselves."
OSU, which was ranked 24th last week and is the first team receiving votes this week, fell out despite rolling Southern Utah 77-38 Saturday night at Gill Coliseum. It's the first time since the the 2013-14 postseason poll that the Beavers (6-1) are not ranked by the AP voters. The Beavers host UC Davis Wednesday, before traveling to Las Vegas for the Play4Kay Shootout.
Five other Pac-12 teams are ranked: No. 9 UCLA, No. 10 Stanford, No. 11 Washington, No. 15 Colorado and No. 23 Arizona State. California and USC are also receiving votes.
Here's the full AP poll:
1. Connecticut
2. Notre Dame
3. Baylor
4. Maryland
5. Mississippi State
6. South Carolina
7. Florida State
8. Louisville

The Flat Earth Wiki
General Information
Is this site a joke?
What evidence do you have?
Is Flat Earth Theory connected to a religion?
People have been into space. How have they not discovered that the earth is flat?
There are many pictures on the internet and in other media depicting the earth as being round. Why do these not disprove flat earth theory?
This site is not a joke. We are actively promoting the Flat Earth Movement worldwide. There are, admittedly, several non-serious flat earth posters, but they are fairly easy to identify.The evidence for a flat earth is derived from many different facets of science and philosophy. The simplest is by relying on ones own senses to discern the true nature of the world around us. The world looks flat, the bottoms of clouds are flat, the movement of the sun; these are all examples of your senses telling you that we do not live on a spherical heliocentric world. This is using what's called an empiricist approach, or an approach that relies on information from your senses. Alternatively, when using Descartes' method of Cartesian doubt to skeptically view the world around us, one quickly finds that the notion of a spherical world is the theory which has the burden of proof and not flat earth theory.Perhaps the best example of flat earth proof is the Bedford Level Experiment. In short, this was an experiment preformed many times on a six-mile stretch of water that proved the surface of the water to be flat. It did not conform to the curvature of the earth that round earth proponents teach.Many other experiments demonstrating the lack of curvature in the earth may be found in ''Earth Not a Globe'', by Samuel Rowbotham.Flat Earth Theory is neither officially nor unofficially associated with any religion. Throughout the ages various religious institutions have championed a flat earth model for the world. Unfortunately this leaves us with the vestigial thought that Flat Earth Theory and religions are symbiotic. They are not, even though many religions today, both mainstream and otherwise, still teach its followers that the world is flat. While they are not incorrect, believing in a flat earth isn't contingent upon believing in a deity or being a part of any religion.The most commonly accepted explanation of this is that the space agencies of the world are involved in a conspiracy faking space travel and exploration. This likely began during the Cold War's 'Space Race', in which the U.S.S.R and USA were obsessed with beating each other into space to the point that each faked their accomplishments in an attempt to keep pace with the others supposed achievements. However, since the end of the Cold War, the conspiracy is most likely motivated by greed rather than political gains. Thus opening up a tremendous amount of funds to embezzle as it only takes a fraction of the total budget to fake space travel.In light of the above, please note that we are not suggesting that space agencies are aware that the earth is flat and actively covering the fact up. They depict the earth as being round simply because that is what they expect it to be.In general, we at the Flat Earth Society do not lend much credibility to photographic evidence. It is too easily manipulated and altered. Many of the videos posted here to "prove a round earth" by showing curvature will show no curvature or even convex curvature at parts. The sources are so inaccurate it's difficult to build an argument on them in either case. Furthermore, barrel distortion and other quirks of modern cameras will cause a picture to distort with little or no apparent altercation; especially without references within the picture. Photographs are also prone to distortion when taken through the bent glass of a pressurized cabin as well as atmospheric conditions on the outside. With this litany of problems, it's easy to see why photographic evidence is not to be trusted.It's also worth noting that if a person were to look down at the earth from high above, they would expect to see a circular shape where the sun's spotlight was shining. This explains why high altitude photographs are generally curved to produce the illusion of a round horizon.
Apple has been angry with Nvidia for some time now because of the prolonged GPU failures in Mac Computers and iMacs. Thus, Apple has finally decided to shift to ATI Radeon 4000 based graphics chips for their upcoming Mac Pro and iMac computers. The ATI series will replace Nvidia Geforce 9400 based graphics chips.
Apple is having issues with Nvidia based onboard graphics chips due to overheating while using multimedia content or gaming. Thus, the failure rate of Apple products has increased significantly, mostly due to burnt GPUs. This has ignited the company to find other partners to replace the graphics chip. AMD has announced that the upcoming Macbook Pro and iMacs will be equipped with Radeon 4000 series discrete graphics cards. The Radeon 4000 series supports DirectX 10.1 along with OpenCL 1.0 which is supported in the new Snow Leopard Operating System. The graphics chips also supports hardware decoding of HD media. The new graphics cards would be ATI Radeon HD 4870 and 4850 to be used in Mac Pro and iMac respectively.
Nvidia will take a big plunge as a major partner is moving to its competitors. However, Nvidia maintains that the heat issues will be corrected in the next generation graphics cards, and Apple partnership will again start.

A come-from-behind victory fueled by a first-year signal caller led the Florida Gators (3-1, 2-1 SEC) to a hard-fought 10-9 win over the Tennessee Volunteers (3-2, 1-2 SEC) at Neyland Stadium in Knoxville, Tennessee, on Saturday afternoon.
Head coach Will Muschamp spoke with the media after the close win, and OnlyGators.com takes a look at a number of key moments in the game.
HISTORY / STREAKS / STATS
» Florida has now won 10-straight games against Tennessee, a winning streak that dates back to 2005. The Gators are 25-19 all-time against the Volunteers and now 12-11 when playing in Knoxville. UF is 23-6 against UT since 1976 and 9-2 in Knoxville since 1994.
» Overcoming a nine-point deficit in the fourth quarter, Florida pulled off its biggest come-from-behind victory in the last period since 2003. It is also the second-best road comeback for the Gators since 1966, per UF.
» Tennessee shutout Florida in the first half for the first time since 1955. It was the Vols first such shutout against any opponent since 2007.
» The Gators' 10 points were the fewest in a win for the program since 1968 (nine, Florida State), per ESPN Stats & Information.
» It was the seventh time in the last 16 games that the Gators were held without a touchdown in the first half. UF is now 2-5 in such games after the victory, per ESPNSI.
» The Gators are now 21-4 against unranked opponents under Muschamp and 12-2 against unranked SEC teams during his tenure.
» Tennessee entered Saturday's game ranked No. 1 nationally in third down defense (.208), while Florida was ranked No. 106 in the country in third down offense (.340). The Gators converted 35.0 percent of their third downs, the Vols just 29.4 percent.
» UF is still +8 in turnover margin on the season after finishing even (3-3) with UT.
» Redshirt senior wide receiver Quinton Dunbar has now caught a pass in 32-straight games. He is three games away from tying a school record for most consecutive contests with a reception.
» Redshirt sophomore defensive end Bryan Cox Jr. exploded on Saturday with five solo tackles, three sacks, a quarterback hurry and a fumble recovery. It is the first three-sack game for a Florida player since 2009 (Carlos Dunlap).
» The Gators' six total sacks against the Vols were second-most in series history (seven, 1999).
OPENING STATEMENT
“Great emotional win. On the road in this league is always difficult. Really proud of our players. Very stagnant on offense. … Felt like we had some drives that were very sporadic in the throwing game as well. Jeff [Driskel]'s first interception was a back-shoulder ball, Demarcus [Robinson] has got to get two hands on the ball, tips the ball up, they make a play there early in the game. But we felt like we were very stagnant, we needed to make a change at the quarterback position in this game and go with Treon [Harris]. He obviously brought some energy to us; made a nice ball on the throw back down the sideline over there, really proud of his composure coming into a tough place and just doing an outstanding job. I'm extremely proud of him. … “It was a very emotional win. We're going to go home. We're going to watch the film. We're going to see why we're not, obviously, offensively doing some things that we feel like are there. It wasn't all on Jeff on the one interception; the running back doesn't pick up the A-gap blitzer, gets splattered and he throws the ball a little errant down the middle. He has another situation with the tipped ball at the line of scrimmage. We just weren't getting into any flow of the game. Very proud of Treon in the job he did but also feel like we had too many drops. We had a couple missed signals, one on a critical third down where Jeff had to take a sack; we had a screen called and the receiver doesn't run the screen. Our execution offensively, our communication needs to improve tremendously. “Very proud of what we did defensively against what I think is a very good throwing offense. … I thought we defended and rushed four pretty good today. We'll all be happy about that. Red zone defense was outstanding. … Our adjustments to tempo were much better by our players. Extremely proud of the tempo they played with [on offense] and how they handled that part of the game. Really proud of our football team. It wasn't always pretty, we did the things we had to do, especially you're down nine on the road in the fourth quarter, you make a quarterback change. Our guys didn't blink; they responded to it. “We were much better on third down defensively, much better on third down offensively against a very good third down defense. Again, really proud of our football team and how we were able to come out and play, do the things we had to do to win the game.”
ADDRESSING THE SECONDARY
Florida's secondary has been abysmal over its last two games, allowing an average of 409 passing yards per contest (17.4 yards per completion) to Kentucky and Alabama. The Gators entered Saturday's contest against the Vols ranked No. 110 nationally in passing defense but only gave up 205 yards to Tennessee and did not allow a completion longer than 27 yards.
“In the Kentucky game, we lost some confidence, coverage-wise. And the secondary – and I've been coaching a long time – is a very fragile position. To go back to old terms, it's the last line of defense,” Muschamp explained Saturday afternoon.
“When you suddenly give up a play, they always talk in terms of having a short memory. Well, for a young player that's very difficult to, from a maturity standpoint, overcome giving up a play. And then it creates a little consternation – we're not real sure, we're a little uncertain about what we're doing and then the confidence issues go out. There were a lot of things that happened [against Alabama]. …
“We just simplified some things [in practice]; it wasn't oversimplification, but we got some turns and reps had two weeks to prepare, so we're not the [19]85 Bears. Let's not jump to any conclusions here. We have a long way to go, but like I said before the season, athletically I think we're going to be fine. We can't make mistakes like busting a coverage and … some of the knucklehead things that we've certainly done in four ballgames.”
Muschamp also promised that he would be shuffling around the secondary and did just that with freshmen Jalen Tabor and Duke Dawson earning the first starts of their careers.
Tabor played exceptionally well. UT avoided UF sophomore CB Vernon Hargreaves III and went right after Tabor. He made four solo tackles and had a great pass breakup. Late in the game, he also blitzed from QB Justin Worley's blindside, sacking the signal caller and stripping the ball simultaneously. The forced fumble was recovered by the Gators.
Dawson made three solo tackles and played well in his own right, which Muschamp credits to him finally understanding that success in practice translates to the field.
“Duke Dawson continues to improve. Duke understands more about the importance of practice, and where young players build confidence, for me, is in practice. To be able to understand that if they can execute and function and communicate, they'll be able to take it to the game. That's something that has not always been as paramount [with him]. I feel comfortable that he's certainly improved that part of it. He's going to be a very good player,” Muschamp said.
CURIOUS END-OF-FIRST-HALF DECISION
For the second-straight game, the Gators had an opportunity to score at the end of the half with possession of the ball, two minutes and at least two timeouts (three at Alabama) in their pocket. And for the second-straight game, Florida not only failed to do so, it chose to not even try.
Rather than re-hash the debate from the Alabama game, check out “Timeouts and Halftime Decisions” in this post and refresh on what happened three weeks ago.
Here's what Muschamp had to say about his decision this Saturday:
“This is the deal. In that situation, when the ball was downed in bounds, they had an injured player. … When it's an administrative timeout, it goes to the 25-second [play clock]. If it had gone to the 40, I was going to milk it down and take a shot in the end zone. But when it went to the 25-second, it was going to go down to 10 seconds. In the box, we had a little miscommunication. … I just took the delay of game, knowing that we would have the runoff. … We were going to take a shot in the end zone if they had reset it to 40, but because of the injury and then the penalty, it went to 25. That's just the difference. It's based on where they set the clock after a dead ball situation. … “I get beat up a couple of weeks ago at Alabama. That was the right decision. From a football perspective, that was the right decision, because you're on the road, you go into the halftime down seven, you create a turnover and tie it up and then it's 21-21. That was a pretty good decision, wasn't it?”
An argument can be made that Muschamp's decision at Alabama was the correct one because of the quality of opponent but not for many other reasons. Florida had a chance to score before the half and the Tide were set to get the ball back after the break. The fact that the Gators forced a turnover and tied the game is simply how it worked out and hindsight is always 20-20. If Florida had scored before the half, the same thing might have happened and UF would have led 28-21.
Anyway, back to Saturday at Tennessee. This is what actually happened.
1. The Gators take over at their own 31-yard line with 1:59 left and two timeouts.
2. Florida decides to make an effort to score, moving 15 yards on two rushes.
3. A Tennessee player goes down, forcing an injury timeout. The Gators get a 40-second clock and next snap the ball from their 46 with 1:28 (and two timeouts) left.
4. Florida converts a 3rd and 6 with a 15-yard pass down to the Tennessee 39. There is 1:11 left and two timeouts still for UF.
5. Good coverage by the Vols forces the Gators to run out of bounds at the UT 38 with 56 seconds left.
6. Incomplete pass stops the clock at 48 seconds. Completed pass for a loss starts the clock running again, and a penalty flag is thrown for personal foul blocking below the waist. It is declined with 37 seconds remaining and a 25-second clock is given to Florida. It begins running with the offense on the field.
7. Muschamp decides to run the clock as it is fourth down. Rather than call a timeout with one second remaining on the play clock (11 on the game clock) to save the yardage and attempt a 39-yard throw into the end zone (or a very long field goal), Muschamp takes the delay of game.
8. The Gators are pushed back five yards back with 10 seconds left. He brings the punting unit, but the delay of game penalty, by rule, wipes out the final 10 seconds remaining on the clock.
“F— YOU, FLORIDA”
Muschamp was worked up immediately after Saturday's game and not just because Florida rallied in the fourth quarter to pull out a victory. Like those in attendance and many fans at home, Muschamp heard the crowd chanting “f— you, Florida” with the game clock winding down. He took exception.
ANOTHER CONTROVERSY?
For the second time in three games, the Gators benefited from the referees being human. When throwing delay of game flags, referees keep their eyes on the play clock until it reaches zero and then divert their attention to the ball to see whether it has been snapped.
Three weeks ago, Florida barely got off a snap in that split-second; it resulted in a game-tying touchdown pass in overtime. This week, the Gators barely got off a snap on what would eventually become a game-winning 49-yard field goal off the leg of redshirt sophomore kicker Austin Hardin.
“A great kick by Austin Hardin. That was outstanding,” Muschamp said. “I thought we were going to get a delay of game. But we didn't; we got it off in time. Boy, he hit it, and I got a lot of confidence in him.”
CHEAP MOVE
With less than a minute left and the Gators in victory formation, the Volunteers tried to create a turnover by, well, cheating. Tennessee purposely reached out and grabbed the wrist of Florida redshirt senior center Max Garcia before he snapped the ball. Flags were thrown and UT was correctly called offside after a bit of a scrum on the field. The very next play, the two teams got into a tussle.
CHECKER NEYLAND
Tennessee's attempt to checker Neyland Stadium – by having fans wear or purchase their own shirts depending on their designated sections – actually worked out incredibly well.
NOTES AND QUOTES
» Muschamp said Cox lost his grandfather this week and did not join the team at the hotel until very late Friday night. He started on Saturday and had the best game of his young career.
» On whether Florida entered the game with a run-heavy game plan on offense: “We felt like we needed to turn the ball. We wanted to be able to run the ball and play action. Matt [Jones] had over 100 yards, and we got the run going. We hit some runs late and wore them down a little bit. We felt good about the run game coming in more than anything because of them, not necessarily because of us.”
» On why Harris was not available to speak Saturday afternoon: “We have a policy that our freshmen don't talk.”
(AFP) EU lawmakers on Wednesday rejected by a huge majority a hard-won compromise which would have allowed EU member states to decide for themselves whether or not to import Genetically Modified Organisms for use in food and animal feed.
Parliament voted 557 to 75 against a law which took the European Commission years to negotiate amid deep suspicions about the possible health and safety implications of GMO products.
The outcome, however, turned on a matter of principle -- allowing member states to ban GMO products would mean erecting barriers within the EU's most cherished achievement, its single market of more than 500 million people.
"Today's vote gave a clear signal to the European Commission. This proposal could turn on its head what has been achieved with the single market and the customs union," said centre-right Italian MEP Giovanni La Via whom chairs parliament's environment committee.
La Via said the new rules -- first proposed in 2010 -- could have harmed EU agriculture "which is heavily dependent on protein supplies from GMO sources."
"Finally, there are concerns over whether this proposal could even be implemented, because there are no border controls in the EU," he said in a parliament statement.
La Via said previously he believed existing legislation should be retained, with national bans excluded.
GMOs hugely controversial
GMOs are hugely controversial in the EU, stirring sharp debate over their use and impact.
Some member states say they may carry as yet unknown health risks and are not necessary in any case, while others believe they are essential for the future and to ban them would turn the bloc into a scientific backwater.
The Commission, the EU's executive arm, tried for years to bridge the positions but eventually decided to offer member states an opt-out mechanism to end the impasse.
Those that want to grow and import GMOs would be allowed to do so, while those that do not, could ban them.
In January, lawmakers approved the opt-out legislation on cultivation and it is unclear what the next step is now after Wednesday's vote to reject the same compromise on import and use.
EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety Vytenis Andriukaitis said the proposed legislation would not be withdrawn and the matter will have to be discussed with ministers.
The Commission said recently that 19 of the 28 member states had asked to keep GMOs out of their territory, creating a complicated patchwork even within member states themselves.
The situation is further complicated by ongoing talks on a massive EU-US free trade accord, with Washington backing GMO use and hostile to any restrictive measures on them.
Greenpeace said it welcomed the vote "because the Commission's plan would have failed to provide additional protection of European citizens and the environment from the risks posed by GMO crops."
Copa-Cogeca, which groups several major farmers organisations, also welcomed the result but on the grounds that the Commission proposals would have distorted trade while existing legislation was adequate.
"Jointly, we believe that a timely application of the existing EU legislation will provide for the much-needed legal and regulatory certainty for all operators," it said.
So far only one GM crop is cultivated in the EU -- Monsanto's MON 810 GM maize which has been bio-engineered to protect against a harmful pest.
There are also eight pending applications for GMO cultivation, including the renewal of the MON810 authorisation.
Additionally, 58 GMOs are authorised for import into the EU for food and feed uses.

A Mathura farmer had received a measly loan waiver of one paisa as a defunct bank account of his had been automatically taken into consideration under an Uttar Pradesh government scheme, a senior official said.
District Magistrate Arvind Malappa Bangari said Chiddi Singh would get his due waiver of Rs one lakh after he gets his functioning bank account linked with the Aadhaar card.
Bangari said that while waiving the loan in first phase, only bank accounts linked with the Aadhaar card were taken into consideration.
According to the DM, Singh had opened an account with the Punjab National Bank in Govardhan in 2011. Due to irregularities, the account was "restructured" and a different account was opened with the bank, he said.
Since his first account was linked with the Aadhaar card, it was selected automatically. Since a loan of Rs 0.01 was shown on March 31, 2016, a waiver of 1 paise was given, he added.'
"As the restructured account of Chiddi Singh shows loan of Rs 2,23,222 he will get the benefit of Rs one lakh after this account is linked to the Aadhaar card," Bangari said.
A trio of marijuana-related arrests for the Detroit Lions this offseason is indicative of a more widespread problem plaguing the league, according to one former NFL offensive lineman.
Lomas Brown, now an ESPN analyst, claims at least 50 percent of NFL players likely smoke marijuana, according to a report in the Detroit News
"I just don't think you'll be able to curb this," Brown told the newspaper.
Wyche: Life after football In light of the bounty saga, Junior Seau's suicide and mounting lawsuits, Steve Wyche explains why some fear retirement.
In light of the bounty saga, Junior Seau's suicide and mounting lawsuits,explains why some fear retirement. More ...
In Brown's eyes, this is actually an improvement. Brown claims up to 90 percent of players league-wide smoked marijuana when he began his career with the Lions in 1985.
It falls in line with some recent findings:
â¢ Four out of 10 draft-eligible prospects from the 2012 class failed at least one school-administered drug test for marijuana; two in 10 failed multiple times, per a CBS Sports report from April.
â¢ "About 70 percent" of prospects at the combine admitted to using marijuana, per an ESPN report.
â¢ A 2009 report by the NCAA stated 26.7 percent of all football players admitted using marijuana over the past 12 months, the highest number of any athlete group they surveyed.
I suppose we should be stunned. Here in Culver City, Calif., we're a brief jog away from Venice Beach, where medical marijuana shacks dot the Pacific Ocean. As you walk by, vibrant youth hoist signs asking you to come in and "see the doctor." A surreal scene, but a testament to how easy it is to get your hands on the drug.
Marijuana has infused our culture and dotted college campuses for decades. Brown's estimates are eye-catching and perhaps disappointing, depending on your perspective. It's not something the league wants to put up with, but it's an issue and debate that goes far beyond the playing field.
Followup to: Why is the Future So Absurd?
"The big thing to remember about far-future cyberpunk is that it will be truly ultra-tech. The mind and body changes available to a 23rd-century Solid Citizen would probably amaze, disgust and frighten that 2050 netrunner!"
—GURPS Cyberpunk
Pick up someone from the 18th century—a smart someone. Ben Franklin, say. Drop them into the early 21st century.
We, in our time, think our life has improved in the last two or three hundred years. Ben Franklin is probably smart and forward-looking enough to agree that life has improved. But if you don't think Ben Franklin would be amazed, disgusted, and frightened, then I think you far overestimate the "normality" of your own time. You can think of reasons why Ben should find our world compatible, but Ben himself might not do the same.
Drop back to the 16th century and one popular entertainment was setting a cat on fire. Ever see that in any moving picture, no matter how "lowbrow"?
("But," you say, "that's showing how discomforting the Past's culture was, not how scary the Future is." Of which I wrote, "When we look over history, we see changes away from absurd conditions such as everyone is a peasant farmer and women not having the vote, toward normal conditions like a majority of middle class and equal rights...")
Something about the Future will shock we 21st-century folk, if we were dropped in without slow adaptation. This is not because the Future is cold and gloomy—I am speaking of a positive, successful Future; the negative outcomes are probably just blank. Nor am I speaking of the idea that every Utopia has some dark hidden flaw. I am saying that the Future would discomfort us because it is better.
This is another piece of the puzzle for why no author seems to have ever succeeded in constructing a Utopia worth-a-damn. When they are out to depict how marvelous and wonderful the world could be, if only we would all be Marxists or Randians or let philosophers be kings... they try to depict the resulting outcome as comforting and safe.
Again, George Orwell from "Why Socialists Don't Believe In Fun":
"
One might consider, in particular contrast, Timothy Ferris's observation:
"What is the opposite of happiness? Sadness? No. Just as love and hate are two sides of the same coin, so are happiness and sadness. Crying out of happiness is a perfect illustration of this. The opposite of love is indifference, and the opposite of happiness is—here's the clincher—boredom...
The question you should be asking isn't 'What do I want?' or 'What are my goals?' but 'What would excite me?'
Remember—boredom is the enemy, not some abstract 'failure.'"
Utopia is reassuring, unsurprising, and dull.
Eutopia is scary.
I'm not talking here about evil means to a good end, I'm talking about the good outcomes themselves. That is the proper relation of the Future to the Past when things turn out well, as we would know very well from history if we'd actually lived it, rather than looking back with benefit of hindsight.
Now... I don't think you can actually build the Future on the basis of asking how to scare yourself. The vast majority of possible changes are in the direction of higher entropy; only a very few discomforts stem from things getting better.
"I shock you therefore I'm right" is one of the most annoying of all non-sequiturs, and we certainly don't want to go there.
But on a purely literary level... and bearing in mind that fiction is not reality, and fiction is not optimized the way we try to optimize reality...
I try to write fiction, now and then. More rarely, I finish a story. Even more rarely, I let someone else look at it.
Once I finally got to the point of thinking that maybe you should be able to write a story set in Eutopia, I tried doing it.
But I had something like an instinctive revulsion at the indulgence of trying to build a world that fit me, but probably wouldn't fit others so nicely.
So—without giving the world a seamy underside, or putting Knight Templars in charge, or anything so obvious as that—without deliberately trying to make the world flawed -
I was trying to invent, even if I had to do it myself, a better world where I would be out of place. Just like Ben Franklin would be out of place in the modern world.
Definitely not someplace that a transhumanist/science-advocate/libertarian (like myself) would go, and be smugly satisfied at how well all their ideas had worked. Down that path lay the Dark Side—certainly in a purely literary sense.
And you couldn't avert that just by having the Future go wrong in all the stupid obvious ways that transhumanists, or libertarians, or public advocates of science had already warned against. Then you just had a dystopia, and it might make a good SF story but it had already been done.
But I had my world's foundation, an absurd notion inspired by a corny pun; a vision of what you see when you wake up from cryonic suspension, that I couldn't have gotten away with posting to any transhumanist mailing list even as a joke.
And then, whenever I could think of an arguably-good idea that offended my sensibilities, I added it in. The goal being to—without ever deliberately making the Future worse —make it a place where I would be as shocked as possible to see that that was how things had turned out.
Getting rid of textbooks, for example—postulating that talking about science in public is socially unacceptable, for the same reason that you don't tell someone aiming to see a movie whether the hero dies at the end. A world that had rejected my beloved concept of science as the public knowledge of humankind.
Then I added up all the discomforting ideas together...
...and at least in my imagination, it worked better than anything I'd ever dared to visualize as a serious proposal.
My serious proposals had been optimized to look sober and safe and sane; everything voluntary, with clearly lighted exit signs, and all sorts of volume controls to prevent anything from getting too loud and waking up the neighbors. Nothing too absurd. Proposals that wouldn't scare the nervous, containing as little as possible that would cause anyone to make a fuss.
This world was ridiculous, and it was going to wake up the neighbors.
It was also seductive to the point that I had to exert a serious effort to prevent my soul from getting sucked out. (I suspect that's a general problem; that it's a good idea emotionally (not just epistemically) to not visualize your better Future in too much detail. You're better off comparing yourself to the Past. I may write a separate post on this.)
And so I found myself being pulled in the direction of this world in which I was supposed to be "out of place". I started thinking that, well, maybe it really would be a good idea to get rid of all the textbooks, all they do is take the fun out of science. I started thinking that maybe personal competition was a legitimate motivator (previously, I would have called it a zero-sum game and been morally aghast). I began to worry that peace, democracy, market economies, and con—but I'd better not finish that sentence. I started to wonder if the old vision that was so reassuring, so safe, was optimized to be good news to a modern human living in constant danger of permanent death or damage, and less optimized for the everyday existence of someone less frightened.
This is what happens when I try to invent a world that fails to confirm my sensibilities? It makes me wonder what would happen if someone else tried the same exercise.
Unfortunately, I can't seem to visualize any new world that represents the same shock to me as the last one did. Either the trick only works once, or you have to wait longer between attempts, or I'm too old now.
But I hope that so long as the world offends the original you, it gets to keep its literary integrity even if you start to find it less shocking.
I haven't yet published any story that gives more than a glimpse of this setting. I'm still debating with myself whether I dare. I don't know whether the suck-out-your-soul effect would threaten anyone but myself as author—I haven't seen it happening with Banks's Culture or Wright's Golden Oecumene, so I suspect it's more of a trap when a world fits a single person too well. But I got enough flak when I presented the case for getting rid of textbooks.
Still—I have seen the possibilities, now. So long as no one dies permanently, I am leaning in favor of a loud and scary Future.

Another great show from MTV. I wasn't sure scream could translate into a TV series. This version works! If you enjoyed the movie you'll enjoy the series. Bravo MTV and thank you for another great show.
Yup
@Patrick.. if you DO know the Scream franchise you need to think like a TV show producer.... what would be the biggest twist one could place on the killer's identity to throw people off? In the movies Sydney was always the victim... Emma is essentially the Sydney role adapted for TV..... think about it.
Angela Marino
Awesome show! I watch it with my 12 year old daughter and we both love it! Glad to hear there will be a season 2!
tom h
I know who the killer is. It is the person nobody on social media talks about it being. They film 4 different endings, then just play the one nobody is talking about. It is a cheap tactic to make it "seem" like nobody knew who the killer was. They will have some cheesey explanation as to why the ending works when it doesn't Same lame thing they did in 2 and 3.
Patrick J
For the ppl in here saying it has gotten worse, u must not be watching the same show as me. I think that what has made the show watchable is the growing mythology they have presented. It's like Scream meets Friday The 13th. I think they have done a pretty good job at building a mystery that u want to know the answer too. For those who think they know the killer (you obvy don't know the scream franchise). Opinions are obviously going to vary but in the long run I think it's being "picked up" is probably A testament to it's growing viewership and interest
Tammy
Because you say so? :)
Yup
@Tammy... if you haven't figured it out.. [spoiler] is the killer, or at least the ring leader.
Tammy
Started out decent and keeps getting better and no, the real killer/killers are not easily identifiable yet.
Ernest
I agree with those who say the first ep was ok and has gotten progressively worse. I could care less if they all die and unless you're gonna completely go left field I have already figured out the killer and why they are doing it. A 5th movie would do Scream better Justice than this crap. Kill em all. Sydney Prescott she is NOT!!!
Donald Trump on Wednesday squashed any speculation that he might soften his immigration position to reach new voters in the final stretch of the 2016 campaign, delivering a hawkish, hardline, and true-to-his-roots border platform and vowing that on Day One of his administration, the United States would launch a mammoth deportation program and begin construction of a wall.
Emerging from a hastily organized meeting with Mexico's president, the Republican nominee flew to Arizona and not only renewed his pledge that America's southern neighbor would fund an impenetrable, beautiful border wall but said it would be built in “record time” and at a “reasonable price."
Story Continued Below
“We will build a great wall along the southern border — and Mexico will pay for the wall,” Trump said. “100 percent. They don't know it yet, but they're gonna pay for the wall.”
Trump hailed the “great people and great leaders” of Mexico following his visit to Mexico City but insisted, “they're going to pay for the wall.”
“On Day One, we will begin working on an impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful southern border wall,” Trump said during a major speech on immigration in Phoenix after weeks of waffling on the issue that has been core to his campaign. “We will use the best technology, including above- and below-ground sensors. That's the tunnels. Remember that. Above and below. Above- and below- ground sensors, towers, aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels and keep out criminal cartels and Mexico, you know that, will work with us. I really believe it. Mexico will work with us. I absolutely believe it.”
Shedding any pretense of softening his posture, Trump promised to protect American citizens, reaffirming his America First policy as he blamed President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton directly for violence perpetrated by illegal immigrants. Obama and Clinton, Trump said, support so-called sanctuary cities, a catch-and-release program on the border, visa overstays, the release of “dangerous criminals” and amnesty.
He accused his rival of promising amnesty in her first 100 days, as well as granting Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare to undocumented immigrants, a move he said would break the federal budget.
“On top of that, she promises uncontrolled, low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers and especially for African-American and Hispanic workers within our country — our citizens,” he said.
He chronicled a number of Americans who've died at the hands of immigrants who were in the country illegally and cast Clinton as the candidate who cares more about protecting immigrant families from being split up while presenting himself as the one who puts Americans first.
“To all the politicians, donors and special interests, hear these words from me and all of you today: There is only one core issue in the immigration debate, and that issue is the well-being of the American people,” Trump said. “Nothing even comes a close second.”
View Trump promises a physical wall that Mexico will pay for Within hours of meeting with the President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, Donald Trump delivers speech in Phoenix, Arizona promising to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it.
Trump outlined other planks of his policy position, including a promise to return all detained undocumented people to their home countries and zero tolerance for immigrants who commit crimes. It amounted to a massive deportation program.
“You can call it deported if you want. The press doesn't like that term,” he said. “You can call it whatever the hell you want. They're gone.”
He also touted his “extreme vetting” policy, which includes an ideological test and merit-based entry system, and pledged to bar immigration from nations like Syria and Libya.
“We have no idea who they are, where they come from,” Trump said. “There's no documentation. There's no paperwork. It's going to end badly, folks. It's going to end very, very badly.”
Trump asked voters to imagine an America in which, if he's elected and his policies are implemented, the U.S. will see a reduction in crime and border crossings, a decrease in the number of gangs and less reliance on welfare, and one in which peace, law, justice and prosperity will prevail.
“For those here illegally today, who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only: to return home and apply for reentry like everybody else under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above,” Trump said. “Those who have left to seek entry under this new system, and it will be an efficient system, will not be awarded surplus visas but will have to apply for entry under the immigration caps or limits that will be established in the future. We will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. We will break the cycle. There will be no amnesty.”
Trump launched his campaign last June pledging to build a “great, great wall on our southern border” that the Mexican government would pay for. Months later in November, he called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S. and within days said he would deport millions of illegal immigrants “humanely” with a “deportation force,” too.
Trump has since modulated his controversial Muslim ban to temporarily suspend immigration from so-called terror states and proposed screening potential immigrants with an ideological admissions test to determine whether they support American values. But his position on immigrants who are already in the country illegally had only gotten hazier in recent days.
Wednesday was Trump's opportunity to clean up his muddied position on border security and immigration, and he opened the day by dashing south of the border to meet with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto — a bid to present himself as a tough contender, ready to make demands of his negotiating partners and get a better deal for America. Certainly, Trump scored on optics, standing next to an elected head of state and declaring that both nations “recognize and respect the right of either country to build a physical barrier or wall.”
But when it came to the central promise of his campaign — that Mexico would pay for the wall — Trump and Peña Nieto disagreed. During the news conference, Trump said it didn't come up during their discussion. Later, on Twitter, Peña Nieto said he had made clear to Trump at the beginning of their conversation that “Mexico will not pay for the wall,” a comment that prompted ridicule from the Clinton campaign.
Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta pounced: “It turns out Trump didn't just choke, he got beat in the room and lied about it.”
“Donald Trump has made his outlandish policy of forcing Mexico to pay for his giant wall the centerpiece of his campaign,” Podesta said. “But at the first opportunity to make good on his offensive campaign promises, Trump choked. What we saw today from a man who claims to be the ultimate ‘deal maker' is that he doesn't have the courage to advocate for his campaign promises when he's not in front of a friendly crowd.”
Trump's campaign responded in kind, with senior communications adviser Jason Miller insisting Wednesday's meeting was only the opening part of a discussion and relationship-builder between both men.
“It was not a negotiation, and that would have been inappropriate,” Miller said. “It is unsurprising that they hold two different views on this issue, and we look forward to continuing the conversation.”
ISLAMABAD: About 50 international and national health experts and representatives of federal and provincial governments attended a meeting held here on Wednesday to review the essential medicines list.
The meeting proposed that 10 medicines / salts, which cannot be sold in Pakistan, should be taken off the list and around 30 medicines / salts be added to it.
The World Health Organisation's list of 374 essential medicines was taken as the model list.
After getting approval from the Pharmacy Services Division, over 390 medicines will be placed on the list and their availability will be ensured in the country.
An official privy to the meeting said that the list was initiated in the country in 1994 and was reviewed in 1995, 2000, 2003, 2007 and 2013.
“The WHO published a model list of Essential Medicines, 19th Edition, in April 2015 after amending its 2013 list. Therefore, the Pharmacy Services Division and the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan are now working on revision of the national essential medicines list, 2016,” he said.
Participants were divided into four groups and after consultations they recommended inclusion and exclusion of some salts. Some medicines of cancer, AIDS and hepatitis were recommended to be added to the national essential medicines list, he said.
“Moreover the essential medicines recommended by WHO and health department will also differ because the former focuses on patient safety but Pakistani health authorities focus more on cost-effectiveness. So we added the low-cost medicines / salts to our list,” he said.
In reply to a question, the official said that maximum molecules should be included in the list, otherwise smuggling of banned medicines and sale of unregistered medicines would increase.
The Chief Executive Officer of the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan, Dr Mohammad Aslam, told Dawn that health experts and representatives of provincial governments also attended the meeting.
“We did not want to unnecessarily increase the number of medicines on the list because it becomes difficult to arrange all the medicines, but it seems that the list may reach near 400 because a number of new molecules have arrived in the market and they are required,” he said.
The recommendations will be finalised within a month and the final list will be circulated to the provinces. It will be ensured that public institutions will have all the medicines.
“After reviewing the national list a provincial list will also be prepared because requirements differ from province to province. Sometimes WHO also recommends cost-effective medicines as essential medicines,” he said.
“WHO prepares the list on the basis of the overall requirement of different countries and countries can make their own lists according to their own requirements,” he said.

It's not always clear what happiness really is. To some it can seem like a kind of mythological state. Happiness is variable: sometimes we feel happier than others. Certain situations will influence whether we are happy or sad.
Is there really no secret to happiness? No button we can push, no pill we can take, no fluffy kitten we can pet? What is it that makes us happy? What contributes to our enjoyment of life, the universe, and everything? Why is it that once you add ‘fun' to certain situations (like learning), people are more enthusiastic about taking part?
To help us answer these questions, we scoured the TED Talks superhighway to bring you our favourite videos on what it is to be happy. (If you're looking for our 5 favourite motivational TED Talks, click here.)
Let's get started…
1. Matt Killingworth: Want to be happier? Stay in the moment
In the last few years, there's been an explosion in research on happiness. What are the big causes of happiness?
Matt says that the potential answer is the contents of our moment-to-moment experiences. He has come up with a way to measure people's happiness all over the world, on a moment-to-moment basis.
Trackyourhappiness.org uses an iPhone to monitor people's happiness. What happens is this: people are sent signals at random times and they're asked to fill in questions about what they've been doing, who they're with etc. The information then shows how their happiness is changing during the day and what factors might be influencing it.
Check out his talk below:
2. Nancy Etcoff: On happiness and why we want it
We are wired to pursue happiness. We can't strive to be happy.
In this TED Talk, Nancy, with her background in psychology, explains how our brains are wired to be extremely sensitive to negative emotions, and how our stress response influences how we feel. She goes on to illustrate how standard perceptions of what make us happy are flawed (for instance, that those with a lot of money are happier).

We all want more happiness, right? As we've already seen, we can't help but strive for it! So finding out how to create more happiness is something we'd all like to achieve.
Stefan explains in this TED Talk which things come together to make us most happy – such as being in a relationship, doing things we love and being close and invested in what it is we do.
Check it out below:
4. Matthieu Ricard: The habits of happiness
In an echo of what we've just watched, Matthieu, a Buddhist monk, explains that “somehow, consciously or not, directly or indirectly … whatever we do, whatever we hope, whatever we dream, somehow is related to a deep profound desire for well-being or happiness”.
It seems clear from this and the previous TED Talks that in terms of desire, happiness is not something we really have a choice about: we all want to be happy.
So how do we proceed in our quest for happiness? Matthieu has a few ideas…

5. David Steindl-Rast: Want to be happy? Be grateful
Happiness, says David, a monk and interfaith scholar, is born from gratitude.
Most people would not argue that people are grateful to be happy. Grateful for having a fast car, owning their house, having a high-flying job, a happy relationship and healthy children.
But is that the correct way around? Is it not our gratitude for what we have that makes us happy? David delves into this issue in the below video:
As you may have guessed from the topic of this blog post, we think it's really important to be happy, enjoy your life and be motivated and engaged. And of course, that applies to learning new things, too. If we're happy and having fun, our brains are more active, meaning we can take in more and push our self-development forward at a much faster rate.

For the leaders of the fight for racial equality throughout the twentieth century, anti-discrimination and anti-capitalism went hand in hand; the struggle for economic justice was always viewed as integral to and inseparable from the struggle for racial justice.
"Our needs are identical with labor's needs — decent wages, fair working conditions, livable housing, old age security, health and welfare measures, conditions in which families can grow, have education for their children and respect in the community," Martin Luther King Jr. said at an AFL-CIO convention in 1961, expressing the prevailing sentiment among the socialist leaders of the civil rights movement.
Bayard Rustin, the key organizer of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, emphasized the importance of organized labor in advancing the rights and material conditions of black Americans in a 1971 essay, in which he asserted both the centrality of unions and the need for a radical approach to inequality.
He urged that "only a program that would effect some fundamental change in the distribution of America's resources for those in the greatest need of them" would be enough "to meet the present crisis."
And "a program truly, not merely verbally, radical in scope" could only be achieved with the backing of that "one social force which, by virtue both of its size and its very nature, is essential to the creation of such a majority — and so in relation to which the success or failure of the black struggle must finally turn. And that is the American trade union movement."
Rustin, like the other organizers with whom he worked, was idealistic, but he was also intensely practical; he understood the limitations imposed by a business and political class fiercely opposed to his aims. And though he was, in the words of Paul Heideman, "perhaps the most talented organizer the US left ever produced," his efforts to transform the Democratic Party into a force for the radical change he thought necessary to bring about racial and economic justice fell short.
In the decades since Rustin's death, we have seen the opposition to even mild forms of social democracy intensify, and organized labor—for King, Rustin, Randolph, and others, "the principal force" in the struggle for equality and dignity—has taken on the brunt of this war.
"For the past forty years (and, some would argue, even longer), the capitalist class and its political representatives in both parties have waged a vicious offensive against working people," writes Charlie Post. "Employers across the economy have demanded tremendous concessions from their unionized employees—wage, benefit, and work-rule givebacks; the introduction of multi-tiered workforces; the outsourcing of work to nonunion subsidiaries and companies—all while fighting union organizing drives at their new facilities."
While the Republican Party has openly sided with the rich in the class struggle, Democrats have in effect (if not in word) abandoned the causes of labor and embraced the financial backing of some of America's most prominent corporate patrons—the most prominent, of course, being Wall Street.
Hillary Clinton's insistence that the Democratic Party is "the party of working people" is thus little more than empty posturing. As Rustin, a man fully committed to altering the ideological core of the Democratic Party, understood, it is not possible to simultaneously fight for the masses and for the business class because their interests are, in most cases, in direct conflict.
Though they still vaguely speak the language of working class struggle, Democrats have for the last several decades embraced a politics of inclusion, particularly eager to welcome into their coalition wealthy, white-collar professionals and technocrats whose views on economic matters fit with the rightward shift of the party's leadership. In turn, this has led the party away from an aggressive redistributive agenda and toward a market-oriented vision, one characterized by privatization, deregulation, and "free trade."
As Thomas Frank and others have documented, this demographic and ideological shift began as early as the 1960's. Today, we are seeing the culmination of these trends.
"Democrats," writes Vox's Lee Drutman, "are replacing Republicans as the preferred party of the very wealthy."
This is not, as is commonly argued, because the business class and other professionals are horrified by Donald Trump: Thomas Edsall, a columnist for the New York Times, has nicely documented the gradual nature of the shift to which Drutman refers.
"Democrats now depend as much on affluent voters as on low-income voters," Edsall wrote last October. "Democrats represent a majority of the richest congressional districts, and the party's elected officials are more responsive to the policy agenda of the well-to-do than to average voters. The party and its candidates have come to rely on the elite 0.01 percent of the voting age population for a quarter of their financial backing and on large donors for another quarter."
Edsall went on to quote the authors of a 2014 study on income inequality, who wrote that "the Democratic agenda has shifted away from general social welfare to policies that target ascriptive identities of race, ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation."
This shift in emphasis didn't have to come at the expense of working class politics, but it did—and for obvious reasons. As Walter Benn Michaels has observed, "the answer to the question, 'Why do American liberals carry on about racism and sexism when they should be carrying on about capitalism?', is pretty obvious: they carry on about racism and sexism in order to avoid doing so about capitalism."
We are now faced with a political establishment in which both major parties are committed to the fundamentals of an economic structure that has produced the soaring inequities that now permeate every facet of American society, from education to health care to employment.
Recently, the most striking look at the consequences of the neoliberal consensus comes from a study by the Institute for Policy Studies, which found that, as The Nation's Joshua Holland summarizes, "If current economic trends continue, the average black household will need 228 years to accumulate as much wealth as their white counterparts hold today."
"For the average Latino family, it will take 84 years," Holland adds. "Absent significant policy interventions, or a seismic change in the American economy, people of color will never close the gap."

And as we have seen over the last several decades, "significant policy interventions" are unlikely to come from those ideologically and financially committed to sustaining and perpetuating business as usual. Recent studies lend credence to this view: The wealthy, even if they identify as progressive Democrats, care very little—if at all—about income inequality.
This is consistent with the Democratic Party's ideological core more generally. To be a high-ranking liberal Democrat in 2016 is to, for the most part, say the right things about race, gender, and sexuality, all the while remaining silent about the suffering imposed by a system subordinated to the needs of both the market and its beneficiaries.
During the primaries, Hillary Clinton put to use a revealing critique of her opponent Bernie Sanders, one that, as Carl Beijer notes, "has a long history in right-wing red-baiting rhetoric": She implied that, because Sanders focuses intensely on income inequality, he is an "economic reductionist."
"Not everything is about an economic theory, right?" Clinton said (at a union hall, of all places) in February. "If we broke up the big banks tomorrow — and I will if they deserve it, if they pose a systemic risk, I will — would that end racism?"
This is, of course, little more than, to use Clinton's own term, an "artful smear." Bernie Sanders, and socialists more broadly, have never said that "everything is about an economic theory," and it is obviously true that racism cannot be reduced to problems of class.
What Sanders has argued, however, is that an economy dictated by the needs of the wealthiest is likely to disproportionately harm poor black and Latino communities. This is precisely what we have seen over the last several decades, and this harm has often been intensified by Democrats eager to clear the welfare rolls and deregulate the banks that so generously bankroll their political ambitions.
But while neoliberal Democrats fail to address these realities (for reasons Upton Sinclair would have understood), those organizing and fighting for a better future beyond the limits of electoral politics are addressing them, and in inspiring fashion.
The Movement for Black Lives, "a collective of more than 50 organizations" dedicated to the fight for racial justice, has released a policy platform that places issues like police brutality and mass incarceration "within the context of institutional racism and neoliberalism."
From its call for the "restructuring of tax codes" in a way that would "ensure a radical and sustainable redistribution of wealth" to its affirmation of the necessity and centrality of labor organization, the Movement for Black Lives has offered a radical alternative to the Democratic leadership's stale and ahistorical commitment to incrementalism.
"By seeking to take on all of the threats to Black lives and not just those that are most immediate and violent, this platform is creating—for the first time since Bayard Rustin and A. Philip Randolph released the Freedom Budget in 1967—a banner behind which the Black working class can march and fight," writes Douglas Williams. "It does this by seeking to address the challenges working class Black people face in their day-to-day lives under racialized capitalism."
Central to the corporatization of American politics has been the singular focus on electoral victories and defeats as markers of the successes—or failures—of ideas and movements.
The Movement for Black Lives, in solidarity with those fighting for racial and economic justice throughout the nation, has forcefully rejected this notion, recognizing that it is futile to wait for legislative victories to trickle down from the top. As Charlie Post has noted, legislative victories come after organization from below, not before.
They have also rejected the elite identity politics espoused by wealthy Democrats by connecting the fight against racism with a critique of American capitalism.
As Adolph Reed has noted, the identity politics embraced by liberal elites is "not an alternative to class politics; it is a class politics, the politics of the left-wing of neoliberalism."
"All politics in capitalist society is class, or at least a class-inflected, politics," Reed adds. The question of consequence, then, is: Which side are you on?
By courting the nation's wealthiest and accepting as normal a corporate-dominated political process, Democrats and Republicans have answered the question with striking clarity.
And in their attempts to offer something for everyone—including odious neoconservatives and high-profile billionaires—the so-called "party of the people" is, as Daniel Denvir nicely put it, deploying "the class equivalent of 'All Lives Matter.'"
Hillary Clinton, speaking at the Democratic convention, promised to "be a President for Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. For the struggling, the striving the successful. For all those who vote for me and for those who don't. For all Americans together!"
Such flowery rhetoric trivializes the severity of the struggles of millions against the very forces Democrats and Republicans have both so gleefully embraced, from billionaires who exploit the poor and vulnerable at home to war criminals who sanction the killing of the poor and vulnerable abroad.
Political leaders, activists, and commentators, regardless of party affiliation, who fail to address these realities—those who fail to acknowledge, in explicit terms, the class war being waged from above—are, as Connor Kilpatrick has written, "not just wrong anymore. They're on the wrong side."
Head knocks in childhood are by no means uncommon, yet they may have lasting negative effects. New research has found a link between concussion in childhood and adverse medical and social outcomes as an adult.
Researchers from the United Kingdom, United States and Sweden looked at data from the entire Swedish population born between 1973 and 1982 – some 1.1 million people – to analyse the effect of experiencing a traumatic brain injury in the first 25 years of life.
Compared to those who had sustained no injury, people who had experienced at least one traumatic brain injury in childhood – around 9% of those studied – were, as adults, more likely to die early or be treated for a psychiatric illness and receive a disability pension, and less likely to have completed secondary schooling.
At first glance, the findings seem unsurprising: common sense suggests, for example, that a child who has sustained severe brain damage in a car accident would encounter more educational obstacles than a child who hasn't.
Accordingly, the study found that the more severe the brain injury, the worse the outcomes in adulthood (this was also the case for repeated brain injuries). But the research also found a significant link between concussion – the mildest and most common form of brain injury – and subsequent problems.
In the study, concussions comprised more than 75% of the childhood brain injuries recorded. The researchers found being exposed to a concussion, or mild brain injury, was associated with a 18%–52% increased risk of negative outcomes, including early death, low educational attainment, and being on welfare. The most marked increase in risk was found for psychiatric inpatient hospitalisation and the disability pension.
Traumatic brain injury and concussion – the same thing?
Traumatic brain injury occurs when the brain is damaged by external force such as a fall, car accident, assault or being struck by an object such as might occur during sport. It's usually classified according to its severity, or based on the anatomy of the injury. Moderate to severe traumatic brain injury can result in irreversible structural damage to the brain, and in some cases death.
A concussion, on the mild end of the brain injury spectrum, results when force causes the brain to twist upon itself or strike the skull. Bruising and cell damage can occur, but any structural damage from the injury cannot be picked up by MRI or CT imaging, which can make diagnosis difficult. Using specialised imaging methods such as functional MRI (fMRI), however, changes in patterns of brain activity are apparent soon after a concussion.

Research shows even a seemingly innocuous knock that wouldn't qualify as a concussion can trigger changes in brain physiology and affect the functioning of neurons. There is some evidence that repeated concussions could be associated with the development in later life of a neurodegenerative disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy. More long-term research is needed to determine how permanent or reversible brain changes following a single concussion are.
The new study found an association between the age at first head injury and subsequent health and social outcomes. Children who were older, and particularly those who were older than 15, were substantially more likely to have problems in adulthood.
Although the study findings are yet to be replicated, the authors suggest heightened neuroplasticity – the ability of the brain to adapt and change its networks and behaviour – in younger years may be protective in the long term.
Protecting young brains
While there are still many unknowns when it comes to concussion, the latest findings point to the importance of minimising head trauma in childhood. Because children have weaker necks and torsos than adults, less force is needed to cause a brain injury. For toddlers and preschoolers, the study's authors suggest improved parental supervision is key, as falls are the most common cause of traumatic brain injury for young children.
In older children, reducing the incidence of sports-related concussions may be trickier. Wearing hard helmets in sports generally reduces the risk of severe head injuries such as skull fractures and bleeding inside the skull, but is ineffective against the rotational forces – forces that cause the head to turn rapidly and the brain to twist on itself, as can occur with whiplash for example – that can cause concussion. There's also no evidence that the soft headgear worn in some Australian football codes can protect against brain injury.
Many concussions occur without noticeable signs such as disorientation or slurred speech, and for that reason go undiagnosed. The danger of an unrecognised concussion on the sporting field – which predisposes a player to subsequent concussion – is that it increases the risk of lasting damage. The lack of awareness about the symptoms, treatment and management of concussion is an unrecognised public health problem.
The signs and symptoms of concussion are not always obvious. (Image: Ivan Chow / QBI)
The health benefits of sport are well established and should be supported. However, the nature of contact sports means that head knocks are sometimes unavoidable.
Given Australia's strong sporting culture, the solution is not to change the fundamental rules of these sports or prevent children from playing them. Rather, by investing in research and improving awareness at the grassroots level, we can improve the diagnosis and management of concussive episodes in kids.

I've been listening to Pegboy since about 1991, when I borrowed a tape of Strong Reaction from a punk girl in my high school. During the early 90's, there were very few bands that matched Pegboy's sound and energy. I had been a Naked Raygun fan earlier, but their breakup seemed imminent and it was difficult to say what the band members would do next. Crossover and thrash were going out of style, grunge was coming into the mainstream, and any type of decent melodic punk was virtually off the map. Pegboy was not only one of the few bands of the time to adapt this sound, but they were one of the few bands that did it well for at least the next six or seven years. Paving the way for an explosion of radio-friendly melodic "punk," Pegboy was way ahead of its time and Strong Reaction/Three Chord Monte is a much overlooked classic. I still listen to this record and get chills at the thought of their live shows that I saw, and their lyrics still dig right into my spine despite the fact that I have been listening to them since I was seventeen. If you prefer bands like Social Distortion, Dag Nasty and Jawbreaker over Blink 182, Green Day and Good Charlotte, Pegboy is for you.
Lower Canadian Dollar's Effect on the NHL's 2015-16 Salary Cap
As the value of the Canadian dollar continues to slide, it could have significant consequences next season for the NHL.
The weakened Canadian dollar recently plunged over a full cent on July 15 in reaction to the Bank of Canada lowering its key interest rate amidst a gloomy forecast for the Canadian economy over the remainder of this year. The “loonie” fell to 77.40 cents US, its lowest level since March 2009 amidst “The Great Recession.”
Back then, the decline in the value of the Canadian dollar also had a significant effect upon the NHL's salary cap for 2009-10, increasing by only $100,000 from $56.7 million to $56.8 million. At that time, there were six Canadian franchises, which reportedly accounted for around 33 percent of league revenue.
Today, there are seven Canadian teams accounting for perhaps as much as 37 percent of league revenue. That's worth noting if the “loonie” fails to improve, or sinks lower, over the course of 2015-16.
It's in the best interests of NHL general managers to keep an eye on its value when planning payroll for 2016-17. They could end up with less cap space to work with.
In examining this last January, I referenced a New York Times' interview last November with Glen Hodgson, chief economist of The Conference Board of Canada, in which he claimed the Canadian dollar would have to drop well below .85 cents for a lengthy period to have a significant impact upon league revenue.
Over the course of last season, we witnessed in real time what the impact would be. In December 2014, Bettman projected the salary cap for 2015-16 could reach $73 million. Over the remainder of the regular season and playoffs, he amended his projections several times before the cap ceiling was officially set at $71.4 million. Even then, it required the NHLPA membership voting to utilize their five percent “escalator clause”. Without it, the cap ceiling might have remained around $69 million.
Teams pressed for cap space heading into 2016-17 could find themselves in serious difficulty if the cap ceiling fails to significantly increase. And if it actually drops, the effects could be devastating, forcing those clubs to trade away expensive stars they would otherwise retain.
It'll also affect players eligible for restricted or unrestricted free agency, especially the latter. Stars like Steven Stamkos, Anze Kopitar, Jakub Voracek, Eric Staal, Brent Seabrook, Mark Giordano, Dustin Byfuglien, David Backes, Andrew Ladd, Milan Lucic and Kyle Okposo are slated for UFA status next summer. While most are likely to be re-signed, there's a deep enough pool of talent there to ensure a handful could be available.
Problem is, if the salary cap stagnates or declines, there might not be enough money available for those players to receive lucrative long-term deals. A number of teams could be unwilling to spend big on available stars in next summer's free-agent market.
It could also create another situation where the threat of an offer sheet forces a cap-strapped club to trade away a good young restricted free agent. We saw instances of that this summer (Dougie Hamilton, Brandon Saad). Possibilities could include St. Louis' Jaden Schwartz, Philadelphia's Brayden Schenn, and the New York Rangers' Chris Kreider.
Perhaps the only clubs that will welcome a stalled salary cap are those in smaller (Ottawa, Winnipeg) or struggling markets (Arizona, Carolina, Florida). They won't have to spend as much to remain above the salary-cap minimum.
A lower “loonie” also effects the Canadian franchises. At the turn of this century, before the implementation of the salary cap, the Canadian dollar was worth around .65 cents US. All but the Toronto Maple Leafs felt the effect at various degrees. That's because they were earning revenue in Canadian dollars but paying their players in American bucks.
There was genuine concern smaller-market franchises like the Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers and Ottawa Senators might relocate to American markets. That prompted the league to implement a form of revenue-sharing, called the Canadian Assistance Plan. Even then, many of those teams struggled to retain their best players. Only the deep-pocketed Leafs could afford to bid competitively for top free-agent talent.
The implementation of the salary cap in 2005 was heralded by some NHL fans as the saviour of Canadian-based teams. It wasn't. The strengthening “loonie”, reaching par with the American dollar on two occasions (between Oct. 2007 to July 2008, and from Dec. 2010 to Feb. 2012), improved the fortunes of the Canadian franchises, allowing most to keep pace with a rising cap ceiling to retain and pursue talent.
Now, one wonders what the effect could be if the “loonie” remains at its current rate over the long term.
Struggling smaller-market Canadian franchises, like Ottawa and Winnipeg, could qualify for revenue sharing, which is now considered more lucrative than the old Canadian Assistance Plan. Still, even that might not be enough. Winnipeg Jets spokesman Scott Brown recently attempted to downplay the effects of the dollar's decline on his team, claiming it hedges itself against the risk of the “loonie's” falling value, though he didn't elaborate as to what those measures were. Even so, Brown admitted the dollar's slide is hurting the Jets' business.
The league could have measures in place to adjust for the falling Canadian dollar. Revenue from its annual “Stadium Series”, broadcasting deals, an increase in the overall cost of attending games played by American-based franchises and the NHLPA once again approving its annual escalator clause could ensure a higher bump in the 2016-17 salary cap.
Still, recent history shows the drag of the lower Canadian dollar upon league revenue could have a substantial impact upon a number of teams. To varying degrees, every club will feels its effects. For most, it won't be positive.
A portion of a screenshot provided by Vickie Penewit shows the GoFundMe page created in her name following a stabbing attack that left her son and stepson dead.
GAYLORD, MI - Vickie Penewit survived the worst day of her life a year ago on Monday. The now 32-year-old Indian River woman was stabbed more than 14 times on June 13, 2015, in an attack that killed her 12-year-old son Timber Brown and his 25-year-old half-brother Jonathan Brown at a home in Washtenaw County's York Township. Penewit told The Ann Arbor News that she
a year later, but a dispute over money from a GoFundMe.com fundraiser in her name has added insult to injury. Penewit said a fundraising page using the Brown name and her maiden name, Moore, raised $6,391, but she never saw the money. The woman who started the page contends that Penewit was never supposed to receive the money. A prosecutor reviewed the case but did not issue charges. Penewit feels cheated. "It's sickening," Penewit said. "Not only that because I didn't get the money raised for me, but because of the people in our own community (that) were stolen from." She said people from around the country donated to the fund after her family was brutally attacked on a trip to see the NASCAR races at Michigan International Speedway in nearby Brooklyn, Michigan. The family decided to stay at an acquaintance's home in York Township when rain washed out their plans to camp. There they were attacked by a man, Joseph M. Hall, then 25, who was attempting to rob the home he believed belonged to his drug dealer.
Year after NASCAR fans stabbed to death, survivor reflects on tragedy Timber and Jonathan Brown's futures were dashed a year ago when a trip to the NASCAR race at the Michigan International Speedway in Brooklyn, Michigan, took a tragic turn.
Hall later apologized in court, saying he "snapped" when he committed the stabbing spree that killed Penewit's son, stepson and injured her and two others. He was later sentenced to life in prison. Then 33-year-old Jesse H. Spurlock, who police said stood guard outside the home, was sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison. A year later, Penewit is still entangled in the world of law enforcement as she seeks criminal charges for those she says wrongly took the GoFundMe money. Penewit and her sister, Jennifer Vogel, 47, of Gaylord claim another northern Michigan woman, Sharon Hush, took the money for herself and a few other relatives after a falling out. Hush acted as spokeswoman for the family, giving media updates from Penewit's bedside while Penewit recovered at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital near Ann Arbor. Hush also set up the GoFundMe after a Detroit-area news reporter suggested it, Vogel said. The family was supportive at the time, though they did not know Hush well, Vogel said. Penewit was under sedation or on a ventilator and unable to speak for her first month after the attack.
'I snapped,' says defendant from York Township double murder case in video Friends and families of those killed and injured in the brutal York Township stabbing attacks got to hear from one of the accused killers for the first time in court Friday.
Penewit said the falling out occurred after she got off of the ventilator and asked the majority of people to leave, because she was overwhelmed. Penewit said she was later unable to get the GoFundMe money for a wheelchair and wound gauze. She noted she owes more than $100,000 in medical expenses. She said can't sue the homeowner, because he didn't cause her injuries - for which she still needs surgery. She also said there was no point in suing her attacker, who she said she supports in prison through her tax dollars. Hush declined to speak at length on the matter, but called Penewit a "vindictive liar" and indicated that the money was used as intended. "The money was raised to help her family stay by her bedside, which is where it went," she said. She declined additional comment. A screenshot of the GoFundMe page provided by Penewit does not specify exactly who in the family was supposed to receive the funds. "Any and all help to take the (monetary) burden off the family will be greatly appreciated," the page read. The vague description is a cause for concern when it comes to criminal charges, said Cheboygan County Prosecutor Daryl Vizina. "I'm not sure this is a criminal act the way the GoFundMe was written," Vizina said. "To show fraud or embezzlement ... it has to deal with the intent. There is some lack of clarity on what it encompasses and what it doesn't encompass." The Michigan State Police Gaylord post opened an investigation into the matter in September 2015, said MSP Sgt. Jeff Gorno. Although Gorno said the investigation is still listed as open, Vizina said he declined to issue charges about two months ago. Vogel questioned what the money could have gone toward given the accommodations made for family, but Vizina said Hush and the other family members were able to provide documentation showing thousands of dollars in expenses during their trips to see Penewit. Vizina said some of those involved offered to give their portion back to Penewit, but she declined. Penewit and Vogel confirmed there were offers to return a portion of the money, but Penewit said she also asked that the money be given back to the donors.
The Ann Arbor News and MLive requested information from GoFundMe but was unable to reach anyone at the company for comment.
, "there is no way to 100% guarantee that a user's GoFundMe donation page contains accurate or truthful information." GoFundMe recommends that donors only contribute to causes they fully understand and trust. Vizina said the matter may be best suited for civil court.

White House officials are setting the scene for a confrontational State of the Union address on Tuesday night, claiming that President Barack Obama is preparing to “bypass” Congress with executive action on divisive issues such as economic inequality.
However, in a flurry of last-minute appearances, advisers also hinted at a growing sense within the administration that the president's chances of securing more ambitious legislative reform before November's midterm elections may already have passed.
In an interview on Sunday and in an email to supporters on Saturday Dan Pfeiffer, Obama's senior adviser for strategy and communications, struck a defiant tone. “We need to show the American people that we can get something done; either through Congress or on our own,” Pfeiffer told CNN. “The president is not going to tell the American people he will wait for Congress.”
The White House press secretary, Jay Carney, spoke of a need to “bypass Congress where necessary”, telling ABC the State of the Union would herald a “year of action” after the frustrations of 2013. Last year was the least productive in the history of Congress, including in October a 17-day government shutdown prompted by right-wing Republicans in an attempt to defund and defeat Obama's signature healthcare reform.
Yet Pfeiffer compared the executive actions Obama intends to outline on Tuesday with recent White House initiatives such as hosting a college opportunity summit or declaring economic “promise zones”, which critics have dismissed as largely cosmetic.
Key policy objectives, such as increasing the national minimum wage or lowering the cost of access to higher education, are almost impossible to achieve without bipartisan legislation. Republicans view the mounting State of the Union rhetoric as largely about political jockeying, ahead of the midterm elections.
“It sounds vaguely like a threat and it's certainly a kind of arrogance,” said Senator Rand Paul, who is increasingly seen as a contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, in an interview on CNN.
Appearing on ABC on Sunday morning, a former candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, Rick Santorum, called Obama “vindictive” and said his plan for greater use of executive action was “non-constructive”.
Those close to the Oval Office say they expect Obama to draw in his State of the Union address on the success of local economic initiatives, as an example of what can be done to boost social mobility without the need for national legislation.
The mayor of Philadelphia, Michael Nutter, who visited the White House for the second time in a month on Thursday, told reporters he expected the address to champion initiatives in urban areas that Obama believes can be extended elsewhere.
“You'll hear in the State of the Union him address a number of specifics about cities, the focus on cities,” said Nutter. “You are going to hear about on-the-ground activities; what's going on across the United States of America; why cities work, how they work.”
Nutter said he also expected the president to be unapologetic about the role of the national government in tackling poverty. “I think you will hear in the State of the Union example after example of how federal support is working on the ground across the country,” he said.
Pfeiffer's email to supporters, which was sent on Saturday, suggested that much of Obama's speech will be about cajoling and supporting, rather than directing.
“The president will use his executive authority, both his pen and his phone, to work with anyone to get things done,” he wrote, “whether they be leaders in business, education, Congress, states, or local communities who want to get things done on behalf of the American people.
“Last week, President Obama kicked off this effort when he named five new promise zones – areas across the country where we will partner with local communities and businesses to create jobs and expand opportunity. We'll do this by increasing access to education and quality, affordable housing, and by improving public safety. These are the kinds of efforts that take the challenges we face head on."
Pew Research asks Americans if they want to know more about Mitt Romney's resume, tax returns, and identity, and comes back with this:
When it comes to specific details of Romney's background and experience, 41% of voters say they would like to learn more about Romney's record as governor, 36% would like to learn more about his tax returns, while 35% want to know more about his record as chief executive of Bain Capital. Far fewer want to hear more about Romney's wealth (21%), his family and upbringing (19%) or his religious beliefs (16%).
Also, 37 percent of independents want to know more about the Bain years, and 35 percent of indys want to know more about his tax returns.
The polling has been mixed as to whether the Bain attacks are “working.” A recent Pew poll found a big swing in Obama's direction on the economy. But today's Gallup poll finds that 63 percent say Romney's business background would lead him to make good decisions, and Romney holds an edge on the economy, 51-41.
What we don't know now: Does Romney's advantage on the economy mainly reflect dissatisfaction with the state of the economy and with Obama's performance, which benefits Romney as a generic alternative? Or are voters genuinely evaluating the choice between the two and affirmatively deciding Romney's ideas and background make him more likely to improve things? Andrew Sullivan theorizes, rightly I think, that the bad economy alone is insulating Romney from serious damage from the Bain attacks.
But the strategy of attacking Romney on Bain and tax returns is a long term one. We won't know for some time whether it is working, because it's all about building a frame to influence the way undecided voters view the election when they start to make up their minds. It's also about laying the groundwork to get voters to appreciate the true priorities that are driving Romney's support for an agenda that includes both deep tax cuts for the rich and Paul Ryan's plan to quasi-voucherize Medicare. Only when voters actually begin to evaluate the choice they face — when it comes to character, biography, experience, and policy — will we know whether this strategy worked.
The Pew numbers do suggest that the Dem attacks may have awakened the curiosity of a sizable chunk of the electorate about things that Romney has declared a distraction (the tax returns) or an unadulterated positive (his business background). Time will tell how important voters will deem these factors in the end, but for now, there seems to be some room for Dems to fill in the story on their own terms.

UPDATE: The LA Times draws a harsher conclusion from these numbers than I did: “Obama making headway with effort to plant doubts about Romney.”
Flickr/yum9me McDonald's franchisees believe the brand is in a "deep depression" and could be facing its "final days," according to a new survey.
"We are in the throes of a deep depression, and nothing is changing," one franchisee wrote in response to the survey by Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski. "Probably 30% of operators are insolvent."
Another wrote, "The CEO is sowing the seeds of our demise. We are a quick-serve fast-food restaurant, not a fast casual like Five Guys or Chipotle. The system may be facing its final days."
More than a dozen franchisees expressed frustration with McDonald's management, saying that CEO Steve Easterbrook's turnaround plan — which includes initiatives like all-day breakfast and a shift to digital ordering kiosks — is a distraction from the core issues of McDonald's, like food quality and customer service.
"The lack of consistent leadership from Oak Brook is frightening, we continue to jump from one failed initiative to another," one franchisee wrote.
A second wrote, "I have been in this business since the early 1970s but have not seen us this leaderless in all my time."
The company's reaction to their frustration, one franchisee claimed, is for operators to "get out of the system" and quit the business.
McDonald's
Several franchisees complained about all-day breakfast, saying that it has complicated kitchen operations and goes against Easterbrook's repeated promises to simplify the menu.
"The system is very lost at the moment," one franchisee wrote. "Our menu boards are still bloated, and we are still trying to be too many things to too many people. ... Things are broken from the franchisee perspective."
Franchisees also criticized the "Create Your Taste" program, which allows people to customize their burgers with premium ingredients.
"They are throwing everything they can against the wall to see what will stick," one franchisee wrote.
Kalinowski interviewed 29 US franchisees covering about 226 restaurants for the survey. McDonald's has more than 14,000 restaurants in the US.
In response to the survey, McDonald's said it's hearing a different story from franchisees — specifically pertaining to all-day breakfast.
"We're hearing from customers and the overwhelming majority of our 3,100 franchisees that all-day breakfast is a hit!" a company spokeswoman told Business Insider. "In fact, since the launch, McDonald's has reached its highest brand score in two years according to YouGov BrandIndex."
McDonald's is trying to revive business following seven straight quarters of same-store sales declines in the US.
In addition to adding all-day breakfast and "Create Your Taste," McDonald's has also made some changes to its core menu items.
The company started toasting its hamburger buns longer, making its beef patties slightly larger, and changing how the patties are seared.
McDonald's has also announced plans to remove antibiotics from its chicken.
There are at least a few franchisees who are on board with the changes.
Among the myriad negative responses to Kalinowski's survey, several franchisees expressed hopeful attitudes.
"I think our leadership is headed in the right direction," one wrote. "It will take time."
Another said, "The CEO seems to be doing OK so far!"
Farm Nitrogen Pollution Damage Estimated at $157 Billion Yearly
Nitrogen from fertilizers and manures washed off farmland costs Americans $157 billion a year in damages to human health and the environment.
That is the stunning conclusion an international scientific team published Feb. 17 in the journal Environmental Research Letters. According to the study, the median cost of nitrogen pollution damages inflicted by fertilizing crops, burning fossil fuels, manufacturing industrial products and all other human-induced sources is $210 billion a year. Agriculture accounts for roughly 75 percent of the problem.
Within the agricultural sector, corn production uses the lion's share of nitrogen fertilizer and manures and generates a lot of the nitrogen pollution. The authors calculate that the cost in human and environmental health problems caused by nitrogen pollution from agriculture is more than twice the $76.7 billion total value of corn produced for grain in the U.S. in 2011, when prices of corn and other agricultural commodities were high.
The researchers calculated that each kilogram of nitrogen used in the U.S. costs an average of $23.10 for increased incidence of respiratory disease and $16.10 for aggravating conditions that cause toxic algal blooms in waterways.
Last year, algal blooms left Toledo residents without drinking water for days. Earlier this year, the Des Moines Water Works utility sued three drainage districts in Iowa because nitrate pollution from farm fields forced it to spend nearly $1 million total to treat water in 2013, the most the utility had ever spent to handle unexpected nitrogen pollution.
Careful use of fertilizer and manures and conservation practices that prevent or treat polluted runoff from farm fields are proven techniques to protect waterways. The farm lobby has claimed for decades that Americans need to wait for farmers to volunteer to take action.
But farm-generated pollution is growing worse. The disastrous incidents that cost the citizens of Toledo and Des Moines time and money are not isolated cases. Drinking water supplies across the nation are threatened by agriculture pollution. Toxic algal blooms are becoming epidemic.
Farmers and landowners need to prevent fertilizer and manure from running into streams and groundwater. Many farmers are already voluntarily doing what needs to be done to keep water clean and safe, but their numbers are still too few to make an impact on farm-generated nitrogen pollution. States need to mandate sustainable use of fertilizer and manures now, since voluntary changes won't keep surface water and groundwater safe.
Is the Air Force preparing to spend precious taxpayer funds as it faces sequester-driven budget cuts on a fantasy football league ?
On blogs and on Twitter on March 20, 2013, people buzzed that it was the case, with a link to back it up.
"What sequester? Air Force wants taxpayers to fund fantasy football league," read a headline at WashingtonExaminer.com.
"Spared by the Sequester, So Far: Air Force Fantasy Football Program," said another at NationalReview.com.
"Forget Budget Cuts," said Wired.com. " Air Force Is Ready for Some (Fantasy) Football."
Some stories credited tips from a co-founder of conservative site RedState.com or a writer there.
Does the Air Force want "taxpayers" to fund a fantasy sports league? Not so fast.
Not your money
Bloggers had noticed a March 19 "request for information" from an Air Force contracting office "seeking sources for providing the Air Force installations a Fantasy Football Program."
The Air Force's original request for information included some clues that taxpayers might not be involved.
It mentioned the personnel center services division, and the Air Force's "nonappropriated" purchasing office.
The personnel center services division runs recreation and leisure programs for Air Force members and their families around the world, including clubs, bowling, golf, fitness, arts and crafts, and recreational shooting. It also manages the Air Force's "nonappropriated funds" — money that comes from fees and other cash collected from airmen and their families who take part.
That is to say: Money that doesn't come from Congress.
It's not taxpayer money, and it's not subject to budget cuts under the sequester.
But it's not a small amount of money, with tens of millions of dollars from overseas on-base slot machines alone.
It even supports a different type of federal employee, not considered federal civil servants because they're not funded through normal congressional appropriations. Those employees run the activities and programs that also include things like restaurants, youth centers, and auto and wood shops.
The goal of all these programs, sometimes called "MWR" for morale, welfare and recreation, is just what it sounds like: to boost troop morale.
And, for 17 years, they've included an annual program called the "Football Frenzy," said Air Force spokesperson Laurel Tingley. In 2011, for example, airmen who joined the Air Force Services Clubs could win a trip to the Super Bowl.
This year, the personnel center services division wanted to find out what it would take to add fantasy football to the Frenzy.
Thus, the request for "information and pricing on providing product branding, hosting, managing, and delivering all programs and materials related to running a Fantasy Football League," that would serve airmen, civilians and family members at "over 100 installations worldwide."
"What we're looking at doing is enhancing a program that airmen have enjoyed for 17 years," Tingley said. "And the entire program is funded through (nonappropriated funds)."
Tingley didn't have details about exactly what the Air Force sought to create, but a fantasy football league wouldn't have been unplowed ground in the world of military morale — the Navy organized a fantasy football contest with commercial sponsors in 2010 that offered a grand prize of $100,000.
On March 21, 2013, the Air Force updated its request to say:
"This RFI is issued by the Air Force Nonappropriated Fund Purchasing Office (AFNAFPO). All requirements, solicitations and subsequent contracts, if any, awarded through AFNAFPO are funded wholly with Nonappropriated funds. These funds are generated through user fees and charges at Air Force morale, welfare and recreation (MWR) programs worldwide. THEY ARE NOT APPROPRIATIONS FROM CONGRESS OR 'TAXPAYER' DOLLARS."
By noon on March 22, 2013, it had canceled the request.
Our ruling
Headlines across the blogosphere and shared via social media suggested the Air Force wanted taxpayers to a fund fantasy football league — a charged claim as defense budgets face mandatory cuts.
But the evidence was a "request for information," not a final decision to fund anything. Meanwhile, any money at stake wouldn't have come from taxpayers, but "nonappropriated funds" generated by Air Force clubs and other activities designed to boost morale. We rate the claim False.
​The idea of a space elevator that lifts people and cargo from Earth into the big, black beyond has been a dream of mankind for more than a century.
News that Thoth Technology, a Canadian firm, recently patented a 20-kilometre space tower has reignited interest in what has long been considered a far-fetched concept.
Aeronautics experts say that while Thoth's concept is intriguing, it's a small step rather than a giant leap towards the goal of travelling into space using something other than a conventional rocket.
A space elevator "is still rather an academic idea, rather than something we're going to start building next week," says Ted Semon, president emeritus of the California-based International Space Elevator Consortium.
Like a cable car
For decades, there has been an abiding desire to develop a so-called space elevator as a transportation system for vehicles and satellites to save the exorbitant costs associated with launching a rocket into space.
The classic conception of a space elevator is a giant cable tethered to the Earth's surface near the equator, with a counterweight out in space beyond geostationary orbit (approximately 36,000 kilometres up).
Brendan Quine, technical director and chair of the board at Pembroke, Ont.-based Thoth Technology, is the inventor behind the company's recently patented space tower. (Thoth Technology)
The scientific rationale is that the combination of gravity (stronger on the lower end) and centrifugal force (stronger on the upper end) would ensure that the tether would remain tense and straight over a single position on Earth.
What Pembroke, Ont.-based Thoth Technology is proposing is an inflatable tower that could carry a space elevator to a height of around 20 kilometres, and theoretically to 200 kilometres, into low Earth orbit.
The structure, which Thoth had previously patented in the U.K., would be made of stacked rings of Kevlar cells inflated with hydrogen or helium.
An elevator could theoretically climb up the tower carrying all manner of cargo, from spacecraft to satellites, possibly even moneyed tourists looking for an otherworldly view.
More of a platform
According to Caroline Roberts, president and CEO of Thoth Technology, the company hopes to build a 1.5-km-high prototype within five years.
Brendan Quine, the inventor behind the patent, unveiled a seven-metre scale model in 2009 at Toronto's York University, where he is an associate professor.
While Thoth's concept is intriguing, it's not really a space elevator in the traditional sense, says Ron Turner, senior science advisor to the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts program and a distinguished analyst at U.S. research institute ANSER.
He says it falls short of the classic conception of a giant shaft that reaches hundreds of thousands of kilometres into space. And once you get to the top of Thoth's proposed platform, you still need to use a conventional rocket to get into orbit, he says.
"In the grand scheme of human progression out into space, it doesn't have the same appeal as the full-blown space elevator," says Turner.
Giant beanstalk
The idea of a gleaming metal beanstalk rising up to the stars was first envisioned by Russian scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky back in 1895, after seeing the Eiffel Tower in Paris.
A team from Seattle-based LaserMotive collected $900,000 in a 2009 competition sponsored by NASA after its laser-powered robotic machine raced up nearly one kilometre of cable dangling from a helicopter. (The Associated Press)
But it was eventually abandoned as a mere "thought experiment," in the words of the late science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke.
In 1960, a Russian engineer named Yuri Artsutanov determined that the idea may not be so outlandish after all, provided you had a material that was strong enough to support the tension between a base station on Earth and a counterweight in space.
Around this time, a U.S. engineer named Jerome Pearson had a similar idea, but he went further, calculating the material and tensile strength necessary to make it a reality.
In the early 2000s, physicist Bradley Edwards brought the idea closer to the mainstream after publishing papers that suggested carbon nanotubes may have the tensile strength necessary to support such a colossally tall structure.
If the world is to ever witness the manufacture of a space elevator, ISEC's Semon says engineers need to solve two problems: Ensuring the tensile strength of the cable and finding a way to power the elevator wirelessly.
Theoretically strong enough
In the past decade, NASA has held a number of Centennial Challenges that have attracted proposals to help realize this vertiginous dream.
In 2009, a team from the Seattle-based firm LaserMotive won the Space Elevator Power-Beaming Challenge Games — and $900,000 — after their laser-powered robot climbed a 900-metre cable suspended from a helicopter in under 7 1/2 minutes.
While innovations such as these are heartening, engineers are still a long way from making the space elevator a reality, says Semon.
Scientists have created three or four materials that are theoretically strong enough to support such a structure, Semon says, including carbon nanotubes and boron nitride nanotubes. But "the material to make a real space elevator has not been developed yet in quantities large enough to build a space elevator," he says.
While tensile strength is an abiding issue, Turner says an even bigger hurdle may be dealing with orbital debris, commonly known as "space junk," which refers to the shards of equipment from satellites and space vehicles that orbit the earth.
Turner says that even if someone were able to build a space elevator, a sizeable piece of space junk could "fatally sever" it.
"My personal bias is that the debris problem will continue to be a fatal flaw to the elevator concept," says Turner.
"Before I would invest any of my money in this project, I would need somebody to convince me that they really, really thought that they could surmount the orbital debris problem."

Chinese esports organisation EDG and Lyon have officially confirmed on Weibo that they have joined forces to form a FIFA Online 3 team.
The roster has added three players on top of Lyon's existing four-man roster for the mobile football game. The roster will compete at tournament called the Tencent FSL professional league on November 4.
Lyon has since updated their logo and changed their name on Weibo to 'Lyon EDG E-Sports Club' as they look to tap into the Chinese market.
Edward Gaming have announced they are partnering with European football club, Lyon
As reported, both organisations took to Chinese social media website, Weibo, to make similar teases about the upcoming announcements. Lyon said they were going to partner with a gaming team and EDG revealed they would partner with a European football team.
Both announcements used GIFs scrolling through the badges of different clubs and both graphics featured EDG and Lyon.
In their announcement, EDG said: 'Tomorrow, we will announce a partnership with a giant international football club to build a cross-border super team.'
Lyon also used the phrase 'cross-border super team' in their announcement: 'Lyon, France, is committed to pioneering and innovative football club will be announced tomorrow and a well-known gaming clubs work together to create a cross-border super team, this will be a combination of exciting traditional sports and electronic games.'
EDG have had CS:GO and Hearthstone players in the past but by far their most successful is their League of Legends team who are five-time LPL champions and recently competed at the LoL Word Championships in China.
However, EDG had already confirmed that this partnership will not involve their LoL squad. The most likely option was a FIFA team or more specifically, FIFA Online 3 which ended up being the case.
Lyon already had a Chinese esports team in FIFA Online 3 and have now added more pros
FIFA Online 3 is a mobile version of FIFA available in China, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and Singapore.
Lyon already have an esports division with FIFA 18 player Fouad 'Rafsou' Fares who participated in the FIFA Interactive World Cup earlier this year. On top of that they also had a team in FIFA Online 3.
The French club became the first first foreign football club to participate in esports in China earlier this year when they signed the team made of of four Chinese players: Sun Jiangfeng, Song Di, Xu Qingmu and Feng Rui, the latter of whom also works at the team's manager.
Now three extra players have been added the newly named squad. The team is already established amongst Chinese fans and makes perfect sense for them to connect with EDG who have more experience of the scene.
This is what I'm thinking:
Jack is Back and so are the viewers for Buffalo Sabres games.
The return of Buffalo Sabres star Jack Eichel, who had a goal and an assist in a 5-4 victory over the Ottawa Senators Tuesday night, led to a season-high 9.8 rating on MSG.
That is well above the 5.5 rating the Sabres have averaged to this point in the season.
To put the rating in further perspective, the rating for the Sabres game beat the popular NBC entertainment program “This is Us” (8.4) on Channel 2 and the annual favorite “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” (8.1) on Channel 4.
NBCSN's plans to highlight the game between Toronto rookie Auston Matthews and Edmonton star Connor McDavid took a hit Tuesday when the game before it between Boston and Philadelphia went to an extended shootout. The shootout, won by Philadelphia, didn't end until there was 3 minutes and 37 seconds left in the second period of the following game won by the Maple Leafs, 4-2.
Needless to say, the delay in joining the Matthews-McDavid game in progress didn't help ratings. The game between the superstars averaged a 0.4 rating from 10:45 p.m. to midnight in Buffalo, hitting a peak of 0.6 in arguably the best TV market for hockey in America.
I wish people would quit picking on Thanksgiving football.
On Monday, radio sports talk host Colin Cowherd, now heard on 1270 The Fan, joined the chorus of people saying that the NFL has become overexposed on television by adding Thursday Night Football and Sunday morning games from foreign countries.
But let's not include the three Thanksgiving games as a problem. After all, two games have been played in the afternoon on the holiday for decades. And it is hard to see anything wrong with adding a prime time game after the turkey and the apple and pumpkin pies were eaten.
It sure beats shopping on Thanksgiving night.
The football ratings in Buffalo prove the popularity of three Thanksgiving games.
Detroit's 16-13 win over Minnesota in the early afternoon game had a 17.7 local rating on WIVB-TV, the local CBS affiliate.
Dallas' 31-26 victory over Washington in the late afternoon game carried on WUTV, the local Fox affiliate, had a 15.4 local rating.
And Pittsburgh's 28-7 victory over Indianapolis in the night game carried on WGRZ-TV, the NBC affiliate, had a 16.5 rating.
In other words, the interest in all three games was pretty close.
To put those ratings in further perspective, the top-rated prime time entertainment program in Western New York this season, “The Big Bang Theory,” averages a 17.4 rating and that's for only 30 minutes.
On the other hand, the league should consider dropping Thursday Night Football games for multiples reasons, including player safety.
Western New York loves to hate New England quarterback Tom Brady. The Patriots' 22-17 victory over the New York Jets Sunday had a higher rating than all of the Thanksgiving games. It had a 21.6 rating on Channel 4 after the Bills victory served as its lead-in.

In The Beatles
…
rday" has the most cover versions then any song ever written Four: The Ed Sullivan Show was not the Beatles American TV debut. It was on "The Huntley-Brinkley Report" on NBC. Five: Eric Clappton almost replaced George Harrison. On January 10, 1969, Harrison finally had enough and quit the band. His announcement caused John Lennon to quip, "If he doesn't come back by Tuesday, we get Eric Clapton." Harrison, of course, came to his senses, and returned to the band on January 15th. Six: She Said" was inspired by an LSD trip with Peter Fonda Seven: Paul McCartney met Yoko Ono before John did. Yoko Ono claims to have been introduced to John Lennon by a mutual friend at her November 9, 1966, art exhibit in London. According to Yoko, she had never heard of the Beatles and had to be told who John Lennon was. However, Paul McCartney, likes to tell a different story about how she and John met. It was late 1965 and Yoko had knocked on Sir Paul's door. She was helping John Cage, a personal friend of McCartney's, with a book he was working on, and wanted to include some of the Beatles' work. Paul declined her offer, but suggested that she see Lennon. Yoko took Paul's advice and Lennon wound up giving her the original handwritten lyrics to "The Word" from Rubber Soul. The lyrics were later reproduced in Cage's book Notations. Eight: 'Hey Jude' was written by Paul in his car. Paul was on his way to visit Julian, John Lennon's son, who was disturbed by his parents divorce. Paul wrote this song to cheer him up. Nine: Paul McCartney wrote the song Lovely Rita, Meter Maid for the album Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band after getting a parking ticket from a female warden in Abbey Road. Ten: (My personal favorite :D ) "Ringo" means "Apple" in Japenese :)

Physical appearance plays a crucial role in shaping new relationships, but does it continue to affect established relationships, such as marriage? In the current study, the authors examined how observer ratings of each spouse's facial attractiveness and the difference between those ratings were associated with (a) observations of social support behavior and (b) reports of marital satisfaction. In contrast to the robust and almost universally positive effects of levels of attractiveness on new relationships, the only association between levels of attractiveness and the outcomes of these marriages was that attractive husbands were less satisfied. Further, in contrast to the importance of matched attractiveness to new relationships, similarity in attractiveness was unrelated to spouses' satisfaction and behavior. Instead, the relative difference between partners' levels of attractiveness appeared to be most important in predicting marital behavior, such that both spouses behaved more positively in relationships in which wives were more attractive than their husbands, but they behaved more negatively in relationships in which husbands were more attractive than their wives. These results highlight the importance of dyadic examinations of the effects of spouses' qualities on their marriages.

The meeting place of the two worlds could not have been more sharply defined. In Manchester Arena, thousands of young women had spent the night singing and dancing at a show in Ariana Grande's Dangerous Woman tour. Songs such as the hit ‘Side To Side' were performed: ‘Tonight I'm making deals with the devil/ And I know it's gonna get me in trouble…/ Let them hoes know.'
Waiting for them in the foyer as they streamed out was Salman Ramadan Abedi, a 22-year-old whose Libyan parents settled in the UK after fleeing the Gaddafi regime. A man whose neighbours said he must have been radicalised in Manchester, ‘all those types' having been driven out of Tripoli. So it was that on their exit from the Manchester Arena, these young women — out for nothing more than a good night — met a literalist from the Islamic faith. A man for whom the concept of a ‘dangerous woman' was not a joke, not about ‘empowerment' and certainly not a metaphor. Abedi would have believed it was real: devil, hoes, the lot.
Even after all these years, all these attacks and all these dead, the West still keeps asking the same question after events like those of Monday night: ‘Who would do such a thing?' The answer is always the same. Sometimes the culprits are home-grown. Sometimes they are recent arrivals. Sometimes they have been in the West for generations, eat fish and chips and play cricket. Sometimes — like last month's attacker in Stockholm, or last year's suicide bomber in Ansbach, Germany — they arrived in Europe just a few months earlier. Sometimes people claim the perpetrator is a lone wolf, unknown to the authorities. More often it turns out (in a term coined by Mark Steyn) to be a known wolf, in the peripheral vision of the security services.
Yet still our society wonders: what would make someone do such a thing? The tone of bafflement is strange — like a society that keeps asking a question, but keeps its fingers lodged firmly in its ears whenever it is given the answer.
Only last month this now traditional national rite was led by no less a figure than the Dean of Westminster, the Very Reverend Dr John Hall. At the beginning of April, Westminster Abbey was the venue for a national act of mourning for the victims of the previous month's terrorist attack. The Dean used his sermon — at what was billed as ‘a service of hope' — to announce that Britain was ‘bewildered' by the actions of Khalid Masood.
‘What could possibly motivate a man,' asked the Dean, ‘to hire a car and take it from Birmingham to Brighton to London, and then to drive it fast at people he had never met, couldn't possibly know, against whom he had no personal grudge, no reason to hate them, and then run at the gates of the Palace of Westminster to cause another death? It seems likely we shall never know.'
Actually, most people could likely make a guess. And had the Dean waited just a few days, he could have joined them. Masood's final WhatsApp messages, sent to a friend just before he ploughed his car along Westminster Bridge, revealed this Muslim convert was ‘waging jihad' for Allah. The Dean was hardly going to get back up into his pulpit and say: ‘Apologies. Turns out we do know. It was jihad for Allah.' The impossibility of that scenario speaks to the deeper disaster — beneath the bodies and the blood — of the state we've got into.
For their part, the Islamists are amazingly clear about what they want and the reasons why they act accordingly. You never have to read between the lines. Listen to Jawad Akbar, recorded in the UK in 2004 as he discussed the soft targets he and his al Qaeda-linked cell were planning to hit. The targets included the Ministry of Sound nightclub in London. What was the appeal? As Akbar said to his colleague, Omar Khyam, no one could ‘turn round and say “Oh they are innocent”, those slags dancing around.'
It is the same reason why ten years ago next month Bilal Abdullah and Kafeel Ahmed (an NHS doctor and an engineering PhD student respectively) planted a car bomb outside the glass front of the Tiger Tiger club on London's Haymarket on ladies' night. They then planted another just down the road in the hope that those ‘slags' fleeing from the first blast would run straight into the second. It is why when Irfan Naseer and his 11-member cell from Birmingham were convicted of plotting mass casualty terror attacks in 2013, one of their targets was — once again — a nightclub area of the city. In familiar tones, Naseer speculated on these places where ‘the kuffar [a derogatory term for non-Muslims], slags and whores go drinking and clubbing' and ‘have sex like donkeys'.
Where does it come from, this hatred the Islamists hold — as well as everyone else they loathe — for half the human species? Even moderate Muslims hate it when you ask this, but the question is begged before us all. What do people think the burka is? Or the niqab? Or even the headscarf? Why do Muslim societies — however much freedom they give men — always and everywhere restrict the freedom of women? Why are the sharia courts, which legally operate in the UK, set up to prejudice the rights of women? Why do Islamists especially hate women from their faith who raise their voices against the literalists and extremists?
Do people think this stuff comes from thin air? It was always there. Because it's at the religion's origins and, unlike the women–suspecting stuff in the other monotheisms (mild though they are by comparison), too few people are willing to admit it or reform this hatred, disdain and of course fear of women that is inherent in Islam. It is a constant of Islamic history, along with the Jews, the gays and the ‘wrong type of Muslim': always and everywhere, the question of women. It's our own fault because we have been told it so many times. As the Australian cleric Sheik Taj Aldin al-Hilali famously said to 500 worshippers in Sydney in 2006: ‘If you take out uncovered meat and place it outside without cover, and the cats come to eat it, whose fault is it — the cat's or the uncovered meat's? The uncovered meat is the problem. If she was in her room, in her home, in her hijab, no problem would have occurred.'
This view is itself barely covered over. Such disdain is what led to the abuse of hundreds of girls in Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxfordshire and elsewhere across this country in recent decades. The fear is what led to the Pakistani Taleban beheading Shabana — one of the region's most famous dancers — in the Swat Valley in 2009. And to the stoning of Ghofrane Haddaoui in Marseilles (yes, Marseilles) in 2004.
Obviously, in the wake of Manchester, there are security questions to address. Not least how someone once again known to the authorities could have made such a devastatingly effective explosive device. Certainly it shatters the comforting narrative we have told ourselves in Britain over recent years, that the security services are one step ahead of the terrorists on most things other than the (essentially impossible to prevent) knife and car jihad attacks.
But what we seem most likely to dodge yet again is the possibility of learning any proper lessons at all from this.
Theresa May and other politicians stress we will never give in. And they are right to do so. But beneath the defiance lie deep, and deeply unanswered, questions. Questions which people across Europe are increasingly dwelling on, but which their political representatives dare not address.
Exactly a year ago, Greater Manchester Police staged a carefully prepared mock terrorist attack in the city's shopping centre to test response capabilities. At one stage, an actor playing a suicide bomber burst through a doorway and detonated a fake device while shouting ‘Allahu Akbar' (‘Allah is Greatest'). The intention, obviously, was to make the scenario realistic. But the use of the jihadists' signature sign-off sent social media into a spin. Soon community spokesmen were complaining on the media. One went on Sky to talk about the need ‘to have a bit of religious and cultural context when they're doing training like this in a wider setting about the possible implications'.
Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan was hauled before the press. ‘On reflection,' he admitted, ‘we acknowledge that it was unacceptable to use this religious phrase immediately before the mock suicide bombing, which so vocally linked this exercise with Islam. We recognise and apologise for the offence that this has caused.'
Greater Manchester's police and crime commissioner, Tony Lloyd, followed up: ‘It is frustrating the operation has been marred by the ill-judged, unnecessary and unacceptable decision by organisers to have those playing the parts of terrorists to shout “Allahu Akbar” before setting off their fake bombs. It didn't add anything to the event, but has the potential to undermine the great community relations we have in Greater Manchester.' Perhaps when the blood has been cleared from the pavements of Manchester, someone could ask how many lives such excruciating societal stupidity — from pulpit to police force — has saved, or ever will save?
In Piccadilly Gardens, at lunchtime on the day after the attacks, crowds of people listened to a busker play the usual post-massacre playlist: ‘All You Need Is Love' and ‘Everything's Gonna Be Alright'. But just like the renditions of ‘Imagine', the buskers are wrong. We need to do more than imagine. We need more than love. Everything is not all right. We need to address this problem, and start at the roots. Otherwise our societies will continue to be caught between people who mean what they say and a society which won't even listen. And so they'll keep meeting violently, these two worlds.
On Monday night, Ariana Grande was in her traditional suspenders, singing: ‘Don't need permission/ Made my decision to test my limits/ 'Cause it's my business, God as my witness…/ I'm locked and loaded/ Completely focused.' Outside, waiting, was someone who was really focused. It is time we made some effort to focus, too.

Play 02:42 Play 02:42 Poor ticket arrangements disappoint fans in Nagpur
Fans without tickets were turned away from Scotland's World T20 match against Zimbabwe at the VCA stadium in Nagpur today, as there are no ticketing facilities available at the ground.
The tickets for the match are priced at 100 rupees for the East and West stands and 200 rupees for behind the bowler's arm (approx £1.10 and £2.20 respectively). However, many supporters were obliged to travel back to the old VCA stadium in central Nagpur to purchase their tickets, meaning that that those that chose to do so were forced to miss much of the contest.
The current stadium, which was inaugurated in 2008 and has a capacity of 45,000, lies 20km outside the city centre, a journey time of approximately 40 minutes by auto-rickshaw. However, the main ticketing system remains still situated at the old venue. A VCA official said it was not possible to have ticketing at both grounds.
The BCCI, who declined to comment, are in overall charge of the ticketing policy for the tournament, but the arrangements for each match are at the discretion of the individual state associations. Dharamsala, the other venue that has so far hosted matches, has chosen to sell tickets for the qualifying rounds at the gate.
The VCA spokesman added that advertisements for the ticketing policy had been placed in local papers but was unable to explain why the information had not been passed on to the BCCI or ICC, so they could warn fans who were travelling in from other grounds.
The atmosphere inside the stadium, which came in for heavy criticism on the opening day of the tournament, was marginally improved for today's contest, thanks to an influx of some 250 children from nearby schools. However, approximately 100 fans remained locked out of the ground at the start of Zimbabwe's innings. The venue is too remote to support any local pubs or cafes in which to watch the contest, or to access the ICC's online ticket-booking service that could have resolved the issue.
"We love cricket, which is why we are here even in this heat to watch Scotland take on Zimbabwe," one group of college students from Nagpur told ESPNcricinfo. "But we can't book online because of the network and the ticket sales are going on at the other ground. There's so few people in, why can't they just let us in. We are even willing to pay at the gate."
One group of Scotland fans, who encountered similar problems during Tuesday's opening round of fixtures, including Scotland's defeat against Afghanistan, had been mistakenly informed that they could buy their tickets at their hotel.
Privately ICC officials are frustrated that common sense has not been used, especially with the already low turn out for these matches.

Do you have a real-life do-gooding dilemma? Please send it to ask.my.goodness@gmail.com and Sandy will try to answer it.
Dear Sandy,
I'm not a preachy Christian, but I do think it's important to follow the tenets set forth in the Bible. Right up there at the top is tithing. My husband feels that you tithe once you get out of debt and only if you have something left over at the end of the month. This theory is quite self-serving, if you ask me.
We have just decided to streamline our spending for the next six months, cutting out almost all luxuries, big and small, in order to pay down our $13,000 in credit-card debt once and for all. So should I not tithe, keep my hubby happy, and increase the amount we can put toward the credit-card debt, thus making us debt-free sooner and better able to tithe? Or should I follow the 10 percent rule, taking longer to pay off the debt and greatly annoying my hubby, but at least holding to my beliefs and easing my conscience?
—Debbie
Sandy:
Credit-card debt can get in the way of charitable contributions
Unfortunately, debt isn't a new problem. I'd guess that debt is referred to almost as often in the Bible as tithing. (I know there are vigorous debates about whether giving one-tenth of your income to the church accurately reflects what the Bible means by tithing, but I am not going to wade into any theological and scholarly fights.)
Even facing foreclosure, some devout Christians believe that tithing is non-negotiable. And, by passing the Hatch-Obama bill in 2006, the U.S. government agreed, stating that those in consumer bankruptcy can continue to make reasonable charitable contributions, including tithing. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, explained, “This bill clarifies the law so that those who tithe can continue to live their faith while in bankruptcy.” Luckily, your case isn't so dire.
Though tithing may be the best-known religious tradition of giving, all major religions have some version: In Judaism, it's called tzedakah, in Islam, zakat. Regardless of where your sense of obligation comes from, it is wonderful to have a giving plan you're so committed to.
That being said, I think giving is something you should do out of desire, not obligation. And it would seem that the New Testament agrees: “Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.” Personally, I can't imagine a higher being that wouldn't understand your need to alter your giving for six months in order to pay off your debt and strengthen your marriage. In fact, while many may believe that tithing is dictated in the Bible, only five percent of Americans (77 percent of whom identify as Christian) tithed in 2007.
Though some surely disagree, I think that a calculated decision to stop tithing (or any charitable giving, religiously encouraged or otherwise) in order to escape credit-card debt is perfectly acceptable and possibly even recommended, as long as you follow a few basic guidelines: First, have a plan with a clear beginning and end. Otherwise it will be easy to stop giving and never start again. Second, spend some time thinking about what landed you in credit-card debt. Redefine living within your means to a point where tithing is included, since that seems to be a nearly non-negotiable part of your life. Third, consider substituting your monetary tithing with “time tithing,” a concept mentioned in The Power of Giving. Tithe your time by volunteering at your church. While 10 percent of your week (16.8 hours) may seem hefty, 10 percent of waking nonworking hours may be more manageable (approximately 7.2 hours).
Finally, remember that 7 percent, or 5 percent, or 2 percent is better than nothing. So decide together what feels right, and congratulate yourselves on taking the first step to get out of debt. Shoring up your own finances will help you help others in the future.

Bold flavors. Power moves. Chest beefers. A thousand beers, you guys. If any of those references are familiar to you, then you're probably one of the over 52,000 people who follow the DadBoner Twitter feed, which is probably the best Twitter feed ever written by an imaginary middle-aged Michigan man who is separated from his wife and loves Bob Seger. The identity of DadBoner, aka Karl Welzein, is one of the best-kept secrets on the Internet, and for the past few weeks, we've been trying to crack it.
DadBoner usually goes online sometime in the late afternoon. And once he gets rolling, there's nothing stopping him. He's not afraid to use multiple tweets to tell a single story, like so:
Went into Mickey D's last night for a showdown with the manager over my Van Halen cd reimbursement. Had to get it on.
The manager said, "I'm sorry, but my hands are tied. My super said spills on your stuff aren't our responsibility." Tried to play hardball
Told the manager, "I'm your huckleberry, and that's just my game." Acted like he didn't know what I meant. Went in the john to regroup.
Called the Mickey D's from the john. Asked to speak to the manager as, "Mr. Welzein's attorney." They said he was "busy." He was not!
Dropped a massive BM of frustration (NO flush) & came out to give the manager a real smack down. Guess he went on break, so I left a note...
...on a Mickey D's napkin: "Watch your back, kimosabe." Power. Move.
Now that's just fucking awesome. It's a pristine Twitter feed. DadBoner never replies to other people. DadBoner never posts links. DadBoner never does Follow Friday or deviates from the story. He's a little island that exists on your feed, totally separate from the day's conversation. DadBoner is such a fully realized comedic character that it already feels as if he has his own FX show (I'm sure he will soon). Most everyone I talked to for this post agreed that the feed must be written by a seasoned comedy writer—someone who writes for Conan or something like that. But I asked a handful of people in the TV writing world, including Parks and Recreation's Mike Schur, if they knew anything about DadBoner. All of them pleaded ignorance.
Then I had a small breakthrough. A literary agent sent DadBoner a tweet asking about a potential book deal, and he got a DM back saying he was already represented by the folks at Creative Artists Agency. The book agent told me that the CAA agent handling DadBoner was named C.C. Hirsch, so I sent C.C. an email asking if I could arrange an interview with Karl Welzein. C.C. sent an enthusiastic reply: "Thank you for this. Would love to discuss via phone. You avail today at 4 pm or tomorrow?"
My hope was to interview the real guy behind the feed and ask him about how he started the feed, how he developed the character, if it was based on someone he knew, etc. Failing that, I thought maybe I could talk to him anonymously, or maybe even do a podcast with him in character. I was ready to present all those options when the agent postponed the call and then never followed up. Nine days later, after pestering her, I was told through a second party that, "Karl isn't planning on doing any interviews at this time." SHIT! Not cool, you guys.
Then I got this tidbit, thanks to friend of the blog Luke Cunningham:
At the Comedy Store last week, an agent from William Morris said they just signed him. He's a guy in his late 20s from Michigan who works as a retail manager in West Hollywood.
Advertisement
This agent was almost certainly lying, because DadBoner is signed with CAA. Still, I desperately WANT to believe that Karl is a retail manager. At the end of my rope, I finally broke down the other day and tried to tweet at DadBoner directly:
Dear @DadBoner, I would like to interview you for Deadspin/Gawker. I'm offering fresh 'ritas and a case of BL Plats. Hit me up.
A zillion people on Twitter then instantly corrected me on my DadBoner catchphrases. It's "BL 'Nums" and "top shelf margs." I felt like such a moron. Karl never replied. Of course he didn't. Silence is the ultimate power move.

Anonymity is one of the greatest assets of being online. Plenty of people use it as a shield to say whatever they want about anyone else without repercussions (I know that's why I wrote under a stupid pseudonym for three years or so). But others use it in a more constructive fashion. The man behind DadBoner has cultivated this fictional character that's so funny, and so hilariously real, that he prefers to keep everything else a mystery. For now, at least. At some point, there will be a DadBoner book and probably a DadBoner TV show. And then, the real Karl may decide it's a sound idea to come out to the world (NOTE: I tried looking up "Karl Welzein" and "Carl Welzein" in California, just in case he was hiding his real name in plain sight. No dice.).
Or perhaps he'll just keep on operating in the shadows. Plenty of people online use a screen name even well after they've been firmly established (Gawker's own Mobute is one of them). For most people, it's really hard to keep it all under wraps, to not jump out and scream IT WAS ME ALL ALONG! Those who manage to resist are possessed of a willpower that I'll never have. It's kind of admirable, really. Then again, COME ON DADBONER! SHOW YOURSELF! WE'LL MAKE IT A HUGE CELEBRAISH! Seriously, if you know the man behind DadBoner, give us a ring. We'll give you five bucks and some cold ones, kimosabe.

Update, March 12: Found him.
Diego Forlan Corazzo is probably the best footballer that Uruguay have ever produced. Forlan enjoyed every bit of his illustrious career with roller coasters of emotions and joy on and off the pitch. He followed the footsteps of his ancestors (his father and maternal grandfather were both footballers) by opting to choose football as his career. He was born on 19 May 1979 in Montevideo to a former player and Uruguayan international Pablo Forlan.
In his youth he loved playing Tennis but later decided to take on football as his career but it wasn't easy at the start when he first came to France for a trial with a French club AC Nancy. He spent several months tirelessly training with them but was left disappointed when the club rejected him and he had to return back to Uruguay. Lets look at the contributions he made to all the clubs he played for and of course his national team, Uruguay.
INDEPENDIENTE
He had already played for other South American clubs before joining Independiente where he caught the eye of many European clubs when he scored 40 goals in 91 appearances for the club.
MANCHESTER UNITED
Eventually he was to be signed by English club Middlesbrough for £6.9 million but the money was to be paid in several installments. Forlan went to England in order to negotiate with Middlesbrough but a last minute twist saw Manchester United buying Forlan for £6.9 million in a single installment + a hefty fee for the Uruguayan. The move to Manchester was like a dream come true for the Uruguayan who was expecting to fulfill the expectations of Sir Alex. But that was not going to be easy considering the standards of the English premier League and Manchester United and he found it hard to adjust to it. He stayed at United from 2001-2004 but could not replicate the form he showed at Independiente scoring just 17 goals in 98 matches.
VILLARREAL CF
He then moved onto Spanish club Villarreal CF which turned the fortunes of his career. He scored 58 goals for them in 128 appearances from 2004-2007 and the spell with the Spanish side helped him to grow more as a footballer.
ATLETICO MADRID
After that he was a wanted man for many clubs and finally he signed for Atletico Madrid for a massive fee of £21 million. He had immense pressure on his shoulders as Fernando Torres had just left the club and now Forlan had to take up the goal scoring duties and in his first season with them he managed to get them to qualify for the Champions league after a long and hard decade and soon became a favourite amongst the supporters. In his third season with Madrid, Forlan won the UEFA Europa league scoring twice in the Final against Fulham earning him the Man of The Match Award and went on to win the UEFA Super Cup by beating Inter 2-0. He ended his career with Atletico scoring 96 goals from 197 matches.
INTER MILAN & INTERNACIONAL
In 2011 Inter sold their striker Samuel Eto'o and bought Forlan as his natural replacement. No financial details of the contract were released but it was expected that the striker would stay there for 2 years. Nothing went well for him there and soon he terminated his contract with Inter and joined Internacional where he currently plays but is hardly noticed.
INTERNATIONAL CAREER
Forlan made his International Debut in 2002 and since then, he has been a revelation for Uruguay. He is the most capped player in Uruguay ‘s history with 93 caps and is also the highest goal scorer for his country with 33 goals. The worst moment in his international career came when he missed a crucial deciding penalty against Brazil which eventually knocked Uruguay out of the Copa America Semi-Finals in 2007. Later, he managed to get Uruguay reach the Semi-finals of the 2010 FIFA World Cup and was also awarded the Golden Ball for being the best player of the tournament.
AWARDS AND ACHIEVEMENTS
CLUB – Premier League, F.A Cup, F.A Community Shield, UEFA Intertoto Cup, UEFA Europa League, UEFA Super Cup
NATIONAL TEAM – Copa America
INDIVIDUAL – Pichichi trophy(2 times), European Golden Shoe (2 times), EFE trophy, 2010 Fifa World Cup Golden Ball.
Forlan was a born Striker who had an inherent sense of opportunities for goal, he liked to play in the hole and support the midfield and make opportunities for others and take them as well. He possessed leadership skills and was a big motivator for the whole team. Even when down he found that extra bit of spirit that could change the course of a game. Humble and kind, he never got himself into controversies and stayed disciplined on and off the pitch. He is a true legend, a legend who should never have been forgotten but now is completely lost!
A new technology to deliver stem cell therapy to patients with neurological diseases such as Parkinson's was developed by San Antonio scientists, according to a new study.
The study, “ MRI Guided Delivery of Neural Stem Cells into the Basal Ganglia of Nonhuman Primates Reveals a Pulsatile Mode of Cell Dispersion, ” was published in the journal Stem Cells Translational Medicine.
Stem cell therapy consists of the delivery of stem cells (immature cells that can become any type of cell in the body) to correct a deficiency in patients.
Marcel Daadi, associate scientist and director of the Regenerative Medicine and Aging Unit at Texas Biomedical Research Institute's Southwest National Primate Research Center, and his colleagues had already developed stem cells capable of becoming dopaminergic neurons, which Parkinson's patients lose over time.
“Stem cell-based therapy is emerging as a promising treatment for a variety of diseases and injuries,” the authors wrote. “The first step in evaluating the potential of different therapeutic stem cell lines is to develop a safe and effectively reproducible delivery system.”
Injection parameters have been studied in methods for drug delivery, but these cannot be directly applied to stem cell-based therapies. Also, the technology for stem cell delivery is still undeveloped and limited, and includes inconsistent cell survival, injection site inaccuracy, and the inability to avoid perforating structures like blood vessels, which could possibly cause a hemorrhage during stem cell delivery to the brain.
To avoid these limitations, the team tried to develop an MRI-guided technique as a potential method to implant stem cells into a living organism, hoping that one day this technique can also be applied to human patients.
The method was designed to deliver stem cells with low invasiveness and high accuracy in the brain region that controls motor skills, which are compromised in Parkinson's patients, called the basal ganglia.
Testing the new technique in baboons, researchers observed that it not only provided effective targeted delivery, but also showed that, when injected in the brain, cells are not dispersed in a steady rate but instead in a small burst. This was a significant finding as it showed how injected cells disperse in the host brain and provide more information on how stem cell therapies can be designed to work best.
“We wouldn't have been able to see this phenomenon using standard stereotaxic delivery,” Daadi said in a news release. “With iMRI, we can visualize in real time the cells being injected to the target area. A non-invasive iMRI approach is becoming a necessity in clinical applications to enhance the safety of patients and the efficacy of the therapeutic approach.”
“We can create the best cells, but if we can't transplant them to the patient in a consistent and predictable way so that the patient can accept and thrive from them, then the therapy is simply ineffective,” he added.
The team believes this approach will improve the safety and effectiveness of stem cell transplants and address some of the current limitations in the delivery of stem cell therapies.

Stephen King is one of the greatest novelists of all-time. Hear that? Of all-time. You can't deride a man who has written not one, or two, or ten great novels, but countless works of literary brilliance spanning multiple decades - and he's still putting out all the stops.
There are those who are quick to write off Stephen King as "non-literary," but those people are just snobs (many of whom haven't actually sat down to read a Stephen King novel). Truth is, Stephen King is popular for a reason - his power to grip and mesmerise and shock the reader renders him as a something akin to a modern day Charles Dickens. His novels are bold, dense and outright unparalleled in their sheer readability.
Still, one question that often occupies the mind of a Stephen King fan - given their sheer audacity or outright weirdness - is: "Where does he get his ideas?"
Whilst - as most writers will tell you - an idea for a novel can just spring up out of nowhere with no real context involved, many of Stephen King's works have emerged as a result of specific incidents or events that happened to the author in person. Incidents and events that, in turn, lead to him writing some of his most famous books...
ASTORIA — It's MTV, curated.
For the first time, the influence of the music video as an art form is being celebrated in a museum exhibit coming to Queens next month.
"Spectacle" will open April 3 at the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, and promises to be the "the most comprehensive museum exhibition on music videos presented to date," according to a press release.
The exhibit will explore the connection of music and video from as early as the emergence of the Vitaphone to today's viral hits.
It will also feature props straight from the sets of several iconic videos, including original drawings from A-ha's animated "Take on Me," the ship from the Smashing Pumpkins' video for "Tonight, Tonight" and a human-size milk carton — recreated especially for the exhibit — from Blur's "Coffee and TV."
"Music videos have never properly been recognized or celebrated as an art form," co-curator Jonathan Wells said in a statement. "It is such an important medium of creative expression."
Interactive installations will feature hundreds of videos, including a number of MTV-era hits from the likes of Devo, Madonna, David Bowie, Talking Heads and The Beastie Boys.
In May and June, the museum will host a film series in conjunction with the exhibit. "Play This Movie Loud" will include big-screen concert films, documentaries and fiction films as well as workshops relating to music videos led by the museum's staff.
“Music and the moving image have been linked since the dawn of sound, from Vitaphone shorts and concert documentaries to MTV and the web," museum director Carl Goodman said in a press release. "Today, when the success of a viral video can make a hit song, the power and cultural significance of the music video are as strong as ever."
"Spectacle" will run from April 3 to June 16 at the Museum of the Moving Image at 36-01 35th Ave. in Astoria.
Keith Carmickle and his friends had already caught three balls during Major League Baseball's Home Run Derby Monday night and wanted more.
He nearly got a lot more: a headfirst fall to a pool deck about 20 feet below.
Chasing a home run hit by Milwaukee's Prince Fielder, Carmickle was saved from a long fall when his brother and a friend grabbed him around the legs and arms, then pulled him back as he dangled above the deck area behind the pool in right field at Chase Field.
His near miss came the same day as the memorial service for Shannon Stone, a 39-year-old fan who died last Thursday while trying to catch a ball thrown into the stands at a Texas Rangers home game.
"I thought: I've lived a good life," Carmickle said about dangling.
Seated in a small section of seats above the right-field fence, Carmickle, of Kingman, and his group had already grabbed home-run balls by Robinson Cano and Adrian Gonzalez and were looking to add another to their collection when Fielder came up in the second round of the derby.
Trying to snare a towering shot by Fielder, Carmickle stepped up onto a metal table about 18 inches wide and reached down to catch the ball. It hit a wall several feet below Carmickle. His momentum carried him forward, headfirst over a short railing at the back of the table.
He was headed for a hard landing when his friend, Aaron Nelson, grabbed his legs and Carmickle's brother, Kraig, grabbed him around the arms. Carmickle dangled briefly over a deck where a couple of cameras were positioned behind Chase Field's pool before being pulled back up to his seat as the crowd above and below gasped.
"He tried to catch it; I grabbed his legs and his brother grabbed his arms," said Nelson, who, along with Kraig Carmickle, is from Chandler. "So when he went over the ledge, we pulled him back. He wasn't going down, I was holding on."
The Carmickles and Nelson gathered themselves after the near fall and let out a few shouts before breaking into high-fives. They relived the moment with a few of the fans around them, then again as they looked at photos taken by an Arizona Republic photographer, who had shots from behind of Carmickle on the table, then falling.
The trio spoke with security personnel a few minutes later and were allowed to remain in the game, with Carmickle putting his arm around a security guard who told him to be careful before he walked back to his seat.
"I stepped up on the table, I missed the ball by 2 or 3 feet and went over," he said. "We caught three balls and I told the guys I was going to go for the cycle. Dude, they were really holding onto me."
Fielder didn't notice the close call and continued his turn in the derby.
"I didn't see it," he said. "We don't need any of that."
Top 10s are back for another Wednesday and this week Ozlet Nick runs through some of the bigger 'what could have been' in the game of Survivor as castaways who had the power to make game changing moves but for whatever reason, ultimately didn't act. Some of these missed opportunities may not have played out directly onscreen but ultimately hindered their chances to make it further in the game. Get ready for a trip down memory lane once again with your Wednesday discussion point!
Discussions about the biggest “dumb moves” in Survivor normally focus in on a few popular candidates. Erik giving up immunity in Micronesia, JT giving Russell his idol, Tyson voting himself out in Heroes vs Villains. Often forgotten are more subtle moments where the game could have gone in a completely different direction, but players made a decision that ended up being costly. Here are ten of the biggest missed opportunities in Survivor history, some of which you may not even remember.
10. Malcolm fails to keep Denise happy – Philippines
Malcolm played a pretty good game in the Philippines, but he certainly made his fair share of mistakes along the way too. In his first game, his last mistake was arguably the biggest and was certainly fatal to his game. At the final four, Denise approached Malcolm to check their alliance was still tight. Malcolm, who had been planning to vote Denise out, gave a very noncommittal answer that didn't exactly put her mind at ease. Unsurprisingly, Denise used this opportunity to go to Lisa and Skupin and offer to vote with them to get rid of Malcolm at the next vote. This put Malcolm in the difficult position of having to win the final immunity challenge to stay in the game, somewhere you ideally never want to be. When Malcolm did lose, he found himself out of the game, with his ally sitting pretty to win it all. We don't know for sure that Denise would have gone with Malcolm if he had been more convincing to her, but assuming she had, this would have resulted in a 2-2 tie with Lisa (as Skupin had immunity). This would mean Malcolm just had to beat Lisa in a fire making contest to remain in the game, and probably win it the following night. In hindsight, this seems a very costly mistake.
9. Savaii didn't calm Cochran's nerves – South Pacific
The Cochran flip was endlessly debated at the time but has now pretty much been consigned to history as a massive blunder on Cochran's part. It's hard to argue against this, but this still doesn't detract from the fact that his Savaii tribe mates didn't exactly make him feel secure. After playing nearly 3 weeks of Survivor with him, one thing they should have known was that he was a very insecure person, and the prospect of going into a tied vote and drawing rocks was not appealing to him. And to add further context; just two days before, after costing them the challenge, they had all openly told him he would be voted out, before Ozzy's decision to send himself to Redemption Island.
A bit more careful management of Cochran may have made him feel more secure. Dawn even knew he was planning to flip. Did Jim fully explain his plans to take Cochran to the end? Did Ozzy offer up either his immunity necklace or hidden idol? Not to mention that Savaii's big plan to infiltrate Upolu was to send their most nervous player and one most likely to flip in to be their “double agent”. So yes, Cochran is to blame for flipping and effectively throwing his game away. But his tribe made this decision relatively easy for him as well, and cost themselves the million dollars in the process.
8. Brandon votes Kelly out – Africa
An older but no less interesting move, Brandon effectively threw his game away by not being prepared to temporarily align with someone he didn't like. At the final nine, the ex-Samburu members of T-Bird, Frank and Kim are ready to join with Kelly to vote as a block to get rid of Lex. Brandon only had to join with them and they could have got the biggest strategic and physical threat out of the game. Brandon would have been sitting pretty in a majority of five, and had options of what to do next. Presuming he stuck with this group, it seems likely he, Kim and Kelly would have stuck together to the final 3, with him and Kelly most likely to take each other to the end. Sitting next to Kelly with an angry jury full of ex-Boran players would have been a good prospect to win.
Even if he didn't choose to stick with this alliance long term, going into the final 8 with a majority and options would have allowed Brandon to take the game any way he wanted. Instead, he couldn't stomach working with Frank and helped Lex get rid of Kelly. His reward? Lex's alliance decided to gang up on Brandon and vote him out next. Perhaps he should have stuck with the devil he knew.
7. Penner doesn't accept Lisa's offer – Philippines
The second Philippines entrant on the list is one of the most painful for any Penner fan. After fighting tooth and nail to stay in the game, Penner finally found himself in a good position at the final 8. Lisa approached him and asked if he wanted to make a final three deals with her and Skupin, which he strangely turned down. Determined to not come off as playing too aggressively (a label aimed at him in previous games),
Penner wanted to let the larger alliance finish picking off those left outside before thinking of any end-game combinations. Unfortunately, others were not thinking this way and Lisa's offer went unanswered, causing her to turn to Denise and Malcolm instead. Penner later said that he couldn't simply pretend to accept and then think on it as he was really trying to play an honest game and not be seen as duplicitous. Unfortunately this honest gameplay cost him and he was destined for another final 7 exits.
6. Kathy helps to vote out the General – Marquesas
Another move that may easily be forgotten, but at the final 6 in the Marquesas, Kathy pondered the option of joining with the General, Sean and Vecepia and getting rid of Paschal and Neleh. There were clear risks with this plan which ultimately meant she didn't pursue it. Had the General gone on an immunity run and made the final 2, he would have won. Voting her closes allies out would also have probably meant Paschal and Neleh didn't vote for her in the end. And given Kathy's third place finish, it may seem silly to quibble over her decision.
But the moment she voted out the General, Kathy effectively had no way to win the game. She was locked into being the swing vote at final 5, then probably needing to win immunity to get to the final 2. This proved to be an impossible task, but probably would have been regardless of her choices from there on out. If she had gone to the final 5 with say Sean, Vecepia, the General and Paschal, she could have taken out either Sean or Vee and left a bunch of single, non-attached players at the end which would give her more options. Kathy is a great player and therefore anything that doesn't lead to her winning should be considered a missed opportunity.
5. Ciera sides with the veterans – Blood vs Water
In a classic case of why new players shouldn't be playing with veterans, Ciera, having just voted her mother out, found herself in a tribe with three veterans and three new players. The choice should have been obvious; team up with the newbies and ride that to a final four, where Ciera would have been a non-threat to win a challenge and almost certainly make it to the final three, with her mother on the jury to champion her cause.
Instead she chose to go with Tyson, Gervase and Monica in a move clearly against her best interest. Credit has to be given to Tyson for getting Ciera to make this move, but it's still hard to watch her hand the game to him. To be fair, she realised her mistake at the next tribal council, taking the game to a rock draw, but it was all in vain and too late by that stage. The damage was done.
4. Caryn Declines a Woman's Alliance – Palau
In a strikingly similar move, Caryn found herself in a final seven with Tom unprotected by individual immunity. Katie, Jenn and Steph put the offer out for an all-female alliance and get rid of Tom before it was too late. Caryn obviously believed her chances were better with the three men, as she turned down what seemed a great move for her. Not only were Tom, Ian and Gregg huge challenge threats, they were also likeable and more respected than her.
As Tom proved a few days later (after voting Karen out at the final five), going to the end with Katie should have been everyone's move. She was an easy beat. Katie said the plan couldn't work because “Caryn sucks” and although it's a pretty blunt way of saying it; her point seems pretty valid in retrospect. Whatever Caryn's rationale was, it's hard to understand.
3. Lisa votes out Abi Maria – Philippines
Another forgotten move that isn't really considered as a strategic mistake or missed opportunity, but one that quite possibly cost Lisa a million dollars. At the final 5, Lisa is in a 4-person alliance with Skupin and the very likeable Malcolm and Denise. It should be obvious that any chance she has to win the game has to be by eliminating both Denise and Malcolm before the final three. If either of them makes it to that point, they will win, against any combination of the three remaining ex-Tandang members. Lisa should have been convincing Skupin to vote with her and Abi Maria to take out Denise. Then the three of them could concentrate on getting rid of Malcolm at the final four. I can see reasons why she didn't do this. The relationship between Abi Maria and Skupin was so fractured that the idea of them working together on a vote may have just been impossible. There is also a very good chance that Abi Maria may have picked up more votes than expected at the end (definitely Pete and Artis, and maybe others). However big a threat this actually was, it was still better than the alternative, which ended up as a final three with either Malcolm or Denise, who obviously ended up winning handily. A final three of Lisa, Skupin and Abi Maria would most likely see Lisa pick up 5-6 votes to win. Lisa is remembered as overly weepy and emotional, but she actually was prepared to make moves to advance her own game. It's a shame she couldn't make the one that would have ultimately enabled her to win it all.
2. Christy fails to keep Rob happy – Amazon
A Survivor classic, Christy's indecision at the final 6 in the Amazon ultimately led her from being in “the driver seat” to being kicked to the curb in no time flat. Christy should have learned by day 33 that leaving Rob with an unclear response was not a good idea. When he came to her and asked if she was down with the plan to vote Heidi off, her nonchalant “I guess” was never going to be enough to appease someone of his level of Survivor skill, and paranoia. Rob quickly turned the game around on Christy and used her own enemies against her to send her home in an incredible blindside. As Rob said at the reunion, all Christie had to say was “Rob, I'm in” and he would have been with her. She didn't even have to mean it. But the power seemingly went to her head and her lapse in judgment gave Rob all the ammunition he needed to send the game in another direction.
1. Woo takes Tony to the end and loses – Cagayan
The latest but most insane missed opportunity, Woo chose to throw away certain victory over Kass in the final 2 to take Tony to the end and lose in an 8-1 vote. Tony clearly did a great job convincing Woo not to flip, but it should have been obvious to Woo that there was no way he could lose sitting next to Kass. She was disrespected by most of the jury, but Woo let his loyalty and desire to go up against the best blind him. This wasn't a coin flip – one way was a clear win, the other an uncertain one at best. It goes without saying that Survivor is not just a strategic game – it has personal and emotional elements too, and Woo let himself get sucked in to this element right when it was most important to resist them.
Having backstabbed a number of other people in the game, it made little sense to not finish the job, especially when the alternative was someone less likeable than him. All the jury cares about is voting for the person they feel most comfortable winning at the end. They don't need to see the best two players up against each other, it makes no difference. Whilst Woo isn't the first person to make a decidedly questionable move at the final 3, his is easily the most baffling in the context, and it directly cost him $900,000.

When Autoweek last spoke to the president and CEO of the Sports Car Club of America ("Jeff Dahnert drives the SCCA forward," Oct. 24, 2012), Dahnert told us that since the five-year deal with Road America in Wisconsin ends this year, he'd like to begin moving the SCCA National Championship Runoffs to different locations, possibly a year here, a year there, rather than locking into multi-year contracts with one facility.
He said he'd even like to take the Runoffs west of the Rocky Mountains, for the first time since 1968, when they ran at the long-shuttered Riverside. But, he said, it would likely be a few years before that could happen, given the typically glacier-like pace the SCCA moves at, thanks in part to a conservative board of directors.
So it came as a surprise when Dahnert announced at a press conference today that not only will the Runoffs visit the West Coast, it would happen in 2014, when the event will take place at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca.
Then, just as surprising: The next year the Runoffs moves to the East Coast -- Daytona International Speedway, which hosted the Runoffs decades ago. And then in 2016, it's back to the old Runoffs home of Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course.
Three years, three different tracks: Ambitious, Dahnert told Autoweek, but worth it. "I give a lot of the credit to the board we have now," Dahnert said. They are obviously far more willing to take chances than boards in the past.
It will also be quite a challenge logistically: Having the race at one track for five straight years offered a certain comfort level for SCCA and the workers. But with each passing year, attendance typically drops, with racers figuring they have been there, done that, at the same track year after year.
Dahnert also credits SCCA vice president of club racing Terry Ozment for actually cutting the deals with the tracks, and beginning the process of making sure the logistics work. After all, the SCCA is a volunteer club, and the races must be staffed with officials and corner workers, typically coordinated by the local host SCCA chapters. Getting them on board was a challenge, too.
And then there were the tracks themselves -- as busy as facilities like Mazda Raceway at Laguna Seca and Daytona International Speedway are, getting them to commit a full week or more to one event isn't easy, especially since a total competitor car count of more than 1,000 is not out of the question.
In the case of Laguna, it likely would not have even been possible a few years ago, said Gill Campbell, CEO and general manager of MRLS. Because of its location, its race dates and noise levels are limited by the local government. Only recently, Campbell said, has more control over the dates been given to the track to make an event like the Runoffs possible.
Campbell said that hosting the Runoffs will be great for both the racers and the track. Laguna "sas soul," she said. "It's such an iconic facility. I know the racers will love coming here, and we look forward to having them."
Joie Chitwood, president of Daytona International Speedway, said that he tried to get the Runoffs to come to Indianapolis Motor Speedway when he was in charge of that track, but the SCCA management then was "unrealistic" about what it would take. "I'm so happy they are coming back to Daytona," Chitwood said. "It's part of the SCCA's history, and part of Daytona's history, and it will be great to reconnect."
"It's great to have the SCCA Runoffs back at Mid-Ohio as amateur racing helped build the history of this track," Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course president Craig Rust said. "Over the past few years many of our fans have asked about the Runoffs returning so we know they will be excited to welcome them back in 2016."
The move is expected to increase manufacturer support, too. Since there is no prize money, many racers depend on contingency money to help cover expenses. "Club racing is the heart and soul of Mazda Motorsports," Mazda Motorsports director John Doonan said. "We are proud to help bring the biggest club racing event in the country to our home track for 2014."
Dates have yet to be confirmed for the 2014 SCCA National Championship Runoffs or beyond. This year, the Runoffs will be held Sept. 16-22 at Road America. But don't expect that to be a lame-duck effort: It is the 50th anniversary of the Runoffs, and both the SCCA and long-participating manufacturers such as Mazda and Nissan will be there in force bringing drivers and cars from the past for what should be a huge event.
Now playing: Watch this: Uber now lets you tip drivers
Uber
Uber is embroiled in scandal. Without a CEO or top executives, a 14-person committee is now running the company. And it looks like their first big move is an attempt to ease their drivers' financial pain.
The biggest surprise: Uber is adding tips, starting today.
Starting in Seattle, Minneapolis and Houston, then rolling out to all US drivers by the end of July 2017, the tipping feature will be part of the Uber app. That's about as official as you can get.
And it's just one of the many reforms Uber claims it will offer its drivers over the next 180 days. In an email sent to drivers, which opens up to a fuller website here, the company's promising a variety of "meaningful changes & improvements to your driving experience."
So far, the first chunk of reforms are focused on helping drivers earn more money, though the website hints that future batches of changes may fall under different themes.
In addition to tipping, today's changes include:
Shorter 2-Minute Cancellation Window
You'll receive a cancellation fee if your rider cancels after more than 2 minutes (down from 5 minutes previously).
No More Unpaid Wait-times
You will earn a per-minute rate if you wait for a rider, starting 2 minutes after arrival.
All Driver Destination Trips Count Toward Quest
Every trip you take now counts toward reaching your Quest total.
Quest Earnings are Available for Instant Pay
You can now immediately cash out your Quest earnings using Instant Pay.
Expanded Driver Destinations
You can now set two trips a day going your way and earn with every mile.
Driver Injury Protection Insurance
You have the option to help protect yourself, and your earnings, in the event of a covered accident. To help you take advantage of this option, you will earn a bit more per-mile. For costs, complete coverage details, and state availability via Aon, tap here.
Teen Fare
For teen account trips, $2 will be added to the base fare and you'll earn more for those rides.
(Uber has a pilot program for teen drivers in Seattle, Phoenix, and Columbus, Ohio.)
Uber
Uber has been under fire for the way it treats drivers in the past. A judge famously rejected a $100 million class-action settlement in 2016 for being inadequate to compensate drivers in California and Massachusetts who wound up paying a variety of costs out of their own pockets.
Uber has long resisted tips, unlike competitors such as Lyft. Following legal settlements last April, Uber communicated that it was okay for drivers to accept tips, but only informally:
Tipping is not included, nor is it expected or required. In fact riders tell us that one of the things they like most about Uber is that it's hassle-free. And that's how we intend to keep it.
That didn't satisfy Uber drivers, however, many of whom petitioned the company to add them.
"Today's tipping announcement is an important win for drivers and proves that thousands of drivers coming together with one voice can make big changes," reads part of a statement from the Independent Drivers Guild. "Cuts to driver pay across the ride-hail industry have made tipping income more important than ever."
Why now? "Because it's the right thing to do, it's long overdue, and there's no time like the present," writes Uber.

WASHINGTON (PAN ): The Afghans would be transitioned drone capabilities so they could keep an eye along its eastern border with Pakistan , a top American general said on Wednesday.
Gen James Mattis, Commander of US Central Command, told members of the House of Armed Services Committee that the US would equip Afghan forces with drone capabilities before leaving Afghanistan .
"The Afghans do not have that capability yet. It's one of the enablers that we are trying to build into them before we leave," Gen Mattis said.
"The long-term view is that we will continue this so long as we are there, and we will transition this capability, standing it up inside the Afghan forces so when we leave, they have the ability to keep an eye on that border area," he said.
Referring to the difficult terrain along the Af-Pak border, the General said, "I've operated in many areas around the world , and I've never had more difficult military terrain to operate in than along that border."
Mattis was responding to questions from Congressman Ron Barber, who expressed concern about the ability of US and its allies to target terrorists, such as the Haqqani network , along the Afghanistan and Pakistani border.
Barber asked if there is a long-term plan for American unmanned reconnaissance after the planned drawdown of American troops and what capacities do the Afghan national security force have for unmanned aerial platforms to target terrorists networks.

This is a re-post, with photos newly added, of an essay I wrote a few years ago. It was originally published in the AOPA ePilot newsletter, March 2007.
My earliest memories are of pointing to the sky, having detected the far-off drone of a piston engine. Dad had been a pilot since before I was born. He flew a pea-green Cessna 172 from Rialto Municipal in Southern California. I can remember with crystal clarity those lazy Saturday afternoons at the airport, helping him push back the big hangar doors and leaning my small weight against the airplane's struts as he pulled it into the sun.
I read him checklists, learning words like “aileron,” “magnetos,” and “pitot” that no one else in my first-grade class knew. I drew airplanes and helicopters all over every piece of paper I could find, proudly telling Dad that I was going to grow up to be a “helicopter designer.” I went to the library, looked up the addresses of every aircraft manufacturer I could think of, and sent them packets of drawings. (Grumman was the only one that responded, with a very nice letter and some glossy 8-by-10-inch photos of fighters.)
But, as a teenager, I had “better” things to do than hang out at the airport. I turned down invitations to fly out for breakfast — that would require getting up too early on weekend mornings. Eventually, I graduated from high school and moved away for college, beginning to build my life in a new city. I saw Dad less and less frequently. He talked occasionally about flying out to visit me, but then he lost his medical and sold the plane. At 75 years of age, he was grounded.
Over the next few years his health deteriorated further. He lost weight, and his energy flagged. When I did see him, he often sat slumped in his chair in a defeated pose I'd never encountered before.
And then, one morning, I got the call that the ambulance had come in the middle of the night to take him away. I rushed to the hospital and met, for the first time, a thin, sad figure that I hardly recognized as my father — so different from the strong, robust figure of my childhood. I drove him home that day, driving as carefully as I could, and knew that he was weak when he never once bothered to comment on my driving!
That night I told my then-girlfriend (now my wife) about how much I regretted passing up the opportunity to fly more with Dad when I'd had the chance. I mentioned that in the back of my mind, I'd always thought that I'd become a pilot someday. I'd just never done anything about it.
A few weeks later, for Valentine's Day, she surprised me with a $49 introductory flight at a local flight school. I grinned like a chimp as I climbed into the school's Piper Cherokee. When the Lycoming engine barked to life, it was as if a spark had jumped a gap in my heart — the love, vigor, and excitement of my childhood came rushing back.
As the instructor led me through some simple maneuvers, I realized that flying had to be part of my life again. The instructor complimented me on how comfortable I seemed in the sky and how sure my movements were — I told him that I'd done this before.
Before I left the airport that day, I bought a logbook and had the instructor sign the first line. I was working an evening shift at the time, so I worked flying lessons into my morning schedule. Within three months, I had my private pilot certificate and was as happy as I'd ever been.
But by now, Dad's condition had gotten worse. His energy was very low. I'd told Mom about the flying lessons, but I didn't tell Dad — I wanted it to be a surprise.
Dad still liked to go to the airport now and then to watch the airplanes and perhaps chat with some of the pilots. Mom told me about a fly-in breakfast that was coming up and said she would make sure he'd be there. When the day came, I took to the air, flying the one-hour cross-country to my hometown. As I taxied from the runway to transient parking, I found Mom leading Dad across the ramp toward me.
The first words out of his mouth were, “Why didn't you tell me?” I laughed and gave him a hug.
The next thing he said was a string of admonishments — “Always watch the weather. Don't spend too much money. Always be careful taxiing. Take the time to do a proper preflight.” Once I heard his strict tone, I knew that the old Dad was back, if only for the day.
Mom coaxed him into the cockpit, and I gingerly steered the plane onto the same runway that was featured so heavily in my favorite childhood memories. With a roar the Cherokee pulled us into the air, and a trip around the pattern rushed by all too quickly. On final, I asked him if he wanted to go around again. Feeling the stress of the flight, he declined. I let the plane down gently, pulled off the runway, and taxied back to parking.
Mom and I helped him climb down the Cherokee's wing, and Mom asked him about the flight. “Sure, David's a good pilot,” he said. Coming from him, this was high praise.
In the months that followed, he weakened further. I took any opportunity I could to visit him, even as his speech and breathing became labored. We discussed where I'd flown recently, and he told me stories of notable trips he'd taken. He continued to warn me about the hazards of not watching the weather, a lesson I've taken to heart.
Dad passed away about four months after the fly-in. My first flight ever had been as his passenger, and his last flight had been as mine. I continued to revisit the little Southern California airports that we'd been to together.
At Apple Valley, an airport in the desert northeast of Los Angeles, a restaurant wall is decorated with handwritten messages from 60 years' worth of pilots who've passed through. Names and dates fight for space on the long, painted brick expanse. I remembered this place. I wondered if I'd written anything there.
I spent 15 minutes searching the wall, trying to find my own name. Instead, I found Dad's — dated five years before I was born.
The ink had faded over the decades, and the name was partially covered by newer additions. I borrowed a marker from the waitress and inked over his signature, smiling as I recognized his familiar scrawl. I colored in his name and date, and then added my own beneath it. Mine was a little bit smaller, a little bit newer, a little bit sloppier — but it was right next to Dad's.

Embed Bernie Sanders Endorses Hillary Clinton for President 2:37 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog
Bernie Sanders officially endorsed Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, capping off a contentious presidential primary and solidifying the former secretary of state's hold on the Democratic Party.
“I have come here to make it as clear as possible as to why I am endorsing Hillary Clinton,” Sanders said while standing next to Clinton at an event in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

“This campaign is not really about Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders. This campaign is about the needs of the American people and addressing the very serious crises that we face,” Sanders said. “And there is no doubt in my mind that as we head into November, Hillary Clinton is far and away the best candidate to do that.”
Sanders did not formally suspend his campaign, however, for procedural reasons related to the upcoming Democratic National Convention. When he first took to the stage, Sanders touted the success of his campaign, noting that he garnered 1,900 delegates during the primaries — “far more than almost anyone thought we could win,” Sanders said.
But Sanders conceded, “Secretary Clinton goes into the convention with 389 more pledged delegates than we have and a lot more superdelegates.”
“Secretary Clinton has won the democratic nominating process. And I congratulate her for that,” Sanders said to a cheering crowd in a city and state he won by wide margins.“She will be the Democratic nominee for president, and I intend to do everything I can to make certain she will be the next president of the United States.”
Our job now is to see our progressive platform implemented by a Democratic Senate, a Democratic House and a Hillary Clinton presidency. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 12, 2016
The event will help to fuse two wings of the Democratic party together that, despite their real differences, seem to be closer together than their counterparts across the aisle. Many of Trump's primary challengers have yet to endorse him.
Sanders attacked Trump several times during his speech, comparing the Republican candidate's stances to Clinton's.
“While Donald Trump is busy insulting Mexicans and Muslims and women and African Americans and our veterans, Hillary Clinton understands that our diversity is one of our greatest strengths,” Sanders said.
But he didn't shy away from noting the dissension that surfaced between himself and Clinton during the primaries.
“It is no secret that Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a number of issues, that is what this campaign has been about,” Sanders said. “This is what democracy is about.”
“There was a significant coming together between the two campaigns and we produced by far the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party," he added.

After embracing Sanders, Clinton took to the podium to thank him for endorsing her and for energizing Democratic voters during his campaign. She then focused on positions she and Sanders both champion — raising the minimum wage, helping college students avoid debt and implementing tougher restrictions on Wall Street.

“I can't help but reflect how much more enjoyable this election is going to be now that we are on the same side,” Clinton said. “Because you know what we are — stronger together,” she said, employing her campaign slogan.
“And now with your help, we are joining forces to defeat Donald Trump and win in November,” she said.
Trump quickly responded to the endorsement with a flurry of tweets.
“I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out,” one read. He left an open invitation to Sanders supporters to join his camp.
To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests, we welcome you with open arms. People first. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2016
Sanders' decision to stay in the race has baffled many and alarmed others, who worry he might help Trump by fracturing the Democratic Party.
But this weekend's meeting of the Democratic Platform Committee showed that in defying norms, Sanders notched real victories and advanced his so-called “political revolution.”
Sanders and Clinton are not particularly close, and they have not seen each other face-to-face since a private meeting at a Washington hotel last month. But they have been on the same side of political fights before.

Never as ideologically pure as his stereotype suggests, Sanders backed Clinton's health reform plan when he was a congressman in the 1990s, even though it fell far short of his favored single-payer plan.
Sanders appeared on stage with Clinton at an event supporting the effort in Vermont. “Thanks for your commitment to real health care access for all Americans,” Clinton wrote underneath a photo of the two of them from 1993.
They overlapped in the Senate for only two years, but it was enough time to serve together on the Health Committee and team up some legislation, including successful green jobs training legislation dubbed The Sanders-Clinton amendment.
Clinton donated $10,000 to help Sanders get elected to the Senate, through a PAC. And he praised her as “one of the brightest people in Congress” when President Obama chose her to be secretary of state.
Related: Democrats Advance Most Liberal Platform Ever
But whatever relationship they had was tested during the primary as both campaigns accused the other of underhanded tactics and unfair attacks.
The tension culminated in early April, when Sanders declared of Clinton, "I don't think you are qualified” to be president. He walked back the statement, but the damage was done, and the line popped up in some of Trump's stump speeches. And it reflected the bombs Sanders continued to lob at Clinton long after it was clear he would lose the nomination.
Since voting ended in June, Sanders has eased himself into supporting Clinton. First he acknowledged he would not be the nominee, then he said he would vote for Clinton and on Tuesday finally suggested others should too.
It's a much longer route to unity than Clinton took in 2008, when she conceded the race just four days after Obama secured the necessary delegates.
The idea for Tuesday's event was derivative of 2008, when Clinton and Obama appeared together for the first time after the primaries in the town of Unity, New Hampshire.
Clinton's campaign is hoping Sanders can serve as a bridge to progressives and young people, whom Sanders consistently won with margins as high as six-to-one throughout the primary.

But his most concrete assist may come in New Hampshire, where Sanders dominated in the primary. Sanders won the Granite State by 22 percentage points, giving him the largest win in the history of the state's Democratic primary.
That outcome rattled Clinton's campaign, but it ended up presaging little. For the rest of the primary, Sanders found it impossible to win outside of caucus states or ones where whites made up at least 70 percent of the vote.
Unity has been slow but steady in the 34 days ago since Sanders lost the nomination. On Monday, three progressive groups that either endorsed or were sympathetic to Sanders announced support for Clinton.
“We urge progressive activists across America to support Secretary Clinton for president, join the fight to defeat Donald Trump,” the political arm of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, whose co-chairs backed Sanders, said in a statement.
Negotiations are ongoing between the Clinton and Sanders campaign about exactly what role he will play and how much he will campaign for his former rival, but Sanders has said, “I'm going to do everything I can to defeat Donald Trump.”
Hoooooly cow. Holy cow. Are you ready? Tumblr isn't ready for this news, and frankly neither am I: Tom Hiddleston's being rumored for Batman V. Superman . As the Joker. Emily Blunt is being rumored for Catwoman. I'm gonna need a moment to gather myself.
This is still a rumor that you should take with multiple grains of sand — like at least a small beach of sand. It could very well be that this is just being spread because of how popular Hiddleston's turn as Loki in Thor and The Avengers was: After that performance it's not that hard him taking a more manic turn as the Joker. It follows, then, that if someone was like "Let's start a rumor today! Who'd be good as the Joker?" that his name would come up.
The same goes for Emily Blunt, who's got a big action movie coming out and wouldn't be that big of a stretch for Catwoman. Also in the signs that this could be very un-true: Batman V. Superman's already likely to lead into a bunch of other films that will hypothetically someday result in a Justice League movie. That means they might not want to blow their whole load on this movie, basically, by piling on the ensemble.
But let's suspend for a moment the fact that one of the only outlets reporting this at this moment is International Business Times UK — just for a moment let's let ourselves beliieeve.
What if it's real? There's no doubt the Joker's some mighty big shoes to fill considering the legacy of Heath Ledger, but given his Shakespearean and comic book villain roots he's the type we'd trust to make it his own thing separate from both Ledger and Jack Nicholson's interpretations of the characters. And Blunt's the exact kind of intelligent slinkiness that would be great for Catwoman. After Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice cast Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, and we're ready for anything that casting team's got to throw our way.
This may all be but International Business Times UK's fever dream. But oh, what a great dream it is.
Megabus.com -- a company that aims to rejuvenate bus travel with low fares and a no-frills business model -- will next month begin offering bus service in Birmingham to Atlanta and Memphis.
Megabus.com, a subsidiary of Coach USA, will today announce Atlanta as a new hub, allowing 11 new cities to be added to the 72 it already serves.
"As Americans continue to look for ways to stretch their income, we look forward to providing safe, convenient and affordable travel to Birmingham-area residents," Dale Moser, president and chief operations officer of Megabus.com, said in a statement.
Beginning Nov. 16, there will be three daily departures from Birmingham to Atlanta and another three to Memphis. Trips will depart from the east side of 18th Street North, between Morris Avenue and First Avenue North. In downtown Atlanta, the pick-up and drop-off location will be the curbside bus stop by the MARTA Civic Center station. There will be three daily return trips from each city as well.
The company also is adding Montgomery and Mobile, according to Megabus.com director Edward Hodgson.
Other new cities in the Southeast include Charlotte, Chattanooga, Orlando and Jacksonville, Fla. Fares begin as cheap as $1 and rise closer to the departure date. A ticket from Buffalo, N.Y., to Toronto booked one week in advance can cost as little as $17, according to the company's website. Prices for Southeastern cities haven't been fully determined yet, Hodgson said.
"I think we've seen such an enormous demand from our other hubs we've been infusing in the Northwest, and this prompted us to extend our reach," he said.
Greyhound Lines LLC already operates in Birmingham to and from Memphis and Atlanta. A round-trip fare from that company from Birmingham to Memphis leaving Oct. 31 and returning Nov. 3 starts at $103.50.
To celebrate the expansion, there will be 10,000 free seats available between Atlanta and the other 11 cities. The free trips can be booked beginning today and are available for use between Nov. 16 and Dec. 16. To book a free seat, Megabus.com says to use promotion code ATL10K.
The company's buses are equipped with free Wi-Fi, power outlets and restrooms. To hold down costs, the company doesn't operate terminals, and customers typically board curbside or in a parking lot.

Even as the Smithsonian Museum is documenting Black history, the US is continuing its repression of Black life. (Photo: Arash Azizzada / Flickr)
Fifty years from now, what will the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture's exhibit on the Movement for Black Lives look like? Will the exhibit feature videos from the hundreds of protests that erupted around the United States and the world, alongside pictures of children with signs that say “I Can't Breathe,” and “Say Her Name?” Will there be displays of the canisters of tear gas thrown by police at protestors, and a copy of the Vision for Black Lives policy plan for visitors to read? And, most important, will the exhibition describe how the US federal government monitored and secretly surveilled protests, vigils, leaders and movement participants? Or will that part of the history — how the government used early 21st-century social media sites against nonviolent protestors — remain hidden?
The new Smithsonian museum opens its doors in Washington, DC, in the midst of the Movement for Black Lives. Its exhibits and events include discussions of the Black Panther Party — discussions that surely include some mention of the state repression that the Panthers faced — but will it also acknowledge that the same government that harassed and surveilled the 1970s Black Panther Party 50 years ago continues to spy on today's activists and organizers?
At a time in which the Smithsonian museum is working to document American history, the US government is repeating American history. This October, reports revealed that 500 law enforcement agencies used Geofeedia, a site that collects data, to sift through and gather social media posts. While the data compiled was meant for advertisers, it is being used to surveil and monitor Movement for Black Lives protesters and actions. In 2015, The Intercept obtained documents, through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, demonstrating that the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and state and local law enforcement agencies began routinely surveilling and sharing information about protests as early as August 2014 after the police killing of Mike Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, which sparked the movement.
The reports show that DHS took information from social media accounts, including Facebook, Twitter and Vine, and shared information with local law enforcement agencies about vigils for Mike Brown in major cities throughout the country. Following arrests of demonstrators in Boston in November 2014 reports surfaced that local law enforcement agencies prepared for the protests by monitoring Movement for Black Lives-related social media posts at the Commonwealth Fusion Center, which provides “information sharing among local, state and federal public safety agencies and private sector organizations … of intelligence relevant to terrorism and public safety.”
Reports also describe how the New York Police Department, the Metropolitan Transit Authority's counterterrorism unit and the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force coordinated efforts to surveil protests against police violence in New York. In July 2016, activists and community organizers in Cleveland were visited by DHS and FBI agents prior to the Republican National Convention. In short, the federal government is using counterterrorism tactics and measures employed for national security purposes to surveil a movement that was in part a response to violent policing and surveillance of Black people.
The contemporary surveillance of the Movement for Black Lives fits neatly within the well-documented history of federal government-led efforts to destroy Black social movements through the use of monitoring and secret surveillance. In August 1967 the FBI initiated a covert action program known as COINTELPRO (from Counterintelligence Program), to disrupt and “neutralize” organizations it deemed subversive. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover instructed his staff to “expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize” the Black Panthers, as well as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), The Young Lords Party (YLP) and Martin Luther King, Jr., among others. Federal agents infiltrated the Panthers (often through illegal measures) with a mission to destroy them from within. Under COINTELPRO, throughout the late 1960s and the 1970s, the Black Panthers faced intense repression and violence, through sabotage, misinformation, agent provocateurs and lethal force.
The ongoing mass surveillance of legal protest activity by and for Black people raise serious constitutional and moral concerns. On October 20, Color of Change, along with my organization, the Center for Constitutional Rights, filed a complaint in federal court under FOIA against the FBI and DHS, seeking to expose this ongoing aggressive government surveillance of Movement for Black Lives activists, organizers and protests. The public deserves to know what the federal government is doing to silence and “destroy” protests against police violence, criminal justice and racial inequity.
The Black Panther Party commemorated its 50th anniversary last weekend and posed the question: “Where do we go from here?” Certainly, in 50 years, museum displays and archival footage documenting surveillance and “counter-terror” tactics used against Black people and Black-centered movements should be relics of history rather than reminders of how little has changed. We should fight for a country in which there is no use of surveillance to silence and “destroy” movements that declare “Black Power!” or “Black Lives Matter!”
Over the past several months, Karsten D. Voigt has been traveling between Kiev, eastern Ukraine, and Moscow. This retired diplomat (although you would not think it) and long-serving member of Germany's Social Democratic Party has been shaken by Russia's actions in Ukraine and its attitudes toward the West.
Voigt's conclusions are grim. “The vision of a pan-European peace order is not a realistic option,” he explained in an interview to Carnegie Europe. “Russia is turning away from Europeans norms and principles.” The consequences for European security are immense and dangerous.
These are strong words for a Social Democrat who hoped and believed that Russia could be integrated into Europe and, more importantly, that Europe with Russia could enjoy a stable security architecture.

Until very recently, the relationship between Moscow and Berlin had shaped Germany's policy toward its Eastern neighborhood. Germany viewed the region through the prism of Russia.
This was because of Ostpolitik. This “Eastern policy” was based on a deep belief and wish among Social Democrats that if Germany reached out to Russia, the relationship between the two countries—and, by extension, between Europe and Russia—could be predictable. Relations would be secure. They would be based on the sovereignty of states and the inviolability of borders.
That was the point of the 1975 Helsinki Final Act, which sought to improve relations between the Communist bloc and the West.
Now, Russian President Vladimir Putin's leadership and the Ukraine crisis have changed all that. He has violated European treaties and international law, which Germany's Social Democrats had assumed were intact. In fact, Putin has derailed Ostpolitik, alienating Russia's most important ally in Europe.
This dismantling of Europe's post–Cold War relationship with Russia convinced Voigt to begin a debate inside the Social Democratic Party about the future of Ostpolitik. He does not want to believe that the policy is dead. Instead, as he argued in the journal Russland-Analysen, a new phase of Russia policy and Ostpolitik has begun. It is a phase devoid of illusions.
Putin has derailed #Ostpolitik, alienating Russia's no. 1 ally in Europe. Tweet This
Voigt knows all too well that Germany's Social Democrats could no longer continue or even justify the Ostpolitik that it has pursued since the days of former chancellor Willy Brandt. “The younger generation of Social Democrats understands this,” Voigt said. “The older generation is a different matter.”
The younger generation realizes too that the old Ostpolitik is no longer applicable because of Putin's domestic and foreign policies and the way far-right parties in Europe identify with Putin's rejection of European values.
Yet there are other Social Democrats who would be hard-pressed to challenge Putin's vitriolic condemnation of the United States. Putin's leitmotiv is to blame America for the crises in Iraq and Libya and for the chaos in the international order.
But Russia's narrative also has another dimension.
Under Putin, Russia believes that ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States has wanted to keep Russia down. Europe, until recently, was spared Putin's ire. That is changing, especially since the European Union followed the United States in imposing sanctions on Russia. Moscow has retaliated by imposing embargoes on European food and dairy products.
“Russia is alienating itself more and more from the democratic countries of Europe through its increasingly authoritarian development,” Voigt said. He referred to how Russia was resorting to the symbols and policies of the czarist period, and to how the country was so unwilling to deal with its Soviet past.
But it is Russia's foreign policy that is now fundamentally changing the structures that predate the end of the Cold War in 1991.
Russia's use of energy to exert political pressure “undermines the trust that has been the basis of cooperation between Russia and Western Europe since the beginning of the 1970s,” Voigt said. As for Russia's annexation of Crimea in March 2014, “it violated the principles of inviolable borders and peaceful resolutions of conflicts that were agreed to in the 1975 Helsinki Final Act,” he added.
More depressing for Voigt is that Russia's actions in Ukraine violate the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, a treaty that made Ukraine give up its nuclear weapons. Yet surely, because not only Russia but also Britain and the United States signed that treaty, London and Washington should have acted when Russia annexed Crimea. As Voigt says, “the annexation undermines the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons.”
#Russia's domestic and foreign policies are challenging Europe's peace order. Tweet This
Germany's Social Democrats are at a loss over how to revive or rewrite Ostpolitik. Voigt knows that European peace and security is permanently stable only as long as Russia is part of that order. But Russia's domestic and foreign policies are challenging that arrangement.
What is more, Russia is not bothering in any serious way to use European multilateral institutions such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe or the Council of Europe to resolve conflicts. “It seems likely that Russia would rather be a counterpart than a partner in conflicts, such as efforts to stabilize Ukraine,” Voigt said.
This means that Germany, the EU, and NATO have to take precautions. European security is no longer a given. Moreover, Voigt believes that this changed environment makes it more necessary than ever to try to resolve the conflicts in Georgia, Moldova, and Armenia—not to mention eastern Ukraine. There is no scope for illusions. “For the foreseeable future, the vision of a pan-European peace order, regrettably, is not a realistic option.”
This bug https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=73597 related to the PECL ssh2 extension bit us yesterday, so this post is a public service announcement that will (hopefully) save you from writing your own workaround like I almost did.
Problem: PHP 5.6.28 (and apparently 7.0.13) introduced a security fix to URL parsing, that caused the string interpolation of the $sftp resource handle to no-longer be recognized as a valid URL. In turn, that causes opendir(), readdir(), etc. to fail when you use an $sftp resource in the path string, after an upgrade to one of those PHP versions.
Solution: Instead of using "ssh2.sftp://$sftp" as a stream path, convert $sftp to an integer like so: "ssh2.sftp://" . intval($sftp) . "/" . Then it will work just fine.
Thanks to the people who fixed the URL parsing security flaw, thanks to the people who wrote the PECL ssh2 extension, and thanks to the people who provided the fix.

Firefighters and the U.S. Coast Guard rescued a woman who disappeared while swimming in the Bay in Sausalito this afternoon, according to fire officials.
The woman was swimming approximately 100 yards offshore from the 100 block of Bridgeway shortly before 12:30 p.m. today when she disappeared in the water, according to Mill Valley Fire Department Battalion Chief Michael St. John.
Watercraft from several fire departments and the U.S. Coast Guard worked with land-based crews on the shoreline in the search, and located the unresponsive woman in the water off of Alexander Avenue at 12:51 p.m., St. John said.
She was pulled from the water and taken to a nearby dock by a fire department jet ski, where she was stabilized before being transported to Marin General Hospital.
Crews from Marin County, Mill Valley and Tiburon as well as the Coast Guard assisted the Southern Marin Fire Protection District in the rescue.

Today I want to take a look at The Viral Franchise by I Wanna Be Rich™. This get rich scheme can be found in money making forums and many other on-line locations. Here is what I have found.
Update: The Viral Franchise was recently offline for a long period of time. Here is an email that explains the downtime and all the technical problems caused by the owners lack of planning for the future or backing up his web server correctly.
Hi everyone, sorry about the downtime but it couldn't be avoided.
Those of you that have been with me/us for a while now have noticed the HUGE leaps in traffic and service we have been having month over month ‘especially' the last 3-4 months. With the increase im sure you noticed we shut down once or twice that first real busy month, then three or four times the next month, then five or six times last month. (tech talk ->) The amount of log files, inode files and a duplicated named file caused the server to lock up permanently with the only option of reformatting.
Ive been working like an absolute madman for the last 5 days to get things back up and running while answering countless emails, I havent been able to email everyone to inform of what happened because all the emails were locked into the broken server. This email im sending right now means that IWBR Financial is now back up and running, there were NO payment OR account losses, all funds are 100% intact and there is absolutely nothing to worry about on this end 🙂
IWBR Financial was the first priority because it handled the cash, my next workload is to get the Franchise back online 🙂
This is going to take me between 3 and 7 days where I have to rewrite alot of unique code specific to the franchise system that wasnt backed up, but believe me when I say im going to complete this ASAP because you arent the only ones not making any extra money with site being down 😉
Thank you all for your patience and encouraging emails, we will get our show back on the road very soon 🙂
Cheers

Since this company is based out of Canada, here is what the law in Canada has to say about how this get rich scheme is run.
Pyramid Schemes
These scams start with one person or a few people (those at the top of the pyramid) who sign up others to invest in a fake business. These new members pay to join the scheme and are expected to bring in more people to invest in the “business.” Each time a new member pays to join, those higher up on the pyramid get a cut of the money.
At some point, every pyramid scheme reaches a point where no new investors can be found and the last investors, those at the bottom of the pyramid, lose their money.
Pyramid schemes are illegal in Canada.

The owner of The Viral Franchise scam clearly understands that his business model is unsustainable and has plans for when the inevitable collapse of pyramid recruiting comes.
“Now, once the franchising aspect runs dry we can flip our script into solely selling ad space and or PPC or any number of other ways to get our latecomers some income.” – Source Frederick Spears
The Viral Franchise Scam Conclusion
In my opinion, The Viral Franchise scam is a cash gifting scheme that is run under the cover of an advertising platform. Each individual who profits, does so primarily from the payments of others who are themselves making payments in order to obtain their own profit. Avoid The Viral Franchise scam.
[The Rundown (TL;DR)]
I applied to the Clinton Global Initiative University program that was hosted April 1-3 by former President Bill Clinton at UC San Diego.
My application, which proposed a commitment that sought to aid farmers in India driven to suicide by the agricultural giant Monsanto, was denied.
I took the feeling of rejection for a couple days and wondered why my application was denied even though I saw several examples of less complex commitments submitted around the same time being accepted. (This doesn't make them any less deserving, I only bring it up to highlight that timing was probably not a major factor).
I recently found out that President Clinton has extensive ties with Monsanto and if there is indeed a relationship between President Clinton's affiliations and those of his organization, then this would indicate a major conflict of interest on the part of CGI U.
[Note]
This is not intended to be a rant. I do not feel bitter or slighted because I simply do not have evidence directly linking what I've found about Mr. Clinton's political affiliations to my rejection from the program. But what I have found is evidence of these affiliations, previously unknown to me, that may explain why I wasn't invited to take part in CGI U if the organization has the same ties as the former US President behind it.
The reasons for a CGI U “commitment” decision are not made available and it very well may be due to limited capacity, quality of the commitment itself, or some other administrative variable (by that I mean reasons such as an admissions officer simply deciding that the application wasn't good enough, etc.)
I acknowledge that the rejection of my application may have been due to an administrative reason. In fact, I sincerely hope this to be true. Still, I am curious about how President Clinton's own policies and political affiliations affect the admissions process of his organization.
Let me explain.
[The Story]
A few months ago I found out that former President Bill Clinton would be hosting his annual Clinton Global Initiative University at UC San Diego where I go to school. I decided to apply and went through the selection process for the program. CGI U describes Commitments to Action as:
proposals that translate practical goals into meaningful and measurable results. Commitments are new, specific, and measurable initiatives that address social or environmental challenges on campuses, in communities, or in different parts of the world (CGI U).
More information about the program can be found here, but the paragraph above gives the basic gist of it. CGI U accepts applicants to attend the program based on their proposed commitments and the majority of students accepted go on to attend the event where they meet with other students to recruit other people to work on and discuss the feasibility of their commitment. Basically, it is a forum to connect with other college students and include them in the development and enacting of your commitment. (A minority of these accepted students are actually awarded funds for their proposals–so, to give myself the best shot, I structured my commitment for the program based on these successful CGI U commitments that are provided as examples from the past).
[My Proposal]
The full text of my proposal can be found here and here, but the major details are these. My commitment has to do with farmers in Andhra Pradesh, India that have been driven to mass suicides due to crop failure and debt caused by deceptive techniques by large agricultural biotechnology corporations such as Monsanto. As my application stated,
The Andhra Agriculture Education and Reform Initiative, [as I named it], seeks to provide agricultural finance literacy to rural farmers in Andhra Pradesh, India so that they may be able to distinguish between valid versus deceptive money-lending and farming contracts. The project also seeks to establish a system of microlending between farmers and provides reserve support through international donation while focusing on promoting an organic, cooperative agricultural setting within a community.
Now comes the important part–I went on to write that:
The AAER Initiative seeks to educate communities of farmers through making them aware of the current state of small agriculture in Andhra. By teaching these communities to recognize the tactics and pitfalls associated with borrowing hyper-speculative loans and subscribing to misleading seeding programs of several large companies (such as Monsanto), the AAER Initiative will prevent the dire situation that has driven many farmers to suicide.
Again, my entire commitment is more detailed and can be found through the link above, but the important part is that the major principle behing my proposal has to do with educating farmers against the deceptive tactics of Monsanto and its subsidiary companies.
[The Research]
After the initial sting of being denied, I was discouraged but decided I was going to draw up a plan to enact my commitment by myself. That's when I found that President Clinton has some interesting political affiliations with Monsanto that I was not aware of.
As President, Clinton put Monsanto executives in at the FDA, as US Agricultural Trade Representatives, and on International Biotechnology Consultive Forums to name a few.
“‘Rural Americans for Hillary,' an advocacy organization for Mrs. Clinton were Monsanto's lobbyists. Her former-employer, Rose Law Firm , represent Monsanto, the world's largest GE (GE - genetic engineering) corporation; Tyson, world's largest meat producer; and Walmart, the world's largest retailer.”
Rose Law Firm which has ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton has other connections: “Jon Jacoby, senior at the Stephens Group - one of the largest shareholders of Tyson, Walmart, DP&L - is C.O.B. of DP&L and arranged the Wal-Mart deal. Jackson Stephens ' Group staked Walton and financed Tyson. Monsanto bought DP&L and Walmart's board invited Hillary on while Tyson executives helped her do a $100,000 trade just before Bill' governorship. Jackson Stephens then backed Bill for Governor, and later President (donating $100,000).”
In office, President Clinton along with his newly appointed USDA officials immediately “weakened chicken waste contamination standards, easing Tyson's poultry-factory expansion.” As mentioned, Tyson has connections to Monsanto and Walmart through the Rose Law Firm which is directly linked to…Mr. and Mrs. Bill Clinton. With Tyson now supported by the Clinton FDA, the following took place.
Monsanto people were put in charge of food. FDA okayed Monsanto's rBGH (bovine growth hormone), first GE-product ever approved. Despite bovine illness/death, FDA didn't recall or warn the public. When dairymen labeled milk “rBGH-free,” the USDA threatened confiscation. Organic food was the last way around unknown danger. FDA tried to close that escape with new “organic” standards, to include: genetic engineering of plants/animals, food irradiation, sewage sludge fertilizer.
(Source for above points)
DP&L's “terminator genes” (now Monsanto's) which prevent seeds from “working” after only one season cause farmers to repurchase new seeds rather than replant them or face lawsuits from Monsanto for “copyright infringement.” These are some of the deceptive tactics used by Monsanto that I was referring to in my commitment that ensnare uneducated Indian farmers causing massive debt and suicide as the only means of escape. These terminator genes were allowed to go into production during the Clinton administration.
Monsanto employs child labor.
These are only some of the more direct initiatives with which Mr. Clinton and Monsanto have shared sponsorship. I encourage you to find out more about Monsanto's negative impact on the US here.
[What this has to do with me]
I want to make the key point clear. While it may be true that I was not accepted by CGI U for purely administrative reasons, it is undeniable that if there is indeed a connection between President Clinton's affiliation with Monsanto/Tyson/Walmart and the administration of the Clinton Global Initiative program, then my commitment was denied for political reasons. After all, why would CGI U want to give me a forum to address and possibly recruit others to a commitment that directly goes against the international work of a corporation supported by both Clintons? It isn't difficult to see the connection. Even a quick perusal of CGI U's resume demonstrates that Mr. Clinton and his organization take part in implementing positive change and their work to better the world is incredibly important. But I sincerely hope that his political affiliations do not hinder the principles championed by his organization.
I am not saying that Bill Clinton personally read my application and decided to reject it. What I am saying is if there is a political affiliation, it is entirely plausible that a CGI U officer decided not to grant me admission, indicating a major conflict of interest.
As I stated before, the precise reason behind the decision to accept or reject a CGI U application is not made public but in this case it is interesting to note that the Clinton-Monsanto connection is directly opposite the principles of my proposed commitment.
After reading this post, I hope that you will check my sources, do your own research if you feel so inclined, and share this post if you find it interesting. Feel free to “reply” via Tumblr with any comments or if you decide, share your thoughts anonymously.
In the meantime, I am going to be planning out how to enact my commitment to help the farmers of Andhra Pradesh. For more information on their situation, you can go here or run a simple google search. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, or would like to help plan the AAER Initiative, please don't hesitate to contact me at cspteja@gmail.com.

Anthony Martial and Daley Blind are both struggling with injuries ahead of another week of international friendlies.
Blind is set to miss Holland's friendly with Poland on Wednesday after failing to recover from a calf injury he picked up during United's FA Cup final victory over Crystal Palace at Wembley.
Martial is also set to miss France's friendly with Cameroon on Monday after picking up a thigh injury in training. However, coach Didier Deschamps confirmed the 20-year-old is still set to be included in his 23-man squad for Euro 2016.
Deschamps said: "Martial has pain in his thigh. He finished the season late.
"I will not take any risks and it is likely that he will not participate in the match.
"There is no doubt about Martial's participation in the Euros. His thigh problem is muscular fatigue."
For those of you who aren't aware, hoarders are people who, to put it simply, just don't throw anything away. Marked by stacks of newspapers, obsessive collections of items they'll never use and crowded hallways full of memorabilia they can't bear to part with, the disorder has come to prominence lately thanks to TV shows like "Hoarders" and "Hoarding: Buried Alive." But in comics? As artist Ulises Farinas shows above, we just call that "the Justice League Trophy Room."
Seriously, imagine a geek's proclivity for filling their home with useless paraphernalia combined with a superheroic zeal far beyond the abilities of mortal men, and up to 75 years of never aging, and you've got the recipe for the ultimate hoarder. But who's the worst offender? I've run down a list of the seven biggest hoarders in comics who could stand to throw some crap away once in a while!
The Fantastic Four's Reed Richards has literal tons of experiments running at any given time, and while that's to be expected when you're the world's greatest super-scientific mind, there's a certain point wwhere it gets ridiculous. And for the record, that point is when you have a portal to the Negative Zone -- which was until recently ruled by a gigantic insect monster named Annihilus -- two floors away from where your children sleep.
Seriously, stacks of newspapers are bad enough with the way they create a fire hazard, but when you've got so much science laying around that math itself comes to life and tries to kill you?
It's probably time to cut back a little.
Admittedly, Reed's lab is pretty well organized (thanks to tesseract storage rooms and H.E.R.B.I.E. 's constant efforts), but one of the measures of hoarding severity, after all, is whether it presents a danger. And really, with this many radical dodecahedrons laying around...
...you're going to run into a few problems.
Some hoarders are marked not just by the objects they have stuffed away into their own personal Fortress of Hoarditudes, but also by the extreme lengths they'll go to to acquire them, and nobody -- nobody -- goes quite as far as Superman himself. Dumpster diving is one thing, but actual diving to the bottom of the ocean so that you can retrieve the wreckage of the Titanic and rebuild it in your living room? Sure there's nothing else you could be doing with your time there, Clark?
Another key factor in identifying compulsive hoarding is that the hoarded objects often have no use whatsoever for the person who hoards them, and again, we can check that one right off on Superman's chart. Admittedly, there may in fact be a few pretty good uses for keeping The Forbidden Weapons of Crimedom around...
...but are we really ever going to use that life-sized wax replica of Perry White? How about we just go ahead and get rid of it and use that space to put down some carpet. Floors made of ice aren't helping anyone.
Much like Reed Richards, Dr. Doom does some pretty intense hoarding, but this dude has taken it to an entirely different level by hoarding the entire country of Latveria , complete with countless robot replicas of himself, with plans to acquire more.
It's pretty hardcore even by the strictest hoarding standards, but once you get to a certain point, that's really not even the word you want anymore. Considering just what he's got cluttering up his basement...
...it's probably better to just go with "stockpiling." There is, as it turns out, a difference.
At first glance, it's pretty easy to call Rick Jones out for hoarding super-hero contacts. Over the course of his existence in the Marvel Universe, he's sidekicked for the Hulk, Captain Marvel, Captain America, ROM: Spaceknight and the entire Avengers team, and been singled out as the bearer of the Destiny Force, which was so complicated that even Curt and Chris won't touch it.
In reality, though -- or at least, in one reality -- Rick's a straight up legitimate hoarder: In the alternate universe of "Future Imperfect," the Hulk ends up killing all of the other super-heroes and super-villains, leaving Rick to amass a pretty hefty collection of memorabilia:
(Click for a larger image)
The scene, written by Peter David with art by George Perez, has been a favorite of fans to geek out over for years, and with good reason: Rick's collection goes from morbid (chunks of the Thing's rocky skin collected in the head of a Sentinel and the Beast's skinned pelt on display) to the poignant (Captain America's shield remains pristine and indestructible) to the outright hilarious (really? Shatterstar's sword gets a place of honor? I can't wait to see the entire room devoted to Darkhawk), with plenty of trivia to go around, including a surprise appearance by the Bottle City of Kandor.
My favorite bit, though, is the fact that Dr. Strange's cloak of levitation isn't actually hanging on anything.
You know how every now and then you'll see an article about how someone gets arrested because they have, like, eighty cats in their house, and how absolutely horrible it sounds? Okay, imagine that, only instead of cats, it's hundreds of different animals, including a giant bee with drills for hands, a dinosaur with a tree growing out of its back, a camel made of volcanoes and... well, whatever the hell Jynx is.
Justify it all you want, kid, but you're not doing that Bellsprout any favors by sending it to your Pokemill.
And consider this: There are currently 649 species of Pokémon, and the goal of every trainer is to catch every single one . I don't know about you, but I do not want to be the Officer Jenny who gets a call to clear out the house of the guy who actually does after he inevitably suffocates underneath a Snorlax.
The Collector , a nigh-omnipotent space-divorcee, is pretty much exactly what it says on the label. Not only does he travel through space... you know, collecting stuff, he also totally fits the profile. After his wife gives up her immortality (which is a nice way of saying that she'd rather die than spend one more minute listening to him drone on about his stuff), he becomes obsessed with collecting -- well, anything that catches his interest, really, often to the annoyance of every other person he encounters.
If this sounds familiar, rest assured that Stan Lee and Don Heck -- who created the Collector in "Avengers" #28 -- havd nothing but the utmost respect for the many fine readers of Marvel comics.
It shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that Batman ranks as the ultimate super-hoarder. It has, after all, been pointed out on a number of occasions that since the Batcave sits below his ancestral home of Wayne Manor, he essentially lives in his parents' basement, and true to form, he's filled it up with a truly amazing amount of useless stuff.
Admittedly, Batman's hoarding is way cooler than average -- you'd want a giant tyrannosaurus in your house too if you had Bruce Wayne money -- but let's be honest here:
Forget about the giant penny and the playing card, he can at least write those off as evidence. Heck, you can even take away the fact that with at least four Robins, three Batgirls and a mute hunchback who used to do auto repair ( yes, really ), the dude is also hoarding sidekicks. But come on: how many cars does one man need to patrol a city with ten million people in it?
Just let it go and get a MetroCard, Batman. It's the first step in making your Butler not want to murder you for making him dust a collection of ray-guns every morning.

Walter Shaub, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, has been outspoken in his criticism of President Donald Trump. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Ethics office won't probe Trump domestic emoluments issue
The government office overseeing ethics policy for the executive branch has turned down a request from a Democratic senator to investigate whether President Donald Trump's business dealings violate a provision in the Constitution that limits the president's compensation to his official salary.
In a letter Monday, U.S. Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub told Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) that his office lacks jurisdiction to examine whether benefits Trump gets from federal government dealings with his private businesses run afoul of the domestic emoluments clause in the Constitution.
"The emoluments issues are presently under judicial review, and, within the executive branch, are under the sole purview of the Department of Justice," Shaub wrote. "OGE has no authority to investigate or order corrective action on the part of the President. Ultimately, under the Constitution, the authority to oversee the Presidency rests with Congress."
Shaub, who was appointed by President Barack Obama to a five-year term that runs through early next year, has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump. The OGE director publicly denounced Trump's plan to retreat from his businesses while he serves in the White House. Shaub also demanded ethics waivers the White House had not made public and he rebuffed a proposal from Trump's lawyer to submit an unsigned financial disclosure form.

However, Shaub previously indicated to other members of Congress that his office has no authority to investigate Trump or anyone else over conflict of interest issues or questions of whether he is violating the Constitution's foreign emoluments clause. That provision prohibits U.S. officials from accepting payments from foreign governments.
It's not clear whether other members directly raised the clause barring supplementation of a president's salary since Trump took office, but Shaub did mention the point shortly after Trump's election in a response to Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.). Carper had posed a series of ethics-related questions about the business dealings of the president-elect and his family.
Murray said in a statement to POLITICO that the OGE's response "makes it clear that Congress needs to continue doing everything possible to keep the scrutiny on President Trump and not allow these serious ethics concerns to slip into the shadows.”
“President Trump has brought so many ethics concerns and conflicts of interest into his Administration that I want every tool we have brought to bear to shine spotlights and expose any potential wrongdoing or inappropriate activities," she said.

What is Adventures
Adventures is a custom story format for Twine 2 made by Longwelwind that allows writers to add RPG elements such as health, items, golds and more to their story. The project is free and open source; feel free to contribute on the Github repository !
The documentation is split into 2 sections:
Basic Usage shows how to use the basic functions of Adventures and is perfect for beginners, or those who don't possess sufficient Javascript knowledge as most scripts can be copy/pasted into your story. This section will show you how to change the health of the player, change the gold it holds and add or remove items in its inventory.
shows how to use the basic functions of and is perfect for beginners, or those who don't possess sufficient Javascript knowledge as most scripts can be copy/pasted into your story. This section will show you how to change the health of the player, change the gold it holds and add or remove items in its inventory. Advanced Usage shows the advanced features of Adventures and is reserved for those who possess an intermediate knowledge of Javascript and want to make more complex interactions. This section will show you how to create custom items, for example.
Requirements
Adventures is based on klembot's Snowman 2 and works by calling Javascript functions inside <% %> tags to change the state of the character and the story. For example, to add a sword to the inventory of the player, you'd write in one of your passages:
In the middle of the hall, amidst the corpses of the goblins, you find a sword. You're definitly not the first one to wield it, but it should suffice should a monster bar your way. <% character.inventory.addItem("sword"); %>
If you have no knowledge of Javascript, a small section describing the basics of Javascript will help you get the minimum skill to use Adventures.
After my middling feelings about Acer's Iconia W700, the Iconia W510 comes as a nice surprise. It's in roughly the same vein as the HP Envy X2: a tablet PC that docks into a keyboard, with batteries in both the keyboard and main unit. The Envy is unquestionably the better product, but the W510 should not be dismissed out of hand. It's worth a close look.
The W510 packs an Atom Z2760 processor (1.5GHz, burstable to 1.8GHz) in a 1.27-pound chassis, sporting a 10.1-inch 1366 by 768 display. The Pro version of the W510 has a few differences: Windows 8 Professional instead of the consumer edition of Windows 8, along with a stylus and a two-year warranty (instead of one year).
[ Windows 8 left you blue? Then check out Windows Red, InfoWorld's plan to fix Microsoft's contested OS. | Ease the transition from Windows 7 with the Windows 8 Deep Dive PDF special report. | Stay atop key Microsoft technologies in our Technology: Microsoft newsletter. ]
Even with the keyboard attached, the whole thing weighs no more than 3 pounds, making it a great grab-and-go machine. Also, it doesn't depend solely on the dock for connectivity. Micro USB, Micro HDMI, Micro SD, and a direct charging connector (which uses the same plug that connects to the dock) are all available on the body of the unit. The second battery in the keyboard/dock gives the W510 tremendous battery life. I got 15 and one-half hours in my Netflix battery rundown test.
Apart from adding a keyboard and second battery, the dock provides a full-sized USB port and a sturdy hinge that allows the whole unit to fold open and shut like a regular notebook PC. The dock is made of ABS plastic as opposed to the Envy X2's aluminum, and the dock connector itself looks somewhat cheap -- I've heard it condescendingly referred to as "the taco shell". Also, be forewarned that if you open the laptop too far, the weight of the dock isn't enough to keep the unit upright. That said, you have to open the hinge at a very wide angle before it topples over.
The Guardian is keeping a running tab of the best media April Fool's pranks today. So far, they've got a Pet Membership announcement at MOMA, a finding of Robin Hood's bones on Maid Marian Way in Nottingham, a special “safe text-and-walk” path at Northeastern University, and a Klingon edition of Rosetta Stone. A little closer to the bone there is the New York Coalition Against Hunger's fake House GOP press release calling for an infant work requirement for WIC beneficiaries, and a phony report that Piers Morgan will serve as media advisor to UK's troubled Lib Dem Party.
There's another crazy item today, however, that seems to be actual news, best I can tell, from the Baton Rouge (LA) Advocate.:
Starbucks has apologized to a Louisiana schoolteacher who complained that a Baton Rouge barista drew Satanic symbols in her coffee foam.
It all happened at the Mall of Louisiana but was promptly liked and shared via Facebook by approximately 1,800 people.
“(Sunday) was the first we heard of it when she posted on our Facebook page,” Starbucks social media team spokesman Tom Kuhn told The Daily Advertiser. “We reached out to her through social media and apologized. We're taking the complaint seriously. We're not sure who served her or what kind of beverage it was. It looks kind of caramel-ish in the photos.”
Megan Pinion posted the complaint and a photo of her two beverages. One had a star drawn in the foam, which she conceded could simply be a star like the one in Starbucks logo rather than Lucifer's pentagram. The other beverage had a 666 drawn in the foam. It is a number the Book of Revelations links to the Antichrist.
“I unfortunately can't give the young man's name who served it, because I was so appalled that I could not bring myself to look at him,” Pinion wrote in her post. “I am in no way judging his beliefs or dis-meriting his beautiful artwork, I am however judging his lack of professionalism and respect for others. I am a teacher in the public school system and if I were to present a child of atheist or pagan believers with a Christian art project I could be sued in a heartbeat. I am of Catholic faith and would love to share in my beliefs daily. Fortunately I have enough common sense to present myself with professionalism and follow an ethics code. Perhaps that could be suggested to that particular location.”
If this is indeed an April Fool's joke, the Advocate needs to say so before a hunt ensues for Satan's Barista, or Baton Rouge Christians demand equal coffee art time as a matter of “religious liberty.”
Negative effects of joining a gang last long after gang membership ends
Doree Armstrong News and Information
Imagine two children, both with the exact same risk factors for joining a gang. As teenagers, one joins a gang, the other doesn't. Even though the first teen eventually leaves the gang, years later he or she is not only at significantly higher risk of being incarcerated and receiving illegal income, but is also less likely to have finished high school and more likely to be in poor health, receiving government assistance or struggling with drug abuse.
University of Washington researchers have found that joining a gang in adolescence has significant consequences in adulthood beyond criminal behavior, even after a person leaves the gang. The research is published in the American Journal of Public Health.
“It turns out that, like violence, gang membership is as much a public health problem as a criminal justice problem,” said Karl Hill, study co-author and research associate professor in the School of Social Work. “Joining a gang in the teens had enduring consequences on health and well-being.”
The Seattle Social Development Project, which was founded by study co-author J. David Hawkins, followed 808 fifth-grade students from 18 elementary schools serving high-crime neighborhoods in Seattle, beginning in 1985. More than half of the students came from low-income families. Participants were interviewed every year until the age of 18, then every three years until the age of 33.
According to lead author Amanda Gilman, a doctoral candidate in the School of Social Work, joining a gang served as a turning point, creating consequences that cascaded into other areas of life for years afterward.
“Very few of them reported still being in a gang at age 27. The vast majority had left a long time ago, but the consequences stuck with them long-term,” Gilman said.
Researchers used 23 risk factors to calculate a child's propensity for joining a gang, and then compared 173 youth who had joined a gang with 173 who did not but showed a similar propensity for doing so, so that the only difference between the two groups was gang membership. The average age of joining a gang was just under 15 years old. No one in this study reported joining a gang after the age of 19, and the majority (60 percent) were in a gang for three years or less.
The 23 variables used to match the groups included individual factors such as antisocial beliefs, alcohol and marijuana use, violent behavior and hyperactivity; family factors such as poverty, family structure, sibling behavior and parent pro-violent attitudes; school factors such as academic aspiration and achievement; neighborhood factors such as the availability of marijuana and neighborhood kids in trouble; and whether the child associated with friends who engaged in problem behaviors. Researchers measured three areas of adult functioning at age 33: illegal behavior, education and occupational attainment, and physical and mental health.
Those who joined a gang in adolescence were nearly three times more likely between ages 27 and 33 to report committing a crime, more than three times more likely to receive income from illegal sources, and more than twice as likely to have been incarcerated in the previous year.
Former gang members also were nearly three times more likely to have drug-abuse issues, were almost twice as likely to say they were in poor health, and twice as likely to be receiving public assistance. They were also half as likely to graduate from high school.
Gilman hopes the study will motivate schools and communities to develop and implement research-based strategies to prevent children from joining gangs, in the hopes of not only reducing crime, but increasing graduation rates and reducing physical and mental health costs.
Hill said everyone can be involved in gang prevention in their own way, by reducing the 23 variables shown to be risk factors. “If you're a parent, manage your family well. If you're a community member, be involved in kids' lives. If you're a teacher, engage your kids and recognize good work. We can't solve all of the risks kids are exposed to alone, but we can if we work together,” he said.

FT Magazine 29/30 July 2006
J.R.R. Tolkien and the Somme were inextricably linked. I learned this forty-four years ago, shortly after I was elected to my first university appointment, at Merton College, Oxford. I was twenty-six years old.
In those days there was a strict seating order at college dinners. The head of the college sat in the centre, the senior fellows on either side of him, and the junior fellows at the far ends of the table. Also at the ends were the Emeritus Fellows, long retired, venerable, sometimes garrulous guardians of the college name. Several of them had served in the First World War. When they discovered a historian, new to his craft, filled with the keenness of a youngster amid his elders, they were happy to talk about those distant days, already more than forty years in the past.
Some enjoyed singing the songs of the trenches, in versions far ruder than those sung today. Tolkien was more reticent, yet when he did open up, full of terrible tales. There was never any boasting. The war's scars were too many, its reality too grim, to lead to self-glorification, or even to embellishment.
In 1916, the twenty-four-year-old Tolkien was a 2nd Lieutenant in the Lancashire Fusiliers. On the evening of July 14 – two weeks after the start of the Battle of the Somme – his battalion went into the line. He had never seen action before. What he later called the “animal horror” of the trenches was as yet unknown to him. But he already knew that one of his closest friends, Robert Gilson, had been killed on the first day.
Gilson, two years younger than Tolkien, had written home two nights before he was killed. “Guns firing at night are beautiful – if they were not so terrible. They have the grandeur of thunderstorms. But how one clutches at the glimpses of peaceful scenes. It would be wonderful to be a hundred miles from the firing line once again.”
Tolkien was to experience many such nights. He was also to lose more friends. On July 22, three days after his first five-day spell in the trenches, his friend Ralph Payton was killed in action. Payton's body was never identified; his name is inscribed today on the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing.
Two days after Payton was killed, Tolkien returned to the trenches for a second five-day spell of front-line duty. As battalion Signals Officer, his task each time he went “up the line” was to supervise the communications to the brigade command post a mile and a half behind the trenches. The main method of communication was by pigeon.
As we talked of those far off times, Tolkien remembered, as vividly as if it were yesterday, the constant danger of German artillery shells, ranging throughout the area, falling with their screech and roar, and clouds of earth and mud, and the fearful cries of men who had been hit.
Like all the First World War soldiers at dinner in college, Tolkien knew that his stories seemed antique compared to the more recent memories of those who had fought in the Second World War. Several times he told me, in words he was later to use in his introduction to the second edition of “The Lord of the Rings”: “It seems now often forgotten that to be caught by youth in 1914 was no less hideous an experience than to have been involved in 1939 and the following years.”
Forty-four years after my Merton conversations with Tolkien, I passed the Roman Catholic church at Bertrancourt, three miles behind the old front line. There, on August 6, he attended mass before setting off, the following morning, for the front-line trenches. It was his third spell up the line, and he was fortunate. During the five days that he ran the communications there, no British forward assault took place, and only four men were killed. One writes “only” because, at the time, the death of four soldiers on a battalion front seemed a small toll.
Like many old soldiers, Tolkien spoke of the stark, dull, ordinariness of much of life on the battlefield. But there were no lack of action. On September 27 he was back in the front line, organizing communications through the splintered maze of Thiepval Wood, as his battalion struggled, in vain, to enter the Schwaben Redoubt, a German strong point that had resisted all efforts to capture it since July 1. On the following day, when the battalion carried out a successful raid on a German machine-gun position that had caused havoc for the attackers, more than thirty Germans were taken prisoner.
Tolkien, who spoke German, later recalled with wry amusement how, when he offered a drink of water to a wounded German officer, the prisoner, while accepting the water, corrected him on his German pronunciation.
Tolkien and his signallers were always vulnerable. One of them, Private Sydney Sumner, had disappeared during intense shellfire on July 9. For two months no trace of him could be found. “Dear Sir”, his wife wrote to Tolkien in hope and despair, “I would not care if only I knew how he went”, and she added, “I know that they cannot all be saved to come home.”
Sumner had left a one-year-old daughter at home. His name is on the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing: a memorial with more than 73,335 names on it. No one of those men was ever identified amid the cruel carnage of the battlefield, another facet of Tolkien's “animal horror” of the trenches.
On October 21 Tolkien was again in the front line with his signallers, following the first wave of infantrymen, who captured the German trench in front of them. During the attack, a German shell hit one of his signallers. Another rescued the signaller's pigeon basket. On the following day the battalion chaplain, Captain Evers, who had disappeared during the fighting, returned to the British lines covered in blood. He has spent the night in No-Man's Land, under German artillery fire, tending the wounded.
On October 26, while in reserve, Tolkien's battalion was inspected by Sir Douglas Haig. The next day Tolkien was taken ill. He had contracted “trench fever”, a bacterium in the bloodstream, through the burrowing of the ever-active lice. He was not to see active service again.
On November 18, the final day of the Battle of the Somme, Tolkien was struck off his battalion's strength and evacuated to Britain. He was never to forget his five months on the Somme. In “The Lord of the Rings”, Sam Gangee – the fictional character of whom Tolkien said that he was “a reflection of the English soldiers, of the privates and batmen I knew in the 1914 war, and recognized as so far superior to myself” – trips, “catching his foot in some old root or tussock. He fell and came heavily on his hands, which sank into the sticky ooze, so that his face was brought close to the surface of the dark mere. There was a faint hiss, a noisome smell went up…. Wrenching his hands out of the bog, he sprang back with a cry. ‘There are dead things, dead faces in the water,' he said with horror.”
I feel proud to have told the story of a battle of which Tolkien was my first eye-witness.

High school students who have been rehearsing a live nativity scene as part of their annual Christmas Spectacular are now scrambling to rework the show — sans Mary and baby Jesus — after a federal judge issued an order to nix the religious reenactment from the show.
STORY: Santa, Jesus Booted Off Courthouse Lawn
But for a public school to have planned to perform a nativity scene in the first place is “really out there,” Annie Laurie Gaylor, co-president of the Freedom From Religion Foundation, tells Yahoo Parenting. The national organization joined the ACLU of Indiana in filing a lawsuit against Concord High School in Elkhart, Ind., on behalf of an unnamed, non-Christian family that complained about the religious scene. “It's the kind of thing you'd expect in a Catholic school or private school or something out of the '50s, but not today,” Gaylor says. “This had our jaws dropping.”
STORY: Mall's Santa Display Sparks Outcry
The inclusion of the scene was “so egregious,” she explains, and the show so close to happening — it's scheduled to be performed this Friday — that the organization asked the court for a temporary injunction, which was granted on Wednesday by U.S. District Court Judge Jon DeGuilio. “The living nativity scene impermissibly conveys an endorsement of religion and thus runs afoul of the Establishment Clause,” DeGuilio noted in his decision, referring to the First Amendment clause that forbids government from establishing an official religion and from favoring one religion over another.

“Holiday celebrations that proselytize students are inappropriate in public schools,” Heather L. Weaver, ACLU senior staff attorney, said in a statement. “Today's ruling makes that clear and ensures that all students and families, regardless of faith or belief, will feel welcome at Concord High's winter concert.”
The Concord Community Schools district responded to the ruling through a press statement, released on Wednesday, from superintendent John Trout. “Concord Community Schools is disappointed in the decision rendered today by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana,” it reads. “The Concord High School music department is working overtime to insure [sic] that this year's Christmas Spectacular performance complies with the Court's order. Additionally, Concord Community Schools is presently researching the possible appeal of the Court's preliminary injunction. A decision on whether to take that step will be made in the next few days.”
Issues similar to this one come up annually around holiday time. In 2013, some parents and students were upset when a New York school decided to omit all religious references from “Silent Night” for a performance by fifth-graders. And this year so far, the word “Christmas” has been banned from school flyers in a New Hampshire town, and a judge ordered a nativity scene — along with a Christmas tree and Santa decorations — be removed from an Arkansas courthouse lawn. And while some decry such events as small battles in a “war on Christmas,” Gaylor calls the pushback “a war against separation of Church and state.”
Concord High School has performed its Christmas Spectacular — inspired by the Radio City holiday show in New York City — every year since 1970. It has included the living nativity scene “for at least the last twenty seven years, and likely the last forty five,” the judge's order reads, calling out that continuity as part of the problem. “The fact that this segment has remained constant while the other portions have changed or rotated could itself suggest a preference for that segment and its message,” he writes. “In addition, until this year, every show has included a narration by a faculty member that includes readings from the Bible of the story of Jesus's birth. … The religious and Christian message conveyed by those performances with both the live nativity scene and the Biblical narration is unmistakable.”
“The old dinosaurs are dying off, and the new sports fans are more than willing to accept soccer,” said Phil Schoen, an announcer who was hired by beIN Sport after stints at ESPN and GolTV. “It's not just the ethnics, soccer moms and urban singles. To make such a commitment really says something about how beIN Sport feels about the future of the sport in this country.”
BeIN Sport declined to make available any executives to speak on the record about its broader strategy.
Initially, beIN Sport may cause headaches for United States soccer fans. So far, the network is carried only on DirecTV and Dish, the country's two largest satellite television providers, and Comcast , the country's largest cable network. But in many cases, customers will have to pay several dollars more a month to subscribe to an extra sports package that includes beIN Sport, which only a small fraction of customers does.
While beIN Sport is rushing to sign other distribution deals, it may be months if not years before fans throughout the country can see the network in their homes. Until then, many fans will have to find a local bar to see the American national team play World Cup qualifying games on the road, including matches against Jamaica in Kingston on Sept. 7 and in Antigua on Oct. 12.
Quickly, beIN Sport has upended the sports television landscape. The network is committed to covering international sports like soccer, rugby, volleyball and track and field. In that sense, it is unlikely to rival ESPN, CBS or the other major American networks that pay billions of dollars to carry baseball, football and basketball.
But in spending heavily for the rights to Europe's top soccer leagues and some of the United States national team's games, beIN Sport threatens to dominate a fast-growing market populated by Fox Sports , ESPN and GolTV. That is bad news for those networks, but great news for soccer teams, leagues and federations.

According to one television executive, beIN paid twice as much as what GolTV had paid to broadcast La Liga, the top Spanish soccer league. BeIN Sport has reportedly paid Comcast to be carried to the cable company's 22 million television subscribers, rather than being paid by Comcast, the way ESPN and Fox are. BeIN Sport also paid well above market rates for the rights to the United States World Cup qualifiers.

“There is a maxim that a small distributor will pay more for rights than a large one because it means more to them,” said Neal H. Pilson, a former president of CBS Sports who is a consultant. “In a world with thousands of channels, live sports are a means of growing an existing business or launching a new business.”
Mr. Schoen, beIN Sport's new announcer, said he was unaware whether his new employer would try to acquire the United States rights to England's Premier League when they come up for bid. Industry executives expect those rights to fetch twice as much as what Fox paid for them three years ago, or far more if beIN Sport joins the bidding.

“If the soccer industry in the U.S. remains a business driven by economics, I think everyone will be successful,” said Rodrigo Lombello, the chief operating officer of GolTV, which was outbid by beIN Sport for the United States rights to Spain's top league games. “But if the industry is going to be a toy for the sheik from Qatar, then I don't know what will happen.”
Fox, which now broadcasts Premier League games in the United States, is eager to defend its turf, especially after spending heavily to win the rights to broadcast the World Cups in 2018 and 2022. Losing the Premier League, the world's most popular, would be a blow.
Fox argues that it is a better fit for the Premier League than beIN Sport because it can broadcast games to most homes in America, not just a few million homes that buy special sports packages. Last season, Fox set viewership records when it showed Premier League matches on Sundays while other networks were broadcasting N.F.L. games.
“Bottom line, there's always been competition in this field,” said David Nathanson, the general manager of Fox Soccer. “It just so happens that as the sport of soccer has grown in the U.S., you're bound to have more players interested in it. But we're the only dedicated English-language soccer network today, so it plays to our strength.”
Longer term, the question many television executives are asking is what Al Jazeera and the Qataris hope to accomplish with beIN Sport. Are they trying to tap the seemingly unending interest in soccer and sports? Are they trying to promote Qatar ahead of the World Cup in 2022? Or do they want to use beIN Sport as a wedge to get cable and satellite providers to carry Al Jazeera's news channel, which has had trouble getting carried in the United States because, some suggest, of the hostility to the network's programming?
BeIN Sport is careful to note that it operates independently of Al Jazeera's news division and, thus far, has focused only on buying sports rights. But other networks have used sports to promote their other programming. Nearly two decades ago, Fox shocked the sports world when it paid top dollar to show the N.F.L. Despite early losses, Fox gained wider coverage for its broadcast network.
Al Jazeera may be trying to pull a page from Fox's playbook. Some industry executives say that while the Qataris are perceived to have limitless resources, they may be doing what other networks have done before them: spending heavily to break into a crowded market.
“My experience is they are more economically driven than you would think and they have a very westernized philosophy,” said Rob Tilliss, a sports consultant who advises clients in the Middle East .

The common perception that cable operators are reluctant to do business with Al Jazeera is incorrect, he said. “It's a commercial relationship, and the more I go over there, the more I realize that,” he said. “At the end of the day, their objectives are basically the same.”
A Boston man was sentenced to nearly five years in prison Friday for selling guns stolen from the U.S. Army Reserve Center in Worcester, Massachusetts.
According to a statement from the U.S. attorney's office in Massachusetts, 29-year-old Tyrone James was sentenced Friday in federal court to 57 months in prison and 36 months of supervised release.
In Jan. 2016, James and co-defendants Ashely Bigsbee and James Morales were indicted on charges of conspiracy to possess, store and sell stolen firearms, possession and sale of stolen firearms, as well as lying to federal agents. James, who was also charged with possessing a firearm while being a felon, pleaded guilty to all charges in December 2016.
The crime went down on the night of Nov. 14, 2015, when co-defendant James Morales allegedly stole six M-4 Carbines and ten M-11 semi-automatic handguns from the Lincoln Stoddard United States Army Reserve Center.
Morales then asked James and co-defendant Bigsbee to help him sell the firearms the following morning. Both Bigsbee and James agreed to sell the stolen guns.
James and Bigsbee then contacted potential buyers via text message, offering to sell the guns for prices much lower than their street and market values. Recovered text messages and pictures proved these efforts, showing the stolen weapons in their Dorchester apartment.
Bigsbee has already been sentenced to 21 months in prison, while Morales is scheduled for trial in April.
An Army war hero turned whistleblower told Congress Thursday that the military retaliated against him for talking to Congress about his plan to trade one Taliban warlord for at least six American and Canadian hostages, including Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.
Ultimately, the State Department insisted on a deal to free the Taliban five for just Bergdahl, and rejected his plans to secure the release of more hostages.
Lt. Col. Jason Amerine testified Thursday before the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. Amerine is a Green Beret who the Army had treated as a war hero for his role in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, and who later helped the military promote recruitment through media appearances.
He told the panel he was well into a plan to try to win the release of at least six Americans and Canadians. Aside from Bergdahl, Amerine was hoping to free Caitlin Coleman, who vanished in Afghanistan while pregnant in the fall of 2012, and her Canadian husband Josh Boyle. Coleman had a baby while in captivity.
Another hostage was Collin Rutherford, a tourist captured by the Taliban in late October 2010, and there was another hostage that Amerine declined to name. Previous media reports identify that hostage as Warren Weinstein, a U.S. Agency for International Development worker held for years who President Obama recently announced was accidentally killed along with an Italian aid worker in a CIA drone strike in Pakistan in January.
Amerine said his office at the Pentagon "was working every initiative possible" to get the hostages home when "we saw that no one else" was trying to do so.
The Obama administration has faced a firestorm of criticism in its handling of U.S. hostage policies and communications with their family members. Amerine's communications with Rep. Duncan Hunter's office, R-Calif., and others on Capitol Hill, has led to media scrutiny of administration's handling of prisoners held overseas and contributed to the White House's decision to launch a review of those recovery efforts, according to Hunter's office.
Amerine testified Thursday that he and other members of his Pentagon office lured a Taliban warlord to the U.S. under "a false promise of safe passage and basically unsealed an indictment and put him in jail for life."
The office was hoping to leverage the warlord's release for those six Americans and Canadians and had reached out to a Taliban tribe "that we believed could free the hostages."
"We made a lot of progress on it," he told the committee. "But in the end, when the Taliban came to the table, the State Department basically said it must be the 5 for 1 and that was the only viable option we have."
Amerine decided to speak with Hunter about his plan. After speaking to Amerine, Hunter filed a complaint to the Pentagon's inspector general alleging a questionable ransom the U.S. government possibly paid for Bergdahl's release.
Amerine said complaints then surfaced that he was sharing sensitive information with Hunter.
Hunter and Amerine were quite open with their concerns, and at one point, the California Republican even set up a meeting between Amerine's office and the FBI to discuss civilian hostage plans. After that meeting, Amerine said, the FBI responded by contacting Coleman's father and threatening them not to speak to Hunter again or they would stop getting any FBI support to find their daughter.
"I mean just an atrocious treatment of family." Amerine said. "So the FBI complained to the Army and for reasons to be seen there was a bit of debate within the Army on whether I actually did anything wrong … that led to an investigation."
After the meeting with the FBI, Amerine says the Army suspended his security clearance, removed him from his job, launched a criminal investigation, canceled his retirement orders and is in the process of trying to court-martial him.
After the Army canceled his retirement orders, he says his pay stopped briefly as well. But Amerine argues that he was exercising his constitutional right to serve as a whistleblower.
Asked about the testimony Thursday afternoon, the White House declined to talk about specific hostage cases but defended its overall commitment to seeking the return of those held overseas.
"The president has talked extensively about the great lengths that the U.S. government has gone to try to secure the safe return of hostages overseas," Earnest said, noting that Obama has authorized U.S. Special Forces operations in Syria and Yemen to try to rescue Americans held by terrorist networks.
"I think that is an indication that the president is willing to take some big risks…I think that is a pretty clear demonstration of the president and this country's commitment" to winning the safe return of American hostages, he said.
Earnest also noted that the Obama administration is reviewing its hostage policies, which could help make the government "more effective in leveraging all of our assets to bring these hostages home."
"I would anticipate we would have some more details soon," he said.
One thing that recent Stanley Cup winners have in common is dominance on the scoreboard both in the regular season and in the playoffs. With a +77 goal differential, and the best record in games decided by two or more (excluding empty netters) in the regular season, the Vancouver Canucks have the regular season part down cold. The playoffs, however, are a different story. Just one win away from a Stanley Cup victory, the Canucks have a -4 goal differential and a rather poor 3-4 record in games decided by at least two goals (excluding empty netters). Is this kind of thing common?
No sir. The chart below shows the goal differential for each Cup winner since the league went to the four best-of-seven series format for the 1986-87 season, as well as the goal differential for this year's Canucks and Bruins
If the Bruins come back to win the series, they'll be solidly in the middle of the pack, but the Canucks are a real outlier, currently sitting 17 goals behind the next closest team, and the only club in the table with a negative goal differential. It's just... odd. But also kind of great because now we know that even if the Canucks manage to pull out a victory tomorrow night, we can sleep easy knowing that they'll be one of the the worst Cup champions ever along with that deplorable Carolina squad from 2005-06, the Pronger Ducks, and Patrick Roy's miracle Canadiens.
More seriously, just look at all of those post-lockout teams near the bottom. One of the things the league was hoping to accomplish with the lockout was greater parity, and these numbers seem to suggest that that has been accomplished. If the Canucks do go on to win, six of the seven post-lockout seasons will take six of the bottom seven spots with the 2007-08 Red Wings being the lone club to buck the trend.
Hey Jets, this is Bruce Ellington, your newest receiver. (AP)
You have to feel for New York Jets fans.
The organization hasn't made the playoffs since 2011 and at this point might be better known for the now infamous “butt fumble” than any success it has had since Super Bowl III. Their roster looks so bad for this season, everyone thinks they're tanking.

The team even had troubles identifying its newest acquisition.
After claiming 25-year-old wide receiver Bruce Ellington off of waivers from the San Francisco 49ers, the Jets tweeted out a picture of their newest addition. No harm done and a good way to keep fans up to speed right? Think again.
In a move that can aptly be described as “Jetsy,” the picture wasn't actually of Ellington, but someone from the Arizona Cardinals. It wasn't even Cardinals running back Andre Ellington, which would have been somewhat understandable. Rather, the Jets announced the move and tweeted out a picture of Brittan Golden, a 29-year-old wideout with the Arizona Cardinals who has 223 yards receiving to his name in four NFL seasons.
Naturally, the Jets have since deleted the tweet, but the power of screenshots will ensure it lives on forever.

The Jets got it right later on Friday, with a picture of their new receiver.
OK, one more time… We've claimed WR Bruce Ellington off waivers and waived/injured TE Brian Parker. pic.twitter.com/G86bvgZZpl — New York Jets (@nyjets) August 4, 2017
Maybe the Ellington faux pas will be a good distraction – at least until Gang Green starts playing actual football games, that is.

Service tax net widened: New rules mean filmstars' income from promotional adverts will take on new levy
The new service tax regime that kicked in on July 1 has cast the net much wider - from including sportspersons earning match fees and prize money exceeding Rs 10 lakh to filmstars who make big bucks from promotional ads and events.
So, B-town's money-spinners such as Shah Rukh Khan who is the brand ambassador for Tag Heuer, Pepsi's new face Ranbir Kapoor, Garnier girl Priyanka Chopra and Katrina Kaif who appears in the hot Slice ad will now have to shell out the dough for their sideshows as well.
A senior official finance ministry confirmed to Mail Today that filmstars will be taxed on advertising and promotional activities.
Actor Shah Rukh Khan models for a Tag Heuer advertising campaign
These events will bracketed in a separate category from their roles in films which are already subjected to income tax, the official revealed on Wednesday.
The fresh set of rules will come as a double whammy for top cricketers like M.S. Dhoni, Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli because they are likely to pay a part of their match fees as well as that of the hefty amounts collected by endorsing a slew of products.
A 12.36 per cent service tax will now be levied on all players – men and women – who earn more than Rs 10 lakh from match fees (this includes prize or award money). Coaches, match referees, umpires and other support staff of teams earning above Rs 10 lakh annually will also be taxed.
Katrina Kaif poses provocatively with a mango slice
Even commentators will come under the ambit of the changed rules. Furthermore, all experts – coaches, physiotherapists, trainers, etc – hired on contract by the BCCI's National Cricket Academy in Bangalore will be similarly taxed.
The BCCI will pay service tax on behalf of the boards of various countries and foreign players and team support staff who play in the Indian Premier League as well as the Champions League T20 under the 'reverse charge mechanism'.
The government has also changed the definition of a 'recognised sports body'. According to a presentation made by BCCI tax consultant S.S. Gupta at a workshop organised for the board's affiliated units recently, six types of 'recognised sports bodies' exist under the changed definition.
They are: (a) the Indian Olympic Association (b) the Sports Authority of India (c) national sports federations recognised by the ministry of youth affairs and sports and its affiliate federations (d) national sports promotion organisations recognised by the sports ministry (e) the International Olympic Committee (IOC) or a federation recognised by the IOC (f) a federation or a body that regulates a sport at the international level.
But there are several grey areas and the sports federations have asked their tax consultants to seek clarity from the government. BCCI vice-president Niranjan Shah said the board had sought clarifications from the government because many aspects were clouded in ambiguity.
The BCCI will pay service tax on behalf of the boards of various countries and foreign players and team support staff who play in the Indian Premier League as well as the Champions League T20 under the 'reverse charge mechanism'
The Indian cricket board, All India Football Federation (AIFF), Hockey India and the Athletic Federation of India (AFI) were now in the process of the ascertaining which areas will become under the new regime. Hockey India secretary-general Narinder Batra, one of the few vastly experienced persons who manage both hockey and cricket, told Mail Today: 'In hockey, the variation in budget limited.
But we still pay Rs 10,000 to 32 junior men players and 32 junior women to take care of their shoes and kits. Additionally, we provide expensive kits for goalkeepers.
We are not clear on whether we will have to pay service tax on this, too. I have asked our adviser to get a clear picture from the government.'
'We are also trying to find out whether service tax will be imposed on events or retainership category. Another problem is that while the government says all players will have to pay service tax online, many cannot handle the computer,' he said.
AIFF general secretary Kushal Das, too, was not very sure about how the new rules would work out.
'We don't pay match fees to football players when they turn out for the country; only bonuses for winning titles. Players are contracted with clubs, so their income is from clubs,' Das told Mail Today.
Athletics Federation of India (AFI) secretary C.K. Valson was confused as well, but he blamed his ignorance on his foreign trip.
'I am not very sure about the service tax as I was away to Kazakhstan and have just returned. I will find out about it,' he said. Earlier, service tax was applicable on only services specified under the Finance Act, 1994.
Services rendered by sportspersons were not a specified service and, therefore, did not fall in this tax bracket.
There was a 'positive list' that contained names of the items that were not taxed. Now, the government has come out with a 'negative list' that contains the items that are exempted from the new service tax. Most services, with the exception of the 38 that figure in the negative list, turned costlier from July 1.
In fields other than sports, coaching classes and training institutions will come under the service net. But the tax will not be levied on school, college and university education as well as on approved vocational courses.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Steven Woolfe has written a report on reducing net migration
Unskilled migrants should be stopped from moving to Britain for five years to help reduce net migration, a report by a pro-Brexit group has said.
Leave Means Leave, which is backed by senior Tory backbenchers, says the measure would help get net migration below 50,000.
It is currently running at 273,000 a year.
Anti-Brexit campaigners said such a move would cause skills shortages that would damage business and the NHS.
Leave Means Leave wants to combine the Australian points-based system with plans for work permits which would come into force after the UK has left the European Union.
The report is authored by independent MEP Steven Woolfe, who quit UKIP following an altercation with a colleague that left him in hospital.
In a speech on Monday, Mr Woolfe will say: "We need an immigration system that is fair, flexible and forward-thinking.
"It must be fair in its outlook, flexible in practice and forward-thinking for our economy.
"Brexit is not about splendid isolation - it's about re-engaging with the world, without our wings clipped by the European Union."
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Anti-Brexit campaigners stage a protest at Westminster last month
But he said introducing "strict controls, an annual cap and a five-year freeze on unskilled migrants" would "reduce net migration year-on-year, lessen the strain on our public services and help build a more cohesive society".
Asked on Sky News about claims his plan would deliver a huge blow to the UK economy, he said that view was based on the idea of a mass exodus of migrants which he did not believe would happen, adding that his plan would lead to a more gentle reduction.
Conservative former Cabinet minister Owen Paterson, a member of Leave Means Leave, said the "overwhelming majority of Britons feel absolutely no resentment towards workers or students from overseas".
But he added: "Mass migration at its current level has fostered resentment, depressed wages and placed an excessive burden on our public services."
The report was condemned by members of the cross-party Open Britain group.
Conservative MP Anna Soubry said: "We have seen encouraging signs from the prime minister that she accepts and understands the reality facing British business - they will continue to need overseas workers for years to come.
"Migrant workers contribute to our economy and to British culture - we should be welcoming them in the traditional spirit of British tolerance.
Image copyright Conservative Party Image caption Anna Soubry says UK businesses need migrant workers
"Leave Means Leave clearly don't understand why British business relies on migrant workers."
Labour's Pat McFadden said the prime minister faced a choice between going "down the road advocated by this kind of plan" or taking a "more realistic and honest approach to the Brexit negotiations on immigration and other matters".
Under the Leave Means Leave plan, there would be no cap on highly skilled workers, entrepreneurs or investors but unskilled visas would be halted for five years.
Work permits would only be granted if the applicant had a job offer with a minimum £35,000 salary and had passed an English language test, signed a five-year private health insurance contract and had savings in the bank.
Up to 50,000 temporary work permits would be issued initially for agricultural workers, tapering off to zero by the third year.
There would be no restrictions on the numbers of students who wanted to head to the UK.
Exemptions would be made for health workers if they were needed from overseas but the report says the focus should be on increasing the number of Britons working in the medical profession.
EU nationals already settled in the UK would have the right to remain indefinitely as long as Brussels adopted the same approach to UK citizens living in Europe, the report says.
But the government should immediately announce a cut-off date for when new arrivals stop qualifying, it added.
We may not have visited personally, but from​ the 1960s to now, humanity has sent dozens of probes to our planetary neighbors.​
From Popular Mechanics
The solar system is big. It may stretch out up to a light year across, depending on the outer boundary of the Oort Cloud. But considering it's barely been 50 years since humanity has launched objects into space, it's amazing where we've been able to explore: all nine classical planets, comets, asteroids, and more. Five probes are on exit routes out of the solar system, two having entered interstellar space beyond the sun's stronger influences.
Pop Chart Lab created this poster, due to ship March 22 for $38, to celebrate that exploration, showing each and every probe that's prodded the worlds in the first three zones of our solar system. With Pluto and Ceres explored as of last year, there's just the Kuiper Belt and maybe planet nine up ahead.
It's amazing to see the details sussed out. For instance, the Earth system, Mars, and Venus have plenty of probes, and Jupiter and Saturn have a decent handful. On the other hand, Uranus and Neptune look a little lonely out there, and Mercury has only been visited a few times. It's also impressive to see the breadth of exploration of small objects, especially comets and asteroids.
The coming years may bring a Europa lander, a visit to a new Kuiper Belt Object via the New Horizons Pluto probe, chatter of a mission to one of the "ice giants" of Uranus or Neptune, and maybe a human landing on Mars. In the meantime, this is a great way to see how much we've accomplished since the late 1950s.

Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The mother of computer hacker Gary McKinnon is to stand for election in Jack Straw's Blackburn constituency. Janis Sharp, who lives in Hertfordshire, said she blamed the justice secretary for pushing through the extradition treaty with the US. Under the treaty, her son, from Wood Green in London, could be sent to the US for trial. But defence lawyers say an assessment of his actions has to take into account his Asperger's syndrome. Mr McKinnon is accused of breaking into military computer systems. A spokesman for Mr Straw said it was right that people with differing views were able to stand in the election. He said: "In a democracy, it is right that people are able to stand in elections and put their case. "I am sure there will be lots of views heard over the next few weeks and it is good that people are able to do that." Ms Sharp, from Hertfordshire, who intends to stand as an independent candidate, said she believed Labour was responsible for eroding civil liberties. I don't expect to get in but I feel civil liberties need a voice
Janis Sharp "Jack Straw led us to believe the extradition treaty would only be used for terrorists, but it is not being used for this," she said. "Once these things are brought in, we don't know where they will go next. It's very frightening." Last year, the Labour government defended extradition laws with the US saying it had simplified the rules while still protecting the rights of suspects. The Conservatives have said the law was not being used, as intended, to fight terrorism, and the Liberal Democrats said that cases such as Mr McKinnon's "underlined the injustice" of the treaty. In July 2009, home secretary Alan Johnson said the government had to act in accordance with the law, which it believed provided sufficient safeguards. Extradition battles The computer systems allegedly hacked into by Mr McKinnon, 44, include those at the Pentagon and, if convicted, he faces 60 years in prison. He claims he was seeking evidence of UFOs. Mr McKinnon's lawyers and family have fought a series of long-running court battles in an attempt to avoid his extradition claiming that his Asperger's syndrome accounts for many aspects of his behaviour. He has claimed in the past that he was looking for evidence of UFOs. A judicial review of that decision will be heard at the High Court at the end of May. Ms Sharp, who said she had voted Labour in the past, said it was time for people to "vote with their heads, not with their habits". She also said she did not believe she had any chance of winning the Blackburn seat, but felt she wanted to make a stand. "I don't expect to get in but I feel civil liberties need a voice," she said.

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Thursday boldly reversed an Obama-era policy that supporters said had helped lower prices for some costly drugs.
The policy centers on so-called biosimilar drugs, which are highly similar versions of biologic drugs manufactured in living cells or microorganisms. The Obama administration designed certain Medicare payments to encourage more price competition among those biosimilar drugs. Trump's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will reverse that policy beginning Jan. 1, 2018.
The reversal is a win for big drug companies and manufacturers, who had been urging the Trump administration to revise the policy — and to do so quickly. They have said the policy would discourage new innovation in the nascent biosimilar market, ultimately driving up prices.

But Obama officials who helped draft the current policy have defended it as a clear way to force competition among an expensive category of drugs.
The Biosimilars Forum, which represents Amgen, Merck, Samsung Bioepis, Boehringer Ingelheim, Pfizer, and other companies, said it was “delighted” by the change.
“A robust U.S. marketplace is critical for American patients and even more important when one considers the costs (sic) savings potential that they represent,” Stacie Phan, who heads the group, said in a statement.
The Trump administration agreed.
“By encouraging innovation and greater manufacturer participation in the marketplace, we believe that this policy change will result in the licensing of more biosimilar products, thus creating a stable and robust market, driving competition and decreasing uncertainty about access and payment,” the agency wrote in a fact sheet about the new regulation.
In essence, the policy would have Medicare pay for biosimilars in much the way it pays for branded and generic drugs administered by doctors.
Medicare reimburses doctors for what is known as the average sales price of most drugs administered by doctors. That average sales price takes into account the manufacturer price of both the branded drug and any available generics — plus an extra 4.3 percent.
It's an approach that incentivizes clinicians to buy less expensive drugs, since they'll only be reimbursed with the average sales price. Manufacturers hoping to entice doctors to use their drugs, in turn, will lower their prices to compete.
Biologic drugs, however, are treated differently. Each biologic drug gets its own pricing category, plus 4.3 percent, by statute. There's no average — meaning there are fewer price competition incentives.
The Obama-era policy grouped all biosimilars into the same category — returning some of that price competition to the biosimilar industry, if not the biologic market. Under the Trump proposal, beginning Jan. 1, each biosimilar will get its own pricing category, like biologics.
CMS is reversing the policy more quickly and less transparently than a typical regulatory change requires. Though earlier this year the agency solicited public comments on the Obama-era policy, it did not give advance notice of its intent to reverse the policy.
Even in the new regulation, CMS warned that all of its systems won't be ready to accommodate the change by the time it goes into effect.
“Completion of these changes, which will require changes to the claims processing systems, is planned to occur as soon as feasible, but should not be expected to be complete by January 1, 2018,” the agency wrote in the regulation.
The agency said it expects the updates to be in place by mid-2018.
Malawian women protest over 'trouser attacks'
Women held up a sign saying: "Real men don't bother women"

Hundreds of people have protested in Blantyre in Malawi about attacks on women for wearing trousers.
Some women were this week beaten and stripped by vendors on the streets of the capital, Lilongwe, and Blantyre for not wearing traditional dress.
A BBC reporter says women wore trousers and mini-skirts to the demonstration to show their outrage.
President Bingu wa Mutharika has said on national radio that women had the right to wear what they want.
He denied reports that he had ordered women to stop wearing trousers, and ordered anyone harassing women to be arrested.
Until 1994, women in the deeply conservative southern African country were banned from wearing trousers or mini-skirts under the autocratic rule of Hastings Banda.
Men were also banned from having long hair.
Women have also been attacked for wearing trousers in Kenya, South Africa and Zimbabwe in recent years.
'Abominable'

The BBC's Raphael Tenthani in Blantyre says Vice-President Joyce Banda, the gender minister, several MPs, church leaders, university lecturers and other activists attended Friday's protest.
One sign was held up during the gathering with the words: "Real men don't bother women" and some of the women wore white T-shirts saying: "Vendor: Today I buy from you, tomorrow you undress me?"
"The reason why I'm here is because I'm in total disbelief that in the year 2012 women are being stripped naked," Ms Banda told the BBC at the vigil.
Speaker after speaker condemned the harassment of women, saying Malawi could not afford to turn back the clock, our correspondent says.

"Trousers and mini-skirts for most women in Malawi are a symbol for our hard-won freedom from the one-party dictatorship to the multiparty era," one woman said.
"Therefore it has been a shock... that 18 years after that multiparty [era began] we can sit here and talk about women being undressed in town. It's abominable."
Our correspondent says men and boys also attended the event where there was dancing and singing, with the Bob Marley classic No Woman No Cry getting the loudest cheers.
A vendors' representative at the protest, Innocent Mussa, was booed off the stage by the women, he says.
"I'm ashamed to be associated with the stripping naked of innocent women," Mr Mussa told the crowd.
"Those were acts of thugs, because a true vendor would want to sell his wares to women, he can't be harassing potential customers," he said.
Seodi White, a lawyer and leading women's rights activist and protest organiser, said the women were being targeted by disaffected youth unhappy with the economic situation.
"Is this really about culture or something else in terms of economic hardship people are looking for an outlet to vent on?," she told the BBC's Network Africa programme.
Earlier, Mrs Banda also blamed the attacks on economic woes in Malawi, where there are severe shortages of fuel and foreign currency at present.
"There is so much suffering that people have decided to vent their frustrations on each other," the vice-president said.
Last year, the UK and other donors cut aid to Malawi, amid criticism of its economic policies and its attitude to the opposition and journalists.
President Mutharika on Thursday made a nationwide broadcast, calling for an end to the attacks.
"I will not allow anyone to... go on the streets and start undressing women and girls wearing trousers, because that is illegal," he said.
"You are free to wear what you want. Women who want to wear trousers should do so, as you will be protected from thugs, vendors and terrorists."

Venezuela clamps down further on dissent amid deepening economic woes Read more
In a further deterioration of diplomatic ties between Venezuela and the US, President Nicolás Maduro announced on Saturday that he will curb the number of US diplomats allowed to work in the country and will impose mandatory visas for Americans travelling to the socialist nation.
Maduro also said that any meetings between US diplomats and Venezuelans would have to be “authorised” by the Venezuelan government.
The president said he decided to require visas for US citizens after the capture of an American pilot of Latin American descent in the state of Táchira, in western Venezuela. He said the pilot, whom he did not identify, was suspected of spying – though he did not provide details.
Maduro has accused the US of working with groups critical of his government to plot a coup against him, charges Washington has denied.
“Conspirator meetings are over,” Maduro said in a public speech marking the anniversary of street riots in 1989, known as the Caracazo, that left as many as 3,000 dead.
As he announced the measures, a cheering crowd clad mostly in red chanted: “Maduro, Maduro, hit the Yankee hard.”
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 2010.
In addition, Maduro named US politicians who would be barred from entering the country. The list included former president George W Bush, former vice-president Dick Cheney, former CIA director George Tenet and several lawmakers who have been critical of the Venezuelan government.
“We will prohibit visas for individuals who want to come to Venezuela who have violated human rights and have bombed Iraq, Syria and Vietnam,” said Maduro.
US says Joe Biden is not plotting to overthrow Venezuela's president Read more
The move was made in retaliation for targeted sanctions imposed by the US against Venezuelan officials and their immediate family members who are deemed responsible for human rights abuses and corruption. The sanctions include denying visas and freezing US-held bank accounts.
Carlos Romero, an international relations analyst in Caracas, said the measures announced by Maduro were extreme and would likely bring some sort of reciprocal measure from the US.
“We are entering a new phase of already deteriorating relations that is much more negative,” he said, warning that the next step may be a severing of diplomatic ties altogether.
“This is going to snowball,” Romero predicted.
The announcement of the diplomatic sanctions came on the same day that four American missionaries who were detained for questioning earlier in the week were released and headed home.

It also coincided with a day of marches of both government supporters and supporters of the opposition, who denounced the arrest on 19 February of Caracas mayor Antonio Ledezma, on charges of plotting a coup along with two other opposition leaders who called on Maduro to step down and pave the way for a transitional government.
Venezuela's government is battling growing discontent among its 30 million citizens over food shortages and spiralling inflation, while the price of Venezuelan crude – the country's lifeblood – continues to fall.

Director David Fincher's Gone Girl is my most anticipated film from the rest of 2014. I like Gillian Flynn's book well enough, but it seems to be a fantastic foundation on which Fincher could build something truly special. As the film's October 3rd release date looms closer, we've started hearing rumblings about what Fincher's adaptation entails, including more than a few mentions of the word “satire”. The filmmaker recently took part in an interview for the film in which he was candid about his tonal aspirations and why he cast Ben Affleck in the lead role.
Specifically, Fincher admits that Affleck's experience of being under public scrutiny was an invaluable resource for playing the character of Nick Dunne—a man who becomes the prime suspect in his wife's disappearance—and also discusses how the crux of the film is about “the idea of our collective narcissism as it relates to coupling.” Read on after the jump.
Speaking with Film Comment, Fincher talked about his decision to cast Affleck in the lead role and how the actor had no qualms about delving back into his life in the public eye:
“I enjoyed working with him immensely. The baggage he comes with is most useful to this movie. I was interested in him primarily because I needed someone who understood the stakes of the kind of public scrutiny that Nick is subjected to and the absurdity of trying to resist public opinion. Ben knows that, not conceptually, but by experience. When I first met with him, I said this is about a guy who gets his nuts in a vise in reel one and then the movie continues to tighten that vise for the next eight reels. And he was ready to play. It's an easy thing for someone to say, ‘Yeah, yeah, I'd love to be a part of that,' and then, on a daily basis, to ask: ‘Really? Do I have to be that foolish? Do I have to step in it up to my knees?' Actors don't like to be made the brunt of the joke. They go into acting to avoid that. Unlike comics, who are used to going face first into the ground. Nick is someone who has skated by on charm and has that as a deflection mechanism. And that's what crucifies him. And Ben got that.”
Fincher also discussed the tone of the movie, saying it walks the line between absurd and sincere:
“When I first met with [Affleck], we didn't have the script yet, but he'd read the book. I mentioned a National Lampoon record from the mid-Seventies called That's Not Funny, That's Sick. That's kind of the tone of the movie. If we play it too earnest and sincere, then it's tragedy, but if we go with the absurdity of it, I think it can walk a satirical line.”
The director also talked about the adaptation process, saying he honed in on a very specific aspect of the book that he wanted to focus on:
“The book is many things. You have to choose which aspect you want to make a movie from. Most interesting to me was the idea of our collective narcissism as it relates to coupling, or who we show to our would-be mates and who they show to us. It's the most absurdly honest part of the book and the newest thing in terms of what it illuminates about marriage and what may or not be going on behind closed doors.”
Fincher echoed previous comments made by Affleck about Gone Girl being an excellent date movie, saying couples may come out of the movie with sharply opposing viewpoints:
“I can't wait to see what will go on between couples at dinner after they see the movie. There are so many interesting tectonic shifts. When the people I've shown the movie come out of it, they are either Team Amy or Team Nick. Team Amy doesn't have a single quibble about her behavior, and Team Nick doesn't have any problems with his. Then there are people who primarily measure it against the book and how they felt about the characters in the book.”
With regards to how the film compares to the book, Fincher aptly describes it as a “deforestation”:
“And the narrative of the movie is vastly denuded from the way it's allowed to grow and bloom in the novel. It wasn't a defoliation as much as a deforestation. Once you got it back to the branches and the trunk, it was pretty easy to see that this movie was going to be about who we are and who we present to those we are endeavoring to seduce. And the absurdity of that difference needed to be part of the two-and-a-half-hour fabric in a much bigger way than in the novel. For me, the 30 percent of the novel that's about who we present—our narcissistic façades—becomes the entire foundation of the movie.”
And this is what I was expecting to see from Fincher's adaptation of the book. Not a simple by-the-numbers murder mystery, but a down and dirty portrait of a destructive marriage that illuminates some universal truth about relationships. October can't get here fast enough.
* I have several friends who live (or lived) in Austin, Texas. One of them told me on my last visit why he moved to Austin from San Antonio, just down the road.
In San Antonio, he said, the local government was always in your business. Unlike in Austin, everything was top-down. The town was just too involved with the art and music scene, to the point of dominance. Street festivals, he said, were organized from the top, which tended to prevent new ideas from emerging and kept old ideas in place long after their prime.
* Illinois, and particularly Chicago, have the very same problem. We're just way too top-down oriented here.
For a good example of how top-down we are, just look at the Chicago firestorm over food trucks. From January…
Six months after the city passed an ordinance placing new regulations on the industry granting truck owners the ability to prepare food inside their vehicles, only one of Chicago's 126 mobile food dispensers have received a license to cook on board. In other major cities, food trucks have been cooking fresh food onboard for years, according to local officials.
Austin, population 820,000, has over 1,000 food trucks. The market is probably over-saturated, but that's capitalism, man. Survival of the fittest.
* What does Mayor Emauel do to promote local music? He wants to develop special “entertainment districts.” There's nothing at all organic about that…
“If I were an artist, I would want to move anywhere else than Chicago,” [Paul Natkin, a longtime concert photographer and executive director of the Chicago Music Commission] said, explaining that he knew struggling artists who were fined for not having a business license under former Mayor Richard M. Daley. That sort of bureaucracy, he added, hurts the music industry as well. “Chicago's kind of known worldwide as one of the hardest places to get a license to open a business,” Natkin said. “It's a daunting task to open a venue or open up a record store — or any kind of business in Chicago.”
* In Springfield, where I now live, the mayor has opposed allowing downtown music festivals to stay open past 9:30 pm - on the weekends, for Pete's sake.
* And it's not just art and music. As Natkin noted above, it's difficult to start almost any business in Illinois, and it's very expensive to keep one going. Workers' comp costs are killing some of our employers, for example, but nothing is being done to deal with it. Yes, Mayor Emanuel has loosened countless goofy Chicago regulations. He's to be commended for that. More, please.
Our entrepreneurship rates are the 47th worst in the nation..
This is a huge problem and it absolutely has to be addressed. For the most part, we need to just get the heck out of the way.
* That being said, Gov. Rick Perry can bite me. His high-profile visit this week is basically just a publicity stunt, planned to coincide with a speech to a bioscience convention. Biotech is one of this state's major bright spots. From a Gov. Pat Quinn press release…
“The Economic Engine of Biotechnology in Illinois” shows the Midwest Super Cluster, which includes Illinois and the surrounding eight-state region, surpasses California and the East Coast in biotechnology-related employment, number of establishments and research and development expenditures. Its four key findings are: * Within the Midwest Super Cluster there are more than 16,800 biotechnology establishments employing more than 377,900 people. By comparison, California has 7,500 biotechnology establishments that employ 230,000 people, and the East Coast cluster employs 253,000 among its approximately 7,100 biotechnology establishments.
* The overall economic output of Illinois' biotechnology industry is more than $98.6 billion with 81,000 direct jobs and more than 3,500 biotechnology companies in the state. In fact, Illinois residents employed by biotechnology companies earn up to 91 percent more than the average Illinois resident. The biotechnology industry in Illinois has demonstrated the strongest revenue growth in recent years among all of the states analyzed in this [Ernst & Young LLP] study, an average annual growth of 13.3 percent.
* During the past decade, the top seven universities in Illinois have steadily increased their research and development expenditures, creating new opportunities for biotech startups. Expenditures have nearly doubled since 2001, growing from $727 million to more than $1.3 billion.
* The ability to secure early-stage funding is spurring innovation and growth among startup biotechnology companies in Illinois. Venture capital funding in Illinois has seen a 209 percent increase between 2009 and 2012.
Nurture, offer funding options if needed, deploy the universities where necessary and then get out of the way of the people who know what they're doing. We don't need to deregulate to the point where our fertilizer plants are exploding. But we need to let the people of this tremendous state put their fantastic minds to work on what they do best and stop being an impediment.

SAN DIEGO (CBS8) -- The Navy Marine Mammal Program (NMMP) is relocating its bottlenose dolphins out of sight of animal activists. Approximately 30 dolphin pens have been moved to an area previously used by the Navy off Point Loma near the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) facility.
SAN DIEGO (CBS8) -- The Navy Marine Mammal Program (NMMP) is relocating its bottlenose dolphins out of sight of animal activists. Approximately 30 dolphin pens have been moved to an area previously used by the Navy off Point Loma near the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) facility.
The documentary Blackfish publicly exposed Sea World's treatment of orcas and led to a shut down of the park's orca breeding program.
Now, there's new video showing “grayfish” on San Diego Bay: bottlenose dolphins in the Navy Marine Mammal Program.
Animal rights activists say the video shows the dolphins in medical distress and close to death in pens at the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) facility on Point Loma.
“They're very small pens. They say they're 30' by 30' by 12 feet deep. How would you like to spend your life in 30' by 30' by 12 feet?” said former dolphin trainer Russ Rector in a Skype interview from his home in Florida.
The video shows Navy contractors holding an IV solution bag over one dolphin while vets tend to the animal. Another clips show a staff member using a bag and tube to force-feed a dolphin food and/or fluids.
One dolphin is seen sitting in a pen for days harnessed into a flotation device to keep it from sinking underwater and drowning.
A local animal rights activist spent months recording the video from a bridge on North Harbor Drive overlooking the SPAWAR dolphin pens.
“I've got videotape of animals literally for hours floating around in those pens supported by flotation, not moving. That's not living. That's dying,” said Rector.
“My camera person, when she's out there people walk by and ask her, ‘What are you doing?' 'Oh, there are dolphins down there?' Most people don't even know they're there,” said Rector.
In fact, the grayfish have been there for decades; 85 bottle nose dolphins in all -- some born in captivity at the Point Loma SPAWAR facility, some born at Sea World under a breeding contract with the Navy.
Dozens more were captured from the wild and transported to San Diego Bay far away from their native waters in the Atlantic or the Gulf of Mexico.
“These animals are suffering,” said Rector. “When dolphins sit in pens and shiver and don't move and they're beating targets in front of it to get it to swim, they're just punishing the animal,” according to Rector.
The navy marine mammal program costs taxpayers more than $29 million per year, according to federal contracts issued by the Navy.
Civilian contractors with Science Applications International Corp. (SAIC) and the National Marine Mammal Foundation not only train the dolphins to detect underwater mines but also conduct medical research on the animals.
After viewing the grayfish video, CBS News 8 repeatedly asked the Navy if its dolphins were sick and/or dying. Officials declined our request to conduct an on-camera interview with one of the Navy's contracted marine mammal veterinarians.
Instead, SPAWAR Director of Public Affairs James Fallin issued a written statement confirming that one dolphin had been euthanized.
“Today (Tuesday, April 11), one of our eldest dolphins, a 46-year-old male named Makai, and one of our most celebrated veterans of the Iraq War, was peacefully and humanely put to rest. He was a beloved and accomplished member of the Navy Marine Mammal Program team, and an American hero who lived to be more than twice the average age of dolphins in the wild. Recently, Makai had been receiving critical care for ailments associated with old age,” the statement said.
Fallin did not respond to follow-up questions asking about the nature of the Makai's ailments, or questions inquiring about additional dolphin deaths at the SPAWAR facility.
David Phillips is the director of the International Marine Mammal Project in Berkeley. His nonprofit is calling on the Navy to retire its dolphins.
“I find it really shocking and disturbing that (the Navy) would try to characterize these dolphins as American heroes. The dolphins are not participating voluntarily and they're not necessary in any security setting now,” Phillips said.
Fallin said the Navy Marine Mammal Program provides state-of-the art veterinarian care and its dolphin program is accredited by a non-profit that inspects animal laboratories, the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC).
None of the AAALAC inspection records are public, however. The group did not respond to an email seeking comment and inspection reports.
SPAWAR has refused to release necropsy reports on its dead grayfish, citing a national security exemption. CBS News 8 currently has several pending FOIA requests for records and necropsies.
SPAWAR did release to CBS News 8 a summary sheet of Navy marine mammal training exercises, which took place over the past 18 months. The summary described exercises where Navy dolphins "cleared inert training mines" from shallow waters near San Clemente Island, Seal Beach, and San Diego harbor. The summary said the exercises were "critical to warfare readiness."
The Navy is required to report all marine mammal deaths within 30 days to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which keeps a Marine Mammal Inventory Report (MMIR) of all captive marine mammals in the nation, including those at SPAWAR. NOAA is preparing to post the entire MMIR online and admitted there were errors in the reports provided to CBS News 8 under a FOIA request.
SPAWAR Public Affairs issued the following written statement about its quality of animal care:
“Our veterinarians and handlers provide continuous, round-the-clock medical care and supervision to every one of our dolphins. Each and every one of our dolphins is fed a tailored diet that meets each of their own individual health requirements. Our veterinarian clinic is state-of-the-art, and is equipped with some of the most advanced medical equipment available. In point of fact, the Navy's Marine Mammal Program is in its sixth decade. We have become recognized experts at providing the full spectrum of husbandry and veterinary care, including pioneering work on geriatric care. We maintain the highest standards of care for our marine mammals, far exceeding what is required by federal regulations.”
Phillips, the International Marine Mammal Project director, said the Navy is hiding behind a veil of secrecy.
“They don't want to end the program because they like continuing it for the jobs and the people who are working with the dolphins. That shouldn't be allowed to dictate what happens to these dolphins,” Phillips said.
“These are animals are far ranging and deep diving and they're being kept in such small pens. It's not healthy. They're languishing there. They're dying,” said Phillips. “My view is that there is not a single dolphin in the Navy complex that wouldn't do far better in a seaside sanctuary retirement area.”
In the wake of CBS News 8's investigation, SPAWAR abruptly took down its entire Navy Marine Mammal Program web site detailing more than one thousand medical and technical studies conducted on its animals. A cached version can be found here.
The navy has long-term plans to retire its trained marine mammals and replace them with underwater robots.
Fallin, the SPAWAR spokesperson, said “while the long term goal remains to replace dolphins with machines, we are not there yet.”
The Navy also has 55 sea lions in its marine mammal program, trained to find and intercept underwater scuba divers.
Most of the dolphins and sea lions are kept in San Diego Bay but some are located in Kings Bay, Georgia and Bangor, Washington. The Navy won't say exactly how many animals are kept in each of the three locations.

President Sauli Niinistö signed stricter security policies into law Monday, making it illegal for unidentified military groups to cross the border and conduct activities in Finland as of today, Saturday.
The move is meant to tighten Finland's territorial integrity against a situation like that seen in Ukraine in 2014, when what Ukrainians coined "little green men" who claimed they were a local militia led an insurgency. The separatists seized government buildings and police stations, and held unrecognised status referendums. At least some of the unmarked men were largely understood to be from the Russian Army, although Moscow denied it.
The new Finnish law defines unidentified militia as an organised military group that is kitted out or armed, supported or encouraged by a foreign power and whose country of origin cannot be ascertained. It bans such groups outright from entering or residing in the country, making any violations punishable as a criminal act in the Criminal Code.
The Ministry of Defence says the amendment is intended to protect Finland's domestic security and safeguard its territorial sovereignty and integrity. It says the change is necessary to meet the changed security situation and new kinds of threats.

City staff will explore the feasibility of introducing a customized web domain for use by Toronto businesses and organizations following a vote by the government management committee on Monday.
Councillor Paul Ainslie's motion calls on the Chief Information Officer to report back on the potential benefits and costs of introducing .TO web addresses by Feb. 22.
Ainslie's motion also raises the possibility of introducing neighbourhood specific web addresses for community groups, so, as an example, accredited organizations could sign up for Parkdale.TO or Littleitaly.TO.
In making the case for the new domains, Ainslie cites the success of a .NYC web address that was introduced in New York City in October, 2014.
“New York City initiated their own .nyc web address earlier this year and reported that 10,000 requests had been filed by October 2015, making the domain names available on a first come first served basis. The simple process has New Yorkers register their own personalized emails at www.OwnIt.nyc. The site is exciting, vibrant and inviting everything Toronto is,” Ainslie writes in a letter accompanying his motion.
.TO owned by Tonga
Though Ainslie's motion specifically calls for the introduction of a .TO web address, that domain is actually owned by the Kingdom of Tonga, meaning that revenues from the sale of .TO domains would go to a country where homosexuality is illegal and women are forbidden from owning land.
One workaround to that problem would be the introduction of a .Toronto web domain, which the city would own.
In a letter to the Government Management Committee, Richard Schreier of the Canadian Internet Registration Authority said that may in fact be the most logical approach.
“The advantages for the city to have full control over ‘.TORONTO' vs. limited to no control over ‘.TO' cannot be overstated,” Schreier wrote.
In order to purchase a custom domain such as .Toronto the city would have to participate in one of the periodic auctions held by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).
The last time ICANN held such an auction in 2012, interested parties had to pay an application fee of $185,000 and if awarded the domain, an annual operation fee of $25,000.
The application fee was non-refundable.

Former British tennis number one Elena Baltacha has been diagnosed with cancer of the liver.
Baltacha, who retired last year, won 11 singles titles, made the third round of Wimbledon in 2002 and was part of Great Britain's Fed Cup team for 11 years.
"I'm currently undergoing treatment and fighting this illness with everything I have," said Ukraine-born Baltacha, 30.
Fed Cup captain Judy Murray added: "She's a determined, upbeat person and everyone around her is positive".
At the age of 19, Baltacha was diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis, a chronic liver condition which compromises the immune system.
The Scot went on to reach a career-high ranking of 49 in 2010, and also reached the third round of the Australian Open in 2005 and 2010, but often struggled with injury and illness.
Announcing her retirement last November, she revealed she planned to dedicate herself to coaching and developing the academy she founded in 2012 with her coach Nino Severino.
"I still absolutely love tennis and I want to take that passion and put it into learning to be the best coach I can be so that I can take all my experiences as a player and use that to help develop the next generation of British tennis players," she said.
Her former Fed Cup team-mate Heather Watson said she was "shocked" to learn of Baltacha's cancer diagnosis.
Elena Baltacha factfile Born in Kiev to Ukrainian parents
Raised in Perth, Scotland
Father Sergei played professional football for Ipswich, St Johnstone and Inverness Caledonian Thistle
Made debut on ITF circuit in 1997
Won first two ITF tournaments in Felixstowe and Pamplona in 2002
Broke into world's top 100 in 2009 and top 50 in 2010
Best Grand Slam: Third round of Wimbledon (2002) and Australian Open (2005, 2010)
Career earnings: £710,000
The British number three said: "It's horrible news to hear and all of us are thinking of her.
"It's a shock to hear and I hope she has a good speedy recovery.
"Bally's a great spirit for Fed Cup and we all enjoy having her around, and all of us girls at the Fed Cup get along so well, so we'll all be thinking of her."
For several years Baltacha and Anne Keothavong were at the forefront of the women's game in Britain.
Keothavong, who retired in July 2013, sent a message of support to her old rival via Twitter.
It read: "She's one of the people I most admire for her courage and determination. You'll fight through this @ElenaBaltacha xxx."
Current British number one Laura Robson tweeted: "Sending so many positive vibes your way Bally! You've got this xx."
Stacey Allaster, the chairman and chief executive of the WTA, added: "Throughout her tennis career, Elena was admired for her friendly personality, her passion, energy and tenacity.
"We know she will use these qualities to fight this illness and we'll support her along this process in any way we can."
Baltacha can look for inspiration to Great Britain Davis Cup player Ross Hutchins, who was appointed the new tournament director of the Queen's Club's Aegon Championships in London this week.
The 29-year-old had returned to action earlier this year with doubles partner Colin Fleming after recovering from Hodgkin's lymphoma - another form of cancer.
Hutchins was diagnosed with the illness in December 2012 but announced he was in remission in July.
Image copyright EPA Image caption The two leaders are discussing defence and post-Brexit relations
Theresa May has insisted that Brexit will not stand in the way of the UK strengthening its ties with Poland.
The prime minister signalled closer co-operation in defence, cybersecurity and enterprise during Downing Street talks with counterpart Beata Szydlo.
She said she wanted an "early" resolution to negotiations over the future legal status of the 900,000 Polish citizens living in the UK.
Ms Szydlo said this was a vital issue but understood reciprocity was needed.
At a press conference in No 10 following the first-ever UK-Polish summit, Mrs May also confirmed the UK is to send 150 troops to Poland to help "deter Russian aggression" in Europe. They will be deployed in April close to the Polish border with the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad.
'Right balance'
On the crucial issue of residency and employment rights, Ms Szydlo said Polish citizens in the UK needed certainty about their future after Brexit, telling reporters she hoped negotiations would yield "the right balance" for both the UK and the EU.
"From the point of view of Poland, let me reiterate that the most important thing (after Brexit) is the guarantees for the Polish citizens who are living and working in the United Kingdom," she said. "Of course, these guarantees would need to be reciprocal."
Mrs May said she wanted to give Poles and other EU citizens living in the UK certainty but she said any agreement depended on Britons living elsewhere in Europe having equivalent assurances over their rights.

During the visit to London, Mrs May and Ms Szydlo discussed Brexit and defence co-operation over a working lunch, while senior ministers, including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Chancellor Philip Hammond, met their counterparts at Lancaster House.
The leaders and ministers then held formal talks in the Cabinet Room at 10 Downing Street on issues ranging from trade and scientific co-operation to concerns about Moscow's military actions in Ukraine and Syria.
'Shared history'
Mrs May said she was determined that Brexit would not stand in the way of stronger economic and cultural ties between the two countries, announcing a series of joint initiatives on enterprise, innovation and cybersecurity and the ambition of a first-ever bilateral defence treaty between the two nations.
Mrs May provided more details of the deployment next Spring of around 150 troops from the Light Dragoons, along with a number of armoured vehicles, to Orzysz in north-east Poland, close to the border with Kaliningrad, which houses Russia's Baltic fleet.
The move, she said, was a response to Russian aggression on the "eastern flank of Europe".
Mrs May said: "Our ties with Poland are rooted deeply in our shared history. We will never forget the Polish pilots who braved the skies alongside us during World War Two, standing up for freedom and democracy in Europe, nor the valuable contribution made by so many Poles in our country today.
"I am determined that Brexit will not weaken our relationship with Poland - rather it will serve as a catalyst to strengthen it."
'Down-to-earth'
Mrs May added that the summit "marks the start of a new chapter in our relations and we will work even more closely together to ensure the security and prosperity of our nations in the years ahead".
"Today's meeting puts beyond doubt the common ground we share, the importance we attach to our bilateral relationship and the benefits it brings. We share a clear commitment to take our co-operation to the next level and to firmly establish the UK and Poland as resolute and strategic allies in Europe."
Mrs May has promised to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which starts the legal process for Brexit, by the end of March.
Formal negotiations cannot begin until then, but the UK prime minister is holding informal discussions with other EU leaders to find out their views.
Ms Szydlo said the Brexit process would be "interesting" and negotiations must take place in a spirit of "mutual trust".
Warsaw has raised concerns about the abuse of Poles in the UK following the Brexit referendum, with a rise in incidents of alleged hate crimes. Ms Szydlo said the incidents that occurred were "very sad" and thanked the UK authorities for their "quick reaction"
"We continue working together in order to make sure that the Polish community is safe," she added.
A four-to-three majority Supreme Court decision today has introduced a new rule concerning the admissibility of evidence in criminal trials.
A four-to-three majority Supreme Court decision today has introduced a new rule concerning the admissibility of evidence in criminal trials.
A decision will be made later on whether a man, in whose case the legal issue arose and who was acquitted on burglary charges after the case against him collapsed after exclusion of evidence under a 25-year-old rule, will now be retried or whether his acquittal stands.
By a four-to-three majority, the court granted an appeal by the DPP to alter a rule which had applied since the 1990 Supreme Court "DPP v Kenny" decision. That rule effectively excluded all evidence obtained in circumstances where there was a breach of a constitutional right, whether or not that breach was deliberate or due to a mistake.
The majority court introduced a new test which provides that evidence taken in "deliberate and conscious violation of constitutional rights should be excluded except in certain exceptional circumstances.
In that context, deliberate and conscious refers to "knowledge" of the unconstitutionality of the taking of the relevant evidence rather than applying to the act concerned, the majority court said.
Mr Justice Donal O'Donnell, who formed the majority view with the Chief Justice, Ms Justice Susan Denham, Mr Justice Frank Clarke and Mr Justice John MacMenamin, said the Kenny decision was "plainly wrong" and it was "long past time it was addressed".
It is part of the Supreme Court's function to adjust its prior decisions in light of developments in the law, experience and analysis, he said.
Mr Justice MacMenamin said the reputation and integrity of the system of justice should not be adversely affected by a "good faith exception" that was "properly and faithfully applied to the exclusionary rule properly and constitutionally applied".
The test set by the majority judgments was significantly higher than in other common law jurisdictions and the new rule "redressed the balance so as to encompass community interests while ensuring that "egregious breaches" of a suspect's rights and police misconduct are checked, he said.
In a dissenting judgment, Mr Justice Adrian Hardiman said the Kenny decision was essential to the maintenance of the liberties of a citizen.
He was "gravely apprehensive" the majority decision in this case overruling Kenny, "one of the monuments of Irish constitutional jurisprudence", was "a major step in the disengagement of this court from the rights-oriented jurisprudence of our predecessors".
Also dissenting, Mr Justice John Murray said the consequences of the majority court ruling was "to change the goalposts, not during the game but after the game is over, except is it not about a game or sport, it is about a criminal trial and justice which the Constitution requires shall be considered in due course of law".
If a citizen cannot rely on a rule of law as defined by the Supreme Court and applicable at their trial without the risk that a verdict shall be set aside because the law is changed by the Supreme Court after the trial, then the integrity of the judicial process is undermined, he said.
Mr Justice Liam McKechnie also dissented and said it could not be said that the Kenny decision was "plainly wrong". The protection of rights was the primary basis of the rule set in the Kenny decision and deterrence was subsumed is not that, he said. He also considered the modification of the rule, as set out by the majority court, would be "unworkable".
The DPP had sought re-examination of the Kenny decision in her appeal against a trial judge's decision to direct the acquittal of a man on burglary charges.
Section 23 of the Criminal Procedure Act permits the DPP to appeal an acquittal to the Supreme Court on a point of law on grounds including her belief the acquittal arose from a ruling which wrongly excluded "compelling evidence".
In the appeal, the DPP asked the Supreme Court to review the exclusionary rule of evidence under which the courts refuse to allow evidence be admitted if obtained in circumstances involving a breach of a defendant's constitutional right, irrespective whether that right was breached by mistake. The exclusionary rule has effectively been applied since the Kenny case.
The DPP asked the Supreme Court to find the rule was misapplied in the man's case and to make a "conclusive" decision on the applicability of the rule to future cases, the Director's counsel Brian Murray SC told the court.
The court was urged to examine whether it is appropriate to apply the rule in circumstances where there was no deliberate or conscious breach of constitutional rights.
In the case before the Supreme Court, the man, referred to as C, was acquitted as a result by direction of the trial judge on grounds gardai had effected an unlawful entry into his home under a warrant issued under Section 29.1 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939
Section 29.1 was struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in a February 2012 judgment on another case, the Damache case, on grounds the section permitted a warrant to be issued by a person who was not independent - a Garda Detective Superintendent who was participating in the investigation.
The Damache ruling was given after the gardai raided C's home but before his trial. As a result of the Damache ruling, the trial judge said she must find the entry into C's home on foot of a Section 29 warrant was unlawful.
As a result of the finding of unlawful entry, the trial judge ruled C's subsequent arrest and detention was also unlawful and therefore certain statements allegedly made by him to gardai were inadmissible in the criminal proceedings against him.
The DPP argued gardai acted reasonably in effecting an arrest under a warrant issued under Section 29 at a time when they could not reasonably have been aware of any issues relating to the validity of Section 29.

Its asylum policies are the continent's most generous. But the public mood is now changing
In a country that elevated social democracy into the natural form of government for decades, Maria has been a loyal stalwart. The 66-year-old retired canteen worker has always voted for Sweden's Social Democratic party, like the vast majority in her working-class suburb of Malmo. Until last Sunday, that is. That morning Maria broke the habit of a lifetime and in doing so helped redraw the map of Swedish politics. She voted for an extreme-right movement accused of being Islamophobic that broke into parliament in Stockholm for the first time, probably condemning the country to a fragile minority government.
She was not alone. In Maria's high-rise suburb of Almgården an astonishing one in three voted for Sweden Democrats, a party dubbed "racist and neo-Nazi" and led by Jimmie Åkesson, the new young darling of the European far right.
The reason is plain. Maria pointed across the dual carriageway to the neighbouring housing scheme of Rosengård, known locally as "the ghetto".
It is home to almost 20,000 immigrants, overwhelmingly Muslim, almost half of them jobless.
"It's become crazy around here. You can't go out in the evening," said Maria, who like other locals, did not want her surname revealed. "I've got nothing against foreigners. I've been married to a Bulgarian for 40 years. But these people don't share our values. If you don't like the colour of our flag, I say, I'll help you pack your bags."
Another resident, running a minicab service, remained loyal to the centre-left, but said: "Åkesson's right. Enough is enough. Even in the jungles of Africa, they don't know where Sweden is, but they know they can come here, get money and not need to work. I came so close to voting for Sweden Democrats. Maybe the next time."
Åkesson, a dapper, bespectacled 31-year-old, celebrated his party winning nearly 6% of the vote by declaring: "We're in." The Social Democrats slumped to their worst result. The same equation now applies across Europe.
Malmo, formerly an old industrial city, lays fair claim to being the cradle of Swedish social democracy. The centre-left still controls the city, but its power is eroding in what has been an exceptionally promising summer for Islam-baiting, anti-immigrant movements in Europe.
In France, President Nicolas Sarkozy has been trying to recover support he forfeited in March to the National Front by expelling Romanian Gypsies. In the Netherlands, Geert Wilders' Freedom party goes from strength to strength with his single issue anti-Islam campaign, paralysing Dutch governance.
In Austria, the extreme right leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, is running for mayor of Vienna next month. He will lose. But he looks likely to take more than 20% of the capital's vote. Next door in Hungary the radical rightwing Jobbik has gained a parliamentary foothold and is demanding permanent, guarded internment camps for Gypsies. In Italy the anti-immigrant Northern League of Umberto Bossi is in government and is the country's fastest-growing party.
In Germany, meanwhile, where the extreme right has failed to make inroads, the political sensation of the summer has been the taboo-busting, bestselling book by Thilo Sarazzin, a former Berlin central banker.
He claims that the country is digging its own grave by admitting waves of immigrants he characterises as spongers, welfare cheats, and sub-intelligent beings copulating their way from ethnic minority to takeover majority.
Against this troubled background, Sweden has long seemed aloof and immune, an oasis of civility and openness, with the most generous welfare, asylum, and immigration policies in Europe. But with about 100,000 immigrants entering a country of almost 9 million every year, Åkesson's breakthrough suggests there has been a shift in the public mood.
"We will not get as tough on immigration as Denmark, Norway or the Netherlands," said Prof Jan Ekberg, a national expert on the economics of migration at Linnaeus University. "But the Sweden Democrats will increase their vote if we don't succeed in our immigration policy. That's the main issue."
In Malmo, where about 80,000 of the 300,000 population are immigrants, the limits of Swedish openness are being tested. "It's a very divided city," said Daniel Sandström, editor of the main city paper, Sydsvenskan. "It's made a successful transition from being an old industrial city to a new, postmodern place of middle-class consumers. That means winners and losers. The losers are the old, the poor, and the immigrants."
Teaching 21 seven-year-olds in a primary school in the immigrant "ghetto", Cecilia Hallström is the sole native Swede in the well-equipped classroom.
"Of course, the school is open to everyone, but it is only Muslims who come here," she said. The children, taught in Swedish, are native Arabic, Pashtun, Kurdish and Bosnian speakers of a dozen nationalities. Hallström is a firm supporter of multiculturalism, but noted: "People are just getting fed up. The far right is not new here, but it is gaining ground. We've taken in so many new immigrants that people are saying we need to slow down and take proper care of the ones that are here."
Signs of friction and trouble are not hard to find beneath the veneer of Scandinavian order, decency and prosperity. Beyzat Becirov points to the window in his office at Malmo's main mosque.
A bullet perforated the reinforced glass earlier this year, shaved the neck of a colleague and lodged itself in the drawer of a desk. "We've got to defeat all fascism," said the imam and head of Malmo's 60,000-strong Islamic community. "But you get it on both sides, on our side as well." His mosque is the oldest and biggest in Sweden. It has been burned down once, and a pig was placed in the prayer hall. Becirov said there had been 300 attacks since it was built in 1983. There have been riots. There are no-go areas.
Two things were new in Malmo, said Becirov. Recent years had brought a flood of people "from Asia, Africa, and Arab countries. There's a problem with the Somalis, the Lebanese, the Palestinians. They have difficulty integrating. And there are no jobs." The other novelty was the local rise of the Sweden Democrats, who Becirov described as the "new Nazis", suggesting that the country was joining the European club. "It's a bit like a tsunami spreading across Europe. And now it's here, too."
In Denmark and Germany, France and Italy, the Netherlands and Switzerland, politicians, pundits and publics are immersed in noisy argument about values and loyalties, the end of multiculturalism, the integration failures of foreigners. It's a backlash against mass immigration. Sweden has seemed oblivious to the tumult while keeping its doors open. But that seemed to shift on Sunday, not least in Malmo and its hinterland where Åkesson, announcing that Muslim immigration is the biggest threat to Sweden since Adolf Hitler, scored double-digit results across the south-west.
That Sweden is moving into the European mainstream in its attitudes to immigration is a contested and controversial point that seems to cut to the core of Swedes' ideas of themselves.
Pia Kjaersgaard, leader of the far-right Danish People's party just across the stunning Oeresund road and rail bridge linking Malmo to Copenhagen, gleefully welcomed the election result and the Åkesson breakthrough by declaring: "Sweden is becoming a normal country." That touched a nerve because Sweden and Denmark have opposing immigration policies, with the Danes practising what may be the most restrictive regime in Europe.
"Åkesson puts Sweden and intolerance together. But the true situation and tradition here is of internationalism and tolerance," said Sandström.
Jörgen Grubb, one of Akesson's seven councillors in Malmo, thinks talk of Swedish specialness is rank hypocrisy. "We've always tried to be the perfect country, telling the world we're so good and nice to everyone. But we've just been hiding and now it's changing. We've become less naïve."
Åkesson's appeal is one of nostalgia for a bygone era, the stiff conservatism and tradition of the white Sweden of the 1950s. The test of the rebellion's impact will be whether, as everywhere else in Europe, the mainstream parties try to co-opt Åkesson's voters by accommodating some of his policies.
Lena Westerlund, chief economist at the national trades union association, does not expect any major policy changes on immigration. "I'm not saying it's not problematic, but for our economy the immigration is a net benefit. We have a very bad demographic, we need a much younger population."
Prof Ekberg also does not expect any big policy change. "The problem is not immigration, it is integration, especially in the labour market. If there are no jobs, the consequences are segregation, housing problems and divided cities."
It is in the post-industrial cities of Europe, once centre-left citadels, that the far right has been making big gains – Le Pen in Marseille, Wilders in Rotterdam, Strache in "red" Vienna. Åkesson in Malmo is new, but part of a trend.
"He is a clever populist, careful not to cross the line and say anything that seems undemocratic. But his party has a tremendous acceptance of racism," said Sandström. "And Sweden is turning into a more European country, while Swedes still want to be some kind of exception. That's the debate that will be taking place here for years now."
At the extremes
France The National Front's hard line on immigration plays well with some voters. Commentators say President Nicolas Sarkozy has shifted further right to capture these votes.
Netherlands Geert Wilders, leader of Freedom Party, is in negotiations to form a coalition government.
Austria The Freedom Party has become a political force and Barbara Rosenkranz, who says anti-Nazi laws should be abolished, came second in presidential race.
Hungary Jobbik party entered parliament in April 2010.
Italy Northern League used a poster of white sheep kicking out a black one to convey anti-immigration message. Swiss People's party, too, has used such a poster image.

HVMN sells nootropics, otherwise known as "smart pills," a growing favorite among Silicon Valley's elite, who are looking for ways to function at super-human levels. The company raised about $3 million, and investors include Zynga co-founder Mark Pincus and Kabam CEO Kevin Chou.
The company says its supplements such as chewable caffeine pills help the human system become "quantified, optimized, and upgraded." At one point, CEO Geoffrey Woo went as far as to describe HVMN's products as unlocking "next-level thinking" that will be key to humanity's evolution.
"In a way, it's almost arming humanity against artificial intelligence and robots," Woo told Bloomberg.
All the marketing seems to be working. HVMN is selling some of these supplements in the tens of thousands of units per year, reaching monthly subscription revenue of $3 million to $5 million in 2016, according to a source familiar with the company's financials. HVMN said it generates sales in the "multimillions."
But many of its claims lack scientific evidence to support them. Little is known about how the human body responds to the cocktail of ingredients, both natural and synthetic, that are found in most nootropic blends.
So in 2016, HVMN -- known as Nootrobox at the time -- set out to prove itself by testing one of its supplements, a "cognitive enhancement" called SPRINT, against caffeine in a landmark clinical trial. It commissioned a study in collaboration with Maastricht University in the Netherlands. HVMN was hoping to support its claim that SPRINT can help people "conquer a big project, a long day at work or any other mentally demanding task."
The results?
In most areas, the supplement tested was less effective than sipping a cup of coffee.
"As we expected, the caffeine had some positive effects, but the SPRINT formulation they gave us was not really effective," said Arjan Blokland, head of the department of neuropsychology and psychopharmacology at Maastricht University, in an interview with CNBC.
Diane Rehm thanked her listeners on Friday as she said farewell to "The Diane Rehm Show," a staple of public radio with fans all across the country.
"It's not goodbye, it's just farewelled," she said.
Rehm, 80, is semi-retiring after four decades in broadcasting. Friday marked her final live broadcast.
"I began hosting my own program in 1979" at WAMU, an NPR-affiliated radio station in Washington, she said. "In 1995, NPR began distributing the show to stations across the country. It's been a wonderful 37 years with these outstanding organizations, especially wonderful because of all of you. So this is my chance to take your calls and say thank you for all the time we've had together on this program."
Famous fans like Julie Andrews, John Dickerson, Cory Booker and Judy Collins and regular listeners called in to honor Rehm. Some listeners said on social media that they teared up toward the end of the program.
While many of Rehm's longtime listeners are clearly anxious about a Trump presidency, Rehm expressed optimism about the future of the country and said "we're going to be OK."
She also alluded to shortcomings in campaign coverage by saying "what we in the press have not done enough of is to listen."
"I think there has to be much more active listening on the part of all of us, not just those who are part of the media, all of us," she said.
Looking ahead to family holiday gatherings, she said, "what I beg of you is, rather than arguing your point, listen to the others' perspective. Try to listen. Ask questions and engage rather than using your own points of view to shut people down."
Taped episodes of "The Diane Rehm Show" will air next week. On January 2, a new program called "1A," hosted by Joshua Johnson, will take Rehm's place on many local stations. WAMU said the name is inspired by the First Amendment.
After Rehm signed off at noon on Friday, her family members and staffers gathered for toasts at the station's headquarters. Rehm toasted Johnson, who was also on hand.
Rehm will continue to work with WAMU -- this time on a new podcast.
The station says the weekly podcast will start sometime in January, with Rehm talking with "newsmakers, writers, artists and thinkers on the issues she cares most about: what's going on in Washington, ideas that inform, and the latest on living well as we live longer."
At a Thursday night farewell party for the show, dozens of Rehm's friends and past guests feted the public radio icon. Rehm spoke briefly to thank the crowd, cracking a joke about how they all worked for free when appearing on the program.
NPR's senior director of promotion and audience development, Izzie Smith, said local stations were encouraged to heavily promote Rehm's farewell on Friday.
A Twitter hashtag, #ThanksDiane, collected messages of appreciation.
Washington Post film critic Ann Hornaday said that being on the air with Rehm "was like being conducted by Toscanini."
She thanked Rehm for making radio "a more civilized place!"
Wilson Center scholar Farahnaz Ispahani said Rehm is in "a class of her own. Will be greatly missed."
Episode 43- The Ren and Stimpy Show
Ren and Stimpy is easily our most controversial show we've covered so far, and also one of the most popular by request. Most of us remember Ren and Stimpy as something our parents wouldn't let us watch, and as something the media vilified. We know both of our parents would always turn it off if they found us watching it. But is it really as controversial as we remember it or was it simply a different time? Maybe. Maybe not. There is quite a bit of interesting info out there about this show: from John K. being kicked off his own show, multiple banned episodes, to a failed 2003 remake there's plenty for us to cover here. The question for us always comes down to “does it still hold up” is it actually a good show? And what about our young viewers, is it really something to keep them from experiencing? Listen along and find out!
Premise:
According to Wikipedia, is The series centers on Ren Höek (voiced by John Kricfalusi in seasons 1–2; Billy West in seasons 3–5), a short-tempered, “asthma–hound” Chihuahua,[3] and Stimpson J. “Stimpy” Cat (also voiced by Billy West), a 3-year-old[4] dimwitted and happy-go-lucky cat.[3] The duo fill various roles from episode to episode, including outer-space explorers, Old West horse thieves, and nature-show hosts,[5] and are usually at odds with each other in these situations. While the show was sometimes set in the present day, the show's crew tended to avoid “contemporary” jokes about current events.[6] The show extensively features off-color humor,[7]absurdist humour, and slapstick.[8]Highlights: Ren, John Kricfalusi, Stimpy, Billy West, George Liquor, Spümcø, SpongeBob SquarePants, Censorship

Exactly eight days ago, having watched dozens of YouTube videos focused on the hottest cryptocurrencies just that minute, I hurried to Coinbase, bought $150 worth of Bitcoin, opened a Poloniex account, and threw my money into a market I quite honestly didn't understand in the slightest. Similarly, despite having no idea what a Siacoin is, countless people enter the cryptocurrency game on a daily basis, convinced that getting involved now will result in them becoming millionaires in a few years when most will make little if any profit off of their investment for one (or two) reasons: they never bother to learn how to the cryptocurrency market works, and instead place undeserved faith in the word of any number of Bitcoin gurus when investing their money.
Having had more than enough time to return to sanity since my original investment, although I continue to recognize the value and potential of cryptocurrency, I also recognize that a great many people I've come across on social media who present themselves as cryptocurrency experts fall into one of three categories: those who greatly overstate their understanding of the market, those who greatly overstate the amount of money they've made from the market, and those who do both. Visit nearly any cryptocurrency forum you'd like and you'll find any number of supposed crypto-millionaires, though upon closer inspection you'll discover that the guy claiming to hold 1.8 million Bitcoin and half a million Ethereum is more or less indistinguishable from a guy named Kevin, who first talked to me about Bitcoin back in 2013.
Obviously, I regret not getting involved way back then, as I would have made a ton of money off of my investment. However, you have to consider the source of the information I was receiving. My introduction to Bitcoin came from someone who even now claims to be making money "hand over fist" with his Bitcoin investment, despite still begging friends and family for rides around town, working at Walmart for what he calls "garbage" wages, and living with his mother just as he did four years ago. Now while I admit that I'm likely off on the EXACT numbers, I would hazard a guess that over ninety-nine percent of people on the forums who go on about how much money they've made off of cryptocurrencies are lying just like Kevin does, and in the interest of helping you identify these people and avoid wasting time involving yourself in conversations with them, I'm going to point out a few things I consider telltale signs that a person presenting themselves as a crypto-millionaire is really one of any number of frauds currently infesting cryptocurrency forums.
THEY CAN'T SHOW YOU THE MONEY
Imagine for a moment that you're sitting on $2.9 million worth of Ethereum. Setting aside the negligible probability that you'd share your investment strategy with random people you don't know over the internet for free, when at last someone dismissively asks what credentials you've got, it would be easy enough to silence further challenges to your mastery of the cryptomarket by simply showing some sign of the wealth you claim to have, yet you'll find few of these self-proclaimed crypto-millionaires can show you definitive proof they've made enough money off of their investment to buy a cup of coffee, let alone a Bugatti Veyron. Assuming that they can show you evidence that there are millions in their Poloniex account, you don't know that the actual source of that money wasn't the death of a wealthy uncle, so don't be so quick to buy their spiel. Look for signs that they actually know what they're talking about lest you end up wasting time out of your life that you can't get back engaging in protracted discussions with these characters.
THEY PREDICT THE OBVIOUS AND NEVER ACKNOWLEDGE BEING WRONG
If you don't have a degree in accounting or some experience with multi-level marketing, many of these characters can be very convincing due to their ability to "talk the talk", so to speak. However, anyone who has ever bought into a MLM "business opportunity", should quickly recognize the all too familiar signs of someone speaking at length and saying nothing. Despite trying to sound like financial geniuses, you'll find that most of these guys completely ignore a coin failing to take off well after they predicted it would, yet rush to take credit for predicting that the value of one coin or another was going to rise when any reasonable person could have reached the same conclusion beforehand. I mean, if I told you the value of Lisk was going to increase considerably in the coming years relative to its current price, I don't think you'd be too impressed. Similarly, you shouldn't put any value in the predictions of someone who pats himself on the back for having previously told you something you already knew, while ignoring the fact that every other crypto on his "Top 10 Hottest Coins Right Now!" list tanked. Even if the guy has a business degree from Harvard University, you should remember that the most he can do is offer his BEST GUESS as to the future value of a coin. His ability to seamlessly intersperse terminology specific to the world of finance into his opinion doesn't change this fact.
THEY ALLEGEDLY MAKE "TONS OF MONEY" REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE MARKET IS DOING
Honestly, these are my favorites because they're the most obvious liars of them all. For a statement like this to be true, you would need advance knowledge of what the market was going to do on a daily basis, and I rather doubt "KryptoKid420" has clairvoyance enough to pull that off. Furthermore, these guys check both previous boxes in that they can neither show you any evidence of their supposed financial windfall, and often recommend others invest in obvious future moneymakers while ignoring the fact that previous recommendations failed to bear fruit. Many of these characters don't even bother to try to hide the evidence that they're lying... Look at the background in some of these videos and you can immediately tell that it's a studio apartment. Now do you really believe that a guy making massive amounts of money regardless of what the market does would live in a studio apartment? Personally speaking, I highly doubt it. Of course, it's possible he rents the apartment to film his YouTube videos to avoid the general public locating his mansion and spying on him while he's relaxing, but you and I both know that the chances of that are about as likely as Dogecoin hitting $50 by December (though I'd really, REALLY love it if it did!).
So in conclusion, as several people on YouTube and elsewhere both reputable and otherwise frequently suggest, do your own homework and never take anyone's opinion as constituting financial advice. Also, just so I'm perfectly clear here (because I can see it coming already), none of this is meant as a criticism of EVERYONE discussing cryptocurrency on social media, as I actively follow several people both here and on other platforms, and thus far have no reason to consider any of them to be anything other than what they claim to be. Having said that however, being sold on the value of a coin because someone presents you with charts and graphs doesn't result in them bearing any financial responsibility for your decisions, so the only competent advice I could give anyone thinking about investing a serious amount of money into the market based on my admittedly limited experience thus far is to gain a reasonable understanding of how it works beforehand, and to have a realistic expectation of what you're likely to get out of investing in it. Don't be like I was a week ago, flushing $100 down the toilet in hopes $10,000 comes out the kitchen faucet, as contrary to what many people would have you believe, we won't all become millionaires from investing in cryptos. Somehow, in spite of all the excitement surrounding this coin and that one, I think if only deep down, most of us already know that.

Philip Seymour Hoffman's death was not on the bill.
If it'd been the sacrifice of Miley Cyrus or Justin Bieber, that we are invited to anticipate daily, we could delight in the Faustian justice of the righteous dispatch of a fast-living, sequin-spattered denizen of eMpTyV. We are tacitly instructed to await their demise with necrophilic sanctimony. When the end comes, they screech on Fox and TMZ, it will be deserved. The Mail provokes indignation, luridly baiting us with the sidebar that scrolls from the headline down to hell.
But Philip Seymour Hoffman? A middle-aged man, a credible and decorated actor, the industrious and unglamorous artisan of Broadway and serious cinema? The disease of addiction recognises none of these distinctions. Whilst routinely described as tragic, Hoffman's death is insufficiently sad to be left un-supplemented in the mandatory posthumous scramble for salacious garnish; we will now be subjected to mourn-ography posing as analysis. I can assure you that there is no as yet undiscovered riddle in his domestic life or sex life, the man was a drug addict and his death inevitable.
A troubling component of this sad loss is the complete absence of hedonism. Like a lot of drug addicts, probably most, who "go over", Hoffman was alone when he died. This is an inescapably bleak circumstance. When we reflect on Bieber's Louis Vuitton embossed, Lamborghini cortege it is easy to equate addiction with indulgence and immorality. The great actor dying alone denies us this required narrative prang.
The reason I am so non-judgmental of Hoffman or Bieber and so condemnatory of the pop cultural tinsel that adorns the reporting around them is that I am a drug addict in recovery, so like any drug addict I know exactly how Hoffman felt when he "went back out". In spite of his life seeming superficially great, in spite of all the praise and accolades, in spite of all the loving friends and family, there is a predominant voice in the mind of an addict that supersedes all reason and that voice wants you dead. This voice is the unrelenting echo of an unfulfillable void.
Addiction is a mental illness around which there is a great deal of confusion, which is hugely exacerbated by the laws that criminalise drug addicts.
If drugs are illegal people who use drugs are criminals. We have set our moral compass on this erroneous premise, and we have strayed so far off course that the landscape we now inhabit provides us with no solutions and greatly increases the problem.
SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Help Keep Common Dreams Alive Our progressive news model only survives if those informed and inspired by this work support our efforts
This is an important moment in history; we know that prohibition does not work. We know that the people who devise drug laws are out of touch and have no idea how to reach a solution. Do they even have the inclination? The fact is their methods are so gallingly ineffective that it is difficult not to deduce that they are deliberately creating the worst imaginable circumstances to maximise the harm caused by substance misuse.
People are going to use drugs; no self-respecting drug addict is even remotely deterred by prohibition. What prohibition achieves is an unregulated, criminal-controlled, sprawling, global mob-economy, where drug users, their families and society at large are all exposed to the worst conceivable version of this regrettably unavoidable problem.
Countries like Portugal and Switzerland that have introduced progressive and tolerant drug laws have seen crime plummet and drug-related deaths significantly reduced. We know this. We know this system doesn't work – and yet we prop it up with ignorance and indifference. Why? Wisdom is acting on knowledge. Now we are aware that our drug laws aren't working and that alternatives are yielding positive results, why are we not acting? Tradition? Prejudice? Extreme stupidity? The answer is all three. Change is hard, apathy is easy, tradition is the narcotic of our rulers. The people who are most severely affected by drug prohibition are dispensable, politically irrelevant people. Poor people. Addiction affects all of us but the poorest pay the biggest price.
Philip Seymour Hoffman's death is a reminder, though, that addiction is indiscriminate. That it is sad, irrational and hard to understand. What it also clearly demonstrates is that we are a culture that does not know how to treat its addicts. Would Hoffman have died if this disease were not so enmeshed in stigma? If we weren't invited to believe that people who suffer from addiction deserve to suffer? Would he have OD'd if drugs were regulated, controlled and professionally administered? Most importantly, if we insisted as a society that what is required for people who suffer from this condition is an environment of support, tolerance and understanding.
The troubling message behind Philip Seymour Hoffman's death, which we all feel without articulating, is that it was unnecessary and we know that something could be done. We also know what that something is and yet, for some traditional, prejudicial, stupid reason we don't do it.

It wouldn't be Halloween if I didn't re-post my favorite White House ghost story.
Ever since the White House was first occupied in 1800, there have been rumors of hauntings, but I got this story direct from the President. No, not President Obama. I first heard about the White House ghosts directly from the lips of Ronald Reagan.
It was March 18, 1986, and my husband Nick and I had been invited to a state dinner in honor of Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. The State Dining room was filled with gold candlesticks, gold vermeil flatware and vermeil bowls filled with red and white tulips. I had the great privilege of being seated at the President's table along with Chicago Bears' running back Walter Payton; the Canadian Prime Minister's wife Mila Mulroney; the president of the Mobil Corporation; Donna Marella Agnelli, wife of the chairman of Fiat; Burl Osborne, the editor of the Dallas Morning News, and Pat Buckley, wife of William Buckley.
The President, a brilliant storyteller, entertained the table throughout the meal and the story I remember best was about his encounters with the White House ghostly spirits. Here is how I wrote it later in an article about the dinner for the Ladies' Home Journal:
According to the President, Rex, the King Charles Cavalier spaniel who had recently replaced Lucky as First Dog, had twice barked frantically in the Lincoln Bedroom and then backed out and refused to set foot over the threshold. And another evening, while the Reagans were watching TV in their room, Rex stood up on his hind legs, pointed his nose at the ceiling and began barking at something invisible overhead. To their amazement, the dog walked around the room, barking at the ceiling.
'I started thinking about it,' the President continued, 'And I began to wonder if the dog was responding to an electric signal too high-pitched for human ears, perhaps beamed toward the White House by a foreign embassy. I asked my staff to look into it.'
The President laughed and said, 'I might as well tell you the rest. A member of our family [he meant his daughter Maureen] and her husband always stay in the Lincoln Bedroom when they visit the White House. Some time ago the husband woke up and saw a transparent figure standing at the bedroom window looking out. Then it turned and disappeared. His wife teased him mercilessly about it for a month. Then, when they were here recently, she woke up one morning and saw the same figure standing at the window looking out. She could see the trees right through it. Again it turned and disappeared.'
After that White House dinner, I did some research and discovered that half a dozen presidents and as many first ladies have reported ghostly happenings in the White House. It's not just the ghost of Lincoln that they see, although he tops the hit parade. He caused Winston Churchill, who was coming out of the bathroom naked but for a cigar when he encountered Lincoln, to refuse to sleep there again. And Abe so startled Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands that she fell into a dead faint when she heard a knock on the door and opened it to find Lincoln standing there.
I also learned that the Lincoln bedroom was not a bedroom when Lincoln was President -- it was his Cabinet Room where he signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
It's well known that Abraham Lincoln and his wife held séances in the White House, attempting to contact the spirit of their son Willie, who died there and who has been seen walking the halls.
The ghost of Dolley Madison, wife of James Madison, appeared often in the Rose Garden, which she planted. There is even reportedly a Demon Cat in the White House basement that is rarely seen. When it does appear, it is foretelling a national disaster. While the Demon Cat may at first look like a harmless kitten, it grows in size and evil the closer one gets. A White House guard saw it a week before the stock market crash of 1929 and it was also reportedly seen before Kennedy's assassination in 1963.
Abigail Adams' ghost has been seen hanging laundry in the East Room -- she appeared frequently during the Taft administration and as late as 2002 and is often accompanied by the smell of laundry soap.
Lincoln himself told his wife he dreamt of his own assassination three days before it actually happened. Calvin Coolidge's wife reported seeing Lincoln's ghost standing at a window of the Oval Office, hands clasped behind his back gazing out the window (just as Reagan's daughter saw a figure in a similar pose.) Franklin Roosevelt's valet ran screaming from the White House after seeing Lincoln's ghost. Eleanor Roosevelt, Ladybird Johnson and Gerald Ford's daughter Susan all sensed Lincoln's presence near the fireplace in the Lincoln Bedroom.
Schools prepare for the gunman
Students and teachers, police officers and EMTs, drill for the day they hope will never come

“Until some terrible, terrible events took place, schools were supposed to be places where we encouraged people to come. We wanted people, parents, to come visit our schools. But now with the way things are, we've all gone to lockdowns.”
Superintendent Dan Connor
By Erika Norton— Schools are prime targets for gunmen intent on mass slaughter. But, as one school security official pointed out, while New York State requires fire drills, it does not require active shooter drills.
“Fire drills are important, but when was the last time there was a fire in a school?” said Frank Squillante, the director of security and emergency preparedness for the Monroe-Woodbury School District. “I can't even remember. But if you pick up the newspapers or watch the news, there's a campus shooting in the United States of America. So, it's not a matter of ‘if,' it's a matter of ‘when.'”
Squillante's experience in security is long and hard-core. For 25 years he was head of emergency preparedness at Riker's Island Correctional Facility. Now at Monroe-Woodbury schools, the second-largest school district in Orange County, he has students and staff members practice lockdowns, lockouts, evacuation, and "relocation situations." Students and staff must know what to do if their school is under attack, at times when it's least expected.
“We do our drills at times that are not convenient for the school," Squillante said, offering examples: "When the caféteria is full with 400 kids, when the play is going on in the auditorium, when the PTA is having a meeting in the conference room. Every area has a plan of what they're going to do at that time of the day.”
The organization Everytown for Gun Safety said 2015 saw 24 gun incidents at K-12 schools across the country, 15 resulting in injury or death. In nine incidents, a gun was fired but no one was injured. The figures do not include attempted or completed suicides.
New York is one of 30 states that does not require lockdown drills, according to the Education Commission of the States. New York requires that schools have emergency plans in place, and recommends, but does not require, lockdown or active shooter drills.
New Jersey, on the other hand, requires schools to conduct one security drill every month during school hours and at least two of the following drills annually: active shooter, evacuation (non-fire), bomb threat, lockdown.
Police benefit from drills
Schools that hold drills collaborate with local police officers, who have an opportunity to become familiar with the school buildings in their community. The scene of an unfolding crisis should not be the first time EMTs and police officers see each other, Squillante said.
Chester's superintendent of schools, Sean Michel, said his district conducts two lockdown drills annually with the town police, one in the fall and one in the spring. Drills occur at both school buildings simultaneously. Half the officers and school staff report to the elementary school, while the other half stays with middle and high school students at the Chester Academy.
The Warwick schools also have lockdown drills. Administrators there have taken other measures to improve security, according to Dennis Tobin, director of human resources and safety and civil rights. Warwick schools now have sun shades that outsiders cannot see through. Ceilings are marked so that teachers know how far an intruder can see into a classroom, and where to hide.
“We try to stay on the cutting edge of new recommendations," Russo said.
He said it was "horrific" that the school was learning from every new mass killing. He wants to stage an active shooter drill where staff members can hear what gunshots sound like in a building.
Russo said parents are worried about trauma afflicting students as they face up to reality. And some studies say drawing attention to active shooter situations can be dangerous.
“If there is somebody within the community that's even thinking that way, it almost brings sensationalism to it, and there are some concerns,” Russo said.
The Goshen schools conduct lockdown drills at least once a year, according to Superintendent of Schools Daniel T. Connor. The district has a police officer on duty at the high school five days a week. Staff members, with local police officers, practice active shooter drills during staff development days.
In November, Squillante ran a drill at the North Main Elementary School, with members of the local ambulance corps and police department on the scene. “In a lot of these situations, it isn't until the police secure the building before the ambulance people can go in and treat possible victims, and people die because of that,” Squillante said.
Buzzers and background checks
Local schools also control access to their buildings. Most have a buzzer system that allows visitors entry only by someone inside the building.
Many schools, including some in the Monroe-Woodbury, Chester Union Free, and Warwick Valley districts, have cameras that turn on when a visitor presses the buzzer. Staff in the main office can see visitors on a screen before allowing them inside.
In addition to a buzzer system, Warwick's middle and high schools require visitors to scan their driver's licenses, so that a background check can be conducted upon entry, according to Superintendent of Schools Dennis Tobin.
Monroe-Woodbury is considering installing a similar system. In Goshen, visitors must show proof of identification.
With 43 years in education, Superintendent Connor reflected on the changes he's seen, brought on by the long spate of school tragedies.
“Until some terrible, terrible events took place, schools were supposed to be places where we encouraged people to come,” Connor said. “We wanted people, parents, to come visit our schools. But now with the way things are, we've all gone to lockdowns.”

Story highlights Jenner's SUV hit a car and pushed it into the path of an oncoming Hummer, police say
Driver of the car was killed, sheriff's deputy tells reporters
As police investigate scene, a fifth car went through barriers and crashed into two vehicles
(CNN) Former Olympic decathlon champion and reality TV star Bruce Jenner was involved in a fatal four-car accident in Southern California on Saturday, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said.
Jenner was driving a black Cadillac SUV that was the third vehicle involved in a multiple read-end collision, Sgt. Philip Brooks of the sheriff's department said.
The first vehicle was a black Prius that stopped short, CNN affiliate KCAL reported , citing deputies. Behind it was a white Lexus sedan that also hit its brakes.
Jenner's Escalade was towing a trailer with an all-terrain vehicle on it when it ran into the Lexus from behind, Brooks said. The Lexus spun into oncoming traffic and was hit by a Hummer H2. The driver of the Lexus was killed.
KCAL reported Jenner's SUV left skid marks.

I would like to announce the first release of Inline::F2003. The project features the program "matopmul.pl", which performs a matrix multiplication calculation, to showcase the use of Inline::F2003.
The project's URL is: https://sourceforge.net/projects/inline-f2003/
Inline::F2003 is a Perl extension module that allows program units written in modern FORTRAN to be added into the "__DATA__" section of a Perl program. The term "program units" is a collective FORTRAN term that refers to subroutines, functions, and module procedures. The module reads the FORTRAN source code, compiles it into object files, and builds a single shared library file.
Inline::F2003 is dependent on the "Inline" Perl extension module. In Inline terminology, Inline::F2003 is referred to as an ILSM (Inline Language Support Module). Inline performs many functions, including loading the shared library that was built and installed by the ILSM. Inline::F2003 operates differently to other ILSMs in that regard. The shared library that it builds must be loaded by Inline::C rather than Inline. This is discussed in more depth in the "README.txt" file of the project.
The FORTRAN source code that the module user would write must utilise the C Interoperability features of the FORTRAN 2003 standard and higher. The reason for this is that the FORTRAN program units must be callable from C, since Perl's native API is written in C. The compiler that the module user would choose must therefore be compatible with FORTRAN 2003. Older compilers that can only interpret FORTRAN 77 or FORTRAN 90 will definitely fail.
The FORTRAN compilers that have been tested, and are currently supported include:
GNU Fortran (free compiler, part of the GCC collection)
G95 Fortran (free compiler, standalone)
NAG Fortran (commercial compiler, developed by Numerical Algorithms Group)
This initial release of Inline::F2003 was developed and tested on Linux only. This will soon change so that Inline::F2003 is also supported on Apple OS X and Microsoft Windows systems. I would still encourage users to try running the program even if their system is non-Linux. I do hope you'll have an opportunity to try out the software, and report back your findings. If the program fails on your system, I would be so appreciative if you could submit a Sourceforge ticket for the project.
Thank you, and enjoy!
Does the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority have a data problem?
The T is becoming more transparent with data in many ways, as a fiscal control board and Governor Charlie Baker's administration try to turn around the beleaguered agency. For one, officials post daily performance statistics on an easy-to-read, easy-to-access website.
But the T has also repeatedly touted statistics comparing its performance in the last year to 2015 — which also happens to be the year Boston had its worst winter ever on the books.

Context is crucial here. Does it truly make sense to show how the T is doing this year compared with last year, when every problem that ails the MBTA (and believe me, there are many) was exacerbated by Mother Nature?
Get Metro Headlines in your inbox: The 10 top local news stories from metro Boston and around New England delivered daily. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here
For example, the T has touted data showing workers clocking in about 40 percent fewer overtime hours, comparing the first six months of 2016 with those months in 2015.
But if you compare the numbers with the same period during 2014, the drop is less dramatic — about 17 percent. And in 2014, overtime hours had already dropped 8 percent from 2013.
Officials have also said driver absences are down 23 percent from January to June, compared with last year, and they say the number of canceled bus trips is down 38 percent. I asked T officials for the 2014 numbers to create a better comparison, but officials weren't able to provide that data in time for publication.
Asked why the T doesn't use other comparisons more frequently to make up for the anomaly of 2015, a T spokesman did not respond for several days.

The T should still get some credit. A 17 percent drop in overtime hours is significant. And the T has reduced that figure in a big way: For this fiscal year, officials say they have only an $80 million shortfall, compared with their original estimate of $242 million.
But the comparisons rile some people, particularly data experts. Steven Koczela, the president of MassInc Polling, put it this way in a tweet: It's akin to taking credit for the weather.
Sunroofs in armored cars?
The Boston Carmen's Union on Friday pushed back against Governor Charlie Baker's claim that someone had cut unauthorized sunroofs into armored cars used by Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority workers.
“These trucks have the exact same roofs from when they were purchased two decades ago,” Boston Carmen's Union president James O'Brien said in a statement. “This baseless allegation is proof that this administration will do anything to try to justify privatization.”
The union on Friday called Baker's statement “pure fiction” and released photographs of a partial fiberglass ceiling on the tops of the armored cars.

The back-and-forth about the sunroofs on armored cars came as Baker and MBTA officials made moves to privatize the agency's cash-counting operation, known at the agency as “the money room.” On Friday, the agency released a request for proposals asking companies to bid on taking over the operation.
Baker mentioned the makeshift sunroofs Wednesday as part of a wide-ranging speech detailing the progress the administration has made in improving the beleaguered agency.
On Friday, Billy Pitman, a spokesman for the governor's office, defended the governor's statement, saying it was “consistent” with an independent audit that showed the roofs had been altered after the vehicles had been bought.
“The facts are clear: The money room's operations are sub-par at best, from the alarms to the doors, and to the trucks, it is clear the status quo cannot continue at the MBTA,” he wrote in a statement, adding that the administration would continue to push to use privatization as a way to “reform the MBTA.”
The MBTA has not made a copy of the audit available.
In recent weeks, the agency released several details from the audit that showed security lapses, such as duct-taped doors to the agency's money vault and doors being propped open in a facility that is supposed to be secure. The agency also quietly replaced several Transit Police officers with security guards from the private company G4S.
Seven drivers in the department who use the armored trucks to collect cash across the Boston region have also received notices that said they would no longer have jobs in the money room, but they could return to their previous jobs as bus drivers for the T.
Workers who clean MBTA fear cuts
The workers who clean the MBTA's stations are worried about impending layoffs, saying that they were told the MBTA is asking its janitorial service contractors to cut positions.
The MBTA currently outsources its cleaning services to two companies: ABM Industries and S.J. Services. In 2013, the T signed a three-year contract, with a possible two-year extension, with the companies for a total of $61.8 million.
Roxana Rivera, the vice president of the 32BJ Service Employees International Union District 615, said the companies told union workers that T officials said they are seeking additional cuts.
Rivera said such layoffs would only hurt riders, who are already paying higher fares.
The staff “is already cut to the bone, and we have workers cleaning multiple stations,” she said. “The T is going to be messier, given the type of cleaning that's needed. We don't believe that it's going to do anything to solve the T's financial problem.”
MBTA officials and representatives from ABM Industries and S.J. Services did not respond to requests for comment.

Hello and welcome to the DailyDrip's emacs videos.
In this first video we will take a look at some of the language that is required to be able to understand emacs content online, and we will take a look at some of the basic actions required to be productive with emacs quickly. We will also take a look at the interface because it's important to know what we're looking at, and there's not that much fundamentally, even though it's kinda foreign the first time.
So, let's dive right in.
What we're looking at right now is the splash screen. It is just what you see when you launch emacs, there's nothing special about it. It's called a buffer . Everything in emacs is a buffer. Everything that you look at. The container for text in emacs is a buffer. So that means that this is just a buffer. We can do many things with buffers. Let's create a buffer ourselves and type stuff in it.
So, Control + x, Control + f ( C-x C-f ) is how we go to find a file, as you can see at the bottom. We're going to create something in the tmp directory and we'll call it foo.rb because, why not.
So this is a new file, if you look at the bottom, emacs tells us that we visited a file that didn't exist. This is not a problem.
We can type things, and you can see that when I press enter it's indenting for me, which is very kind. So, this is how a dog would speak. Woof .
class Dog def speak "Woof" end end
And, that's it. You can repeat that with everything. We can do the same thing with a Javascript file, with a C file, and so forth.
So now let's save this, because it would be a shame to lose this very hard work, this very elegant code that I wrote here. Saving is very simple, you just do it with Control + x, Control + s ( C-x C-s ), and you can see at the bottom, it says Wrote /tmp/foo.rb . That's really quite convenient.
So now let's take a look at what we have at the very bottom. We have this U -- this is the modeline. We have U:--- . This is the state of the buffer. Right now it has three dashes, that means it's unmodified. If I make changes to it, like press enter and add a new line, there are two stars U:**- , which means it's modified again. I can undo or I can just save again and you'll see we're back to three dashes.
To the right of that is the name of the buffer, foo.rb , you saw me type that earlier, it's not a surprise, it's just a good place to have it, you know that the filename is there.
To the right of that is the word All , that's just telling you how much of the file you can see right now. If the file is very big you'll only see how far you are in it, so you'll see Top or Bottom or a percentage of how far you are in it.
To the right of that, you can see L3 which is the line number.
And to the right of that, you can see the word Ruby . That tells us that this is a Ruby file. This is the major mode . So let's take a quick look at what would happen if I created a file called foo.js . I visit a file with C-x C-f , I call it foo.js , it's a new file again and it says JavaScript . So I can write any Javascript I want, I can create a function, and again like in Ruby it indents the way I want it to. And then I can save it and everything works just fine.
console . log ( "Hello!" ); function foo () { return "hi!" ; }
I can switch between the two with Control + x then b then enter ( C-x b RET ) just like so and you'll even notice that the indentation is different. It indents Javascript with four spaces and Ruby with two. So those are what we call major modes , those are the driving engines for the buffer. That is how emacs thinks about things, how it will make particular choices about this buffer, and it is also how we as humans will think about what we're editing generally.
So that's really all you need to think about when you hear major mode is, this is the level of thinking that a human makes about this editing.
There are also minor modes, because of course, if you have MAJOR modes, you will have MINOR modes. Minor modes are secondary modifications. We will get into them later, they are very powerful and very useful, but for this first video they're no very interesting to us.
We're going to end this video by discussing keyboard shortcuts. So let's take a quick look.. Ah.. Let's cancel this with Control + g ( C-g ) and create a file called keyboard-shortcuts.txt and you'll see this is a buffer in Text mode.
So, if you want to read emacs content online you will read a lot of keyboard shortcuts. You will see things like this for instance: C-x d . This C means press the Control key . The - means keep it pressed , x means press x , and because there's nothing afterwards it means release x and release Control , and then d means press and release d .
So: it would be Press Control, press x, release x, release Control, press d, release d .
You will also see things like M-e . M is the Meta key. This would be press the Meta key , whatever that is, keep it pressed, press e, release e, release the Meta key. The Meta key is just the alt key, or the option key on OSX. There's no mystery, that's just the name it has because emacs existed before those keys were called alt or option.
Finally let's end the screencast with the most important keyboard shortcut, C-x C-c which is how you exit emacs.
This one has two Control keys in a row, and the way you would do that is press Control, press x, release x, then you can keep Control pressed because the next key also requires Control, so you can press c and release c, then release Control. One ore time, this would be 1. press Control 2. keep it pressed 3. press x 4. release x 5. press c 6. release c 7. release Control
So that's it, that's all you need to know to get started with emacs. Thank you for watching, and join us next time.
Reinaldo Ilarraza, 2B, Single-A Fort Wayne
Forget the numbers—he's struck out at a 34 percent clip in 24 professional games—the best indicator about what the Padres think about Ilarraza might be the assignment. He's 10 days younger than the more hyped Fernando Tatis Jr., just 18 and already in Single-A ball. He's nearly 3.5 years younger than the average player at this level.
After suffering though some injuries last year, it would have been reasonable for Illarraza to stay back in the Arizona Rookie League to start 2017, then progress to Low-A Tri-City by the summer. Instead, the Padres skipped that option and ambitiously sent him to full-season Fort Wayne, where he's flanked by similarly young teammates like the Tatis, Eguy Rosario, and Hudson Potts. It's clear that the Padres aren't scared to challenge certain prospects, and with all four of these guys playing on the infield, there's a chance they could play together a bunch in the minors.
Ilarraza, signed out of Venezuela in July 2015 for $300,000, gets good reports for his baseball instincts but isn't without plus tools. He plays stronger than his 5-foot-10, 150-pound frame, and word is he has enough arm strength to play short in the long run. Right now, with Tatis at short, he's playing mostly second base, but there's a decent chance he'll slide over to short more regularly once an opportunity opens. Not even listed in Baseball America's Padres top 30, Ilarraza is an under-the-radar prospect to watch. (Sac Bunt Dustin)
Jorge Ona, OF, Single-A Fort Wayne
The Padres gave Jorge Ona a $7 million bonus last summer, the second largest of any player they signed. Ona wasn't a typical July 2nd signing. He's already 20 years old and is already projected to a corner outfield spot. Whereas most J2 kids are held back in extended Spring Training until the Dominican Summer League starts, Ona's already playing full-season ball at Fort Wayne.
It's still extremely early, but through 11 games Ona's hitting .277/.333/.362 for the TinCaps. The slash line doesn't yet reflect the scouting report, as Ona's calling was his power and advanced feel for hitting.
AJ Preller to the Journal Gazette, just before the season: “Compact swing. He's got a really good bat path. Hits the ball very hard. As you look at hitters, there are a lot of good components he brings to the table as a corner outfielder.”
Still, it's evident that 51 plate appearances in, Ona hasn't been overmatched. It's even more noteworthy considering he hadn't played competitive baseball since competing in the Pan American Games in Mexico in late 2014.
Hopefully as Ona gets more adjusted to life in the states, and the weather starts warming up, we'll start seeing his power potential and he'll emerge as a top bat in a system that's suddenly bereft of them. (Oscar)
Fernando Tatis Jr., SS, Single-A Fort Wayne
Tatis Jr. got a game-tying double on Tuesday, a game-winning single yesterday, and he hit a monstrous home run a week and half ago, but he's striking out—a lot. Outside of the hit, he whiffed in all three of his other plate appearances yesterday, marking his ninth consecutive game with at least one strike out. Overall, on the very early season, he's hitting .163/.226/.245, with 19 strike outs and three walks in 52 plate appearances.
The good news is that Tatis is extremely young. He's just 18 years old and prior to this year had played in just 55 professional games. By my count, he's the fifth-youngest player in the entire Midwest League, just months (or days) older than Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Isaac Paredes, and teammates Ilarraza and Rosario. Most of the players Tatis is playing against—particularly the pitchers—are three or four years older than him. In many respects, he should be struggling.
Of course, that doesn't mean we shouldn't be concerned with his performance. If there's any one thing that's going to derail a prospect like Tatis—one full of power and speed and athleticism—it's the almighty hit tool. He's striking out 37 percent of the time, an indicator that he's struggling with the more advanced pitchers of this level. He'll have to adjust, obviously.
Just for comparison, the slightly younger Guerrero Jr. has just seven strike outs and nine walks in 48 plate appearances on the season. For further context, I decided to look up some current MLB stars who followed a similar early professional path to Tatis (limited pro experience, first appearance at A-ball, super young). How'd they fare, both early in the season and later on in that introduction to Single-A?
Everyone develops in different ways. Lindor went right into Single-A and didn't miss a beat. He actually struck out more later in the year, though he also added walks. Same thing with Machado at an even more extreme rate. Look at Correa, though. He struck out a lot in April of his first month in Single-A (the Midwest League, to be exact), after entering the season with 50 games of pro experience in rookie ball from the previous season (plus some winter league play), all at 18 years old. That is the Tatis path. He even had a Tatis-like 11-game stretch with at least one whiff, over which he struck out 36 percent of the time.
Then, something clicked. In May, he dropped his strikeout rate all the way down to 12.2 percent, and he had just one multi-K game in the entire month. From June 23 to July 4, he had a 38 PA run without striking out once. Bogaerts, too, lowered his K-rate at every minor league stop, and now he's a .300-hitting big-league shortstop with a very workable 18.5 percent strikeout rate.
(By the way, I don't necessarily mean to put Tatis on this level as a prospect. These are elite guys, and they were mostly viewed that way at the time. He's not quite there yet. Again, just providing some context.)
If it wasn't obvious already, Tatis has plenty of time to reduce his strikeouts significantly this year. Whether he does it or not—well, that's why we watch. (Sac Bunt Dustin)
Luis Urias, SS/2B, Double-A San Antonio
Even if Tatis Jr. is the best position player prospect in the system, in this writer's eyes, Urias is legitimate competition for that crown.
First off, what's the deal with him playing shortstop? Most of the stuff I read about him last year seemed to indicate that his arm would be stretched at third and that his range might even be stretched some at second. His best positon was “hitter,” and shortstop was never really a consideration, even though he had received some scattered playing time there. Now he's playing short, the most demanding defensive position, every day in the minors, an experiment that started in spring training, continued into the World Baseball Classic, and has rolled right through the first month of his Double-A debut. It should be noted that fellow San Antonio shortstop Jose Rondon is injured, which has likely contributed some to Urias playing there.
I haven't heard (or seen) much on his performance at short, but it probably can't hurt that he's playing there. Second and short are relatively interchangeable, so it's not like he's losing a lot of development when he switches back to second. Further, it never hurts to have a little added versatility, in case he must play short in a pinch at a higher level. And maybe, just maybe he proves capable of sticking at the position.
Second . . . to steal a line from Oscar, the boy can hit. It should be no surprise to anyone who has followed his minor-league career, but Urias is hitting in San Antonio. He hits wherever he goes.
His current line stands at .261/.333/.478, with five walks and six strikeouts in 52 plate appearances. Urias just doesn't strike out, as he now sports a 7.2 career strikeout percentage. That's an otherworldly figure considering Urias—not yet 20 and already in Double-A—has always been extremely young for his leagues. With all the usual caveats about small sample sizes, what's most encouraging about his early numbers from Double-A is the power, as he's already popped two home runs, two doubles, and a triple in 12 games after a lackluster power showing in the hitter-friendly Cal League last season.
We're getting close to the point where it'll be an upset if Urias isn't at least a useful big-league bat someday. The bigger question might be where he plays defensively, and how his secondary skills support his hitting. (Sac Bunt Dustin)

Or maybe it's back to Hofstadter, citing Adorno (sorry, governor Palin, this post is probably one you'll want to skip):
From clinical interviews and thematic apperception tests, Adorno and his co-workers found that their pseudo-conservative subjects, although given to a form of political expression that combines a curious mixture of largely conservative with occasional radical notions, succeed in concealing from themselves impulsive tendencies that, if released into action, would be very far from conservative. The pseudo-conservative, Adorno writes, shows conventionality and authoritarian submissiveness" in his conscious thinking and "violence, anarchic impulses and chaotic destructiveness in the unconscious sphere. The pseudo-conservative is a man who, in the name of upholding traditional American values and institutions and defending them from largely fictitious dangers, consciously or unconsciously aims at their abolition.
John Yoo anyone? Dick Cheney? I can think of few examples of this more telling than the suspension of habeas corpus, the enactment of preventative war as policy and the institutionalization of torture as the celebration of American traditional values. So Hofstadter helps me understand how a movement based on inalienable individual freedom had nothing to say about the most authoritarian period in the American executive branch in their lifetimes. But the maintenance of shrill ideology against reality is still the most prevalent feature. Hofstadter noted some classic examples from a previous era that seem plucked from Fox News today:
The lady who, when general Eisenhower's victory over Robert Taft had finally become official, stalked out of the Hilton Hotel declaiming "This means eight more years of socialism" was probably a fairly good representative of the pseudo-conservative mentality ... [So also was] the general who told [the Freedom Congress] , demanding an Air Force capable of wiping out the Russian Air Force and industry in one sweep, but also a "material reduction in military expenditures ..." the people who a few years ago believed simultaneously that we had no business fighting communism in Korea, but that the war should be immediately extended to an Asia-wide crusade against communism ...
It all sounds weirdly familiar, doesn't it? The cognitive dissonance and the obvious human misery behind it:
The pseudo-conservative believes himself to be living in a world in which he is spied upon, plotted against, betrayed and very likely destined for total ruin. He feels that his liberties have been arbitrarily and outrageously invaded ... he is the most bitter of all our citizens about our involvement in wars past but seems not the least concerned about avoiding the next one.
Brutally accurate, no? What you see is the predominance of acute alienation - the opposite of a natural conservative at peace with the world as it is - and the intensity of emotional rage it provokes. I would add one thing to this analysis. The Bush-Cheney presidency was, in some respects, the perfect pseudo-conservative administration. They waged war based on loathing of the experts (damned knowledgeable elites!); they slashed taxes and boosted spending for their constituencies, while pretending to be fiscally responsible; they tore up the most ancient taboos - against torture - with a bravado that will one day seem obscene; and they left the country in far worse shape than they found it.
Jan Krissler, also know by his alias "Starbug," told a conference of hackers he has copied the thumbprint of German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen. Speaking at the 31st annual conference of the Chaos Computer Club in Hamburg, Krissler highlighted the dangers in relying on security technology.
Krissler explained that he didn't even need an object that von der Leyen had touched to create the copy. Using several close-range photos in order to capture every angle, Krissler used a commercially available software called VeriFinger to create an image of the minister's fingerprint.
Along with fellow hacker Tobias Fiebig, Krissler has been working at the Technical University of Berlin on research into weaknesses of biometric security systems. Krissler pulled a similar stunt in 2008 with a fingerprint of then interior minister and current Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble.
Krissler intends to show how systems which use these prints or iris scans to verify identity, which are becoming more prevalent and popular, can be outsmarted. He gave the example of facial recognition software that can be fooled by a person's photograph, as well as showing how his fake fingerprint can trick the iPhone fingerprint sensor.
In 2013, Krissler made a comment about how he trusted his passwords far more than his fingerprints, according to Spiegel Online. Spiegel also reported another security hole from the conference: reading a user's PIN code from reflections in their pupils while taking selfies.
The Chaos Computer Club, or CCC, is the largest hacker organization in Europe.

Story highlights The Chinese Communist Party faces "severe challenges," Xi says
China's new elite group of leaders is presented to the news media
Xi Jinping becomes head of the powerful Central Military Commission
The event follows months of secretive deal-making and rumors
China on Thursday unveiled the elite group of leaders who will set the agenda for the country for the next decade, the culmination of months of secretive bargaining and a carefully choreographed performance of political pomp.
The seven members of the powerful committee that sits atop the Chinese system strode out onto a stage in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. They were led by Xi Jinping , who takes over from Hu Jintao as head of the Communist Party, which has ruled China for more than 60 years.
Xi is joined on the new Politburo Standing Committee, the party's top decision-making body, by Li Keqiang, who is expected to replace Wen Jiabao as premier early next year, and five other veteran party officials.
Although the committee's lineup is new, analysts said it appeared to be predominantly conservative and unlikely to bring about meaningful political changes in the world's most populous nation and second largest economy.

Xi also succeeded Hu as head of China's powerful Central Military Commission, which oversees major national security and military affairs. That makes for a cleaner transition than in the past two power handovers, when the former party chiefs held onto the key military role for years afterward, using it to keep exercising considerable power and influence.
A far cry from the relentless media campaigns and frequent public appearances of U.S. presidential candidates, the efforts to determine who ended up in China's most powerful posts have taken place behind closed doors, part of a once-in-a-decade leadership transition.
The focal point of the process has been the party's 18th National Congress that has unfolded amid heavy security in Beijing over the past week.
Despite the spectacular economic and social changes China has undergone in recent times, the party has maintained a tight grip on power and upheld its obscure methods for selecting its top leaders.
The consequences of the leadership handover are significant for the nation's 1.3 billion citizens, its neighbors in Asia and the United States, which is warily watching China's economic and military rise.
Standing in front of a huge landscape painting on Thursday, Xi brought a touch of cordiality to the start of his speech before a packed room of reporters, apologetically acknowledging that he and his party colleagues had kept their audience waiting by appearing later than scheduled.
But he quickly turned to serious matters, warning of the "many severe challenges" that the party faces.
He singled out corruption, remoteness from the general public, as well as undue emphasis on formalities and bureaucracy as particular concerns.

The secrecy and exclusivity of the procedure by which China's top leaders are selected, involving maneuvering and deal-making among senior party figures, leaves a lot of the country's citizens feeling detached from the process.
"Many ordinary people don't feel so excited or joyful about what's happening," said Lijia Zhang, a Beijing-based author. "People say, 'Oh, it's the party's business, nothing to do with us -- and we do not have a say in selecting the leader or the policy.' "
But Xi's speech had more of a human touch than many of those delivered by Chinese officials, and he addressed subjects close to the heart of many Chinese people and others around the world.
"Our people have great enthusiasm in life," he said. "They hope for better education, more stable jobs, more satisfactory income, more reliable social security, medical services with higher standards, more comfortable living conditions and a more beautiful environment."
What kind of changes Xi, 59, and those joining him on the party's most powerful committee are likely to usher in over the coming years remains shrouded in mystery.
"Xi Jinping is in many ways an unknown commodity," said Mike Chinoy, a former CNN correspondent and now a senior fellow at the University of Southern California's U.S.-China Institute. "He's risen to the top of the Chinese system by being very careful not to disclose what he really thinks."
The son of one of Mao Zedong's top lieutenants, Xi is considered a "princeling" because of his family's place in the Communist Party aristocracy. He is also believed to be close to the Chinese military.
Married to a popular folk singer for the People's Liberation Army, he has climbed through the party hierarchy, at one point holding the top job in the eastern metropolis of Shanghai. He is expected to inherit the title of president from Hu, 69, early next year.
Some observers have expressed hope that the next decade could bring a degree of political reform as Chinese leaders seek to bolster their legitimacy, which has been eroded by widespread corruption and the dramatic scandal this year involving the former senior party official Bo Xilai.
But many analysts are skeptical about the willingness of leaders to adopt significant changes, noting the concentration of power and money at the top of the party. The new set of leaders appears set to uphold the status quo, according to Willy Lam, a history professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
"By and large, we have a conservative team," Lam said following the announcement of the new Standing Committee. "We can expect no substantial or meaningful movement toward political reform."
The new leaders are likely to be "in favor of staying the course, maintaining political stability and defusing challenges to the party's authority," he said.
The new Standing Committee is more streamlined than its previous incarnation, dropping for nine members to seven. The smaller committee may help bring about greater unity and efficiency at the top of the party, some experts say.
Besides Xi and Li, the members of the elite committee are Zhang Dejiang, Yu Zhengsheng, Liu Yunshan, Wang Qishan and Zhang Gaoli.
The new lineup shows that Jiang Zemin, the 86-year-old former party chief who preceded Hu, still maintains heavy clout in the Communist hierarchy, said Cheng Li , director of research at the John L. Thornton Center at the Brookings Institution.
The composition of the committee is "not a surprise but a disappointment," he said, adding that it was dominated by people loyal to Jiang.
He said some Chinese people would be disappointed about the decision not to include Liu Yuanchao and Wang Yang, senior officials who he described as "strong advocates for political reform."
The next chance to refresh the Standing Committee's membership will occur in five years, when the Communist Party's next National Congress takes place.
For the time being, the committee remains a men's club with no woman among its new members. Since the Standing Committee's creation in 1949, no woman has ever held a position on it.
Despite speculation that Liu Yandong, the lone female member of the wider Politburo, might be tapped for the elite group, she was not among the seven members who marched across the stage Thursday.
Her age may have been a disadvantage in her candidacy, according to the Hoover Institution, which is based at Stanford University. Liu was born in 1945 and has been a member of the Politburo since 2007.
Women lag in political representation in China. Only 2.2% of working women were in charge of the state offices, party organizations and other enterprises or institutions, according to the Third Survey on Chinese Women's Social Status, a national survey released last year.
The number of women on the 25-member Politburo has increased, though, from one to two: Sun Chunlan, the party secretary of Fujian province, joins Liu, who was already a member.
The reaction from China's neighbors to the unveiling of the new leadership reflected its complicated relationships in the Asia-Pacific region.
Japan, which is locked in a tense territorial dispute with China over a group of small islands in the East China Sea, said it hoped "the mutually beneficial relationship based on common strategic interest will be further developed and enhanced with the new leadership."
Kim Jong-un, the young leader of North Korea, sent a message congratulating Xi on his new position, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency.
Kim's message stressed the long "friendship" between the two countries. China is the reclusive North Korean regime's main ally, providing it with vital economic support.
CLOSE Comedian and writer Kumail Nanjiani commencement speech at Grinnell College where he was a 2001 graduate. Rodney White/The Register
Buy Photo Comedian and writer Kumail Nanjiani gives the commencement speech at Grinnell College Monday, May 22, 2017, where he graduated from in 2001. Described as "the future of funny" by GQ magazine, the Pakistan native earned a bachelor's degree in computer science and philosophy before moving to Chicago then New York City. He became a go-to guest on popular TV shows such as "The Colbert Report," "Veep" and "Portlandia."

When Kumail Nanjiani arrived at Grinnell College from Pakistan nearly 20 years ago, he was a devout Muslim who had never romantically touched a girl and was going to get a degree that would guarantee him a job.
“By the time I graduated, I was basically a Rastafarian with a white American girlfriend and a philosophy degree,” the comedian and actor told 390 graduating seniors Monday during the 171-year-old college's commencement.
Nanjiani had also never experienced stand-up comedy until his fellow classmates at Grinnell showed him a video of Jerry Seinfeld. He later worked up enough nerve to do his own set at Bob's Underground on campus.
"Before America was my home, Iowa was my home," he said.
Graduating in 2001 with degrees in both philosophy and computer science – “because although I had changed, my parents hadn't” – Nanjiani moved to Chicago, got a computer science job through his Grinnell connections and spent most of his nights honing his stand-up skills.
After averaging about four hours of sleep a night for the next five years, he went on to New York City to become a professional comedian and earned spots on “The Colbert Report,” “Key and Peele,” “Portlandia” and “Silicon Valley.” His first movie, “The Big Sick” – which he co-wrote with his wife, Emily Gordon – is scheduled for wide release this summer.
Sundance: Kumail Nanjiani on his breakout 'Big Sick' and Trump-era comedy
But none of that success — whether in life or love — seemed a certainty at Nanjiani's graduation ceremony back in 2001.
“Sixteen years ago almost to the day, I sat where you are sitting, trying to stay awake, while a very smart man said some very smart things – I think,” he said. “I cannot be sure they were smart, because I couldn't focus on anything but the gaping maw of uncertainty facing me at that moment.”
Nanjiani said he had no suggestions on what do do about that "gaping maw,” but he did offer today's graduates a few standard pieces of advice on what has worked for him over the years.
Find something that you like doing – something that satisfies you – and do it for just that day. “I never thought (about the) big picture,” he said. “That would have overwhelming. So what I'm saying is, you can go slow. Allow your dreams and goals to change, but live an intentional life.”
“I never thought (about the) big picture,” he said. “That would have overwhelming. So what I'm saying is, you can go slow. Allow your dreams and goals to change, but live an intentional life.” Be okay with failure. “Nobody is paying attention to your failure,” he said. “The world is full of people failing. People are failing all around you. Failure is boring. Your failure will not be so spectacular that people will write articles about your failure or even remember your failure.”
“Nobody is paying attention to your failure,” he said. “The world is full of people failing. People are failing all around you. Failure is boring. Your failure will not be so spectacular that people will write articles about your failure or even remember your failure.” Populate your life with people different than you. “Being a fish out of water is tough, but that's how you evolve," he said. "I think that scientifically accurate, I don't know. I had a liberal arts education.”
In the biggest laugh line of his speech, Nanjiani also offered some non-standard advice based on his experience falling in love with and marrying a woman so very different than the future spouse his Pakistani parents imagined for him.
“Seeing her white Southern family and my Pakistani family gather, it was beautiful," he said. "I don't have words. So here's another concrete piece of advice: have sex with an immigrant. We're going through a tough time. And it would be really great for morale. And it would make sure that you will definitely be on the right side of history.”

Nanjiani grew serious, however, in offering a shout out to the families of the 50 graduating international students who had traveled to the U.S. for this event.
“As nervous as you were to get through customs and immigration, I hope that you were just as proud to watch your children walk across the stage, and I hope that today, you see the America that we love,” he said.
He also took issue with a recent tweet made by U.S. Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, claiming that civilization can't be restored “with somebody else's babies.”
“That is not the Iowa I know," Nanjiani said. "The Iowa I know understands that there is no such thing as somebody else's babies. ... This was the second place in my life that felt like I was home — different, weird, but not strange.”
After his speech, Nanjiani was given an honorary doctorate of humane letters “for pursuing comedy that is both incisive and deeply heartfelt and for succeeding at this work at the very highest levels.”
He texted his parents during the ceremony to let them know that they finally have a doctor for a son.
Editor's note: An earlier version of this story misspelled the name of Nanjiani's wife, Emily Gordon.

The Conservatives have overtaken the UK Independence Party in the polls ahead of this week's European Parliament elections.
The Tories are now in second place behind Labour in the contest to elect MEPs across Britain on Thursday, according to ICM/Sunday Telegraph results.
The Conservatives have also edged ahead of Labour in the battle to win next year's general election, the survey found.
Last month, ICM's survey for this newspaper put the Tories in a distant third place, on 22 per cent, behind the UK Independence Party on 27 per cent and Labour on 30 per cent.
The Ukip Leader, Nigel Farage, has predicted that his party will come first in Thursday's national vote and even senior Conservatives have privately conceed they are likely to come third.
But the new poll, which asked 2,000 adults, suggested the European elections have become a much closer fight, with the Conservatives winning background they had lost to Ukip.
Labour is still in first place, but down one point to 29 per cent, the Conservatives are up four points to 26 per cent and Ukip has dropped two points to 25 per cent. The Liberal Democrats are on 7 per cent.
Martin Boon, director of ICM Research, said the volatile polling in recent weeks showed the European elections were wide open.
“Usually, polls give a pretty clear picture of what's going to happen at any major election. Not so here. Labour could win, as could the Tories, or maybe Ukip,” he said.
ICM's separate Wisdom Index poll put the Tories on 31.4 per cent, to Labour's 30.7 per cent.
The slim lead of 0.7 points follows two polls last week which showed David Cameron's party with a two-point advantage over Labour, his first poll lead since 2012.
The Liberal Democrats are on 15.1 per cent in the latest ICM results, ahead of the UK Independence Party on 13.4 per cent.
Trends and changes in the Wisdom Index ratings, which ask respondents to predict the next election result, tend to be less dramatic than conventional polls, which ask individuals how they personally intend to vote.
However, a clear pattern has emerged of declining support for Labour in recent weeks.
The previous ICM/Sunday Telegraph Wisdom Index survey, published on May 4, showed Labour's lead cut to just one point. It has now disappeared.
:: ICM Research interviewed an online sample of 2,033 adults aged 18+ on 14th and 15th May.

“Marvel's Agents of SHIELD” has cast Adrianne Palicki as Marvel hero Bobbi Morse (aka Mockingbird) in season 2, Variety has confirmed.
Mockingbird is described as a super-spy who will make her first appearance in the fifth episode of “SHIELD's” second season — but she may not be an ally to the newly promoted Director Coulson (Clark Gregg) and his team.
It's not Palicki's first superhero role — the “Friday Night Lights” alumna starred as the titular heroine in NBC's ill-fated “Wonder Woman” pilot, and appeared in The CW's scuttled “Aquaman” pilot in 2006. She reunited with “FNL” showrunner Jason Katims last season for a recurring role on NBC's “About A Boy,” which she will reprise in season two.
Palicki joins other season 2 cast additions including Lucy Lawless as Isabelle Hartley, a veteran SHIELD agent; Nick Blood as mercenary Lance Hunter; Reed Diamond as Daniel Whitehall, a HYDRA agent known as the Kraken; Henry Simmons as SHIELD agent Alphonso “Mac” Mackenzie, and Simon Kassianides as Bakshi, a loyal right-hand man.
The introduction of Mockingbird was teased at the show's recent Comic-Con panel in San Diego, where she was mentioned in a video clip featuring two of Patton Oswalt's Agent Koenig characters.
Palicki is repped by WME and Anonymous Content. “Marvel's Agents of SHIELD” premieres Tuesday, Sept. 23 at 9 p.m. on ABC.
The challenges have been both great and small for eighth-ranked Houston this season, and the next obstacle might prove especially dangerous for the rolling Cougars if they aren't attentive.
Houston (26-1, 13-1 American Athletic Conference) travels to Greenville, N.C., on Wednesday to take on the scuffling East Carolina Pirates. The Cougars have won 11 consecutive games, secured their highest national ranking on the season and are playing with supreme confidence. And, they've finally generated the national attention to complement their play, with ESPN's College GameDay scheduled for its first visit on Saturday when Houston hosts UCF.
The mood on Saturday would be dampened significantly if the Cougars were to stub their toe against the Pirates, whom they defeated 94-50 at home on Jan. 23. Such a result seems highly unlikely given the respective trajectories of the two programs, but it's difficult for the Cougars to not have one eye focused on this weekend given all the corresponding hoopla.
"Well here's our little chance to shine," Houston coach Kelvin Sampson said. "Little old University of Houston jumping up, swinging with the big boys, and that's something to take pride in. I'm happy for our fans, I'm happy for our alumni, but more importantly, I'm happy for our players."
Given how intently Sampson coaches the Cougars, he will surely have their full attention on Wednesday. Yet, with Cincinnati just one game behind the Cougars in the conference standings, Houston can't afford to look ahead to a coronation.
"It can be any of these programs in the position we are today," Sampson said. "Look at us five years ago. No one would have ever thought College GameDay would be coming to the University of Houston, I know that.
"Next year it could be one of the other (AAC) programs. I wouldn't be surprised if it if's not Memphis or Connecticut or Cincinnati, SMU, Temple -- it could be anybody."
The Pirates (10-16, 3-11 AAC) snapped a five-game skid with their 85-81 victory at Tulane last Saturday, a win that came on the heels of a frustrating home loss against Tulsa. East Carolina had dropped 10 of 11 before completing a season sweep of the Green Wave, with two of the previous three losses coming in overtime by a total of eight points.
The Pirates' 77-73 loss to the Golden Hurricane provided a teaching point, and the results were immediate. Given the season-long struggles, the response against Tulane was gratifying, if not somewhat foreshadowed.
"This is part of the process of trying to learn how to win," Pirates coach Joe Dooley said. "The first step is staying in the game, which we're doing a better job of doing.
"I think what we're learning to do is we're learning how to play hard and compete to win. I think there's a difference. I think you can play hard, but that doesn't mean you're playing to win. I think they're learning how to compete and trying to win a game."

Traditional Asset Tokenization
Stephen McKeon Blocked Unblock Follow Aug 11, 2017
Tokenization of traditional assets in the coming years will have an impact on liquidity across multiple asset classes. The implications of this statement are relevant to all investors, including both traditional and crypto, for reasons I detail in this post.
I. Liquidity: The driving force behind traditional asset tokenization
Let's start by defining liquidity. Liquidity is not binary, it is a continuum. Illiquid does not necessarily mean “unable to trade,” it means “costly to trade.” Liquidity is related to trading volume and can be measured using price impact from trading, or by observing the bid-ask spread.
An example: When I was a kid I found a Darryl Strawberry rookie card in a pack of Topps. By the late 1980's, Beckett Monthly listed the value at something like $50.
Darryl Strawberry rookie card
Upon opening my Beckett Monthly, I thought: “That's 100 Snickers bars!” I was ten years old so 100 Snickers bars had a lot of utility value to me back then. I wanted to trade.
I marched over to my local card shop, presented the card to Calvin, the owner, and requested $50. Calvin offered me $10. Sadly, that was the only card shop within walking distance, and I had binding transportation constraints since I was only 10. Calvin represented the only market participant. I accepted $10. This is the “bid” in financial jargon. Calvin then put it on the shelf with a $50 price tag (the “ask”). This is an example of a very large bid-ask spread, therefore, the Darryl Strawberry rookie card is considered a relatively illiquid asset.
The advent of sites like eBay made life a lot better for baseball card traders because it opened up competitive markets with more participants and volume, and assets could be bought and sold with smaller spreads and less price impact. All things equal, additional liquidity increases the expected value from trade.
This post is not about baseball cards, so let's extend this framework to think about other assets like equity in private companies. A share of stock that's traded on an exchange is of higher value than a share of stock in an identical private company because there are fewer frictions to trade the public stock. Fewer frictions often mean more market participants, more volume, smaller spreads, and less price impact. We think of the difference in value between the public company and identical private company as an “illiquidity discount,” or analogously a “liquidity premium.”
How big is the illiquidity discount? Financial economists have attempted to measure the illiquidity discount in a variety of ways. A common rule of thumb is 20–30%. This represents a huge amount of value and therein lies great promise. Tokenizing relatively illiquid assets and creating a market in which to trade these tokens can reduce the illiquidity discount substantially by reducing frictions to trade. Traditional assets will tokenize because they will lose the liquidity premium if they don't.
II. Traditional asset token use cases
This tweet by @naval is profound and extends well beyond traditional asset tokenization. However, it certainly applies to all the assets currently characterized by low liquidity that will get tokenized in the future. Let's briefly unpack a couple of these.
Blockchain Capital as an example of traditional asset tokenization. Typically, investors in venture capital (VC) funds, known as limited partners (LPs), are locked up for 10 years, and for good reason: VC funds invest in illiquid securities and cannot fulfill redemption requests in the interim. In so doing, the liquidity premium is a component of VC returns.
There are often fund-level restrictions that prevent LP investors from trading their positions and VCs have historically not gone out of their way to facilitate trade for their LPs. Blockchain Capital has demonstrated that this model can be disrupted. They executed a portion of the fundraising for their recent VC fund by issuing a blockchain token (BCAP). In doing so, the fund receives the capital they need to invest in illiquid securities, yet investors can exit prior to 10 years selling the token to another investor. Importantly, this liquidity does not require a redemption on the part of the fund. Furthermore, since tokens are highly divisible, it eliminates the need for minimum investments. Blockchain facilitates trade in the secondary market.
Consider commercial real estate. Publicly listed Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) provide some liquidity, but they are expensive to set up and typically hold a basket of properties rather than a single building. Furthermore, REITs are typically buy and hold vehicles, so most investors are shut out of development projects entirely unless they can meet minimums which are often on the order of $25k and higher. One day you might be able to buy $10 of a single commercial real estate asset like the Empire State Building, or invest $100 in the development of a LEED-certified housing project. Real estate focused token exchanges will increase liquidity for asset owners. Real estate appraisers will become more like equity analysts, because the market value of any building will be readily apparent if the token is trading. Tokenization will make IRS 1031 exchanges easy.
Consider residential real estate. Perhaps funding models will emerge where you can tokenize your house instead of taking out a traditional mortgage. Instead of making mortgage payments, you will make payments to the network of token holders. I will not pretend to know exactly what this might look like, but I think we will see some version of this in the coming years.
Fine art will be tokenized. Perhaps small donors will collectively acquire a Picasso for their local museum through a token sale even though none of them possess the resources to acquire the painting individually. The difference between this and current crowdfunding models is that the token holders can retain fractional ownership. Charitable donations will evolve towards charitable investments. Token governance mechanisms will evolve to enable granting usage rights rather than cash flows.
These and many other assets that are costly to trade will be tokenized and become more liquid. Vacation timeshares come to mind. The lines between token exchanges and traditional exchanges will blur. Most electronic exchanges will trade tokens because most assets will be tokenized.
III. Challenges for traditional asset tokenization
Regulatory: Although there are early efforts in progress (e.g. digix for gold and rex for real estate), mass adoption of traditional asset tokenization is going to take years, and possibly decades, to fully develop. Technology evolves quickly, but regulation does not. Traditional asset tokenization represents one of the greatest opportunities, and greatest challenges, that the SEC and other global regulatory agencies will face over the next decade.
Governance: If one entity owns a building they have the incentive to monitor things like maintenance and timely lease payments. If 10,000 people own the same building then it may be the case that no owner has the incentive to monitor, because the cost of monitoring exceeds the value of their investment. Solutions will need to come to market that enable governance of widely held tokenized assets. Financial economists have spent a lot of time thinking about the separation of ownership and control and will be able to help design these solutions.
Thinly traded tokens: Let's be very clear about this one: the mere act of token generation to represent ownership claims on a traditional asset does not impact liquidity in and of itself. If a token is thinly traded it is still relatively illiquid. Improvement in liquidity comes from increases in market depth, meaning more participants and more trade. The reason tokenization improves liquidity is because it enables deeper markets. Since tokens are highly divisible and global, the potential number of market participants is substantially higher than what we see today in markets for illiquid assets.
Status Quo: Tokenization of traditional assets will cause disruption to the status quo. Some systems that are in place today may not work the same way in the blockchain world (e.g. equity securities lending). That doesn't mean the blockchain world isn't coming, it means the current systems will have to evolve. The challenge is that there are stakeholders that benefit from the status quo. These constituencies have incentives to resist change, and they will do what they can to slow down adoption. I view this as a speed bump rather than a barrier.
IV. Impact of traditional asset tokenization on protocol tokens
As Nick Tomaino mentioned in a recent post, traditional asset tokens are less common and perhaps less interesting than protocol tokens. I agree with this sentiment. However, traditional assets currently represent aggregate market value that is orders of magnitude greater than cryptoassets. As they tokenize I believe that there will be crossover effects that are relevant to protocol tokens.
Consider the market sizes of low liquidity assets. Global real estate value was recently estimated at $217 trillion. Roughly 25% of that total, $54 trillion, is commercial. For arguments sake, let's say a 10% liquidity premium would be applied to these assets if they were tokenized and could be traded freely. That's over $5 trillion, or put another way, the illiquidity discount on global commercial real estate is about 40–50x the aggregate value of all cryptoassets as of this writing. These are big markets. Will tokens eat the whole market? Of course not, but they will eat some, and as time goes on the bites will get bigger and bigger. These tokens will become embedded within the larger ecosystem of cryptoassets. Traditional asset tokenization is going to impact protocol valuation because they will become intertwined.
If traditional asset tokenization occurs on top of an existing crypto protocol (e.g. ERC20 tokens), this will influence value of the underlying blockchain network. Further, traditional asset tokenization enables protocol tokens to be used as a method of payment in both directions. For example, perhaps dividends/lease payments/coupon payments are paid out in ETH or BTC. This will drive demand for the protocol tokens and influence valuation. Finally, there will be a demand for governance protocols within traditional asset tokens, giving rise to new platforms. Crypto investors would be wise to watch these developments, even if they don't intend to invest directly in this asset class.
It will be fascinating to watch this develops. As the world's assets become increasingly liquid, the concept of ownership will evolve in ways we cannot yet imagine.
Kim Jong-un, the North Korean dictator, has become so fat while in office that his ankles have fractured under his own weight, it was reported on Tuesday.
The 31-year-old, who has looked increasingly portly since taking power, had to undergo a hospital operation after putting too much strain on his ankles during a gruelling round of official engagements.
The treatment has also been linked to his unexpected failure to attend a recent session of the Supreme People's Assembly, according to a Pyongyang source who spoke to the Chosun Ilbo newspaper in neighbouring South Korea.
Unlike other members of North Korea's political elite, for whom a sudden absence from public life often means they have been killed or imprisoned, in Kim Jong-un's case it is said to be down to Elvis-style weight gain as a result of his unhealthy diet.
He is now believed to weigh at least 20 stone as a result of his fondness for heavy drinking and imported Swiss cheese, which he gained a taste for while at school in Switzerland.
His ankle injuries are said to have resulted from a long tour of military bases and factories while wearing shoes decked out with Cuban heels, which boosted his 5ft 9ins height but proved difficult to walk in. He is said to have suffered sprains on both feet first and then compounded the injuries by walking more, leading to the fractures.

Bodyguards have been posted around the ward of a Pyongyang hospital where he is now being treated. "There's been a marked increase in the number of elite officials visiting the ward," said the source. There was also speculation that a team of private European doctors had flown in to treat him.
His absence from the assembly was followed by a rare admission by state television which not only showed footage of him limping but also stated that he was ill.
Just imagine being able to write scripts that automatically interact with your iOS application and be able to verify the results. With UI Automation you can. UI Automation is a tool provided by Apple to perform a higher level of testing on your iOS application beyond anything achievable with XCTest.
1. White Box versus Black Box Testing
You might have heard the comparison of white box testing versus black box testing with regard to how one might test a piece of software. If you're not familiar with these concepts, let me explain how they work.
White Box Testing
Imagine there's a piece of software running inside a box. With white box testing, you can see inside the box and look at all the gritty pieces of how the software works, and then make educated decisions on how to test the software. You can also have deeper level hooks into the software from the tests that you write.
Unit testing is white box testing. When writing unit tests, the tester has fine-grained access to the code under test. The tester can actually write tests that leverage the software under test at the method, or unit, level.
In iOS software development we use the XCTest framework to perform this type of testing. Have a look at another tutorial I wrote on getting started with XCTest.
Black Box Testing
In black box testing, the box is opaque. The tester cannot see inside the box. The tester cannot access and doesn't know about the implementation of the code base to write tests. Instead, the tester is forced to use the application as an end user would by interacting with the application and waiting for its response, verifying the results.
There are at least two ways to execute this type of testing.
A tester who repeatedly and manually performs a number of predefined steps and visually verifies the results.
Use specialized tools to test the application with APIs that behave similar to how a human interacts.
In iOS application development, Apple provides a tool called UI Automation to perform black box testing.
2. What is UI Automation?
UI Automation is a tool that Apple provides and maintains for higher level, automated, testing of iOS applications. Tests are written in JavaScript, adhering to an API defined by Apple.
Writing tests can be made easier by relying on accessibility labels for user interface elements in your application. Don't worry though, if you don't have these defined, there are alternatives available.
The UI Automation API lacks the typical xUnit based format for writing tests. One difference with unit testing is that the tester needs to manually log success and failures. UI Automation tests are run from the Automation instrument within the Instruments tool that comes with Apple's developer tools. The tests can be run in the iOS Simulator or on a physical device.
3. Writing UI Automation Tests
Step 1: Open the Sample Project
I've updated the sample project used in the previous tutorial on iOS testing with some additional user interface elements that provide some useful hooks for adding UI Automation tests. Download the project from GitHub. Open the project and run the application to make sure that everything is working as expected. You should see a user interface similar to the one shown below.
Before we write any tests, feel free to try out the sample application to become familiar with its functionality. As a user, you can enter text in the text field and tap the button to see a label on the screen that displays the reversed, inputted string.
Step 2: Create a UI Automation Test
Now that you're familiar with the sample application, it's time to add a UI Automation test. UI Automation is a tool that can be found in Instruments. To run the sample application in Instruments, select Product > Profile from Xcode's menu. Select Automation from the list of tools.
The main Instruments window will open with a single instrument ready to run, the Automation instrument (the Automation instrument executes UI Automation test cases). You'll also see an area in the bottom half of the window that looks like a text editor. This is the script editor. This is where you will write your UI Automation tests. For this first test, follow the below instructions, adding each line to the script in the script editor.
Start by storing a reference to the text field in a variable.
Set the text field's value.
Verify that the value was set successfully and, if it was, pass the test. Fail the test if it wasn't.
While this test is fairly trivial, it does have value. We've just written a test that tests the presence of a text field when the application is launched and that tests if a random string can be set as the text field's value. If you don't believe me, then remove the text field from the storyboard and run the test. You'll see that it fails.
This test demonstrates three important pieces of writing UI Automation tests. First, it shows you how to access a simple user interface element, the text field. Specifically, we access a dictionary of all text fields on the base view of the application via target.frontMostApp().mainWindow().textFields() and we then find the text field we are interested in by looking for the one with key Input Field . This key is actually the accessibility label of the text field. In this case, it's defined in the storyboard. We can also set the accessibility label in code using the accessibilityLabel property on NSObject .
Accessing the application's main window, the front most application, and the target are common when working with UI Automation. I'll show you how to make this easier and less verbose later in this tutorial.
Second, this shows you that you can interact with user interface elements on the screen. In this case, we set the text field's value, mimicking the user interacting with the application by entering text into the text field.
And third, the example also shows a technique for verifying what happens in the application. If the value is successfully set, the test passes. If the value isn't set, the test fails.
Step 3: Saving Tests
While writing tests in the script editor is convenient, it quickly becomes cumbersome and difficult to maintain. If you quit Instruments, any unsaved changes are discarded. We need to save the tests we write. Simply copy and paste your test into a new document in your favorite text editor and save it. You can find the tests created in this tutorial in the sample project under Jumblify/JumblifyTests/AutomationTests.js.
To run the test, select the middle tab in the pane on the right, next to the script editor, and select Add > Import.
You'll be prompted to select the script to import. Navigate to the saved script and import it. You can still change the script in the script editor. Any changes will be automatically saved in the external file you created.
Step 4: Tapping a Button
Let's update our test to test interaction with the button. Our test already adds text to the text field so we only need to add code to tap the button. Let's first consider how to find the button in the view so that it can be tapped. There are at least three ways to accomplish this and each approach has its tradeoffs.
Approach 1
We can programmatically tap an (X, Y) coordinate on the screen. We do this with the following line of code:
Of course, I have no idea if those are even the coordinates of the button on the screen and I'm not going to worry about that, because this approach is not the right tool for this job. I'm only mentioning it so you know it exists. Using the tap method on target to tap a button is error-prone, because that button may not always be at that specific coordinate.
Approach 2
It's also possible to find the button by searching the array of buttons of the main window, similar to how we accessed the text field in the first test. Instead of accessing the button directly using a key, we can retrieve an array of buttons on the main window and hard code an array index to get a reference to the button.
This approach is a little better. We're not hard-coding a coordinate, but we are hard-coding an array index to find the button. If we happen to add another button on the page, it may accidentally break this test.
Approach 3
This brings me to the third way to find the button on the page, using accessibility labels. By using an accessibility label, we can directly access the button just liked we'd find an object in a dictionary using a key.
However, if you add the above line to the script and run it, you'll get an error.
This is because we haven't defined the accessibility label for the button yet. To do that, flip over to Xcode and open the project's storyboard. Find the button in the view and open the Identity Inspector on the right (View > Utilities > Identity Inspector). Ensure that Accessibility is enabled and set the Label for the button to Jumblify Button.
To run the test again, you'll need to run the application from Xcode by selecting Product > Run and then profile the application again by selecting Product > Profile. This runs the tests and each test should pass now.
Step 5: Verify the Jumbled String
As I mentioned earlier, our application takes a string of text as input, and, when the user taps the button, displays the reversed string. We need to add one more test to verify that the input string is properly reversed. To verify that the UILabel is populated with the correct string, we need to figure out how to reference the UILabel and verify the string it displays. This is a common problem when writing automation tests, that is, figuring out how to reference an element in the application to make an assertion on it.
There is a method on nearly every object in the UI Automation API, logElementTree . This method logs the nested elements of a given element. This is very useful to understand the hierarchy of elements in the application and helps to to figure out how to target a specific element.
Let's see how this works by logging the element tree of the main window. Take a look at the following line of code.
Adding this line to the test script results in the following output:
As you can see, there's a UIAStaticText subelement of the UIAWindow and you can also see that it has a name of ih , which also happens to be the reversed string we need to verify. Now, to complete our test, we just need to add code to access this element and verify that it's present.
Why do we only need to verify if the UIAStaticText element is present? Because the element's name is the reversed string of the input string, verifying it's presence confirms that the string was correctly reversed. If the element doesn't exist when referenced by name–the reversed string—then it means the string wasn't correctly reversed.
4. Scratching the Surface
There are so many other ways that an end user can interact with an iOS device while using your app. This means that there are many other ways that you can use UI Automation to simulate these interactions. Rather than attempt to capture a comprehensive list of these interactions, I'll direct you to the UI Automation reference documentation.
For each type of object that you can interact with, you can view the list of methods available on that object. Some methods are for retrieving attributes about the object while others are for simulating touch interaction, such as flickInsideWithOptions on UIAWindow .
Recording a Session
As you attempt to test more and more complicated apps with UI Automation, you'll find that sometimes it's pretty tedious to repeatedly use logElementTree to find the element you're looking for. This also becomes tedious and complex for applications with a complex view hierarchy or navigation. In these cases, you can use another feature of Instruments to record a set of user interactions. What's even cooler is that Instruments generates the UI Automation JavaScript code that's needed to reproduce the recorded interactions. Here's how you can try it out for yourself.
In Instruments and with the Automation instrument selected, look for the record button at the bottom of the window.
If you click the record button, Instruments will start a recording session as shown in the screenshot below.
Instruments will launch your application in the iOS Simulator and you'll be able to interact with it. Instruments will generate a script based on your interactions in real time. Give it a try. Rotate the iOS Simulator, tap at random locations, perform a swipe gesture, etc. It's a really useful way to help explore the possibilities of UI Automation.
Avoiding a Monolithic Code Base
As you can probably foresee, if we continue to add more test to the test file we've created in the same method, it will quickly become hard to maintain. What can we do to prevent that from happening. In my tests, I do two things to solve this problem:
One test for one function: This implies that the tests we write need to be focused on a specific piece of functionality. I'll even give it an appropriate name, such as testEmptyInputField .
This implies that the tests we write need to be focused on a specific piece of functionality. I'll even give it an appropriate name, such as . Group related tests in one file: I also group related tests in the same file. This keeps the code in one file manageable. This also makes it easier to test separate pieces of functionality by executing the tests in a specific file. In addition, you can create a master script in which you call the functions or tests you've grouped in other test files.
In the following code snippet, we import a JavaScript file and this makes the functions in that JavaScript file available to us.
Conclusion
In this tutorial, you've learnt the value of higher level testing and how UI Automation can help to fill that gap. It's another tool in your toolbox to help ensure you ship reliable and robust applications.

DETROIT, MI -- Mayor Mike Duggan wants Detroit's police officers to wear body cameras.
The possibility has been discussed in the past, and 30 officers wore Taser brand body cameras during a trial in April, but Duggan's announcement during his State of the City Speech Tuesday night at Detroit's 87-year-old Redford Theatre inches the prospect closer to reality.
"The other thing that we are going to be proposing is to be one of the leaders in the Unites States in putting body cameras on police offices so we can see the interaction," Duggan said, adding that officers who participated in the trial said suspects actually behaved more calmly knowing their actions were being recorded.
"I saw this," said Duggan. "I was the prosecutor when the dashboard cameras first went in, and there were a couple times that I prosecuted police officers because of the evidence on the camera, but there were a whole lot more times the police officer was cleared because the person in the back seat of the car had no idea that they were being recorded and their false actions could be disputed.
"We feel very confident about this, so in the next couple weeks Chief Craig and I will be sending the recommendation to the Detroit Police Commission and the Detroit City Council to consider deploying body cameras, first on a demonstration basis, and then throughout the department. We think it's going to build the trust between the police and the community."
The cameras used in the April trial cost between $300 and $500 per unit, Taser account manager Vincent Valentine said when the program was launched. With nearly 1,700 patrol officers, that would bring the total cost up to $850,000, not including data storage and other costs.
Cameras used in the April trial were self-contained, engaged by the officer and uploaded to a data storage devices as needed during the officer's shift.
Detroit Police Officers Association union President Mark Diaz said officers aren't against the cameras, so long as they're for recording interactions with the public, and not to record every occurrence of an officer's shift.
"The added pressure of having your boss watching you all the time is unnecessary," Diaz said Tuesday.
Duggan didn't say if the decision to move forward with cameras has anything to do with citizen-police unrest prompted by nationally criticized deaths like the police shooting of Mike Brown in Ferguson, Mo., but said the relationship with the public is "extremely important."
"There have been incidents that have happened in other cities in this country," he said, "and they're capable of happening anywhere if we're not vigilant."
The Republican-controlled Senate has failed by five votes to override President Barack Obama's veto of legislation approving the Keystone XL oil sands pipeline. The override had required a two-thirds majority.
The failed vote means the controversial project will have to wait for permission or denial from the Obama administration, and the House of Representatives will no longer vote on an override.

Keystone supporters, however, said they would continue to fight for the pipeline. Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), who authored the bill and represents one of the states that would be affected by the pipeline, said that Republicans would try and attach it to legislation such as a long-term transportation funding bill or an energy package.
“If we don't win the battle today, we will win the war, because we will attach it to another piece of legislation,” Hoeven told the Hill.
Meanwhile, Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said that Republicans are “politically delusional” if they think attaching the Keystone legislation to a transportation bill will work.
Obama vetoed the bill in February, saying it had not passed a final State Department assessment on whether the project would benefit the US. The State Department assessment is due in the coming weeks or months and Obama is expected to make a final decision on permitting for the project.

The TransCanada Corp pipeline project has been pending for six years and, if approved, would carry 830,000 barrels of crude from Canada's tar sands to Nebraska and then across the US to refineries and ports along the US Gulf Coast.
Republicans have argued the pipeline would create jobs. The US Chamber of Commerce told Reuters the project “would produce good, high paying jobs, increase supplies of Canadian and American crude to refiners, and therefore bolster American economic and energy security.”
The Obama administration has questioned those arguments, as the majority of the jobs would exist only during the construction phase, which is estimated to last two years. The White House also has concerns about greenhouse gas emissions, a view shared by environmental groups who have lobbied for several years against the project.
Nat Borchers, also known as 'The Beard', is one of the most tenured defenders in Major League Soccer. Today, Borchers is known as one of the toughest veteran center backs in the league and for good reason. As one of the most newsworthy pickups of the offseason for the Portland Timbers, we will take a look at how he is doing with his new club.
'The Beard' entered the MLS in 2003 with the Colorado Rapids with a respectable season playing the majority of the games In his rookie year.
Borchers left MLS in 2007-2008 for a short stint with Norwegian club Odds Ballklubb before returning to his native country to play for Real Salt Lake in 2009, staying with the side until 2014. This would begin one of the longest stints for a defender in MLS and in the end put him in third for most appearances for the Utah-based club.
In 2014 Real Salt Lake traded Borchers to the Timbers for allocation money in a move Borchers heavily played a role in deciding. Since then Timber fans have fully embraced 'The Beard' and his gritty defensive leadership.
The question is now a third of the way through the season how has he been stacking up at his new club? Many may be surprised to find out that if he continues to contribute at his current rate and consistency this could be the best season of Borchers career yet.
Borchers has played 299 games since his rookie season in MLS, and started all but one of those games. That game was his rookie season. Since then Borchers has played an average of 28.8 games a year with his shortest two seasons being his rookie season in 2003 of 23 games, and his 2012 season of 28 games. Wherever Borchers has been over the years he has been relied upon to be a rock in the center of his team's defense.
This season for Portland 'The Beard' has started every single game and played every single minute possible.
Borchers is a part of a pair that is the core of the Timber defense with English football veteran Liam Ridgewell. Together they have been a powerhouse on the backline in MLS.
When it comes to becoming a part of the attack this year, Borchers is on track to have his best season ever. Currently a third of the way through the MLS regular season, Borchers has already accrued two goals. Borchers current best goal scoring season was in 2011 with three goals. Borchers has twenty-three more games this season in which to score two more.
On the defensive end Portland as a whole has not been at its worst, currently they sit in the middle of the table in goals conceeded. There have been issues defensively, but the backline has been signifigantly vitalized with Borchers' entry into the team this year along with Norwegian-Ghanian keeper Adam Kwarasey.
In adition to Borchers and the back line as whole avoiding goals, he has some other interesting stats.
Borcher's weakest area defensively is aggressively tackling which has been historically low for a while at .8 tackles per game.
On the other hand, his interceptions and clearances have been historically high. His interceptions per game are sitting at a nice 1.6 per game which is nearly double of his partner in crime, Liam Ridgewell. Borcher's clearances also sit a respectable 5.5 per game this season which is quite close to Ridgewells who sits at 6.1 per game.
In review of the first third of Nat Borcher's first season with Portland, most would agree he has been a worthy pickup. Borchers has been the rock in the defense Portland needed to maintain cohesion and structure when times get tough.
Lets hope at the end of this season he lives up to the stats hes setting himself up for now.

Why do things Russians find normal so often terrify Americans? Why do things Americans consider perfectly normal so often upset Russians? Why is it so easy to walk unknowingly right into one cultural taboo after another?
51 Ways to Offend a Russian is an adventure in how not to assimilate into another culture. It is the culmination of the author's five years spent blundering through endless mistakes, miscalculations, and misunderstandings in Russia. This humorous collection of bite-sized anecdotes will leave you in tears - from both laughter and frustration alike.
The author's blunders include such observations and unlikely adventures as:
“Beer isn't alcohol. Do not question this. Do not try to understand it.”
“Once upon a time in Russia, at a backwaters border crossing adjacent the far Southeastern edge of Estonia, I got mistaken for an American spy.”
“There is a word in Russian which means, loosely, “To chase a shot by smelling food.” Not eating food, smelling it. I think that says a lot about the culture.”
“In what weird parallel universe are berries not a kind of fruit? In Russia, even science is done differently.”
“Date enough “vegetarians” in Russia, and you might find yourself forgetting people back home still think chicken is a kind of meat.”
“This was the first time in my entire life I have ever understood the thought process of a Samurai. Specifically, the thoughts of a Samurai about to commit seppuku.”
“For a Russian, [the] ideal state of “warmth” seems to fall somewhere between fifty and sixty degrees Fahrenheit. By eighty-five degrees, most see the four horsemen of the apocalypse in their heatstroke-induced nightmares.”
“One should never disrespect bread. Quite literally, no [Russian] would be alive without it… The Paleo diet is a fun thing to explain in Russia.”
“They don't teach you how to send Facebook messages in Russian class. There is no “Social Media in Russia, 101.” There should be.”
“It's perfectly normal to strip naked and let grown men hit you with hot birch branches. This is just about the most normal thing a person could possibly do in Russia.”
GREENVILLE, N.C. -- Billy Godwin is out after nine seasons as East Carolina's coach.
Athletic director Jeff Compher said Monday that Godwin's contract will not be renewed.
Godwin was 317-215-1 with five NCAA tournament appearances at the school.
The Pirates were 33-26 this season, finished in a three-way tie for sixth place in the 13-team Conference USA and were not selected for the NCAA tournament. They will begin play in the American Athletic Conference next season.
The three-year extension he received after a Super Regional appearance in 2009 expires June 30.
Compher says the decision came "after a thorough and thoughtful evaluation."
He says he will conduct a national search for Godwin's replacement and appointed associate head coach Dan Roszel to run the program on an interim basis.
It began innocently enough: Mario Costeja González, a 58-year old lawyer and calligrapher from northwestern Spain, Googled himself.
Somewhere in the search results, he found something disturbing: an 11-year-old issue of the newspaper La Vanguardia republished online, which contained an unflattering moment from his past. In 1998, La Vanguardia and other papers were ordered to advertise property auctions, the proceeds of which would pay back taxes owed by the owners. On page 23 of the Jan. 19, 1998, issue of La Vanguardia, Mario Costeja González was listed among other debtors whose property was available to the highest bidder.
There was a time when the page with his name on it would have ended up at the bottom of a landfill — but today, thanks to Google, embarrassment is forever. It didn't matter to Costeja González that his name was one of several buried in a 36-word sidebar. It didn't matter that he only found the link because a friend alerted him to its existence. It didn't matter that “Mario Costeja González” wasn't exactly a trending term on Google. What mattered to him was the fact that the debts in question had been settled long ago. Why did their memory have to linger online?
Costeja González complained to La Vanguardia. The paper threw up its hands and claimed that a government edict required publication in the first place. Then Costeja González contacted Google. Nothing changed. So he lodged a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency (Agencia Española de Protección de Datos, AEPD). At last his protests found the right audience: the AEPD ruled that Google was required to remove the links in question — that Costeja González, in other words, had a “right to be forgotten.” After appeals, the case made its way to the European Union's highest court, which sided with the AEPD and Costeja González: All search engines would have to consider user requests to take down links.
In May 2014, Google designed a system to field such inquiries, and they, along with Bing and Yahoo, began to limit search results deemed "inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive in relation to the purposes for which they were processed." But Google applied one important caveat: Links would only be erased for search engines within European internet domains. It is, depending on your perspective, either a perfectly tailored application of the EU's ruling — or a clever dodge. What it means in practice is that European users could easily find their way to any and all search results simply by using Google.com.
And perhaps it was the too-clever-by-half response, or the general hostility toward Google among European politicians, or Google's pesky habit of leaking which links it has been asked to remove, but EU privacy watchdogs came down hard on the search giant last week. “Under EU law, everyone has a right to data protection,” European regulators declared. Their new guidelines will request that Google remove offending links from the main Google.com search results as well.
Yet the guidelines are non-binding — so what punishment does Google face if it fails to comply? Even if Google tried to meet the requirement, how would the search engine manage it? Would there be two functional Google.com sites — one for Europeans, one for everyone else? Or would these guidelines apply the “right to be forgotten” to non-Europeans as well?
To Americans accustomed to a certain degree of deference to the private sector, this whole affair can seem comic. A European citizen wakes up one day and decides to erase himself from Google — they can't really enforce that, can they? But they can, and they have. Google's struggles with privacy in Europe have real costs and consequences. It has had to hire a phalanx of lawyers and lobbyists, change its products, and build compliance services. Yet as exasperating as this regulatory flurry must look from Google's perspective, it has at least one value for the rest of us: forcing us to think long and hard about the online panopticon that gives every embarrassing news story, every ridiculous photo and every injudicious comment a permanence and accessibility that would have been unimaginable a generation ago. It forces us, too, to consider the incentives shaping the behavior of companies with massive financial stakes in accumulating as much information about us as possible.
If a “right to be forgotten” sounds laughable to certain ears, perhaps that's because the right didn't need a name until very recently: Not too long ago, it was taken entirely for granted.
Of course, that's no guarantee that the EU's notoriously sprawling bureaucracy will get this right. But while we wait to find out, we can at least appreciate the ironic fact that the man who had set out to make himself invisible on Google is now unavoidable on it. Mario Costeja González's name populates search pages by the hundreds, and depending on the source, he's either a benevolent “internet warrior” or a buffoon.
For his part, he's thrilled at how the case has played out — and his response may speak to a public that both loves Google and fears for its privacy: “I've been saying to people, if Google was good before, now it's perfect.”
Tanker drivers in the UK have voted in favour of strike action over health and safety standards. The strikes are expected to take place over the Easter Holiday period to cause maximum disruption. The government has trained 300 soldiers to take over the duties of striking drivers and has vowed to use the police to prevent any 'irresponsible' picketing.
This week, tanker drivers in the UK have voted in favour of strike action over health and safety concerns. The 2,000 drivers balloted are responsible for around 90% of the fuel delivered to petrol stations in the UK.
Strikes are expected to take place over the Easter Holidays in order to cause maximum disruption. It is expected to cause the biggest disruption to fuel supplies since 2001.
The government have responded in typical fashion by accusing drivers of putting people's lives at risk, as Ambulances and Fire Engines would not be able to run. They have forgotten to mention that the Union have stated that emergency services would have access to fuel.
The Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Edward Davey, has said:
“The Unite ballot result is disappointing. The Government is strongly of the view that strike action is wrong and unnecessary. The union should be getting round the negotiating table, not planning to disrupt the lives of millions of people across Britain.” “Our economy is just getting back on its feet and any action that makes that harder is totally unjustified”. “With the London 2012 Olympics approaching, it is unacceptable and selfish to behave in this manner and jeopardise our international reputation.” Quote:
How selfish of the drivers to want industry standard minimum health and safety regulations?
The government has been planning for the strike action and has trained 300 scab drivers from the armed forces to take over the delivery of fuel. They have also stated that they will be using the police to prevent pickets from blocking depots or interfering with scab drivers.
It's a shame that there has not been a move to link up the strikes with a fuel price campaign, but there is time yet.
Stocks hogged the headlines during President Donald Trump's first full calendar month in office as the Dow Jones Industrial Average embarked on its longest record-breaking run in three decades.
See: Here's how analysts say you should trade Trump's speech to Congress
But other assets logged gains that were commensurate with, if not stronger, than U.S. equities.
Here's a rundown of this month's best-performing assets.
Bitcoin
Bitcoin barreled higher in February, rising 30% and notching a record intraday high, amid growing optimism about the creation of a bitcoin-focused exchange-traded fund.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to issue its decision on whether to allow the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust to begin trading on the BATS exchange. Two other companies, Grayscale Partners and SolidX, also have submitted applications for a bitcoin ETF.
Bitcoin +30% Dow Jones Industrial Average +5% S&P 500 index +4% Nasdaq Composite Index +4% Mexican peso +4% Turkish lira +3.8% Russian ruble +2.8% South African rand +2.8%
Industry analysts believe a bitcoin ETF would usher in a torrent of capital from institutional investors hoping to profit from the cryptocurrency's rapid ascent. It could appeal to retail investors, too, by allowing them to easily include exposure to bitcoin in their retirement accounts, said Chris Burniske, blockchain analyst and products lead at ARK Invest, a company that owns shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust GBTC, -6.24% through two of its ETFs.
Others, including Charles Hayter, chief executive officer at CryptoCompare, a company that provides data and analytics about the cryptocurrency market, have pointed out that bitcoin tends to appreciate alongside haven assets like gold and Treasury bonds.
So the cryptocurrency's recent outperformance could portend a selloff for riskier assets like stocks.
A single bitcoin BTCUSD, -0.37% went for $1,187.77 in recent trade, according to CoinDesk's bitcoin price index.
Emerging markets
February was an unusual month for emerging-market assets. The Mexican peso, Turkish lira, Brazilian real and South African rand effectively erased their postelection losses, despite a slight increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against its developed-market rivals, and a decline in commodity prices.
The dollar USDMXN, +0.2169% has fallen 4% against the Mexican peso this month, while sliding 3.8% USDTRY, +0.0321% against the Turkish lira, 2.8% against the Russian ruble USDRUB, +0.2936% and 2.8% against the South African rand USDZAR, +0.1063%
Paul McNamara, director of emerging markets at GAM, attributed their performance to the improving outlook for global growth and trade.
The World Bank projects that economic growth in emerging markets will accelerate to 4.2% in 2017, from 3.4% in 2016, driven, in part, by rising commodity prices. The bank expects growth in the developed world to accelerate, too.
”The main reason we suggest [for the rise in emerging-market assets] is a sharp improvement in the elements of the global outlook that most affect EM,” McNamara said.
To be sure, fears that Trump's protectionist leanings could seriously disrupt this trend persist. But It's still unclear exactly what form his policies might take.
U.S. stocks
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.13% is on track to notch a 5% monthly gain, what would be its strongest performance since November. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.08% and Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.07% were both on track to finish the month up 4%.
Equities have been on a tear since Trump's Nov. 8 electoral triumph over Democrat Hillary Clinton, bolstered by expectations that his administration will implement a slate of business-friendly measures like slashing corporate taxes, gutting regulation and boosting infrastructure spending.
But their gains have slowed in recent weeks as investors worried that it might take longer than previously expected for Trump to push these measures through Congress.
Utilities, in particular, were the best-performing sector with a total return of 6.6%, followed by health-care stocks at 5.7%, and consumer staples at 5.6%.
Mike Antonelli, equity sales trader at R.W. Baird & Co. attributed their outperformance to the decline in bond yields during the last two weeks of February.
“Utilities are going to do well as rates go nowhere because the dividend makes them more attractive,” Antonelli said. “Those are very interest-rate sensitive stocks.”
Treasury yields are on track to finish lower for the first time since July. The yield on the 10-year note TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.87% as off 1.6 basis point in recent trade, leaving it on track to finish the month about 10 basis points lower.

A new detailed map of the hippocampal region of the brain, compiled by researchers at the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital-The Neuro at McGill University, is helping the scientific community accelerate research and develop better treatments for patients suffering from epilepsy and other neurological and psychiatric disorders.
The team of researchers, led by Dr. Neda Bernasconi, a neuroscientist specializing in the neuroimaging of epilepsy and co-founder of the Neuroimaging of Epilepsy Laboratory (NOEL) at The Neuro, set out to build and share a detailed model of the substructures making up one of the key centres of the brain involved in epilepsy: the hippocampus. The goal of their project, published on November 10 in Scientific Data, is to improve the tools available to researchers and clinicians working in the field around the globe.
Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by a sudden, brief change in the brain, expressed as a seizure. According to Epilepsy Canada, approximately one percent of Canadians suffer from the condition and more than 30% of patients with epilepsy do not respond to anti-epileptic drugs. For these individuals, the surgical removal of the brain tissue causing seizures is the only known effective treatment for controlling the condition and improving quality of life.
In order to compile this hippocampal atlas, researchers used MRI imagery from a sample of 25 healthy individuals. They then used their expertise in brain anatomy to label all the substructures composing the region, providing a model of an average, healthy hippocampus. The end result is analogous to a Google street view of this particular part of the brain. With this tool, researchers will be better able to assess the pathology of their patients by comparing their data to the atlas and will more clearly be able to locate the areas in need of surgical intervention.
A tool for brain diseases experts of all levels
"Our primary purpose was epilepsy. We wanted to be able to detect and identify different substructures in the hippocampus to enable us to be a lot more precise in our diagnosis and to pinpoint the affected region to better target treatments," said Dr. Bernasconi. "With this new submillimetric dataset, made available through open science, we are not just sharing MRI images, we are also transferring anatomical knowledge and providing a statistical map that can be used by researchers and clinicians of different levels of expertise anywhere in the world."
These tools hold promising therapeutic implications for epilepsy, but also for other neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and depression. Crucially, the atlas provides researchers with a non-invasive way to assess the impact of therapies targeting this region of the brain and to thus develop better treatments to improve the quality of life for their patients.
This work conducted by Dr. Neda Bernasconi and collaborators at the Montreal Neurological Institute, was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
From time to time, we indulge in moral panics. Usually, this follows a startling scandal unearthed by the media - and often it's RTE that does the spadework.

Gene Kerrigan: Not the kind of stories one wants to see
They send undercover reporters into nursing homes or hospitals with hidden cameras. We see things that upset us - perhaps we see the old being tied down or beaten up.
Or we see hospital corridors that look like something from a war movie.
And it stirs our concern.
Again and again we read of a 91-year-old man who spent 29 hours on a trolley in Tallaght; or a 93-year-old woman who spent 29 hours on a trolley at Beaumont.
Just when you think the public health service has some kind of 29-hour torture fixation you read - as we did last week - of the 76-year-old woman who spent 30 hours in a chair before she graduated to a trolley on which to linger in misery.
And this upsets us.
For a time, we talk about how awful it is, the media tut-tuts, there will be some official follow-up, then the next scandal arrives and all the others slide inexorably down the memory hole.
Last week, RTE upset us again. This time it was the sight of children being put through dreadful stress and the State subjecting their parents to contemptuous treatment.
In a superb piece of journalism, RTE had these families record their experiences on video over a long period - the day-to-day reality of being homeless and living in a hotel.
Some might hear "living in a hotel" and think it's fine, but the evidence of what it's like for adults and children to live, eat and sleep in one room was shocking. The fact that it happens over months on end is disgusting. The State is deliberately doing this to children, knowing its effects, knowing the strain this puts on parents - it has been doing it for years and it will never stop.
Never.
Unless we do something about it.
So, last week we had a bit of a moral panic. "Obviously," the Taoiseach said, these "are not the kind of stories one wants to see on television or indeed hear about."
Indeed not, sir. Particularly when there's an election on the way and you're telling people they'd better vote for you or there'll be chaos.
The issue for this particular moral panic is what is known as social housing. Or, more precisely, the lack of it. It used to be called public housing or municipal housing. Whatever it's called, it's often treated as charity.
It's sometimes tacked onto private house construction, as a condition. The developers will grudgingly build social housing, like they're doing the State a favour. And they'll sometimes break their commitments and find a way to ditch the charity work if profits aren't large enough.
Municipal housing is not charity.
Municipal housing was part of the 19th Century reforms that followed the industrial revolution. Without state support for housing, education and health there wouldn't have been the mass workforce required by modern society.
We have arranged things in this society so that homes are speculative commodities. Some people - speculators and builders - get extremely rich out of this. Others - landlords - get very rich. Or, in the case of smaller landlords, moderately rich.
This pushes up prices and there are swathes of people who work hard but still don't earn enough to buy into this market. The State provides municipal housing as a form of indirect subsidy to business. Otherwise, there would be relentless pressure to push wages up to the point that would make many businesses uneconomic.
Rent subsidies work similarly - those who benefit most are the landlords. In a booming market, landlords can discard the lower earners.
We have - in the Kenny/Burton Government - people possessed of a truly remarkable ideological crudeness. They are intensely committed to market forces, to the point where they've virtually stopped the provision of municipal housing.
It offends their free-market principles. Since they came into office, the construction of municipal housing has gone through the floor.
Yet, the surge in homelessness surprises them, although they've arranged it. The surge in homelessness isn't a result of incompetence, it's a result of policy.
Then, someone dies on a doorstep. Or we're shown that - horror of horrors - middle-class people are increasingly among the homeless. People with the look and the accent of government ministers.
Good God.
Suddenly, there's a moral panic and the Government stirs itself and does something - but as a charity measure, avoiding any fundamental change in how we do things.
Fianna Fail is currently playing the left-wing card. Micheal Martin attacks Fine Gael's right-wing obsessions. And he's right - Fine Gael is indeed some notches to the right of Fianna Fail.
But it's a matter of degree. Through decades, they've taken turns implementing similar right-wing policies - Fianna Fail less ideological, more inclined to take note of which way the populist wind is blowing.
They truly believe it is their job to increase the wealth of a top layer, which will then invest in the market so that the wealth trickles down to the rest of us. It's a quaint 18th Century theory, and one of these centuries it may well work out.
In the meantime, the ideology requires state spending to be eternally narrowed, which results in OECD figures showing social spending in Ireland at 21pc of GDP (France is at 32pc, Italy 28pc, Spain 26pc, Greece 24pc and so on).
So, decades pass with the public hospitals in chaos. It's not incompetence, it's policy.
We stress children to the point of cruelty to keep the housing market ideologically pure. It's not incompetence, it's policy.
We are in economic recovery, with a Government that proudly offers unending "stability" - and 17.5pc of people born here live abroad (Poland is 9pc, Greece 6.8pc, Italy 4.3pc, Spain 2pc).
Irish Water is an inept attempt to privatise the water supply, following the ideological imperative to channel even more wealth upwards - a clumsy attempt scuppered by popular protest.
Communities organise charity drives to buy medical equipment that should be provided by the State. Relatives, friends and neighbours club together to send kids abroad for treatment they should get at home.
Homes and businesses are lost to floods because the State won't raise the taxes to provide the necessary flood defences.
And this in a country where the Government proudly boasts of recovery from recession.
This in a country where we gave away €9bn we could have kept if the Government didn't greet every ECB demand with servile acquiescence.
And all of this will go on and on and on. And every now and then we'll have our little moral panics.
In 1966, when the State was commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising the pressing issues of the day included unemployment and emigration. There were so many homeless that the Dublin Housing Action Committee was about to come into being.
Every now and then, politicians would promise to drain the Shannon, to relieve flooding.
Fifty years on . . .
And 50 years from now, we will continue to have our occasional moral panics, when what we ought to do is stop whining.
There's no sense getting all worked up about these scandals. It ratchets up our blood pressure and brings closer the day when we will ourselves be rushed to an A&E to be left on a trolley for a day or two.
Might as well accept it.
Or change it.

Everyone who wants to reduce wealth and income inequality with more regulations and taxes is missing the key dynamic: central banks' monopoly on creating and issuing money widens wealth inequality, as those with access to newly issued money can always outbid the rest of us to buy the engines of wealth creation.
History informs us that rising wealth and income inequality generate social disorder.
Access to low-cost credit issued by central banks creates financial and political power. Those with access to low-cost credit have a monopoly as valuable as the one to create money.
I explain why in my book A Radically Beneficial World: Automation, Technology and Creating Jobs for All.
Compare the limited power of an individual with cash and the enormous power of unlimited cheap credit.
Let's say an individual has saved $100,000 in cash. He keeps the money in the bank, which pays him less than 1% interest. Rather than earn this low rate, he decides to loan the cash to an individual who wants to buy a rental home at 4% interest.
There's a tradeoff to earn this higher rate of interest: the saver has to accept the risk that the borrower might default on the loan, and that the home will not be worth the $100,000 the borrower owes.
The bank, on the other hand, can perform magic with the $100,000 they obtain from the central bank. The bank can issue 19 times this amount in new loans—in effect, creating $1,900,000 in new money out of thin air.
This is the magic of fractional reserve lending. The bank is only required to hold a small percentage of outstanding loans as reserves against losses. If the reserve requirement is 5%, the bank can issue $1,900,000 in new loans based on the $100,000 in cash: the bank holds assets of $2,000,000, of which 5% ($100,000) is held in cash reserves.
This is a simplified version of how money is created and issued, but it helps us understand why centrally issued and distributed money concentrates wealth in the hands of those with access to the centrally issued credit and those who have the privilege of leveraging every $1 of cash into $19 newly created dollars that earn interest.
Imagine if we each had a relatively modest $1 million line of credit at 0.25% interest from a central bank that we could use to issue loans of $19 million. Let's say we issued $19 million in home loans at an annual interest rate of 4%. The gross revenue (before expenses) of our leveraged $1 million would be $760,000 annually –let's assume we net $600,000 per year after annual expenses of $160,000. (Recall that the interest due on the $1 million line of credit is a paltry $2,500 annually).
Median income for workers in the U.S. is around $30,000 annually. Thus a modest $1 million line of credit at 0.25% interest from the central bank would enable us to net 20 years of a typical worker's earnings every single year. This is just a modest example of pyramiding wealth.
Next let's say we each get a $1 billion line of credit which we leverage into $19 billion in loans earning 4%. Now our net annual income is $600 million, the equivalent income of 20,000 workers. We did nothing to improve productivity, nor did we produce any goods or services. We simply used the power of central banking and fractional reserve lending to skim $600 million in financial rents from those actually producing goods and services.
Note that we are not uniquely evil or avaricious in maximizing our private gain from the central bank system; we're simply responding rationally to the system's incentives.
The system concentrates wealth and subverts democracy not because participants are different from the rest of us but because they are acting rationally within a perverse, exploitive system. Would you turn down $600,000 a year? How about $600 million a year?
It makes no sense for banks and financiers not to maximize their gains in this system. Those who fail to maximize their gains will be fired.
I hope you understand by now that the current system of issuing money and credit benefits the few at the expense of the many. The vast privilege and the equally vast inequality it generates is the only possible output of the system.
This inequality cannot be reformed away; it is intrinsic to centrally issued money and private banking with access to central bank credit.
The problem isn't fiat money; it's centrally issued money/credit that is distributed to the few at the expense of the many. If we want to limit the subversion of democracy and reduce wealth inequality, we must decentralize and democratize the issuance and distribution of money.
In the current system, money isn't created to reward increasing productivity. It is created to increase the wealth and power of the privileged.
If we want to connect the creation and distribution of money/credit with productivity, we must issue new money directly to those creating value and boosting productivity, bypassing the privileged few in central and private banks.
By concentrating wealth and power, centrally issued and distributed money doesn't just subvert democracy. It also optimizes inequality, monopoly, cronyism, stagnation, social immobility and systemic instability.
The status quo “solution” is Universal Basic Income (UBI), a form of subsistence designed to quell the righteous urge to throw off the monetary yoke of the privileged financial Elites. If scraping by as a debt-serf on UBI is the New American Dream, we need a new economic/social system.

In last month's SD LIVE event, I discussed multiple ways to help maintain a relative level of comfort and safety when backpacking in the rain. Some methods are simply a matter of packing differently or packing more: sleeping clothes, camp shoes, breathable footwear, group tarp, down insulation, and a pack liner. Other methods are techniques: taking care of your feet, packing your pack, starting a fire, and “the reset dry.” Watch the video for all the details. My co-star is Michael Glavin, Brand Manager for Sierra Designs.
SD LIVE is a regular online event. It's an excellent way for us to make real connections with the backpacking community, and to share our knowledge and exciting developments at SD. Watch past episodes plus other informative videos. The SD LIVE event is scheduled for Tuesday, May 12. Details will be announced on this website, my Facebook page and Twitter feed, and on www.SierraDesigns.com and via its mailing list.
In the video I reference a few pictures. These were available during the live broadcast but are not integrated into the recorded video. Here they are:

Icelandic culture, whose culinary tastes have been defined by the scarcity of food, has given rise to a people who learned, through necessity, to combine ingredients innovatively. Granted, this hasn't always produced a popular result - as the Icelandic "delicacies" of urea-soaked rotting shark and boiled sheep head prove, but occasionally they'll come up with something amazing, like the world's most involved sci-fi MMO. Most folk will agree, they're all an acquired taste.

CCP's secret sauce is a blend of many components and it would be fair to say the recipe has been adapted over the years, with some components not introduced until further along the cooking process. Here is an examination of some of the key ingredients which have contributed to the success of EVE Online and CCP Games.
Free Expansions
Twice a year, every year, EVE Online's free expansions keep the momentum up and keep players coming back for more.
The nature of the expansions has been varied, as has their reception. The most recent EVE Online expansion, Odyssey, was the nineteenth such release and saw enhancements made to several aspects of EVE, with a focus on the exploration of the unknown. The Winter expansion has yet to be announced, but already there will be much anticipation of what is yet to come, and that is powerful.

You may come for the spaceships, but you stay for the people.
From the sweet taste of victory to the burning desire for personal vengeance, nothing can provide motivation more than the genuine emotion which can only come from interaction with real humans. In New Eden, individual choices, unpredictable ambushes and the ebb and flow of player-driven empires are all powered by people. It's not all destruction and explosions though, there's also the complex society of intertwined player cultures to explore and become part of.
All of which can be destroyed and exploded. Ahem.

CCP Games has had a long and colourful history when it comes to working with their players. There have been many highs and quite a few lows, but - like any relationship - ties have been strengthened as lessons were learned.
The player-elected Council of Stellar Management has grown from this relationship and has gained traction in recent years as an effective means of player empowerment and communication. It has evolved beyond a simple player advocacy group and become an active and contributing part of the creative process which leads to a better game environment for all.
And then there's Fanfest – there's nothing better for getting the customer on side than throwing them a party.

In a world where striking the balance between premium subscriber content and free-to-play accessibility is a holy grail of the ever-changing MMO market, CCP Games quietly nailed it back in 2008.
PLEX (Pilot License EXtension) is a simple, elegant system which takes advantage of EVE's mature player market to allow players to trade 30-day subscription tokens in game. Players can spend real cash to buy PLEX to sell on the in-game market, instantly providing them with resources to quickly get to the game content they want without crossing the “pay to win” line. Meanwhile, less affluent players can grind for in-game cash to buy PLEX to redeem as game time, effectively playing for free.
Everyone wins. Except RMTers.
For participants, being part of something as unique and exciting as a virtual world which mirrors human civilisation is an experience that is far beyond “gameplay”, for some it is a lifestyle choice. CCP's approach to delivering the ability for players to have real impact within the universe is critical, as is their understanding of the role they play – and the roles they shouldn't.
Having a still-expanding persistent environment already enriched by a decade of history is something that simply cannot be replicated. Paradoxically, EVE Online is unique because it has been unique for some time. It's just not something that can be coded.
To stir it all together, let's take a look at where this all might be going in the ongoing taste test which is the massively multiplayer online gaming universe. Will we see more competitors adopt CCP's methods or has CCP Games had its day in the sun? EVE Online's Secret Sauce: The Menu of the Future takes a look and asks the questions.
CCP's Secret Sauce Article List
In a Lenny Letter released yesterday, lena dunham displayed intense white feminist entitlement to Black men's bodies, time, and energy. dunham took it a step further by attempting to read his mind because Beckham did not show her attention, attention she was not due. In an attempt at humor, lena dunham “accidentally” continued the fetishization and criminalization of Black men by white women. In short, dunham was projecting her whiteness and insecurity onto the Black body of athlete Odell Beckham Jr when she stated:
“he determined I was not the shape of a woman by his standards.”
Once the internet got a hold of this self deprecating white feminism, dunham tried to make it up with the following set of tweets:
lena dunham and amy schumer used white woman sarcasm (and racism) to deflect the very serious issue:
this tweet has since been deleted, but user thewayoftheid captured a screenshot
according to schumer, a bandmate tweeted the offensive tweet from her account
dunham proceeded to make it worse by talking about continuing to attempt non consensual grinding (read: sexual assault) on Black actor Michael B. Jordan
Now here is where the misogynoir really comes in. Xavier Burgin, a Black filmmaker reached out to schumer on Twitter that same day.
Burgin, dunham, and schumer talked. Burgin started a conversation about it on his account, stating that he wished he “had deferred to Black women.” dunham has since released an apology (which, as Tomarra Wagoner pointed out after I published this piece, does not actually apologize for her racism):
So what's wrong with the situation? As evidenced above, Black women are now talking about their consistent critiques of not only white feminism, but dunham and schumer specifically. These critiques have been ignored, yet when a Black man speaks up, not only do they listen, they set a meeting with him.
My expectations for white people (and by proxy, white women) are very very low, so I don't expect them to be accountable for their actions, their racism, or their obliviousness. Although white people really should be held accountable for their actions, their racism, and their obliviousness, the person who I predict growing the most from this is us watching it play out and Burgin himself.
This piece was not written to chastise Xavier Burgin. The question now is how do we do a better job of listening to Black women in the moment, rather than after the moment? And how do we use what we learned from Black women responsibly, rather than “learning how to mask [toxic masculinity] enough to get what [we] want,” as blowticious stated. We need to do better as Black men, and we need to listen to Black women because #BlackWomenDidThat. In short, this is the question we need to ask ourselves:
Charlie Comero, a transgender man in Charlotte, North Carolina, is taking bold -- and brilliant -- steps to educate the public about the realities of life for transgender people in public spaces in wake of the state's recent anti-LGBT legislation.
Comero, like most queer and trans people in North Carolina and across the country, was outraged by this legislation and wanted to find a way to highlight the way this law will dramatically affect his daily life and may be potentially dangerous. He decided that when complying with House Bill 2 by using women's public restrooms, he would hand out cards he created to anyone who questioned his presence in the space.

"The truth is that when folks in the general public are called upon by fellow citizens who happen to be transgender to be curious and compassionate about what it's like to be a transgender individual, it sticks more," Comero told The Huffington Post. "It's a new thing for many -- and there are many of us (myself included) who are willing to educate and speak with them from a place of love and compassion. That is the purpose of my cards: to show an amount of absurdity about the law and to educate folks [about] what being transgender means."
Courtesy of Comero
Comero also told The Huffington Post that he has handed out the cards in public restrooms since the bill was signed. The most notable interaction happened when he entered the women's facilities at the government center in Charlotte, North Carolina.
After a government employee using the restroom informed Comero that he was in the women's restroom, he attempted to give her a card, which she respectfully declined to take, and then verbally explained why he was there. When he ran into the woman again later in the day, it suddenly dawned on him, "Shit... she possibly doesn't know what it means to be a transgender man."
This led Comero to rethink the language on his cards to give a more nuanced understanding of what it means to be transgender.
"My whole card idea is a great, compassionate approach to such a disservice to a community, but it is not enough," Comero continued. "I firmly believe that she has no idea who she ran into in the bathroom and how I see my gender and my history. I have since modified my cards to read that a transgender male is someone who's birth certificate (at the time of birth) says female and that is not how I live my everyday life.
The irony in all this is that I learned as much as she did. We truly all do better when we all do better."

John Carpenter, creator of the original “Halloween” films, will return to the franchise as executive producer on a new production of the iconic horror movie.
Miramax and Blumhouse Productions will co-finance development and production. Producers are Malek Akkad under his Trancas banner and Jason Blum producing for Blumhouse.
Miramax holds worldwide distribution rights and will determine its theatrical distribution partner at a future date.
The “Halloween” film franchise was started in part by Carpenter and Moustapha Akkad in 1978, and has led to 10 films that have grossed nearly $400 million worldwide.
John Carpenter said, “38 years after the original ‘Halloween,' I'm going to help to try to make the 10th sequel the scariest of them all.”
The news was unveiled on a new Halloween Movies web site.
“‘Halloween' is one of those milestone films that inspired everyone at our company to get into the world of scary movies,” Blum said. “The great Malek Akkad and John Carpenter have a special place in the hearts of all genre fans and we are so excited that Miramax brought us together. We cannot wait to find and collaborate with the right filmmaker to give ‘Halloween' fans the movie they deserve.”
David Thwaites will oversee the reboot for Miramax with Carpenter.
The original “Halloween” was directed by Carpenter from his own script about Michael Myers as he stalks and kills teenage babysitters on Halloween night. The film begins with six-year-old Michael killing his teenage sister on Halloween in 1963; he escapes 15 years later from a sanitarium and stalks Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her friends as they babysit.
Malek Akkad is the son of Moustapha Akkad, who is a exec produced the original “Halloween” and produced several of the sequels. Malek Akkad produced three sequels, including 1998's “Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later,” 2007's “Halloween” and 2009's “Halloween II.”

The turmoil inside the Trump White House is much more intense than the media is reporting. Palaces of intrigue, under perceived siege by political and law enforcement adversaries, tend to boil inward before they burst outward.
One of the most perilous decisions for Trump is how far will he go in firing prosecutors looking into his murky dealings past and present. Already he has fired former FBI Director, James Comey, who just testified before the Senate flanked by several of his loyal FBI agents in the front seats of the hearing room.
Earlier, after then President-Elect Trump assured the influential US attorney in New York City, Preet Bharara, that he could keep his job, President Trump abruptly fired him in March. It seems Mr. Trump got wind of an investigation pertaining to various ill-defined, at least publicly, inquiries, tried to contact him to find out what was going on (a clear breach of ethics) and, not receiving a response, dispatched Bharara. The US attorney had reported Trump's phone call to the chief of staff of Attorney General Jeff Sessions which probably led to his undoing.
New presidents often replace US attorneys, who are known to harbor political ambitions within the political party that appointed them to this powerful prosecutorial position. But President Trump had an additional personal motive behind his worry about Bharara.
Now Mr. Trump's White House friends are leaking a trial balloon, or shall we call it the ‘nuclear option.' Can you imagine that President Trump even is considering firing Robert S. Mueller III, who is the special counsel chosen by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to lead the investigation of possible connections between Trump's electoral campaign and Russian operatives.
Mueller, a highly respected former director of the FBI, is starting to hire staff for this important inquiry – one paralleled by similar probes under the Republican controlled Senate and House Intelligence Committees.
One can discern this possibility is more than a slip of the tongue by someone eager for publicity. Already, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, often a mouthpiece for Trump's ‘thinking,' has tweeted that “Republicans are delusional if they think the special counsel is going to be fair,” even after praising Mueller's integrity a few weeks earlier. The signal to fire Mueller is being trumpeted by conservative talk show hosts such as Rush Limbaugh, Mark Levin and other lucrative right wing beneficiaries of our free and public airwaves.
While this latest drama of Trump's panic unfolds, there is speculation within their ranks that Trump may fire dozens of inspectors general who investigate waste, fraud and abuse by federal agencies to which they are attached. This would be unprecedented. Inspectors General (IGs) are non-partisan, independent civil servants with traditional bi-partisan support. They return $14 to the taxpayer for every $1.00 they spend on their investigations.
Trump looks askance on such independence and what might be found under his cabinet and agency heads. Thus far, he is not replacing open IG positions and intends to cut IG budgets. In another brazen move, the White House has insisted that Executive Branch agencies don't have to respond to Congressional inquiries. A bizarre narcissism is taking hold in the White House. Get rid of anyone who can hold you to the rule of law. Have cabinet members bow and scrape the floor with their obeisance at a White House meeting as they surrender giving their independent judgement to a firing-prone president.
Overseas, we have names for bosses of nations who expect such orchestrated ooze. What's next, statues and giant pictures of Trump looking down on his subjects around the country?
Trump would do well to study what happened when another president, Richard Nixon, hunkered down in 1973 and fired Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor appointed to investigate the Watergate scandal. Nixon's attorney general, Elliot Richardson, refused to fire Cox and resigned in protest, followed by the protest resignation of Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus.
It is possible that Trump may not want to wait as long as did Nixon, who acted after he received a subpoena from Cox requesting copies of taped conversations recorded in the Oval Office?
Nixon's firing of Cox generated a public firestorm of protests with millions of telegrams and calls pouring into Congress from the American people. The momentum to impeach Nixon accelerated. He quit just before the House of Representatives was to vote. Already, so early in the unfolding of Trump's reactions, 43 percent of the people believe that Congress should begin impeachment proceedings to remove President Trump from office, with 45 percent of them opposed (according to a Quinnipiac poll).
Firing a special counsel before he even gets underway, much fewer starts issuing subpoenas, would not sit well with even more Americans and increasing numbers of Republicans in Congress who would have preferred Mr. Pence by a large margin over Mr. Trump. Trump could quit in a fit of rage. Impeaching Trump in the House and convicting him in the Senate would get the Republicans a more stable, very conservative, former congressional colleague. Could Mike Pence, a recent governor of Indiana, be our next president?
Fasten your seatbelts, the wild card in the White House is sure to get wilder and seriously test our nation's rule of law.
WASHINGTON –Russian Facebook ads bought in Rubles successfully mimicked American social causes – like Black Lives Matter, tea party patriots and confederate flag backers – and tricked hundreds of thousands of Americans into “liking” them, according to testimony Wednesday at a congressional hearing.
Images of the fake ads were released as lawyers from Facebook, Google and Twitter testified before the House and Senate on the vast Russian propaganda campaign that infiltrated their platforms and sowed political unrest during the 2016 presidential election.
A Facebook executive told Congress Russian-backed trolls spent $100,000 for more than 3,000 Facebook and Instagram ads between June 2015 and August 2017.
The ads were highly sophisticated in tapping into divisions regarding politics, immigration, race, religion, gun rights and police conduct.
“They were intended to drive followership of the pages,” Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch told the House Intelligence Committee.
“It's clear they were able to drive a significant following … for a relatively small amount of money,” Stretch added.
“It's why this activity appears so pernicious. It was undertaken, I think, by people who understand social media. These people were not amateurs and I think (that) underscores the threat we're facing and why we are so focused on addressing it going forward.”
Examples of Russian ads on Facebook pages included:
“Back the Badge” a community that supported police officers that was created Oct. 19, 2016 and paid for in 111,000 Rubles (or $1,900 US dollars). It generated 1.3 million ad impressions and 73,000 clicks. A “Blacktivist” page with the tagline “Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud” was also paid in Rubles worth about $2,100 on Dec.10, 2015 and generated 531,000 ad impressions and 32,000 clicks. The “Being Patriotic” ad had images of American flags and a bald eagle that said “welcome every patriot we can reach.” It cost 330,000 Rubles ($5,700) and generated 530,000 impressions and 72,000 ad clicks. A “South United'” page used a confederate flag graphic and said “the South will rise again!” It cost just 78,000 rubles ($1,300 US dollars) and netted 511,000 ad impressions.
Other Russia ads shared promoted pages for “Danney Williams” who it claimed was “the out-of-wedlock son of former President Bill Clinton.”
Others were about banning Sharia law and Muslim women from wearing burqas and anti-Hillary Clinton propaganda including images of the Democratic nominee dressed as the devil.
After a real US user liked the page, subscribers would continue to grow.
Postings would continue to spread that were shared in users news feeds. The ideologically-charged images were aimed at exploiting divisions and eroding trust.
Rep. Will Hurd (R-Texas), a former CIA undercover officer, said the online campaign “is going to go down in history as the greatest covert action campaign in history” by Russia.
Earlier Wednesday at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) showed two Facebook groups created by Russians – one called “Heart of Texas” that peddled anti-immigrant messages and one called “United Muslims of America” that promoted Islamic pride.
Both Facebook pages posted an event for noon on May 21, 2016 at a Houston Islamic center — one to protest Muslims and the other to promote Muslims. What was orchestrated in St. Petersburg, Russia for a cost of about $200 in Facebook ads resulted in a real-life clash covered by local news.
“What neither side could have known is that Russia trolls were encouraging both sides to battle in the streets and create division between real Americans,” Burr said. “…You must do better to protect the American people and frankly all of your users from this kind of manipulation.”
BOSTON (CBS) – Boston Bruins president Cam Neely joined 98.5 The Sports Hub's Felger & Mazz on Thursday to talk hockey and all things Bruins.
Neely said he should refrain from talking about Shawn Thornton's incident, with his hearing scheduled for tomorrow, but he did open up about the hits that led to Thornton's actions.
Neely said he wasn't “overly thrilled” with Brooks Orpik's hit on Loui Eriksson, as the forward couldn't see the hit coming.
“Loui's playing the right side, he's a left-handed shot playing the right side, the puck went behind him,” explained Neely. “I still haven't really had an opportunity to see if in fact the puck did hit him anywhere. But what I do know, when it came off the boards, it came behind him, and him being a left-handed shot, he was looking the opposite way than he would be if he were a right-handed shot. He certainly had no clue that Orpik was coming.”
“I felt that if the puck was in front of him and not behind him, I'd feel better about the hit,” he said. “When I saw it live, I probably thought it was a good hit, but then seeing it slowed down and replayed, you think it may be a little questionable. But that always happens when you have the time to look at replays.”
Neely had plenty of criticism for the knee that James Neal delivered to the head of Brad Marchand.
“I certainly hated the knee to the head of Marchand. I know Brad can get under players' skin and that helps him, but guys have to control their emotions,” he said. “I was not surprised by the suspension. If it was longer, it wouldn't have surprised me either. You watch that play … and he clearly moved his knee to target the head.”
As for the ever-raging debate about fighting's place in the NHL, Neely said he still strongly believes that fighting plays an important role in the league.
“Obviously there is a strong push from certain reporters on both sides of the border who are talking every chance they can get about getting fighting out of the game. I think if they spend as much time and energy talking about that, or talking about headshots — and I'm not talking about a punch to the head as much as I am a knee to the head or a shoulder to the head or hits from behind — those to me have more of an impact for player safety than a fight does, in my opinion.
“As much as I respect that everybody has an opinion about our game, when you're on the ice, and you know all of the things that go on on the ice, whether it's conversations, whether it's a little stickwork that gets lost behind the scenes, I think if you have an opportunity to settle things by dropping your gloves, I think it's far better than settling things in different ways. I think that's why I believe that needs to be left in the game.
“The other thing I concern myself with is that everybody would be a tough guy. There won't be one guy that's not tough in the league if there's no fighting.”
With Brendan Shanahan's office working overtime with all of the recent suspensions in the league, Neely said the general consensus among those in charge of the league feel it's on the players' shoulders now to simply adjust to the rules that are firmly in place.
“I think the players really have to get a grip on it. At the Board of Governors meetings, Shanahan spoke that it's not so much that they want to suspend players, it's more like the players need to start understanding what they can and cannot do out there,” Neely said. “I know it's an emotional game and it's an emotional sport and tempers flare, but ultimately you can hand out all of these suspensions you want … really the players are the ones that have to figure this one out.
“Really, there's been a better understanding of what they can and cannot do as far as hits in the heads, but then you see some incidents that happen and you wonder if it'll ever get out of the game. But you certainly hope it will.”

We all manage what we manage, but struggle to accomplish what we must.
SAN JOSE — Fed up with political fallout from voting on their own salaries, San Jose lawmakers will ask voters to scrap the longstanding protocol of the City Council approving its own pay raises.
If approved by voters next year, San Jose's mayor and City Council members will get an automatic raise every July tied to cost-of-living increases. But it would be capped at 5 percent per year and the council could vote to decline it.
The change requires a vote by residents, costing San Jose about $136,000 to put a measure on the June or November ballot in 2018.
Since 1995, San Jose's mayor and council members have relied on an appointed salary-setting commission to make recommendations on their salaries and benefits every two years. City law allows them either to accept the recommended salary boost, decline it or adopt a lower amount.
The mayor and council members for years have refused the raises — for political reasons or because city employees took pay cuts amid budget shortfalls and a deep recession. Mayor Sam Liccardo and the council in January 2016 approved raises, but put off another boost last May.
Liccardo, along with Vice Mayor Magdalena Carrasco, and council members Chappie Jones, Raul Peralez and Sylvia Arenas, proposed stripping the council of the decision-making power and going with the automatic raises. The council approved the idea on a 10-1 vote Tuesday with Councilman Lan Diep opposed.
Diep said the council should not divest its own authority and a ballot measure is not a “worthwhile” expense. “I just say we should have more political courage, if we think we are worth that,” Diep said during the meeting. “There's a lot to this job.”
But Liccardo said elected officials voting on their own salaries is “bad for public confidence” and it creates conflicting loyalties.
“To be voting on budgets at the same time we're voting on our own salaries — which are paid out of that same budget — is fundamentally a conflict,” the mayor said.
Anti-choicers know that calling women stupid or evil in public is bad politics. So why do bills like Sen. Eddie Lucio's, which would require women to take a three-hour webinar on adoption in order to get an abortion, keep cropping up?
Anti-choicers know that calling women stupid or evil in public is bad politics. So why do bills like Sen. Eddie Lucio's, which would require women to take a three-hour webinar on adoption—implying women don't know what adoption is—keep cropping up?

Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry had to call a third special session this summer to deal with the actual business of running the state government, which went neglected during the first two special sessions—sessions that were completely hijacked by anti-choice politicians ramming through a major omnibus abortion bill that will shut down most of the state's clinics. But any hope Texas might have had that anti-choicers would drop their obsession with passing restrictions and impediments to abortion was quickly dashed when state Sen. Eddie Lucio, Jr. (D-Brownsville), filed a bill that would require women to take a three-hour webinar on adoption in order to get an abortion. And once again, we are reminded that the anti-choice opinion of women's intelligence and capabilities is shockingly low.
Anti-choicers just can't help themselves. They know that they need to fend off (entirely accurate) accusations of misogyny, but their view of women is just so dim that misogyny keeps cropping up anyway. The stereotype of women underlying this legislation is a particular favorite in anti-choice circles, the belief being that women who seek abortions are sexually incontinent morons who are too stupid to understand the realities of their own lives, or even what an abortion actually is.
The notion that women are too stupid to know that adoption is an option is breathtakingly misogynist, but what makes the whole thing even more disturbing is that this patronizing belief that women get abortions because they're stupid is the anti-choice version of trying not to be misogynist. After all, they routinely claim abortion is murder. If you don't present women who get abortion as too stupid to tie their shoes, then, as an anti-choicer, the only other alternative is to present them as cold-blooded killers—which, in turn, means arguing that one in three U.S. women deserves to go to jail, a politically toxic idea that the anti-choice movement will do anything to avoid. So they portray women as stupid instead of evil, because those are the only two options if you think abortion is morally wrong.
When your entire political movement is built on the premise that so many women must be stupid or evil, it's politically wise to change the subject away from your bigotry as much as you can. Indeed, that's what a lot of politicians have been trying to do. Passing regulations like requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at local hospitals or requiring clinics to meet ambulatory surgical center standards is a stroke of evil genius, because it exploits a regulatory system that has legitimate uses in setting health and safety standards—though of course these particular health and safety standards are not necessary. While forcing abortion clinics to have wider hallways or doctors to have hospital admitting privileges isn't a very sexy way to go about restricting access to abortion, it has the benefit of dropping the entire subject of women and why they get abortions. And the less anti-choicers share with the world about how little they think of women, the better they tend to do in the polls.

So why come up with a bill that might as well be titled the “Abortion Opponents Believe Women Are Stupid Bill”? Frankly, at the end of the day, I think many anti-choicers just can't help themselves. Their low opinion of women is, in their minds, a glittering jewel that can't just stay hidden away, but has to be shared with the world, even if the cost of doing so is making it that much harder to do real damage to women's lives. There's just something about misogynists that makes it hard for them to keep their opinions to themselves. Anyone who spends time online can attest to that, as the internet is teeming with woman-haters whose desire to issue rape threats or taunt feminists over the most piddly nonsense overwhelms pragmatic concerns such as preserving one's reputation or future employment opportunities.
Of course, expecting sexists to be logical about how they go about being sexist is kind of a silly thing to expect, if you give it a moment's thought. After all, being a devoted sexist is an irrational thing to waste your energies on in and of itself. The Texas legislature's anti-choice faction has demonstrated this beautifully. Passing this massive omnibus bill not only got in the way of doing real business and forced lawmakers to work throughout the summer they thought they'd have off, but it's going to cost the taxpayers up to $2.4 million just in the legislative costs. The cost of defending the law in the courts after the inevitable lawsuits are filed will likely run into the millions as well. The law runs a very high chance of being struck down by the court for clearly violating Planned Parenthood v. Casey, but even if the anti-choicers get their way and the law goes into effect, things are still going to be sour for anti-choice politicians.
The growth of a black market for abortions, the costs of having to enforce this medically unnecessary law, and the growth of social spending to help women who did not successfully seek an abortion all will be bad for Texas. The rational choice for people who are tasked with running the government is simply to let abortion be legal and available. After all, restrictions like this won't even stop that many abortions—some, sure, but women are going to seek illegal abortion drugs or travel out of state, and anti-choicers have to know that. So this is all a very, very expensive ploy to make life harder for women. People who put their resentment and loathing of women ahead of basic common sense aren't really thinking rationally to begin with, so their tendency to shoot themselves in the foot on the PR front all the time is understandable.
Right now, it's reasonable to believe that Lucio's bill will die without getting a vote. The mainstream anti-choice movement has very little time right now for antics like this, with the heavy focus being directed more at doctors than women when it comes to abortion restrictions. But as with most things misogyny, I expect that this sort of thing will rear its head again. Condescending women and making life hard for them are two things that are just so personally rewarding to anti-choicers that they'll be drawn to bills like this, even if part of them knows that, politically, it will only hurt them in the long run.
With literally millions of phishing scams crossing the wires each day, media reports about individual ones are the quintessential dog-bites-man stories that are rarely worth the time of writer or reader alike. Every now and then, though, one comes along that's clever enough to make it rise to the top of the massive steaming pile of messages. To wit: one recently caught by researchers from Symantec.
The phishing attempt shows up as an e-mail with the subject "Documents" and advises the recipient to view important files stored on Google Docs. It includes a link in the body. So far pretty banal stuff. But it gets better. As Symantec researcher Nick Johnson writes:
The fake page is actually hosted on Google's servers and is served over SSL, making the page even more convincing. The scammers have simply created a folder inside a Google Drive account, marked it as public, uploaded a file there, and then used Google Drive's preview feature to get a publicly accessible URL to include in their messages. This login page will look familiar to many Google users, as it's used across Google's services. (The text below "One account. All of Google." mentions what service is being accessed, but this is a subtlety that many will not notice.) It's quite common to be prompted with a login page like this when accessing a Google Docs link, and many people may enter their credentials without a second thought. After pressing "Sign in," the user's credentials are sent to a PHP script on a compromised web server. This page then redirects to a real Google Docs document, making the whole attack very convincing. Google accounts are a valuable target for phishers, as they can be used to access many services including Gmail and Google Play, which can be used to purchase Android applications and content.
With all the attention on zero-day exploits that surreptitiously install malware with little or no user interaction, it's easy to forget that one of the biggest threats we face is our own gullibility. Most people reading Ars are experienced enough to spot phishing attempts, but the campaign Symantec reported is one I could see my friends or relatives falling for, especially if they were tired, rushed, or otherwise not paying close attention.
When signing in to any service that wants a password, it's never a bad idea to slow down and take a close look, not only at the URL in the address bar, but also at the particular service being logged into. As Johnson points out, there are almost always subtle but crucial warnings when a scam is afoot.
Dez Bryant made it to the practice field a little late Friday after most likely spending some necessary time with the training staff inside Valley Ranch.
When the Dallas Cowboys wide receiver arrived outside his signature "X" was up in the sky. Check it out below.

Could this be a sign of good things to come for the Bryant and the 'Boys? No. 88 throws up the X with his hands after every touchdown he scores to signify that he's the "x-factor."
As for practice, Bryant went through rehab work off to the side with his left knee wrapped up before the start of the session (see video below). The minor injury came on his touchdown reception in Week 9 against the Eagles.

Bryant then joined his teammates and caught passes from quarterback Tony Romo during individual drills.
There should be no concern over Bryant's status for Week 11. The receiver played the previous week and there appears to be no major setbacks with his knee and foot injuries. The Cowboys are being cautious with their star receiver.

It was just a couple of days ago that word of a "Superdelegate Hitlist," compiled by an overzealous Bernie Sanders supporter (is there any other kind at this point?) was introduced into the media bloodstream. The deal was that a Sanders fan named Spencer Thayer had gone through the trouble of compiling the names and phone numbers of the Democratic superdelegates currently pledged to Hillary Clinton and released them to the masses, calling it a "hitlist" and imploring Sanderistas like himself to do whatever was necessary to make these people Feel the Bern and change their minds about whom they support for president.
The list originally featured an image of a donkey, the Democratic symbol, with two crossed arrows that appeared to be through its head. It's since been changed to two crossed telephone receivers attached to spiral cords, which you have to imagine confuses the hell out of the people it's intended to inspire, given that most college students have probably never seen a land-line. Either way, before the thing was even changed, the kids got the picture and began relentlessly harassing the superdelegates in question, calling them at all hours of the night in an effort to hector them into switching allegiances. Because that's the kind of thing guaranteed to make them think they'd rather vote for Bernie Sanders.

Over the past week or so, we've heard a couple of horror stories from the pestered superdelegates, but one such tale, published yesterday by The Hill, is noteworthy because of the specific kind of threat this person has seen leveled at his colleagues if they refuse to cooperate -- a threat that will sound all too familiar to anyone who's paid attention to political extremism in America over the last eight years. According to Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Democrat from Missouri, members of his caucus have been warned that if they don't dump Clinton and get on board with Bernie, they'll be primaried from the left.
Now if this does sound familiar to you, it's because the past several years have seen the Tea Party rise up, threaten and then purge anyone not ideologically clean enough to meet its exacting standards. The way they've done this is by primarying solid GOP candidates with far-right lunatics. That tactic is what gave us fringe know-nothings like Joe Miller, Ted Cruz, Sharon Angle and Christine O'Donnell and which ousted at least sane conservative candidates along the way, all of it culminating in the fall of Eric Cantor and the eventual resignation of John Boehner so that Paul Ryan could assume the speakership.
In other words, what we're seeing here is the threat of the same kind of purge, which means that we're seeing here, finally and officially, is the promise of the Bernie Sanders "revolution" becoming nothing more than the left's own version of the Tea Party. No matter which side you're on, when you demand purity, you wind up doing serious damage to your overall cause. But don't tell the members of the Sanders superdelegate hit squad that right now. I promise you they won't listen.
WASHINGTON — Speaker Paul D. Ryan condemned President Trump's blaming of “both sides” for last week's violence in Charlottesville, Va., but argued during a town hall on Monday night that the president had since repaired the damage he had done.
“It was not only morally ambiguous, it was equivocating,” Mr. Ryan, appearing at a CNN forum from his congressional district in Wisconsin, said of the president's remarks at a news conference last week, one of several instances in which he stoked tensions over the violence. “And that was wrong. That's why I think it was very, very important that he has since then cleared that up. I think it was important that he did that tonight.”
Mr. Trump indirectly addressed the violence in Charlottesville on Monday night at the start of his address laying out his new strategy to jump-start the faltering campaign against the Taliban and the Islamic State in Afghanistan.
“Let us make a simple promise to the men and women we ask to fight in our name, that when they return home from battle, they will find a country that has renewed the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that unite us together as one,” the president said.
Bluefin tuna stocks close to collapse
Updated
The prized southern bluefin tuna industry, worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Australia, could be heading for a major collapse unless a moratorium on fishing the species is adopted.
That is the view of TRAFFIC, a program of the conservation organisation WWF, and several scientists who are becoming increasingly concerned at the low level of spawning stock and the low levels of annual recruitment of young fish to that of breeding stock.
The issue will come to a head at the annual Commission for the Conservation of the Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), which meets in South Korea next week.
Lateline understands the scientific report to be presented at the meeting is expected to show a dramatic fall in stocks.
The delegates to the commission have all signed confidentiality agreements and the true state of the stock will only be revealed once the meeting finishes on Friday, October 23.
One of the delegates to the CCSBT, CSIRO scientist Campbell Davies, cannot reveal the latest scientific data but says the information from the 2008 reports shows the stock is not recovering, despite significant cuts to quotas over the past 10 years.
He says "this level is below the level of many nationally and internationally recognised limit points for fisheries management". In other words, below this point is crisis time.
The global marine program leader for TRAFFIC, Glenn Slant, puts the situation more bluntly: "The southern bluefin tuna is at an all-time low, below 10 per cent of its original population size, and what that means is at any time it could collapse."
"Just this week the Australian Government released its status report ... and I can tell you there is a lot of red ink in it which represents continued overfishing and overfished levels."
The report Mr Sant is referring to is the Fishery Status Reports 2008, put out by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics.
But Lateline believes the evidence to be presented to the CCSBT next week may show the southern bluefin tuna is now in a worse state than its northern cousin - the northern bluefin tuna, which has just been submitted by the Prince of Monaco for what is known as a CITIES listing.
The CITIES parties will now consider whether the tuna should be listed as an "endangered species". If accepted it would ban the trade in the species for commercial purposes, placing much more pressure on the southern bluefin tuna.
Scientists are improving their methods of stock assessment. Since the 1990s, electronic tags have revealed information about how the southern bluefin tuna migrates over large distances and how it hunts for food.
This information is helping scientists to more accurately determine the size of the spawning stock. Also, there is some hope that the use of genetic tags - a type of DNA fingerprinting technology - will allow scientists to estimate the size of the spawning stock independent of fishery reports.
Data questioned
The Australian Tuna Association, which represents the Port Lincoln community, disputes the scientific claims. Chief executive Brian Jefferies says the current data is not "transparent".
"The stock is recovering, there is no question about that. What everyone agrees on is that the stock is not at risk. Where people disagree is how quickly will it take to recover."
Australian tuna fishermen are angry the benefits that should have flowed from large cuts to the quota in 1990, and then by 50 per cent in 2006, were cancelled out by years of illegal overfishing by Japan.
Several years ago, the Japanese Government admitted it had illegally taken more than 120,000 tonnes of tuna above their total allowable catch (TAC). The figure is believed to be closer to 200,000 tonnes.
Mr Jefferies says the Japanese Government is "pulling their fishermen into line" and should be given credit for that.
However, Mr Jefferies say there should be a debate about whether Japan needs to pay back the thousands of tonnes of tuna it was illegally catching and selling.
"They should pay back 200,000 tonnes, when they only have a quota of 6,000 tonnes - this is a political issue for the two countries. Let's see if the Government takes into account other issues such as the health of the Australian tuna industry."
But Mr Jefferies does not believe next week's CCSBT meeting in South Korea will decide to significantly cut the total allowable catch for south bluefin tuna.
"The season is about to start, the boats and pontoons are in the water already. That is not realistic. That is not going to happen," he said.
"The real debate will be 2011, but it will be informed by the data available in 2010. We shouldn't panic and be driven by short-term decisions."
The Australian Tuna Association says it could cope with a cut to quotas if it was given enough time to adapt and the market conditions were right.
"If we were given plenty of notice, and the prices in the market were right, we will do what's best for the long-term of the resource," Mr Jefferies said.
"Australia is the only country that relies on this resource. Other countries have other fish and remember Port Lincoln has 5,000 working families relying on this resource.
"The data is not transparent enough. By 2011 we will have a better idea of where the stock actually is instead of just speculating."
Crunch time
But Mr Sant says there is enough evidence on the public record to show the stock is in severe decline.
"Unfortunately, when we talk about fisheries we are talking about communities and people," he said.
"Here we are in a fishing port, this port 20 years ago was dependent on eastern gem fish catches. The management of that stock was too little and too late, so the stock collapsed. At some stage we have to make hard decisions if we want a long-term future for the industry and the communities."
Mr Sant says he has been attending CCSBT meetings for 16 years but now it is "crunch time".
"What we would like to see in Korea is for the commissioners at this meeting to substantially reduce the catch of tuna and consider a zero catch for the next couple of years. We need to get the southern bluefin tuna on a firm footing if we are going to see a recovery of the stock and the industry."
For more on this issue watch Lateline tonight at 10:30pm on ABC 1.

Enjoying seasonal produce can be a joyous sensory overload. Not only do we nourish ourselves with every bite, we're offered a cerebral indulgence at the same time: we taste the abundant flavor, we touch each item as we hand-pick what's in season, we smell what's ripe, and we spot the perfect selections by their vibrant colors. Each selection ends with the sound of satisfaction as we consume the produce, so what better way to heighten the entire sensory and cerebral experience than through cannabis strain pairings?
We invite you to take your dining to the next level and savor what's in season with the following pairing suggestions, which match seasonally fresh fruits and veggies with the perfect strains to complement them. The terpenes that give these strains their unique aroma and flavor profiles accentuate flavor nuances in late spring and early summer produce, while cannabinoids augment your enjoyment of flavors and textures. Suddenly, getting the recommended daily servings of fruits and veggies doesn't seem like such a chore, does it?
Mangoes
Strain Pairing:
Terpene Profile: Myrcene, Limonene
Strain Flavors: citrus, earthy, sweet
Whether you enjoy your mangoes fresh, in a salsa poured over fish, or stirred into your gelato, the flavor will almost certainly meet your lips at some point this season. This exotic fruit needs something that can keep up, so we've paired it with Green Crack. The sativa keeps you alert and the citrus notes of the strain coincide beautifully with the sweet notes of the mango.
Tomatoes
Strain Pairing:
Terpene Profile: Caryophyllene
Strain Flavors: sweet, earthy, pungent
Juicy plump tomatoes are in abundance this season, and we can't get enough of them. GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) fits right in with tomato dishes: the acid from the tomatoes cuts those potent notes of pepper, wood, and spice in the strain.
Blueberries
Strain Pairing:
Terpene Profile: Myrcene
Strain Flavors: grape, sweet, berry
Blueberries are bountiful during this time of year. The purple-black pigment always stains your hands in a satisfying moment of tasty tart deliciousness. Enjoy them fresh, or nestled inside a decadent pastry, and consume with Grape Ape for the ultimate cerebral experience.
Peaches
Strain Pairing:
Terpene Profile: Linalool, Limonene
Strain Flavors: mango, tropical, sweet
Peaches are one of the best stone fruits on the market, and we can't get enough of these furry, succulent gems. Whether you eat them fresh or incorporate them into a recipe, they're best enjoyed with summer just around the corner. Connect those sweet flavors with a tropical finish characteristic of Mango Kush.
Lemons
Strain Pairing:
Terpene Profile: Limonene, Linalool
Strain Flavors: earthy, sweet, honey
Lemons are bright and bursting with acidity. They're tart to the taste and begging to be paired with something sweet. As such, they're best enjoyed by making fresh-squeezed lemonade. Pair your beverage with Willy's Wonder: this indica strain offers a sweet, honeyed flavor to balance everything out.
Avocados
Strain Pairing:
Terpene Profile: Linalool, Pinene
Strain Flavors: butter, flowery, sweet
Bumpy creamy avocados pair perfectly with Liquid Butter (or anything else, for that matter). You can taste the sweet buttery notes in the cannabis right alongside the healthy fats in this rich green fruit. The strain's indica effects keep you mellow, but its pinene-laden terpene profile ensures continued alertness as you savor this moment.
Cherries
Strain Pairing:
Terpene Profile: Limonene, Pinene
Strain Flavors: citrus, lemon, sweet
Pairing cherries with the Cherry Pie strain was too easy, so we thought outside the box. Naturally, Lemon Pie brings a sweet lemon taste to the table, playing in the cherries' juicy sweetness. This pairing offers a strong limonene terpene presence, relieving your stress and naturally making you happy. And really, who wouldn't be happy consuming cannabis with fresh seasonal cherries?
Cucumbers
Strain Pairing:
Terpene Profile: Limonene
Strain Flavors: lemon, citrus, sweet
Cucumbers are invariably refreshing: you can slice them up and infuse your water, sneak them into a salad, or use them to accent fresh ceviche dishes. My favorite way to take advantage of this seasonal favorite is to place chilled slices over my eyelids and spark up a joint loaded with Super Lemon Haze. As the citrus notes of the strain burst into a sweet lemon taste and mingle with the cucumber aromas, your mood is guaranteed to be elevated.
Oranges
Strain Pairing:
Terpene Profile: Limonene
Strain Flavors: diesel, pungent, earthy
We're sure this isn't the first time you've been told to eat an orange while consuming cannabis. One moment with this pairing and you'll understand why. The sweetness of the orange balances out the Sour Diesel as the pungent, earthy flavors of this strain work in sync with the citrus.
Beet Greens
Strain Pairing:
Terpene Profile: Caryophyllene, Myrcene
Strain Flavors: earthy, diesel, pungent
Beet greens plus roasted beets, goat cheese, and candied walnuts make for a delicious summer-ready salad, and the hybrid strain Chemdawg is the perfect companion to these greens. The earthiness of the bud plays into the peppery notes of the greens, and it all finishes with a little spice. The combo creates a pungent, woodsy aroma that is simply intoxicating.
ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Africa is not a country, and Africans generally do not live in trees or hunt game with spears. Nor do they all walk around in the nude among lions and zebras.
Chinedu Ezeamuzie shows some of his company's Web designs after an interview last week.
African immigrants to the United States say cartoonish caricatures and a Western media penchant for reporting on Africa's disease, hunger and war -- rather than the continent's successes -- trivialize their cultures. They complain they have trouble dispelling the stereotypes once they arrive in the States.
They concede, though, the myths run both ways and some say they were surprised to find their values more often aligned with those of white Americans than African-Americans.
"I have been laughed at because of my accent and asked all the ignorant questions," said iReporter Ajah-Aminata N'daw, 25, of Fall River, Massachusetts. "Questions like: Did I live on a tree? Roam the jungles naked? Have wild animals at home?"
N'daw emigrated from Dakar, Senegal, in 2001. She works in a hair-braiding salon and has met African-Americans who share her values of hard work and family, but in most cases, "we are raised differently, taught different values and held up to a different moral code." iReport: Read why N'daw is not African-American
Gaddafi Nkosi, 18, recently graduated from The Piney Woods School, a historically African-American boarding school about 22 miles southeast of Jackson, Mississippi. He has since returned to Pretoria, South Africa, but recalled well the misnomers he faced in the U.S.
"I came down from South Africa and so many people thought that maybe that's a jungle or maybe I'd go out chasing lions or something like that," he said. African, black students find common ground at Mississippi school »

Nkosi's American classmates acknowledge their misconceptions. Cydney Smith, 17, of Nashville, Tennessee, said she once believed Africa was populated with "uncivilized tribes."
Raphael Craig, 17, of Hyattsville, Maryland, said the television misinformed him as well.
Before Craig visited the continent in 2005 and 2006, he thought of Africans as "half-naked, running around with tigers in the jungle," Craig said, confessing he was unaware tigers roam only Asia.
But in Ghana and Nigeria, Craig saw children playing the same games he and his siblings played. He saw many signs of modernity, including Mercedes and other brands of cars found in the United States.
"OK, this country is running how we're running, just two different schools," Craig recalled thinking. "It really opened my eyes to the point that everything you see on TV is not always the actual thing."
If the Western media are doing Africans no favors, then the African media are also a disservice to African-Americans because it portrays them as criminals, some immigrants say.
Sandi Litia, 19, a Piney Woods graduate from Limulunga, Zambia, said she was initially scared of African-Americans because the African media show them "wearing clothes like gangsters and killing each other."
Nkosi concurred that African media "made it seem as if they were these aggressive people that did nothing constructive with their lives except occupy prison space."
Trying to fit in
Chinedu Ezeamuzie, 21, of Athens, Georgia, arrived in 2003. He had spent the majority of his life in Jabriya, Kuwait, and came to the U.S. to pursue his education.
The recent Georgia Tech graduate said he considers himself Nigerian because his parents -- both from the village of Uga -- instilled in their four children strong Nigerian values of family, community, spirituality and self-betterment. Test your Africa knowledge with a quiz »
In Athens, Ezeamuzie found his ideals at odds with those who shared his skin color at Clarke Central High School, his first stint in a public school.
On his first day, he donned khakis, a button-down dress shirt and nice leather shoes. He caught the African-Americans' attention upon stepping into the cafeteria, he said.
"They give me the look," he said. "Why is this guy dressed like the white folks, like the preppy guys?"
Africans in America U.S. states with the highest African immigrant populations:
 California (143,882)
 New York (141,958)
 Texas (110,042)
 Maryland (109,751)
 New Jersey (78,527)
 Georgia (69,548)
 Virginia (66,724)
 Massachusetts (65,151)
 Minnesota (63,612)
 Florida (59,176)
Source: U.S. Census Bureau
Ezeamuzie didn't understand why so few black students were in his advanced-placement classes. He didn't understand the de facto lunchroom segregation or the accusing glances he got for eating with white classmates. One classmate called him a traitor and asked, "Do you not like black people?"
"My whole life I had reaped benefits from being in different circles and bridging them," so he wanted to fit in, he said. iReport: What are the unique struggles of being African in America?
He found clothes akin to what he saw many African-Americans wearing --- baggy pants and an oversized T-shirt. He relaxed his British-trained tongue and tried out for the basketball team, the 6-foot-5 Ezeamuzie said.
Ezeamuzie recalled finding himself more confused by his experience with some African-Americans: Why were they so cliquish? Why did they mock students for being intelligent? Why were they homophobic and bent on using the n-word? Why did every conversation seem to involve drugs, girls or materialism?
"They kind of accepted me. They saw me a little differently, but I was thinking this is a very narrow mindset," Ezeamuzie said.
Ezeamuzie and other Africans say they feel African-Americans too often dwell on slavery and the racism that has persisted for more than a century since the Emancipation Proclamation.
"We have all been tortured," said iReporter Vera Ezimora, 24, a Nigerian student living in Baltimore, Maryland. "Now that we are free, holding on to the sins of white men who have long died and gone to meet their maker is more torture than anything we have suffered." iReport: Read about questions Ezimora faced when she came to the U.S.
Values at core of misunderstanding?
Martin Mohammed, president of the U.S. African Chamber of Commerce, estimates there are 3 million African immigrants in the U.S. -- about twice the U.S. Census Bureau estimate. He has heard from numerous immigrants struggling to find commonalities with Americans who share their skin color.
Mohammed emigrated from Somalia in 1998 and is now naturalized. He considers himself African-American, but "it does not mean that I have already assimilated into the culture."
Values and upbringings may lie at the center of the cultures' misunderstanding of each other, he said.
Many Africans come to the U.S. to escape dire conditions such as poverty or civil war. Their objectives are often advancing their education or finding good jobs, Mohammed said.
They also strive to reunite their families, or at least support them back home. Remittances from the U.S. to Africa total about $20 billion annually, according to the World Bank.
However, African immigrants find that education and good jobs elude their African-American brethren, and there is a perception that many African-American men aren't committed to supporting their families, Mohammed said.
The two cultures have much to teach each other -- especially politically and economically -- but they must accept they have something to learn.
"Honestly, what we need to do is realize both cultures are important," Mohammed said.
Myths thrive on ignorance
iReporter Emeka Aniukwu, 35, hails from Ebenebe, Nigeria, and said he has heard all the American misperceptions about Africa, but the cure to ignorance is communication.
He began dating Sonya Roberts, 25, of Austin, Texas, shortly after he arrived in the U.S. in March 2005. She taught him about African-American culture, and he taught her about Nigeria. The couple married two years ago.
"Talk to people, stop showing ugly face and don't be shy about your accent," he advised African immigrants. "Most of the media coverage about Africa is all about hunger, diseases and war, so what do you expect? People are curious and just want to know, so calm down and educate them as much as you can." iReport: Read why Aniukwu loves Africa-Americans
At Piney Woods, where about 35 of the 200 students emigrate from Africa, the school's president, Reginald Nichols, concurs that education is integral to understanding.
He's heard Africans say the African-Americans are aggressive, while the African-Americans accuse Africans of being reserved -- but the more they mingle the more they mesh, he said.
"You have the African students tell me that they have learned so much about standing up from the African-American students, and the African-American students said they've learned how to simmer down, so it's a wonderful thing," Nichols said.
Mohammed, too, said he'd like to see more African-Americans dispelling myths about Africa, which is increasingly important as Africans in the U.S. begin wielding more economic influence.
The chamber estimates African immigrants have about $50 billion in annual purchasing power. Numbers from the University of Georgia's Selig Center of Economic Growth indicate the number is just behind the nation's Native American community, which had $61.8 billion in buying power last year. The entire African-American market was estimated at $913 billion and the Hispanic market at $951 billion.
History dictates that economic power precedes political power. Mohammed said Africans can learn much about politics from African-Americans because of their "level of influence in Washington."
"I'm also interested to the extent that the black population can play a role in solving global conflict. We can help these discussions around the globe, but we must begin here in the U.S.A.," he said.
iReporter Faraji Goredenna, 53, of Layton, Utah, said he encourages African-Americans to learn more about Africa and lend a hand to Africans so they know "America's institutions and opportunities are open to them, too." iReport: Read how Goredenna embraces both cultures
But he'd like a symbiotic relationship, he said, explaining, "We African-Americans want to learn more about our history and culture as it exists in Africa, but we have also created a culture for ourselves here that we ask our brothers and sisters from Africa to respect."

This is where I grew up and where my mother still lives. It may not look like much, but it is one of the nicer apartment buildings in my Queens neighborhood. My grandmother lived a few blocks away, in a lower-income apartment. When I was in elementary school and my mother went back to work, I went to my grandparents after school. My grandmother made an excellent tuna fish sandwich, with chopped celery and dill.
My father was a physical therapist at a city hospital and my mother still works in publishing, so they never made that much money. They worked hard to put me through two very expensive private colleges, just so I could obtain two completely useless degrees — a B.A. in English and an M.F.A. in Film. I was totally spoiled by them.
I had an excellent childhood growing up in the Flushing/Kew Garden Hills area of Queens. The public school was good, the public library was two blocks away, and the neighborhood was incredibly diverse — blacks, Jews, Puerto Ricans, Indians, Chinese. I'm still good friends with guys from the neighborhood who I've known all my life. They're the first people I see every time I fly into New York.
I am so diverse — here I am with my Jewish childhood friend Barry at the Blue Bay Diner in Bayside last week, which looks exactly the same inside as it did when I was in high school.
When I was a child, Queens felt isolated from the excitement of Manhattan, but it was close enough to travel to by subway. (…ok, first you take a bus to get to the subway) My parents took me to museums and concerts all the time, so I was able to participate in the “high culture” of the city. We also lived near Queens College, which had a symphony orchestra. I spent many weekends in the audience with my parents, falling asleep to Schubert.
Although the stores in my neighborhood weren't very fancy (still no Starbucks!), you could get everything you needed just by walking down the block. There were grocers, a bakery, a Radio Shack, a cleaner, a pharmacy etc. This was perfect for my parents, who didn't drive a car. It also created entertainment for me. After school, my friend, Rob, and I could pass several hours just stopping in the Kissena Boulevard shops, or reading the comic books in the stationary store.
I only felt embarrassed about “Queens” once I went to Columbia, and met rich kids from the Upper East Side, Beverly Hills, Boston, etc. They had actually gone skiing in Aspen and visited museums in Florence. All of a sudden, Kissena Boulevard was very small time. I began to feel ashamed of my background, like a Jennifer Beals in Flashdance, moving from the steelmill to the hoity-toity ballet studio. It felt as if the entire borough of Manhattan looked down on Queens. The only reason to visit Queens was to go to the airports or see a sporting event. There was even talk about building a new stadium in Manhattan, so there would even be less reason to travel to Queens. Queens was the home of misfits, from Archie Bunker to Ugly Betty. During snowstorms, Manhattan was quickly shoveled by the plows since it is the center of the business and tourism worlds. Queens was always plowed last. Queens had her big moment in 1963-64 when the World's Fair was in Flushing Meadows Park, but then most of the fair buildings was just left behind to decay.

Eventually, I learned to embrace my Queens neighborhood. There was a cool mix of people on the street, and it felt more “New York authentic” than many of the streets of Manhattan. Today, “Sesame Street” reminds me of Queens, not Manhattan. Big Bird could never afford Manhattan. Sadly, whenever Sophia comes with me to visit my mother, I'm always disappointed that she can't see the area in the same positive way I do.
“It looks like a slum,” she said recently, as we walked down Kissena Boulevard. This hurt my feelings, especially because, in my heart, despite my romantic view of the neighborhood, I believed the same. At one time, the street was lively, with all sorts of shops and ethnic food. Gene Simmons, who grew up nearby, even named his group KISS, after Kissena Boulevard. Now, the neighborhood has deteriorated almost beyond recognition.
Half of the stores on the block are gated and closed — some stores have been empty for five years! Can't the management company find any tenants? What happened to the bakery, the pharmacy, the seafood store, the stationery store, the women's clothing store? Surely some business can make a profit here? People are afraid to walk outside at night because everything looks so abandoned. Why has this happened?
Perhaps the answer can be found on the website of the management company, Pelcorp. On the site, they advertise the entire block, not as available individual stores catering to a community, but only as a 240,000 sq. ft. shopping center. There had been rumors that the landlord isn't renting out the stores because it's interested in selling the entire block to a big-box entity like Kmart. This might explain why no stores never seem to be rented, despite having “For Rent” signs plastered on the gates of shuttered stores. Is the management company waiting for the opportunity to unload the entire property at once?
A view of Kissena Boulevard at noon, a far cry from what this busy street used to look like.
The management company has every right to sell the entire complex if they want to, but should they be allowed to thrust the entire neighborhood into a downward spiral? Who wants to live in an area where more than half the stores have been closed for years?
It is pretty sad state of affairs. I remember how The Garden Bakery made the best onion rolls I've ever tasted. There was “Sweet Donut,” a little coffee shop/donut store. Dr. Sakow, the friendly optometrist, fitted me with my first pair of dorky eyeglasses in the third grade. All of these stores are now gone, with no replacements.
Even if the management company does want to sell the entire property, shouldn't they at least be responsible for its upkeep? What about all the garbage and graffiti everywhere? Why should I be embarrassed to show my wife the “old neighborhood?” Why should my mother have to walk past the junk in the parking lot? People still LIVE in the neighborhood.
At one time, the landlord/management company was a local one, headed by a New York builder. He was always seen around the area because he also created middle-income housing across the street. After his passing, his son took over the real estate property, and it didn't surprise me at all that his management company is based in Palm Beach, Florida! Out of sight, out of mind.
From their website:
Our President, Prescott Lester, is the fourth generation of Builder Developers. He is responsible for building and developing nearly 3,000 residential units in Palm Beach County, Florida. Projects included Lakes of Laguna in West Palm Beach with 2,204 residential units and Cascade Lakes in Boynton Beach having 556 dwelling units. Mr. Lester's Greatgrandfather began building in Brooklyn, New York around the turn of the century. He was followed by his son David Minkin who became one of New York City's Master Builders. Mr. Lester assisted and succeeds his great uncle, David Minkin, in running the family's building, management and brokerage operations.
Here is a promotional photo of the late David Minkin, Prescott Lester, and former NY Mets (yeah, Queens!) pitching great Tom Seaver, who has apparently sold his New York baby boomer appeal for some hard cash.
Despite a history of New York building, the fourth generation of builders now “specializes in the marketing and sale of luxury properties in Palm Beach County. This includes waterfront, country club, and other estate properties.”
The Kissena Boulevard holdings, one of their four retail holdings still in New York, must be their least attractive holding, compared to their shiny new malls in Florida. No wonder they seem so disinterested in the upkeep of Kissena Boulevard!
I talked to a few people in my mother's building and they are very unhappy with the way Kissena Boulevard looks. Some say they would even move away, if they could afford it. The shopping area is pretty disgraceful, and much of the blame must go to the management company. They have played a major role in making the area look like a slum. Of course, since Pelcorp is in Palm Beach, and the executives don't get to come to Queens very often, I've included some photographs of Kissena Boulevard for Prescott Lester and his partners to see.

Craft brewing continues to climb statewide as production jumped about 21 percent with more than 39,000 barrels of beer made in 2014.
That's according to the State Craft Beer Sales & Production Statistics report prepared by the Brewers Association, a national advocacy group for craft beer makers in Boulder, Colo. The numbers were touted today during the Alabama Brewers Guild's annual meeting at Avondale Brewing in Birmingham.
2014 Alabama brewing statistics from the Brewers Association.
ABG, which has 31 members, has welcomed five new brewing partners over the past year in Birmingham, Tuscaloosa and Cullman.
Despite a rocky Legislative session that failed to pass ABG's direct sales bills, Back Forty Beer President and founder Jason Wilson said the growth statewide says "a lot about where we're going" as an industry.
"Here we are now, for most of us six or seven years into this industry being developed, and we're still seeing major double digit growth rates," said Wilson, who was recently named Auburn University's Young Entrepreneur of the Year.
Growler sales
A bill that would have allowed Alabama breweries and brewpubs to sell beer to go in growlers died earlier this month in the Legislature without a vote. The scaled-back measure, which was sponsored by Sen. Bill Holtzclaw, R-Madison, was the third unsuccessful direct sales bill introduced this year by ABG.
It was a blow to ABG and its members, who were counting on the extra revenue stream this year to fuel growth across the state. Alabama is currently the only state in the U.S. that does not allow some form of off-premises sales at breweries.
Despite no direct sales or self-distribution at this time, ABG President Wilson said the state's burgeoning brewing industry is growing at a pace that's faster than the national average.
"Right now in Alabama, these brewers are having to try to succeed with one hand tied behind their back," he said. "It's just difficult. We're competing against brands from all over the country that have these abilities and can take that money and bring it into this state to promote their products."
Economic impact study
Earlier this year, ABG commissioned a report from Jacksonville State University's Center for Economic Development and Business Research to determine how growler sales would affect Alabama's total economic impact, employment base, and tax revenue.
The study found ABG's Brewery Jobs Bill would create 655 jobs, generate $12.3 million in tax revenue and create $100 million in total economic output within three to five years.
Here's a quick breakdown:
461 - Number of jobs without implementation
1,116 - Number of jobs with implementation
$8,668,695 - Amount of tax revenue without implementation
$21,039,976 - Amount of tax revenue with implementation
$68,755,826 - Amount of economic output without implementation
$169,725,865 - Amount of economic output with implementation
ABG Executive Director Dan Roberts has said the failure to pass direct sales legislation in Alabama will hinder economic development in the state. Florida-based Cigar City Brewing told AL.com last fall it passed over Alabama for its Southeast expansion because off-premises sales and self-distribution are not present.
Key findings from a study the Alabama Brewers Guild commissioned from Jacksonsville State University.
"If you legalize this extra revenue stream, it's going to lead to investment," Roberts said.
Salty Nut
Salty Nut Brewery, which offers draft-only beer, is looking to expand with bottling and to a new location near the Stone Middle School development in Huntsville.
Co-owner Jay Kissell said direct sales would produce extra revenue for Salty Nut, allowing the small business to grow more quickly, attract new customers and compete with bigger brands.
"All of us in the industry find that as we make money, we're reinvesting it," he said. "It's not like we're taking home big paychecks out of this, but it fuels the growth rate to allow us to get to a larger size."
Alcohol commission
In late April, the Legislature gave final approval to House Joint Resolution 154, which created an Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Study Commission to look at other states' alcohol laws. The commission is expected to report its findings by Dec. 31.
Chattahoochee Brewing Company owner and ABG board member Derrell Winowich said his small enterprise in Phenix City would get a major boost from direct sales. The brewery near Columbus, Ga. has at least 3-5 customers each week who want to purchase beer to-go in a growler.
"I get that every week and in real numbers it's probably $1,000-$1,500 a month that it would mean to my bottom line," he said. " ... It would be a huge economic boom to me, and with these guys and the size they are, it would mean even more to them."
One of the world's largest bitcoin exchanges is reportedly close to announcing a new deal with the Luxembourg government that would enable it to launch regulated and licensed services across Europe.
According to sources, Bitstamp may have secured a payment institution (PI) or electronic money institution (EMI) license from Luxembourg regulators, a move that the company has reportedly said would allow it to become “the first regulated and licensed bitcoin exchange for all 28 countries in the EU”.
Founded in 2013 and originally based in Slovenia, Bitstamp has long been one of Europe's largest bitcoin startups, offering bitcoin trading and gold buying services to investors. The company is registered in the UK, the US and Luxembourg, where its Bitstamp Europe SA entity is based.
Such a move would come nearly two years after Luxembourg first opened dialogue with the industry, and weeks after blockchain-based payment app provider Circle received an e-money license in the UK.
Bitstamp is currently the fourth largest exchange by total US dollar trading volume, according to data from Bitcoin Charts, behind Bitfinex, BTC-e and Coinbase. The exchange saw just shy of 4,000 BTC traded in the last 24 hours, representing $1.6m in trades. Notably, it does not yet offer EUR trading.
A representative of the Luxembourg Trade & Investment Office declined to comment but said an announcement on the government's work with the industry could be forthcoming.
Bitstamp executives offered no comment when reached.

Hamish McIntosh in action for the Cats against Carlton in 2014
CATS ruckman Hamish McIntosh has announced his retirement, effective immediately.
The 30-year-old, who played 107 games for North Melbourne before joining Geelong in the 2012 trade period, made the decision after suffering yet another ankle injury.
"It's been an emotional few days," McIntosh told CatsTV on Wednesday.
"Unfortunately, my ankle has broken down again and I need surgery next week, so it's obviously forced my hand a little bit.
"I'll be retiring from AFL footy today. It's sad ... I've been a bit of a mess, really, because it's been an amazing journey to play for 13 years for two great clubs, in North Melbourne and here.
"It's been a ball, it's been so much fun, but unfortunately it all ends today."
McIntosh played 19 games for the Cats, all of them last season.
Injury problems restricted him to just two VFL appearances this year.

ROSCOSMOS. PROGRESS MS-04 SITUATION
December 1, 2016, Soyuz-U launch vehicle (LV) with cargo spacecraft Progress MS-04 was launched from the BAIKONUR Space Center. The LV flight was normal until 382-d seconds. After 382 seconds of flight the receiving Progress MS-04 telemetry data was stopped. Radar stations did not detect the cargo vehicle Progress MS-04 on the calculated orbit.
According to preliminary information, the contingency took place at an altitude of about 190 km over remote and unpopulated mountainous area of the Republic of Tyva. The most cargo spacecraft fragments burned in the dense atmosphere. The State Commission is conducting analysis of the current contingency. The loss of the cargo ship will not affect the normal operations of the ISS and the life of the station crew.

India has decided to allow power companies to pass on the costs of foreign coal to customers, a minister said on Friday, a move likely to boost imports and investment in power generation, but bring higher energy prices to consumers.
However, a proposal to raise gas prices for the first time in three years has been deferred, Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tiwari told reporters after a cabinet meeting.
A gas price rise to near-world levels would have fuelled investment in the sector and made liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from major producers like Qatar more attractive.
India is the world's third-largest producer of coal and more than half the country's power comes from burning the fuel, but domestic output falls short of demand, triggering frequent and lengthy power cuts in Asia's third-largest economy.
It also means power producers have to turn to expensive coal imports and until now, they have not been able to pass these costs fully on to customers.
"That's a very, very positive development," Isaac George, the chief financial officer at GVK Power, said of the government decision.
The move could help bring as much as 78,000 MW of generation capacity on stream, a Power Ministry source said.
India's economy grew at its weakest pace in a decade in the year to March 31, 2013 and the government is trying to tackle a raft of reforms, some leading to unpopular price rises, ahead of state elections this year and national elections in 2014.
Deferring a gas price rise to near world levels will see the government avoid an expected voter backlash.
CONSUMERS TO PAY
The new power prices have to be approved by individual states, which can decide to subsidise them and ease the costs for millions of poor Indians.
"Ultimately the consumers have got to pay for the cost of generation, so there is no question of the developer taking a hit on the cost of imported coal. There was absolutely no sense in that," said Mr. George.
Shares in GVK and other power companies like Tata Power and Adani Power rose after the decision.
India's electricity generation is dominated by state-run NTPC although an increasing number of private players are setting up units, often near the coast to facilitate imports.
The country's total installed capacity is about 212,000 MW as of January this year, according to the state electricity authority.
Coal accounts for over half of the country's energy demand and 80 per cent of production comes from Coal India Ltd, which is 90 per cent owned by the Union government.
Producers can either import directly or through state-run firms like Coal India and MMTC Ltd.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt admonished in a 1932 commencement address that “it is common sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly and try another.” FDR had the revival of a depressed U.S. economy in mind, but scientists experimenting with treating brain disorders with fetal cell transplants have taken his aphorism to heart. New methods are transforming past failures, and the results seem far more promising this go-round.
Fetal cell therapy began in earnest in the mid-1980s, among researchers hoping to treat Parkinson's disease. These patients have trouble controlling their movements partly because their brains lack the neurotransmitter dopamine. The hope was that tissue from fetal midbrains placed into patients' brains would turn into dopamine-making cells. Shortly after the turn of the century, however, the work foundered when a subset of transplant patients developed disabling movement disorders termed runaway dyskinesias.
But amid the setbacks was the fact that some subjects—especially those who were younger and less afflicted—did well with the fetal cells. “The question is, How do we reconcile all these disparate strands and problems with these trials and move the field forward?” says Roger Barker, a neurologist at the University of Cambridge who is meta-analyzing prior transplant data in hopes of devising a better trial. One possible explanation for the mixed findings is contamination: transplant tissue containing serotonin-secreting neurons could have muddied the results.
Although fetal cells may need support from other, nearby cells in a tissue transplant, Barker concedes that the field is moving to transplanting pure stem cells, rather than tissue. He and others are particularly heartened by safety results last year of the first fetal neural stem cell trial approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The phase I trial enrolled children born with Batten disease, a fatal neurodegenerative illness in which genetic mutations render patients unable to produce enzymes needed to clear cellular waste.
In the trial, six children had up to one billion fetal neural stem cells injected into the ventricles of the brain or into white matter tracts. None exhibited ill effects, and an autopsy of one child who died from the natural course of the disease indicated that the transplanted cells had grafted nicely into the brain.
This result is a big advance in the field, says Robert Steiner of the Oregon Health and Science University who was a principal investigator on the trial. “This is a much more sophisticated approach to doing neural cell transplants by actually purifying and only using fetal neural cells rather than the mix of cells used in the earlier trials,” he notes.
Achieving high degrees of purity—that is, assuring that the vast majority of cells being transplanted are only neural stem cells—requires careful separation of cells. StemCells in Palo Alto, Calif., which produced the cells for the trial, employed a technique that labels fetal neural stem cells with a fluorescent tag. That makes them easy to see and sort from other cells. With the technique, the firm says that at least 90 percent of their proprietary cells are neural stem cells—a critical benchmark for FDA approval in clinical trials.
The success of the safety trial has given the FDA confidence to green-light a second trial, this time for children with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD), a genetic disorder that compromises the creation of myelin, a fatty substance that sheaths the axons of nerves. The trial will inject neural stem cells into the brains of four children with PMD and use magnetic resonance imaging to track new myelin formation. Preclinical trials in animal models of PMD have demonstrated that the cells can differentiate into myelin-forming cells called oligodendrocytes and successfully create myelin sheaths, but they have yet to prove they can restore function.
Cells that are more developed might lead to functional results. Steven Goldman of the University of Rochester isolated neural stem cells of fetal origin that had differentiated into the progenitor cells of oligodendrocytes. When injected into mouse models of PMD, the precursor cells improved the health of afflicted rodents, which also lived a normal life span.
Scientists debate the best method of obtaining the cells. Rather than sorting primary cells in various stages of differentiation, for instance, Geron in Menlo Park, Calif., can induce the appropriate precursor cells from human embryonic stem cells. (Geron received FDA approval to use the cells for trials last year.) But in the end, only clinical trials can determine the best strategies. “Because now we have better ways of identifying the potentially regenerative cells in the fetal populations, we can probably perform more powerful and better targeted studies than before,” remarks Charles ffrench-Constant, an expert in regenerative neuroscience at the University of Edinburgh. Certainly for advocates, fetal cell transplantations are emerging from their dark days and moving into a reenergized spotlight.

A picture taken on June 21, 2013 shows President Vladimir Putin and ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson in Saint Petersburg. MICHAEL KLIMENTYEV/AFP/Getty Images
While now-CEO Rex Tillerson was a top executive at Texas-based ExxonMobil, the company circumvented U.S. sanctions in the mid-2000s against Iran, Syria, and Sudan, all deemed state sponsors of terror, and did business with the sanctioned regimes anyway through a European subsidiary, USA Today reported Monday. The sales to the sanctioned regimes took place from 2003 to 2005; Tillerson became a senior VP in 2001 and president and director in March 2004, but did not assume the CEO role until 2006.
From USA Today:
The sales were conducted in 2003, 2004 and 2005 by Infineum, in which ExxonMobil owned a 50% share, according to SEC documents unearthed by American Bridge, a Democratic research group. ExxonMobil told USA TODAY the transactions were legal because Infineum, a joint venture with Shell Corporation, was based in Europe and the transactions did not involve any U.S. employees. The filings, from 2006, show that the company had $53.2 million in sales to Iran, $600,000 in sales to Sudan and $1.1 million in sales to Syria during those three years.
ExxonMobil did not disclose its dealings with the pariah regimes with shareholders at the time, a decision the Securities and Exchange Commission questioned the wisdom of. “These are all legal activities complying with the sanctions at the time,” Alan Jeffers, a media manager at ExxonMobil, told USA TODAY. “We didn't feel they were material because of the size of the transactions.”
Tillerson, of course, is headed to Congress this week to begin the confirmation process for Secretary of State where the company's sanction-evasions are sure to be raised along with his connections to Vladimir Putin and Russia.

OTTAWA–Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde says Canada has a racism problem across the country.
Bellegarde was responding to a cover story by Maclean's magazine claiming Canada has a bigger race problem than the U.S. The story focused on Winnipeg claiming racism in the city was the “ugliest” in the country.
Bellegarde said he saw racism as a national problem.
“I think we have to do a lot more to address it,” said Bellegarde, in an interview with Nation to air later Thursday. “It is not in any particular region, it is right across Canada.”
The national chief told Maclean's he believed colonialism was at the root of racism in Canada.
“Colonialism didn't just impact Aboriginal people,” Bellegarde said to the magazine. “It forever changed the way the European population on the Prairies would see Aboriginals as a problem, never a partner.”
Bellegarde said Canada's colonialism has spawned a litany sins against Indigenous people.
“We have got to repair this relationship in this this land. It has been affected by colonialism, it has been affected by the imposition of residential schools, which is cultural genocide, it has been affected by the economic marginalization of the lands and resources being exploited without our being involved,” he said.
Bellegarde said one of the ways to begin reversing Canada's existing racism is to education children about the treaties and residential schools.
Aboriginal Affairs Minister Bernard Valcourt's office did not return request for comment as of this article's posting.

In a move that seems determined to fuel more international backlash against them, the Israeli government is preparing to seize a large plot of Palestinian farmland near Jericho, allowing nearby settlements to access the land for themselves.
The 380 acres of farmland is in territory which was intended to be part of an eventual Palestinian state, but settlers objected to this, as they've been illegally farming the outskirts of the land for years. Since it is in Israeli military administered land, the Palestinian owners weren't allowed to use it at any rate.
The government seizure, then, is the latest in a long line of retroactive legalization of illegal moves by settlers to appropriate privately owned Palestinian land. The argument will likely center on them using “abandoned” land after the military barred the Palestinians from it.
Israeli settlement expansions and territory seizures like this are illegal under international law, though the Israeli government insists they have a religious obligation to seize the territory, and usual react with fury when criticized for such moves.

So Keith Alexander, the General who managed the National Security Agency's (NSA's) wholesale surveillance of Americans and the rest of the world, headed through Washington DC's revolving door last month. Alexander is, of course, now selling his services to the financial industry for as much as $1 million a month.
His calendar is filling up rapidly, too, despite his pricey rates - offered through his new firm, IronNet Cybersecurity Inc. Standing in line for the General's attentions, according to Bloomberg, are the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), the Consumer Bankers Association and the Financial Services Roundtable (FSR).
The FSR itself is a veritable tilt-a-whirl of revolving doors, with a steadily increasing lobbying budget on behalf of its corporate bankers and insurers and a roster of high-placed former government officials. For example, the FSR employs the firm of Barnett, Sivon and Natter to advocate its causes. The eponymous Robert Barnett is a former chairman of the FDIC, and years ago, James Sivon was the staff director for the Republican members of the U.S. House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs.
Into this mix, comes Keith Alexander, the go-to-guy for advice on cyberattacks and information technology. While serving as the director of the NSA, he also headed the U.S. Cyber Command and managed both government surveillance and an array of advanced cyberweapons.
The U.S. Cyber Command, Alexander's lesser-known portfolio, is a relatively recently spawned creature that defends the military's own cyber systems and executes cyberattacks on the systems of other countries. USCYBERCOM's description of itself is a word salad (with bizarre punctuation) that reveals little:
USCYBERCOM plans, coordinates, integrates, synchronizes, and conducts activities to: direct the operations and defense of specified Department of Defense information networks and; prepare to, and when directed, conduct full-spectrum military cyberspace operations in order to enable actions in all domains, ensure US/Allied freedom of action in cyberspace and deny the same to our adversaries.
Despite its obscure purpose, the budget for USCYBERCOM doubled in 2014, presumably providing its director, Keith Alexander, with cyber awareness that is greater than ever. This expertise will now be placed at the service of the financial industry.
Looking at this arrangement objectively, it seems fishy. For a price, the General can tell you pretty accurately what a sophisticated cyberattacker can do to your database. He knows this because he managed these attacks. Consequently, for another pantload of payments, IronNet Cybersecurity Inc. will tell you how to fend off these assaults. The revolving generals and bankers can appropriate the products of our publicly-funded cyber research and development and deploy it for the financial world for a steep (privately collected) price.
In the person of Keith Alexander, we're seeing the de facto merger of corporate financial power and government overreach. Some subset of corporations is paid to develop the cyberattack and defense capability of the US government, and another subset pays the graduates of the contracting agencies (the NSA and USCYBERCOM) for an inside route to the technology.
All of this is conducted behind the veil of the War on Terror, an increasingly profitable funding vehicle for those well-placed to hop on board.
While pundits argue about who won the second presidential debate on Tuesday night, Mitt Romney showed himself to be a master of creating an (albeit unintentionally) trending phrase. “I went to a number of women's groups and said, ‘Can you help us find folks,' and they brought us whole binders full of women,” said the Republican presidential hopeful in response to a question about gender inequality in the workforce.
Romney referred back to his tenure as governor of Massachusetts, saying that, when putting together his cabinet, “all the applicants seemed to be men.” He noted that he made a “concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet” — as a result of which, he and his staff were brought “whole binders full of women.”
As it turns out, Romney's story is made up. It's another one of his lies and it has already become an Internet meme on Tumblr and Twitter. Here are some of #BindersFullOfWomen responses.

I think it goes without saying that Romney and his aides must be regretting his tall tale about “binders full of women.” They must be wondering, how in the h— are we going to (pun intended) clamp down on the furor the Republican candidate's words have wrought?

Here are some ideas for GSoC proposals that I think are good matches for the constraints and goals of Google Summer of Code and Haskell.org
Sorry for making this post late, I just realized we were 5 days from the GSoc deadline!
Make Template Haskell visible
There are critics of Tempalte Haskell, but it is often difficult to find constructive critiques from them. In a conversation with a new team member we were able to figure out that a big problem with Template Haskell for him is that it invisibly generates code. If the template Haskell generates identifiers then you can no longer just grep for those identifiers. You can turn on -ddump-splices, but viewing code generated that way is generally a horrible process. I started a ghc proposal to simply instead output the code to a file.
So if you have Foo.hs it would generate a file Foo.th.hs
Now when you grep for identifiers, they will show up, and you can see all the generated code.
My estimation may be wildly inaccurate, but I think the just above will not take that long. But that is a good thing for GSoC, to have an easy to achieve first goal that will immediately benefit the community. I think there are enough directions to take this project to keep the summer busy.
There are other sources of code generation such as deriving: these could also be added.
Making sure IDEs, and text editors can find the generated code and match it to their source location
Shipping the generated code and using it is an interesting idea to explore. This could help with cross-compiling and marking packages as Safe.
Improve the Persistent (Database serialization) library
Persistent is relied on by a lot of application developers, and it could definitely be improved. We already started work on Persistent 2.0, which will finally have flexible key support. There are so many things that could be improved with persistent, please talk with us to nail down a more concrete proposal.
Make a Haskell development mode
This is a continuation of a successful GSoC project from 2 years ago which created the fsnotify library now used by the community. The idea has always been to take things further and provide the ability to automatically recompile Haskell projects as files are edited, and figuring out how to do this as quickly possible through plugins or the GHC API. We already have yesod devel for yesod, but we want to improve this process and generalize it so it can be used effectively on any Haskell project.
I also want to give a shout out to an existing proposal for faster Cabal/GHC parallel builds A development mode helps manage the development compilation cycle to keep that process efficient, but ultimately the compilcation process needs to be as fast as possible.
Notes on applying to GSoC
The best thing you can do is find your project mentors ahead of time. This requires starting your application process today rather than the night before the hard deadline. Right now there are 3 possible proposals here, but only 2 mentors available. I will help look for more mentors in the community to match interest from students. A single student can make multiple proposals.
While even poke stalwart Sam Choy isn't sure of poke's exact origin, it's apparent that the current form of Japanese-influenced poke became pervasive throughout the “grindz” culture in the 1970s. Since then (and even more so since President Obama's win), poke — a Hawaiian seasoned raw tuna salad — has become one of the go-to island food memories for mainlanders. During a hot, summer day, a bowl of poke, whether eaten solo or accompanied by rice, brings out the snorkeler in everyone . Here are 3 newish — and one that's been around for a while — L.A. restaurants for fresh poke.

Seasalt Fish Grill's new branch in Downtown opened with poke on the menu — and the dish was so popular it was immediately introduced to Seasalt's original Santa Monica branch. The poke here is sesame soyed ahi (sourced daily under the guidelines of Long Beach Aquarium's “seafood of the future” program), tossed with sesame seeds and green onions. It's available with tortilla chips, on top of a salad, or by the pound. Restaurateur Jimmy Jang says the the Peruvian ceviche has also been a hit, and there's absolutely no “secret ingredient” in the poke recipe; we say he's simply bringing Hawaiian dreams to the cubicles drones of downtown Los Angeles. 508 Santa Monica Blvd., Santa Monica; 213-944-6631. 812 W. 7th St. ; Los Angeles; 213-243-5700.

The abominable practice of "civil forfeiture" is a legal procedure in which prosecutors can seize your property without accusing you—much less convicting you—of any crime.
The civil forfeiture racket raises billions of dollars for federal, state, and local governments. Most of the time, the seizing agency gets to keep the money it confiscates, creating a bounty hunter mentality throughout the law enforcement system.
But that's not enough, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. The DOJ is now implementing its first-ever National Asset Forfeiture Strategic Plan, with the goal of ensuring that prosecutors recover every last dollar of potentially forfeitable assets. That's a big job, because nearly 400 federal laws authorize civil and/or criminal asset forfeiture. Not to mention tens of thousands of state, local, and county asset forfeiture laws and ordinances.
According to former assistant Attorney General Alice S. Fisher:
"Today, there is legal authority to forfeit the proceeds of virtually all serious offenses including terrorism, drug trafficking, organized crime, child pornography, alien smuggling, human trafficking, white collar crime, and money laundering. The National Asset Forfeiture Strategic Plan seeks to develop and implement policies and procedures to ensure that asset forfeiture is an integral part of every investigation and prosecution."
In other words, the government wants to make absolutely sure that no forfeitable assets slip through the proverbial cracks.
How might this affect you? Well to begin with, consider what might happen if you have undeclared monies outside the United States and have used a structure such as an offshore trust or international business company (IBC) to hold those funds.
It would be difficult for prosecutors to claim that mere failure to disclose a foreign account constitutes money laundering. However, what if prosecutors discover you've formed a bearer share IBC, and you've used it to operate a bank account that has generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in untaxed profits?
Under that scenario, prosecutors could argue that you're using "sophisticated means" to defraud the government. This elevates a relatively mundane reporting violation into a tax fraud case involving money laundering. And in a money laundering prosecution, the government can confiscate not only the proceeds of a crime, but all assets "facilitating" that crime.
A jury might or might not agree that your domestic bank accounts, your home, your vehicle, and your business "facilitated" a money laundering violation, but that doesn't prevent a prosecutor hunting for scalps from alleging that they did. And in many cases, prosecutors can freeze your assets pending trial.
There's no question that the Obama administration and is determined to go after tax evaders who move their money offshore. Nor is there any question that the Department of Justice wants to maximize forfeiture revenues by any means necessary. That makes it more important than ever to be 100% compliant in your offshore dealings—or face the consequences.

Many clients have used this program to really be clear about what they need to do - and how to get started. You likely will too.
To begin, we just need to know where to send it:
WASHINGTON — Martin O'Malley said on Sunday that Bernie Sanders needs to stop “rewriting history” about the 2012 presidential campaign and his criticism of the president
“The reelection of the president was actually a harder election than the first one, and a time that we needed people to rally and get up for the battle at hand. And that's what I did,” O'Malley said in a phone interview with BuzzFeed News from Las Vegas, where Sanders and O'Malley are both courting the Latino vote at an immigration policy forum. “At the same time, Sen. Sanders was trying to get someone to primary the president.”
“In early 2012, there were a lot of Democrats who didn't have the president's back when he needed them the most. But I was not one of those, unlike Sen. Sanders, who criticized him from the sidelines or went trawling around trying to find someone to primary him,” O'Malley said. “I don't believe that Sen. Sanders should be allowed to rewrite history.”
O'Malley is courting something else too, these days: better standing in the polls. The former Maryland governor has struggled to move the needle with supporters and in fundraising. To that end, he's taking the gloves off even more, beginning what he called “the compare and contrast” phase of his campaign where he pledged to be “highlight the differences” between Sanders, Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, and his own campaign.
“It would be irresponsible for me not to point out those differences,” O'Malley said. “Frankly, it's those differences that make my candidacy more compelling than the other two.”
In Vegas, O'Malley tried to convince Latino voters that he was their real ally, while the other two candidates tried to court them with “poll-tested triangulation and half-truths” when it came to immigration and other issues.
O'Malley has been been happy to point out his age difference with his opponents right from the start of his candidacy, and his campaign has aggressively taken on Clinton and Sanders right along. But in recent days, O'Malley has been quicker to call out his opponents by name.
On Friday, O'Malley went after Sanders for his 2011 criticisms of Obama, which included endorsing the idea of a progressive primary opponent to take on the incumbent Democrat. Sanders rebuffed the attack, telling reporters the day after that he “vigorously” supported the president. The history shows Sanders was more critical of Obama during to reelect than many other Democratic surrogates — including O'Malley, who campaigned regularly for Obama in 2012 after supporting Clinton in the 2008 primary fight.
Asked about O'Malley's comments, Sanders strategist Michael Briggs dismissed the idea that his boss was anything less than an Obama booster.
“The fact is that Bernie was a strong supporter of President Obama in 2008 and 2012,” Briggs told BuzzFeed News in an email.
The Sanders attack is just one of many rhetorical jabs O'Malley is rolling out ahead of this week's second Democratic presidential debate, Saturday in Des Moines, Iowa. Asked if he was going negative, he said Democratic voters need to know there are big differences between their three remaining choices for nominee.
“I know that there's always a desire by some to turn these contests into some sort of cage fight. That's not what this has to be,” O'Malley said. “Look, this is very, very important business. This is the most important office in the land and on the planet. And so voters deserve to hear from us in debates, to expect us to do our duty to describe and explain our differences. That's what you have a responsibility to do as a candidate.”
Moscow: Russian president Vladimir Putin on Wednesday accused Ukraine of waging “terror" over alleged attempted incursions into annexed Crimea that Kiev has fiercely denied.
Russia's security agency announced it had thwarted “terrorist attacks" in Crimea by Ukrainian military intelligence and beaten back an armed assault, claims that have ratcheted up tensions first sparked by Moscow's 2014 annexation of the strategic Black Sea peninsula.
The Federal Security Service (FSB) said in a statement that one of its officers was killed in armed clashes while arresting “terrorists" on the night of 6-7 August, while a Russian soldier died in a firefight with “sabotage-terrorist" groups sent by the Ukrainian defence ministry on 8 August.
“This is very alarming news. In fact, our security services prevented an incursion into the territory by a sabotage-reconnaissance group from Ukraine's defence ministry," Putin said. The Kremlin leader accused the authorities in Kiev of “practising terror" and pledged not to leave the deaths of the two Russian officers unanswered.
“From the Russian side there were losses—two servicemen killed. We obviously will not let such things slide by," Putin said.
“This is a very dangerous game. We will of course do everything to assure the security of infrastructure, citizens and will take additional measures to provide security, including serious additional measures."
Moscow and Kiev have been locked in a bitter feud since the Kremlin seized Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014 after Russian-backed president Viktor Yanukovych was ousted.
Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said Moscow's claims were “senseless and cynical". “These fantasies are only another pretext for the next military threats toward Ukraine," Interfax news agency reported him as saying.
Ukraine's national security council chief Oleksandr Turchynov, meanwhile, branded the allegations as “hysterical and false" and said Moscow was trying to stoke fear in Crimea. Ukraine's defence ministry also dismissed the allegations as “nothing more than an attempt to justify the redeployment and aggressive actions" of Russian forces in the region.
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) monitoring the frontier between mainland Ukraine and Crimea did not report any incidents. But it said road traffic was halted earlier this week and border guards appeared to be on “heightened alert".
In its statement, the FSB—which controls Russia's border guards—said it had “foiled terrorist attacks on the territory of Crimea prepared by the intelligence directorate of the Ukrainian defence ministry".
“The aim of the sabotage and terrorist attacks was to destabilise the social and political situation" ahead of elections in Russia and Crimea next month, it said. The security agency said that in the August 6-7 raids, several people were detained, including a Ukrainian military intelligence officer, and a cache of explosives was discovered.
“On the night of 8 August 2016 special operations forces from the Ukrainian defence ministry carried out two more attempts to make a breakthrough by sabotage-terrorist groups," it said.
The assault included “massive firing from the side of the neighbouring state and armoured vehicles" but was beaten back by the Russian authorities, the statement said. The FSB said it had stepped up security measures around the peninsula following the alleged incidents.
Russia seized Crimea in 2014 after sending in thousands of special forces troops to take control of Ukrainian bases and holding a hastily-organised referendum that was rejected by the international community.
The move shattered ties between the two ex-Soviet neighbours and sent relations between Moscow and the West plummeting to their lowest point since the Cold War. Since its annexation by Russia, Crimea has remained largely peaceful.
However, a separatist conflict—that the West and Kiev blame on Moscow—has killed some 9,500 people in two regions of Ukraine's industrial east. Fighting in the east between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian rebels is still rumbling on as a peace deal to end the violence fails to make progress.
Putin said the alleged incidents in Crimea meant he would not hold a meeting with Poroshenko and mediators German chancellor Angela Merkel and French leader Francois Hollande on the conflict at the G20 summit in China in September.
Russia is gearing up for nationwide legislative elections on 18 September and Putin has previously warned his security officials that “foreign enemies" are seeking to disrupt the vote.
Game 3 - March 12, 2016
“It's arguable that in the first two games Lee Sedol was playing differently than his true style, trying to find a weakness in the computer. Today Lee was definitely playing his own game, from his strong opening to the complicated moves in the final kō. AlphaGo was ready for everything, including the kō fights, and was able to take the win. I'd like to congratulate the people who actually made this accomplishment possible, because it's a work of art.”
“Lee Sedol played well. As a professional player myself, I'd like to show my respect to his three consecutive games against AlphaGo, which played almost perfectly. Lee made a few diverse moves at the end of today's game to understand more about AlphaGo. I look forward to remaining games as well.”
AlphaGo has just won its third straight game, claiming overall match victory against the best Go player of the last decade, Lee Sedol. Playing as white, AlphaGo won by resignation after 176 moves. Lee used up all of his time and two periods of byō-yomi overtime, while AlphaGo had 8:31 left on the clock.AlphaGo created a large territory on the board but Lee Sedol used a few innovative tactics to start a huge all-or-nothing kō fight and complicate the situation. In the resulting kō fight, AlphaGo prevailed.All five games will be played to determine the final match score. The next game, Game Four, will be on Sunday, March 13, and the final game, Game Five, will be on Tuesday, March 15.
Here are the results and final board position from Game 3:
The Clostridium difficile bacteria, or C. diff, kills 29,000 Americans a year. (Photo: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
Life-threatening infections caused by bacteria called Clostridium difficile now sicken nearly half a million Americans a year, health officials said Wednesday.
The number of these infections — which can cause "deadly diarrhea" and damage to the colon — doubled between 2000 and 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In 2011, about 29,000 patients with the bacteria, also known as C. difficile or C. diff, died within a month of becoming sick, according to a CDC study published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine. One out of three of these infections occurs in people 65 and older. People 65 and older also account for most deaths.
"C. difficile infections cause immense suffering and death for thousands of Americans each year," CDC Director Tom Frieden said in a statement.

Although the infections are often treatable with antibiotics, toxins released by the bacteria can severely damage the colon, forcing doctors to remove it, says the CDC's Michael Bell, who specializes in drug-resistant pathogens and hospital-acquired infections.
C. diff is the most common health care-associated infection in the USA, costing hospitals $4.8 billion a year, according to the CDC.
About two-thirds of C. diff infections developed in patients with a recent hospital stay, although symptoms often set in only after discharge, according to the CDC. About 100,000 C. diff. infections a year are diagnosed in nursing home residents.
More than 80% of patients who pick up C. diff outside of hospitals had visited outpatient doctor's or dentist's offices in the previous 12 weeks, according to the CDC. The bacteria are hardy and can live on bed linens, bathroom fixtures and medical equipment, according to the CDC.
Although soap and water can wash off the bacteria, hand sanitizers don't kill C. diff, Bell says. The CDC recommends that doctors treating C. diff patients wear disposable gowns and gloves.
"The numbers are pretty striking," says Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who wasn't involved in the new study. "A substantial number of cases are occurring in people who have never been to a hospital."
Healthy people also can develop C. diff infections after taking antibiotics for illnesses as mild as urinary tract infections or bronchitis, says the CDC's Fernanda Lessa, the study's lead author.
Although antibiotics can save lives, they can also wipe out huge numbers of helpful bacteria that live in the digestive tract, says Amesh Adalja, senior associate at the Center for Health Security of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, who wasn't involved in the new study.
These bacteria normally keep the body healthy by competing with dangerous bacteria and keeping them in check, Adalja says. Antibiotics interfere with this delicate balance, killing off beneficial bacteria and allowing harmful ones to gain a foothold.
More than half of hospitalized patients are prescribed antibiotics. Yet studies show that 30% to 50% of these prescriptions are unnecessary or incorrect. Health care providers can help prevent C. diff infections by prescribing antibiotics only when they're really needed, Frieden said in his statement.
Christian Lillis says his mother died from C. diff in 2010 just a few days after taking an antibiotic related to a root canal surgery. She was 56.
"We struggled to understand how our mother could die from a disease we've never heard of," says Lillis, who founded the Peggy Lillis Memorial Foundation in her honor as a way to reduce the number of C. diff cases.
Hospitals have worked to combat C. diff infections for years, but authors of the new study say that the country needs to do more to prevent the infections in doctor's offices and clinics. England has reduced the number of C. diff infections by more than 60% by encouraging people to use antibiotics more carefully. A study from a Canadian hospital found that reducing antibiotic use 10% was associated with a 34% drop in C. diff cases.

It seems to have surpassed MRSA as the most prevalent hospital-acquired infection among patients, according to a study by Duke University Medical Center researchers.

People who are prescribed antibiotics should take the full dose exactly as prescribed, instead of stopping medications simply because they feel better, the CDC says. People who develop diarrhea after taking an antibiotic should contact a doctor, Bell says.
Some C. diff infections are hard to treat. Nearly one in five patients in the new study had a recurrence within 30 days of treatment.
In recent years, doctors have had success treating C. diff with fecal transplants, which help restore the gut's normal bacteria. A small 2013 study found that the transplants cured 94% of C. diff patients.
Although the transplants were once considered "last-ditch" efforts to save people who might otherwise have died, the procedures are now being done earlier in the course of treatment, Bell says. Several drug companies, including Sanofi and Pfizer, are working on C. diff vaccines.

Bailey's three-day hospitalization for the brain surgery turned into a nine-month ordeal, with multiple hospitalizations and, ultimately, a pioneering series of fecal transplants to get the infection under control.

Sharia Law
Islam's Sharia law is cast from the words of Muhammad, called "hadith," his actions, called "sunnah," and the Quran, which he dictated. The Sharia law itself cannot be altered but its interpretation, called "fiqh," by muftis (Islamic jurists) is given some latitude.
As a legal system, the Sharia law is exceptionally broad. While other legal codes regulate public behavior, Sharia regulates public behavior, private behavior, and even private beliefs. Compared to other legal codes, the Sharia law also prioritizes punishment over rehabilitation and favors corporal and capital punishments over incarceration. Of all legal systems in the world today, the Sharia law is the most intrusive and restrictive, especially against women. According to the Sharia law (see the links for details):
• Theft is punishable by amputation of the hands (Quran 5:38).
• Criticizing or denying any part of the Quran is punishable by death.
• Criticizing Muhammad or denying that he is a prophet is punishable by death.
• Criticizing or denying Allah is punishable by death (see Allah moon god).
• A Muslim who becomes a non-Muslim is punishable by death (See Compulsion).
• A non-Muslim who leads a Muslim away from Islam is punishable by death.
• A non-Muslim man who marries a Muslim woman is punishable by death.
• A woman or girl who has been raped cannot testify in court against her rapist(s).
• Testimonies of 4 male witnesses are required to prove rape of a female (Quran 24:13).
• A woman or girl who alleges rape without producing 4 male witnesses is guilty of adultery.
• A woman or girl found guilty of adultery is punishable by death (see "Islamophobia").
• A male convicted of rape can have his conviction dismissed by marrying his victim.
• Muslim men have sexual rights to any woman/girl not wearing the Hijab (see Taharrush).
• A woman can have 1 husband, who can have up to 4 wives; Muhammad can have more.
• A man can marry an infant girl and consummate the marriage when she is 9 years old.
• Girls' clitoris should be cut (Muhammad's words, Book 41, Kitab Al-Adab, Hadith 5251).
• A man can beat his wife for insubordination (see Quran 4:34 and Religion of Peace).
• A man can unilaterally divorce his wife; a wife needs her husband's consent to divorce.
• A divorced wife loses custody of all children over 6 years of age or when they exceed it.
• A woman's testimony in court, allowed in property cases, carries ½ the weight of a man's.
• A female heir inherits half of what a male heir inherits (see Mathematics in Quran).
• A woman cannot speak alone to a man who is not her husband or relative.
• Meat to eat must come from animals that have been sacrificed to Allah - i.e., be "Halal."
• Muslims should engage in Taqiyya and lie to non-Muslims to advance Islam.
• Continue...
Which countries use the Sharia law?
Muslims' aspired Sharia state is the birthplace of Muhammad that has no legal code other than the Sharia law and enforces it without mercy: Saudi Arabia. But as detailed below, the Sharia law is also used in full or in part, nationally or regionally in:
* In the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and other European countries that resist the Sharia law, it has proven adept at infiltrating elements of the society that are left vulnerable (see Sharia law in America and Islamization of America).
** Percent of Muslims who favor making Sharia the official law in their country (source: Pew Forum Research). In many countries where an official secular legal system exists alongside the Sharia law, the majority of their Muslim citizens favor making Sharia the official law. For example, while Egypt's military blocked the Muslim Brotherhood's efforts in this direction in 2013, 74% of Egypt's Muslims still favor it. Even in Jordan, Indonesia and Malaysia - Muslim countries with progressive images - the relatively secular ruling elite sit atop Muslim masses, 71%, 72% and 86% respectively of whom want their countries to be ruled by Sharia. And in Iraq, where the United States has been propping up democracy since 2003, 91% of its Muslims want to live under the Sharia law.
The number of countries penetrated by Sharia law continues to grow, as does the depth of its penetration in the countries already affected. This penetration is not by happenstance; it is managed to occur in five phases: see Spread of Islam and the 10 steps to Stop Islam.

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said on Friday that the United States government spends "billions of dollars scooping up" Americans' phone records when it should be focusing more of its resources on Arabic speakers.
"We spend billions of dollars scooping up all the phone records of millions of Americans and sending them to Utah, to a multi-billion-dollar science-fiction sort of headquarters there, to house all these records, when in reality what we ought to do is maybe spend more time on people who speak Arabic, people who are looking at public avenues and public access to see who are the ones talking and might want to harm us," Paul told radio host Dave Price.
Paul made the comment in response to a question about how to prevent shootings like the one in San Bernardino, California on Wednesday. Paul's campaign did not immediately respond to BuzzFeed News on what Paul specifically meant when he said "people who speak Arabic" and " people who are looking at public avenues and public access."
Paul said in the interview that, "Sometimes, there is no answer" to the question of preventing shootings, but added that, despite being a "great advocate of privacy," he was in favor of "targeted surveillance" and the "individualized search and seizure of records" after obtaining a warrant.
"I would say that targeted surveillance — I'm not against surveillance. I'm not against looking at records," Paul said. "So if you call me up and you say, 'We have evidence that this gentleman is communicating with a guy who we know advocates for violence, and know advocates for killing Americans, and this is a radical Imam and we are watching this guy because we have suspicion,' I'm for that. And if we know that this man is talking to this person in San Bernardino, that's suspicion. Then you go to a judge."
He argued the country also needs "to control our borders," and said his Republican presidential rival Marco Rubio was "the weakest of the weak on defending the border."
"And so the thing is, is you've got people like Marco Rubio, saying, 'Oh, he's strong on national defense,'" Paul said. "Well, he's the weakest of the weak on defending the border. And if you don't defend the border, you really can't defend the country. And so we've had multiple attempts throughout a several year period to convince Marco that you've gotta defend the border if you' re gonna defend the country. And at every turn he's opposed increasing the strength of border security."
Russian coal mining settlement in Svalbard, Norway
Barentsburg (Russian: Баренцбург) is the second-largest settlement on Svalbard, with about 500 inhabitants (2007), almost entirely Russians and Ukrainians. It is the site of the Barentsburg Pomor Museum.
History [ edit ]
Rijpsburg was the name of an abandoned Dutch settlement on Spitsbergen on Cape Boheman, at the southern end of the Nordfjorden in the Isfjord, diagonally opposite Longyearbyen. It was built in 1920 by the Rotterdam Van der Eb and Dresselhuys Scheepvaartmaatschappij (Shipbuildingcompany) with prefab huts for the mining of coal. 12 Dutch staff and 52 German miners started mining coal here that year. Dutch Spitsbergen Company (NESPICO) was founded in 1920 and mined coal in Green Harbour fjord on Spitsbergen from 1921 to 1926. The company renamed the settlement Barentsburg after Dutch explorer Willem Barentsz. In 1932 the propriertors sold the mine, including its settlement Barentsburg, to the Russian Trust Arktikugol. The population has declined over the decades; in its heyday, over 1,000 Soviet citizens inhabited Barentsburg.
2006 fire [ edit ]
On October 17, 2006 Norwegian inspectors detected a smoldering underground fire in Barentsburg, prompting fears that an open fire might break out,[2] which would have forced the total evacuation of Barentsburg for an indefinite period of time, and also cause environmental problems of unknown magnitude for the entire archipelago. The fire was later contained.[3] Coal mining resumed at the end of 2010.[4]
Status [ edit ]
Although Svalbard is under Norwegian sovereignty, the unique Svalbard Treaty of 1920 allows citizens of signatory countries equal rights to exploit natural resources. Russia, along with Norway (via the Sveagruva mine and Mine 7), maintains mining operations on Svalbard as a result. Russia maintains a consulate in Barentsburg,[5] the northernmost diplomatic mission of any kind in the world. Barentsburg still has a Norwegian mail address and Norwegian phone numbers.
Economic basis [ edit ]
Barentsburg started as a Dutch mining town in the 1920s.[6] In 1932 the Dutch sold their concession to the Soviet Union.[7] Since 1932 the Russian state-owned Arktikugol Trust (Russian for "Arctic Coal") has been operating on Svalbard. The main economic activity is coal mining by the Arktikugol (Арктикуголь) company. The coal is usually exported to Northern European buyers. The town relies entirely on mainland Russia for food and coinage. There have been instances in which not enough food was sent, and aid packages were sent from Longyearbyen. Tourism is now being developed, but does not yet generate enough income to revive the town.
Transportation [ edit ]
The distance from Longyearbyen to Barentsburg is about 55 km but there are no roads connecting the two settlements. Most contact between the two is by boat, snowmobile, or helicopter. There is a heliport (ICAO code ENBA) with a road connection at Heerodden ( ), 4 km north of Barentsburg. Tourists usually arrive via a 2-3-hour boat trip from Longyearbyen. The coal is freighted by ship. The port is located in the middle of Barentsburg.
Climate [ edit ]
Barentsburg features a tundra climate under the Köppen climate classification, with short, chilly “summers” and long, brutally cold winters, though winters here are noticeably warmer than winters in a number of locations with subarctic climates. Due to the fact that the town is located at a latitude approaching 80 degrees, only in four months of the year are average temperatures above freezing, and in no month does the average monthly temperature exceed 10 °C (50 °F). Average low temperatures during the winter routinely drop below −15 °C (5 °F). Barentsburg averages roughly 550 millimetres (22 in) of precipitation, much of which falls as snow. In fact, the town typically experiences snowfall in every month of the year.

M. Presnyakov. The old Barentsburg church, 2014
The Barentsburg Pomor Museum presents Pomor culture, Arctic flora and fauna, and archeological objects preserved in the permafrost. It is open when the daily, summer-only boat from Longyear arrives and by special arrangement. There is an athletic complex, including a swimming pool with heated seawater.
Every summer, several dozen geophysicists, geologists, archeologists, biologists, glaciologists, geographers, etc., from Russia and elsewhere work in the scientific research centre. There is also a year-round meteorological observatory and the northernmost cosmic rays station.
Education [ edit ]
The school
Barentsburg has its own school serving the Russian community; in 2014 it had three teachers, with one for most subjects, one for music, and one for the English language. By 2014 its welfare funds had declined.[9]

If the news around you makes you think that humans have stooped to an all-time low, there's more coming your way.
Recent events such as the attacks on women on New Year's Eve in Cologne, Germany, have been pinned down to the Middle Eastern refugees and different asylum seekers that are currently residing in the country.
Because rape, or any other form of sexual or physical assault on women, isn't a country or region-specific phenomena, but the result of an inherently misogynistic and discriminatory attitude that exists globally.
Source: www.scoopwhoop.com
However, there's a disgusting, scarring Arab rape game, known as Taharrush Jama'i (collective harassment) whereby women are sexually assaulted by various men in a public place, and it is slowly spreading to Europe. It begs the question; is the blame that Europeans level on the Middle Eastern mindset for being deeply conservative and misogynistic a reality?
Source: lipstickalley.com
Basically, how Taharrush Jama'i works is that a woman is usually attacked by some men in a public place, during rallies, protests or festivals where a crowd is gathered, and they gang rape the female protected by a small cover, who shield them from the rest of the crowd and makes sure the act doesn't gather much attention.

The phenomenon was especially widely reported in Egypt during the Arab Spring. It caught the international media's attention when a reporter, Lara Logan was assaulted, stripped and raped over the duration of 25 minutes while she was covering the celebrations in Egypt following the toppling of Hosni Mubarak.
Source: jezebel.com
The ‘rape game' is now being reported across various European countries such as Switzerland, Sweden, and Finland.
With recent events unfolding in Germany, and them being linked to the Middle Eastern refugees and the supposed “Islamic” ideals, Europe is looking into hardening its immigration laws to limit, or stop altogether, the influx of people.

We may have just met the biggest Aaron Rodgers fan in the world. His name is David Pehl. He is a sixth-grader, and he refuses to take off his beloved Green Bay Packers jersey.
WKBT Wisconsin has a report that will have you rooting on Pehl as he inches closer to his ultimate goal of owning a peculiar jersey record. As the report mentions, the record is held by someone who rocked a Brett Favre jersey for just over four years, so Pehl has some work yet.
By the time he closes in on the record, we imagine the Rodgers replica will be completely devoid of any semblance of the name that once sat proudly on the back.
And really, you have to give some props to the parents for embracing their kid's mission, no matter how silly the endeavor might be.
In fact, this reminds us of a movie about wonderful parenting:
The best part in all this, other than the family saving a great deal of money on back-to-school clothes, is that the rest of the Pehl clan are Vikings fans. Somewhere along the line, their little boy became a huge Packers fan.
Obviously, any family would embrace their son, no matter team affiliation, but Dave, the patriarch of this football family, went one huge step further. Dressed in his own Vikings gear, he set out to paint his son's bedroom in Packers colors.
Per the report, the father states, "Being a Viking family we tried to convert him, but once we knew he wasn't going to convert we said OK."
The hilarious jersey that is now more of a solid green shirt than anything has been on the young Pehl for a reported 1,034 consecutive days (nearly three years).
Of course, you must be thinking that there's a visible cloud of stink following the kid around like Peanuts character Pig-Pen. Relax, because the jersey gets regular handwashing to the tune of every other day.
So, if you parents are tired of deciding what to clothe your kids in, just get them excited about an athlete and the rest will take care of itself.

Report: Bill and Hillary Haven't Spoken in Months After He Threw Her Book ‘What Happened' in the Trash
A new report claims that the Clintons haven't spoken to each other in months and are only communicating through friends and lawyers.
The Daily Mail reported that according to author Ed Klein, who has written several books on the Clintons, the former President threw a manuscript of Hillary's memoir ‘What Happened' in the trash after she ignored his advice not to publish the book.
Bill had red-penned the book in an attempt to improve it, a friend allegedly told Klein, but flew into a rage when Hillary refused to read any of his notes. ‘He hated the title because calling it “What Happened” would only make people say, “You lost.” ‘He urged her to postpone the pub date and rewrite the book, but she yelled at him and said: “The book is finished and that's how it's going to be published”.' The argument is believed to have taken place over the summer before Hillary took off on tour in order to promote the book. Bill and Hillary were last pictured together toward the end of August while enjoying a visit to see friends in the Hamptons. The couple have not been seen together since.
Ed Klein's book All Out War: The Plot to Destroy Trump will be released in late October.
The Clintons completely lost their power after Hillary Clinton lost the election. Neither of them are in a position to sell influence and power in exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation. Their marriage has been one of convenience for decades.
We sure dodged a bullet by not having the Clintons in the White House AGAIN.
RMT members walk out from Friday to Monday in dispute over ‘repeatedly undermined' work-life balance
Eurostar rail workers have begun a four-day strike in a dispute over work-life balance.
Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union will walk out from Friday to Monday, followed by three days over the bank holiday weekend from 27 August. A picket line will be mounted outside London St Pancras station, where trains depart for Paris and Brussels.
One train in each direction between London and Brussels was cancelled on Friday, and Eurostar said it expected to operate a normal service on Saturday. The company said it was working on plans for Sunday and Monday and would be able to accommodate all customers booked to travel.
The union said the dispute centred on Eurostar's failure to honour an agreement from 2008 which sought to ensure that train managers could expect a good work-life balance in terms of hours and duty rosters.
Around 80 train managers are involved in the dispute. RMT members voted in favour of strike action, claiming that their work-life balance was being repeatedly undermined.
Mick Cash, the union's general secretary, said: “Our train manager members at Eurostar have a heavy commitment to shift work and unsocial hours and are sick and tired of the company's failure to honour agreements.
“Our members have every right to have a fair work-life balance that fulfils the operational needs of the company while guaranteeing quality time off for friends and family. It's now time for Eurostar to come to the negotiating table with a set of proposals that honours our agreements and guarantees our members a genuine work-life balance.”
A Eurostar spokesman said: “We are aware of the plans for strike action and our focus has been seeking a joint resolution whilst planning to provide a good service for our customers.
“On the days of the strike we have made some small changes to our timetable to ensure that all passengers booked to travel will be able to on those days. Passengers affected will be notified in advance.”
The TSSA rail union announced that its train manager members on Eurostar would strike on 14 and 15 August and for two days over the bank holiday weekend – Sunday 28 August and Monday 29 August – in the same dispute.
Its general secretary, Manuel Cortes, said there was still a “window of opportunity” to solve the dispute in talks with management on Friday.
“This is a longstanding issue and there is still time to resolve it if common sense prevails on Friday,” he said. “No one wants to see disruption at holiday times and we will be working for a peaceful solution.”
Timetable alterations
Eurostar has announced the cancellation of the following trains:
Friday 12 August
08.04 from London to Brussels

PARIS, France (AFP) — A divorced mother-of-three, French far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen has played up her gender to soften her image and grow her vote beyond her party's traditional white male base.
In her campaign video Le Pen, who faces centrist Emmanuel Macron in the second round of the election on Sunday, introduces herself as “a woman” and “a mother” before adding that she was a lawyer before going into politics.
She is shown leafing through a family album containing photographs of her and her two sisters.

Airbrushed out of the picture is her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, a convicted anti-Semite who passed the reins of the anti-immigration National Front (FN) to his daughter in 2011 but was booted out of the party four years later for downplaying the Holocaust.
But the accompanying message on Islam is still uncompromising, with Le Pen warning darkly of “the restriction of freedoms that have multiplied in our country through the rise of Islamic fundamentalism.”
In the six years since Le Pen took over the leadership of the FN — a position from which she took leave to campaign in the run-off — the party's share of the female vote has grown exponentially.
An Ipsos poll conducted before the first round of the election showed 20 percent of women backing her, nearly on a par with her share of the male vote, which stood at 24%.
Le Pen placed second in the opening round with 7.7 million votes, taking a step closer to becoming France's first “presidente.”
Analysts have linked her success to her inroads among female voters, who represent 52% of the electorate.
When Le Pen senior, a former paratrooper, was in charge the FN attracted mainly young masculine types “in search of a virile leader,” according to political scientist Virginie Martin.
Le Pen, who gave a tell-all interview about her childhood to French M6 television in October, has attempted to give the party a new face.
“I want to defend French women,” she said in a four-page pamphlet designed to look like a fashion magazine, four million copies of which were printed in February.
The pamphlet featured a smiling Le Pen on the cover, with headlines describing her as “A woman with heart” and a female politician “In A Man's World.”
‘Taboo smashed'
“Marine Le Pen's leadership smashed the taboo of the FN vote among women,” Martin said.
But for feminist groups like the Osez Le Feminisme (Dare Feminism) collective, the FN remains an “anti-republic, anti-feminist” party.
“No, Marine Le Pen is not the candidate of women,” Osez Le Feminisme said in a statement.
In Le Pen's list of 144 campaigns promises “defending women's rights” comes near the top, at number 9.
In it she lists radical Islam as the first threat to women's rights in France, ahead of gender pay inequality.
Rebecca Amsellem, founder of the feminist newsletter Les Glorieuses accused Le Pen of subverting women's rights to send a “xenophobic message.”
“Let's not kid ourselves. Marine Le Pen is no women's rights activist,” Amsellem said, pointing to Le Pen's voting record at the European Parliament.
Le Pen has only backed three out of 59 EU bills on women's rights since becoming a member of the parliament in 2004, France 2 public broadcaster reported. She was absent for 32 votes, abstained for 7 and voted against on 17 occasions.
But she has broken with the traditionalist Catholic line of the FN's old guard by opposing calls to reduce reimbursements for abortions and steering clear of demonstrations against a 2013 gay marriage bill.
Polls currently show Le Pen lagging Macron by over 20 points in Sunday's runoff.
If she were badly beaten, “the hardliners will make a comeback,” Martin predicted.

The government contractor who killed 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard last week was driven by delusions that he was being controlled by low-frequency radio waves and scratched the words “End the torment!” on the barrel of the shotgun he used, the FBI said Wednesday, offering new, chilling details of the attack.
Valerie Parlave, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Washington Field Office, said that Aaron Alexis, 34, began the shooting knowing he would be killed. A search of Alexis's electronic devices, she said, indicated that he was “prepared to die during the attack and that he accepted death as the inevitable consequence of his actions.”
Documents released Wednesday and details provided by authorities began to fill in some gaps in the timeline of the Sept. 16 rampage, which ended when police fatally shot Alexis in a third-floor cubicle.
The clues about Alexis's mental state and motivations come from inscriptions found on his Remington 870 shotgun and documents found on his electronic devices.
In one document, he wrote: “An ultra low frequency attack is what I've been subject to for the last three months, and to be perfectly honest, that is what has driven me to this.”
Investigators are still trying to understand Alexis's “pathway to violence,” Parlave told reporters. The etchings on his gun included “Not what y'all say!” and “Better off this way!”
Another scratched message, “My ELF weapon!,” and other evidence gathered from Alexis's electronics indicate that the former Navy reservist thought he was being controlled by extremely low-frequency electromagnetic waves, according to the FBI. The Navy has legitimately used such technology, the FBI said, but these radio waves also have been at the center of conspiracies about government mind control.
Alexis had been working for The Experts, a subcontractor that was updating computer systems at Navy and Marine Corps installations. He arrived in the Washington area Aug. 25 and stayed at a hotel in Bethesda for a week, according to search warrant affidavits unsealed Wednesday.
From Aug. 31 through Sept. 7, he stayed at a hotel in Pentagon City, followed by a stay at a Residence Inn in Southwest Washington, where he remained until the attack. On Sept. 9, he started working on the fourth floor of Building 197 at the Navy Yard.
Parlave said that Alexis had a performance issue at work that was addressed Sept. 13 but that there is no indication that Alexis targeted “anyone he worked for or worked with.”
Parlave did not elaborate on the issue and stressed that investigators believe that Alexis fired at random. She said there was no evidence that any single event triggered the attack.
The day after the performance issue was discussed, the FBI said, Alexis purchased a Remington 870 shotgun in Virginia and went to a home-improvement store, buying items including a hacksaw. Police said the shotgun was sawed off at the barrel and stock.
According to the documents and an FBI statement, at 7:53 a.m. on Monday, Sept. 16, Alexis parked his Hertz rental car, a blue Toyota Prius, in Parking Garage 28, across from Building 197. He walked into the building at 8:08 a.m. with a backpack slung over his left shoulder. When he got to the fourth floor, Alexis — carrying the backpack as well as a clipboard — went into a men's bathroom. He came out carrying a shotgun.
The backpack later was found hanging on the back of a stall door. It contained a roll of purple duct tape, empty boxes of ammunition, and numerous computer disks and software, according to FBI affidavits.
The documents do not detail the shootings, but a haunting 30-second video provided by the FBI shows some of Alexis's actions. Dressed in a blue striped polo shirt and dark slacks with what appears to be an ID attached to his belt, Alexis stealthily stalks the hallways and a stairwell with his shotgun in hand, ducking behind walls when someone might spot him.
Police received a call reporting an “active shooter” about 8:17 a.m., the FBI said. Officers from Naval District Washington and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service were among the first to confront the gunman, authorities said. At least three D.C. police officers, some armed with only handguns, were inside before heavily armed tactical teams assembled and entered.
The three agents with the NCIS worked in Building 197, where they were assigned to investigate procurement fraud and offer counterintelligence support. Officials said they engaged in two firefights with the gunman in two sections of the sprawling building. Eight additional agents quickly joined them.
Quoting D.C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier, Parlave told reporters that the vast building was a “tactical nightmare” for first responders because of its numerous places for Alexis to take cover and hide.
Officials said it was NCIS agents who pulled a D.C. officer who was shot in the legs to safety and carried him down three flights of stairs and outside. The officer, Scott Williams, a 23-year veteran, was still at MedStar Washington Hospital Center on Wednesday but was expected to make a full recovery. Police also said that a second D.C. officer was hit twice in the chest but that his vest saved him from injury.
The shotgun was found on the first floor of Building 197, near the identification badge that had allowed Alexis access, court papers say.
Near Alexis's body, authorities said, they found a 9mm semiautomatic pistol — which police have previously said was taken from a security guard he had killed in the first-floor lobby. The documents say the handgun was loaded, even after Alexis's gunfire exchange in the final battle with police.
Among the items found inside the backpack were USB card readers, a USB memory stick, a copy of Microsoft Office, a DVD labeled “unclassified” and a disk for computer training. The affidavit does not say what authorities may have found on the computer disks or in the material. The FBI said they had also found other computer disks.
The Toronto Maple Leafs may want Snoop Dogg to drop his logo like it's hot.
The rapper is catching heat over the logo on his Leafs by Snoop product line. His business features marijuana products such as cannabis flowers, edibles and concentrates, and it opened in Colorado, where the drug is legal.

Snoop Dogg, whose legal name is Calvin Broadus, filed a trademark application for his company with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Nov. 17. After seeing the logo Snoop used, the NHL's Maple Leafs decided there were enough similarities with their own logo to object.

On June 8, Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE) filed an opposition to Snoop Dogg's logo in order to get more time to consider whether to formally challenge the logo. Christopher Sprigman, an intellectual properties professor at the New York University School of Law, told TSN that MLSE could argue the logos will cause confusion in the marketplace.
“The Maple Leafs might say that their brand has been tarnished by confusion over Snoop's new logo,” Sprigman said. “That's quaint but a tough argument. I don't see a lot of overlap between Colorado pot smokers and Maple Leafs fans.”
The logos appear different enough, with Snoop Dogg's featuring a 7-pointed, gold leaf and Toronto's featuring a 3-pointed, blue leaf. The text is also different as Snoop Dogg's is interwoven with the leaves and Toronto's is simply placed on the leaf.
Still, MLSE may feel like it has a strong enough case to engage in trademark litigation.
Aussie cosplayers get their geek on
Updated
Fashion and nerds don't generally mix, but a growing bunch of creative, anime-obsessed Australians are breaking down that stereotype by getting their geek on through cosplay.
Cosplay - a combination of costume and role play - originated in Japan as a way for comic, video game and animation fiends to imitate their favourite characters.
It spread to Australia in 2001 and experts say the often expensive and time-consuming hobby is becoming increasingly popular.
Bryan Marriage, 27, and Melanie de Chantraine, 32, are two of the country's oldest cosplayers.
The Queenslanders have been cosplaying for nearly eight years. Between them they've created more than 40 costumes, spending between $100 and $1,000 on each.
Bryan described his foray into the scene at Brisbane's 2003 pop culture expo Supanova as nerve-racking.
"I was very nervous because I didn't know a lot of people there and I'd come from Toowoomba, so I wasn't in and around the fandom crowd at that stage," he said.
"Getting up on stage was scary but everyone was cheering and it got the adrenaline going ... through that I got in contact with a lot of other cosplayers."
He admits his obsession is left of centre.
"I was always a little bit bizarre and quirky," he said.
"At school I did drama and I had a lot of fun doing that, but when cosplay came along it was sort of a release, to do something similar to drama.
"Probably what's kept me in it is friends and the people I get to meet and also a love for different shows and different series.
"It gives me that extra dimension to show my fandom ... you get to display the feelings for a character you have and it lets you release your inner child."
Melanie, thought to be Australia's most experienced and well-known cosplayer, says she thrives on the hobby's creative challenges.
"It's a creative outlet and it gives me something to do. I can't imagine what else I'd be doing if I wasn't doing this," she said.
"It's just seeing the challenge - if I can make this 2D character exist in the real world - and sometimes I reckon they're trying to break me."
She says Japanese anime is not like anything you see in Australia.
"With Western characters the designs are a bit prudish, but the Japanese characters are just so out there," she said.
"They don't care if they look stupid and I think sometimes they look so stupid that they loop back around to awesome."
Game on
Supanova 2010 begins in Brisbane today. It will then move around the country to Melbourne, Sydney and Perth.
Supanova is a hub for both veteran and budding cosplayers, hosting competitions for them to show off their intricately designed costumes and play out their much-loved characters.
Sydney student, 22-year-old Christie Lee, won the national cosplay competition last year.
While she has only been cosplaying for a few years, the dedicated champion has already concocted more than 30 costumes.
"Making every costume is a learning experience," she said.
"It's a way of expressing how much I love a particular story or how much I love a particular character.
"A lot of people appreciate it and they are amazed by how you created your outfits ... when you get to a convention it's kind of like walking into Disneyland.
"You see your favourite characters walking around looking beautiful. It gives you a sense of satisfaction and happiness."
Her winning piece was based on Alice, the heroine from the Japanese manga (comic) and anime series, Pandora Hearts.
"I'd never made a big, humungous Victorian dress before and I never really want to make another one again," she said.
Brisbane student, 19-year-old Sabina Myers, is also excited by the costume side of cosplaying.
"A lot of people have different approaches to how they prefer to do cosplay," she said.
"I like to design my own costumes because it's more fun and I don't always pick things from Japanese anime."
One of her recent designs was an interpretation of the White Rabbit from Alice In Wonderland.
"Even I think it's weird," she said.
"My friends and I try to keep real about how strange this hobby is. It is a strange hobby and people will think it's odd, but I'm okay with that and I enjoy it."
Popular culture
Madman, an Australian distributor of anime, initiated the national competition last year.
Head judge Sylvester Ip says there are hundreds of cosplayers around Australia.
"We attend about 20 events and every event we go to there are more and more people in costumes and cosplaying in general," he said.
"We're definitely seeing an increasingly popular pop culture thing that kids are getting into. It's definitely increasing and as the years go by we expect to see more and more entrants."
Veteran cosplayers Bryan and Melanie agree the scene is growing.
"With more conventions, more competitions, people are becoming more aware of it and participating," Bryan said.
"So it is increasing probably a lot more quickly than I would have ever expected."
But Melanie says the rise in cosplaying has been accompanied by an increase in cattiness.
"The first con that I went to was in Adelaide and there may have been 10 of us," she said.
"I went back to that con two years ago and there was over 100, so it has definitely grown ... with the rise that I've seen over the last eight years it can only get bigger.
"But it is getting competitive and nasty, with a lot of people taking it far too seriously - a lot of bitchiness and people talking behind people's backs."
Melanie is an Australian representative for the World Cosplay Summit - an annual international event held in Japan - which includes 15 countries and hundreds of thousands of participants.
Christie just returned from spending a week in Japan, her prize for being last year's national champion.
After experiencing cosplay there in its most original form, she says she still prefers Australia's take on it.
"Japan is very strict with the cosplay thing, which was really irksome," she said.
"Japan cosplay is much more extreme ... I'd never seen so many cosplayers in one place in my life. They're more perfectionist than us. They put much more detail into the hair and their make-up.
"They're just so used to seeing so many cosplayers all together, I guess it just loses the spark of uniqueness over there.
"But here there is a lot more variety. No-one really looks the same and it's much more open here in saying: 'Oh my god, your outfit looks awesome. Can I take your photo?'."

“NFL policies emphasize tolerance and inclusiveness, and prohibit discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other improper standard,” NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said in a statement to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “Whether the laws and regulations of a state and local community are consistent with these policies would be one of many factors NFL owners may use to evaluate potential Super Bowl host sites.”
But there is a more pressing issue at hand: Atlanta is set to host the College Football Playoff Championship two seasons from now. In November the College Football Playoff announced Mercedes-Benz Stadium as the host site for its Jan. 8, 2018 title game, crowning the champion of the 2017 season.
The NCAA has been clear in its stance against “religious liberty” laws — urging lawmakers to defeat a same-sex marriage ban in 2014 (which was later defeated) and threatening to remove Indianapolis from the rotation of Final Four sites if its own “religious liberty” law was signed. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence signed the bill into law on March 26, 2015.
“The NCAA national office and our members are deeply committed to providing an inclusive environment for all our events,” NCAA president Mark Emmert said at the time. “We are especially concerned about how this legislation could affect our student-athletes and employees. We will work diligently to assure student-athletes competing in, and visitors attending, next week's Men's Final Four in Indianapolis are not impacted negatively by this bill. Moving forward, we intend to closely examine the implications of this bill and how it might affect future events as well as our workforce.”
The NCAA for years banned South Carolina from hosting official events due to the state's insistence on flying a Confederate flag above its statehouse. The Palmetto State's ban ended when the flag came down last summer. “The NCAA strongly supports today's removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina State House grounds,” Emmert said. “This step sends an important message of respect for and dignity of every person. As a national association, the NCAA opposes this symbol of racism, and since 2001 we have demonstrated our opposition by not playing pre-selected championships in states where the flag was flown prominently. The removal of the Confederate flag now means that South Carolina can bid to host future NCAA championships.”
The College Football Playoff is not an NCAA event, however. The CFP is an autonomous organization run by the commissioners of the ten FBS conferences.
Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby has gone on record against “religious liberty” laws as Missouri, the site of the Big 12 basketball tournament through 2020, considers its own version.
“The Big 12 Conference and its member institutions support the rights of all individuals regardless of race, religion or sexual orientation,” Bowlsby told the Kansas City Star this week. “It is acknowledged that elected officials enact laws they believe reflect the desires of their constituents, however, as a Conference we will consider the impact of the Missouri Legislature's action on current and future Big 12 events within the state.”
MAC commissioner Jon Steinbrecher announced a ban on official events in Indiana last year (its football title game is held in Detroit and men's basketball tournament in Cleveland). The Big Ten, however, announced last year it will “further review” the situation at its next executive meetings. Indianapolis is the permanent host of the Big Ten football championship and women's basketball tournament, and a regular host of its men's basketball tournament.
But where does the CFP itself stand? We don't know. A CFP spokesperson did not immediately return a message from CollegeFootballTalk seeking comment.
It's possible the entire issue could become a moot point.
Gov. Deal said earlier this month he would reject any measure that “allows discrimination in our state in order to protect people of faith,” and urged Georgia conservatives to “recognize that the world is changing around us.”
Gov. Deal has until May 3 to approve or veto the legislation.
BATON ROUGE, La. ― The Triple S Food Mart here has become a gathering place for people to demonstrate in protest of the shooting of Alton Sterling. Those peaceful protests were interrupted Friday evening when a young white man showed up at the convenience store with a loaded firearm strapped to his side.
“I think it was to provoke the crowd,” Joaquina Winslow told The Huffington Post.
Winslow was among demonstrators who were gathered in front of a makeshift memorial for Sterling when the man, who identified himself to HuffPost as 21-year-old Jake David, of Baton Rouge, strolled up with a sidearm on his hip.
“It's very peaceful down here,” said Winslow. “We're not about having people come provoke us. When I saw it, it immediately made me upset. I was upset someone had the nerve to come out here, knowing the situation. We want to keep it peaceful and guns are unnecessary.”
David Lohr Jake David said he came to the demonstration to show the community "white people are not crazy."
Some of the protesters, angered at the presence of a gun at the scene where Sterling, 37, was shot and killed by police early Tuesday, asked David to leave.
“Get out of here, crazy white boy,” said one unidentified man. Another yelled, “You're the one who's going to get shot!”
Approached by HuffPost, David said he came to the demonstration to practice his Second Amendment rights, offer protection and show the community “white people are not crazy.”
“It's hard to help when you have people complain about their rights being taken and at the same time they're trying to take yours,” David said. “I understand it, but it's not my protest, it's theirs.”
David Lohr Jake David said he came to the demonstration to show the community "white people are not crazy."
David, who was visibly shaking during the interview, said he is “nervous about what's to come.”
“I carry it everywhere,” he said. “If there's not a sign on the door, it's not a school, a church or government building, it's on my hip. It's not just for my own protection, I don't want to see anybody get hurt.”
An older African-American man, known throughout the neighborhood as “Leo,” was among the group of individuals that demanded David leave. After following David to his vehicle, Leo recounted his initial interaction with the young man.
“His words were, ‘I came in case y'all needed protection,'” Leo told The Huffington Post. “Before we ran him off, I regret not saying, ‘Where were you when Alton needed protection?'”

GALVESTON, Texas -- A Southeast Texas man and his girlfriend were indicted Thursday on charges arising from the cyberbullying of the man's ex-girlfriend until her suicide.
A Galveston County grand jury indicted Andres Arturo Villagomez, 21, and girlfriend Karinthya Sanchez Romero, 22, on charges arising from the Nov. 29 suicide of Brandy Vela, Villagomez's ex-girlfriend. The 18-year-old woman shot herself in the chest and died in front of her horrified family at their home in Texas City, about 10 miles northwest of Galveston. The Galveston couple is accused of actions that investigators say drove Vela to take her own life.
Romero is charged with stalking and online impersonation, felonies punishable by two to 10 years in prison. Court documents allege that she, on multiple occasions, made threatening and harassing phone calls to Vela. In interviews shortly after the suicide, Raul Vela said his daughter changed her cellphone number but her tormentors always found her.
Romero also is accused of setting up fake Facebook pages in Brandy Vela's name to post content that was embarrassing, intimidating and harassing to the woman.
Brandy Vela shot herself in front her family on Nov. 29, and two people have been charged with alleged cyberbullying that led to her suicide. KHOU-TV
The indictment charges Villagomez with unlawful disclosure or promotion of intimate visual material, a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail. Court documents allege that he provided photographs to be posted on the internet that portrayed Vela in sexually graphic poses -- images obtained from Vela that were meant to be private.
According to Texas City Police, Villagomez was Brandy's ex-boyfriend and Romero is his current girlfriend, CBS affiliate KHOU-TV reports.
Romero is being held on bonds totaling $20,000, while Villagomez is jailed on a $2,500 bond. Galveston County prosecutor Bill Reed said he's not aware of the two having attorneys.
One day after Brandy took her life, her father demanded justice.
“I want to see these people get locked up,” said Raul Vela. “I hope they get what they deserve because I didn't deserve this,” KHOU-TV reports.
Brandy was a Texas City High School senior who her father claims cried out for help from the bullies who were tormenting her on social media. According to Vela, the harassment began when someone began using her picture online.
“And continually posting nasty things about her,” added Vela. “Set up an account saying she was actually soliciting sex.”
Brandy Vela's final cellphone text message to her family was: “I love you so much just remember that please and I'm so sorry for everything.”
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Ms Contostavlos accused reporter Mr Mahmood of "openly lying"
Singer and TV star Tulisa Contostavlos's trial over drugs allegations has collapsed.
Judge Alistair McCreath told Southwark Crown Court he thought prosecution witness Mazher Mahmood had lied in giving evidence.
Mr Mahmood claimed Ms Contostavlos, 26, had brokered a deal through her friend Mike GLC to supply Class A drugs.
The Sun journalist Mr Mahmood has been "suspended pending an internal investigation" the newspaper said.
Ms Contostavlos, the former N-Dubz singer and X Factor judge, had denied the allegations against her.
The judge told the jury the case "cannot go any further" because there were "strong grounds to believe" that Mr Mahmood had "lied" at a hearing before the trial started.
Explaining his decision Judge McCreath said: "Where there has been some aspect of the investigation or prosecution of a crime which is tainted in some way by serious misconduct to the point that the integrity of the court would be compromised by allowing the trial to go ahead, in that sense the court would be seen to be sanctioning or colluding in that sort of behaviour, then the court has no alternative but to say 'This case must go no further'."
Image copyright PA Image caption Despite an earlier guilty plea Judge McCreath said the case against Michael Coombs would be dropped
The court heard the collapse of the trial hinged on evidence given by the newspaper reporter about a statement his driver, Alan Smith, had previously given to police.
Mr Smith said he had heard the singer talking disapprovingly about drugs but "changed his mind" following a conversation with Mr Mahmood.
Mazher Mahmood is one of Britain's most successful and controversial investigative journalists. In more than 20 years at the News of the World, and since, he has written hundreds of stories exposing drug dealers, paedophiles, immigration fraudsters and wayward celebrities. One of his greatest triumphs was his exposure in 2011 of Test cricket match fixing which led to the jailing of three Pakistani players. One of his most notorious scoops came when he recorded Sophie, Countess of Wessex, apparently using her royal connections to solicit business for her PR firm. In both cases he pretended to be an Arab sheikh. But his frequent use of subterfuge has led to criticism that he is an agent provocateur, who lures otherwise innocent people into wrongdoing. And today's not the first time a criminal case in which he has been involved has collapsed. In 2006 three men were cleared of conspiracy after he had offered to sell them a fictional radioactive chemical called red mercury to make a terrorist dirty bomb. One defence barrister in that case called Mazher Mahmood charismatic and highly intelligent, but was sharply critical of his methods.
In his written statement, Judge McCreath, said: "When he [Mr Mahmood] gave evidence last week, he was asked questions on the same topic and gave answers entirely inconsistent with his earlier evidence."
The judge said he therefore had "strong grounds" to believe Mr Mahmood had lied in evidence to conceal the fact he had manipulated evidence by getting his driver to change his account.
Judge McCreath said: "Had I made the decision then that I have made now neither defendant would have been called on to answer the indictment, nor even enter a plea to it."
As a result, the case could not properly proceed against Ms Contostavlos and therefore could not proceed against Mr Coombs either.
During the trial the court heard that undercover reporter Mr Mahmood, known as the "fake sheikh", had posed as a film producer when he met Ms Contostavlos at several luxury hotels and restaurants.
He claimed the singer had vowed to procure cocaine for him when he offered her a lead role in a film.
Giving evidence from behind a screen, Mr Mahmood said he used "subterfuge" when he secretly recorded meetings to establish whether she was involved in drugs.
'Never dealt drugs'
Under cross-examination he denied the reason was to create a "sensational story" but said it was "in the public interest to expose criminality".
Ms Contostavlos, from Friern Barnet, north London, vehemently denied brokering the deal, which was reported in The Sun on Sunday in June 2013.
Following the dismissal of the case, she urged police to investigate the reporter.
Outside court she said: "I have never dealt drugs and never been involved in taking or dealing cocaine.

"Mahmood has now been exposed by my lawyers openly lying to the judge and jury. These lies were told to stop crucial evidence going before the jury."
She also claimed she was "tricked" into believing she was auditioning for a movie and was encouraged to "act the part of a bad, rough, ghetto girl".
She said: "They recorded this and produced it as evidence when I thought it was an audition. It was a terrible thing to do.
"Thankfully, the lies have been uncovered and justice has been done."
The singer's co-defendant, Mike GLC, whose real name is Michael Coombs, 36, previously pleaded guilty to supplying cocaine.
Mr Coombs also walked free after he was informed the case against him could not proceed.
Following the announcement, Ms Contostavlos's former boyfriend and N-Dubz band mate Fazer, real name Richard Rawson, tweeted: "Thank god for this!! @officialtulisa #Relieved."
End justified the means
Mazher Mahmood has spent more than 25 years as an undercover reporter and has done exposes on celebrities, royals, as well as criminals while working with the Sunday Times, the News of the World (NOTW) and The Sun.
He has been dubbed as the "fake sheikh" after a disguise which he donned for some of his stories.
During the Leveson Inquiry into media ethics and standards, the journalist, who then worked for the NOTW, said he had written about 500 stories for the newspaper and his work had led to more than 260 "successful criminal prosecutions".
In an interview to the BBC he said his undercover work was always in the public interest and the end justified the means.
(CNN) -- As coalition and Afghan forces entered the second week of a major offensive against the Taliban in southern Afghanistan, the head of U.S. Central Command warned that the potential loss of lives among U.S. forces in the operation "will be tough."
Gen. David Petraeus said the losses could be comparable to those seen after the 2007 surge of U.S. troops into Iraq.
"They'll be tough. They were tough in Iraq," Petraeus said on NBC's "Meet the Press."
From the time the U.S. surge in Iraq began in January 2007 until its official end in July 2008, 1,125 U.S. troops died -- more than a quarter of the total 4,379 Americans who have died in the Iraq war.
"The reality is that it's hard, but we are [in Afghanistan] for a very, very important reason, we can't forget that," he added. "We're in Afghanistan to ensure that it cannot once again be a sanctuary for the kinds of attacks that were carried out on 9/11."
Despite stiff Taliban resistance to Operation Moshtarak in Helmand province, Petraeus said that the militants are "a bit disjointed at this point in time."
"When we go on the offensive, when we take away sanctuaries and safe havens from the Taliban and other extremist elements that we and our Afghan and coalition partners are fighting in that country, they're going to fight back," he added. "And we're seeing that in Marjah, we will see that in other areas, but we are going after them across the spectrum."
Petraeus noted that the offensive is just the "initial salvo" of what will be a 12- to 18-month military campaign, but results are being seen already.
"We have more of our special operations forces going in on the ground, and you've seen the results, you've heard some of the initial results of that with more ... Taliban shadow governors being captured, more of the high-value targets being taken down."

The Central Command chief also addressed his group's assessment of al Qaeda, following a dust-up a week ago between former Vice President Dick Cheney and current Vice President Joe Biden.
Biden had argued that another massive terror attack against the United States, like the one on September 11, 2001, was "unlikely."
But Cheney called that analysis "dead wrong," and said the biggest threat facing the United States now is a potentially huge terror attack with nuclear weapons or biological agents.
Petraeus said the assessment of the U.S. Central Command is that al Qaeda has been "diminished" in the past year.
"But ... al Qaeda is a flexible, adaptable -- it may be barbaric, it may believe in extremist ideology as it does -- but this is a thinking, adaptive enemy and we must maintain pressure on it everywhere."
Mrs Andreasen was blocked by Christian Democrat and Socialist MEPs from becoming vice-chairman of the European Parliament's budgetary committee on Monday.
The centre-Right European People's Party and the Socialists broke parliamentary convention on the allocation of committee posts by demanding a vote by secret ballot to block Mrs Andreasen, who was elected as a Ukip MEP for South East England last month.
"They know that I know too much. I know where the bodies are buried and that's why they don't want me," said Mrs Andreasen.
Chris Davies, a Liberal Democrat, attacked the "shameful decision" to hold a secret ballot so the MEPs could not be "held accountable for their actions".
"The message it sends to the public is that anyone who speaks out against malpractice in Europe risks being excluded from office," he said.
Mrs Andreasen, the European Commission's former chief accountant, was fired in 2004 after she publicly claimed there was a £172 million discrepancy between two sets of Brussels accounts.
Lord Kinnock, who was then her boss as the Commission's vice-president, furiously accused her of "disloyalty and breach of trust" after she went to MEPs with her concerns, already raised internally, over accounting standards.
"Marta is still the martyr," joked one parliament official after Monday's vote.
The parliament's budgetary control committee plays a powerful role in scrutinising and signing off the European Union's annual budget, worth £199 billion this year.
Inge Graessle, a senior German Christian Democrat MEP, admitted that the former Commission accountant had been opposed for the senior post because of her trouble-making past.
"The role she played in the past, what I feel was a certain scandalising of issues, is not really one we want endorsed by her becoming vice-chairman," she said.
The 54-year-old Ukip MEP, who keeps her place as an ordinary member of the committee, remained defiant.
"This is a message about how much they fear me. But I still know what I know and they will not stop me," Mrs Andreasen said.
Jeffery Simmons, a five-star football recruit who in February signed with Mississippi State, apologized after a video surfaced Saturday reportedly showing him assaulting a woman.
The 1-minute, 48-second clip, obtained by Columbus, Miss., TV station WCBI, shows a man and a woman repeatedly striking another woman laying on the ground. Simmons took responsibility for the incident — which he said occurred Thursday — on his Facebook page later Saturday.

"Where do I start? Where do I begin? Wow!," Simmons wrote in a since-deleted post. "Decisions, choices, and actions should always be carefully thought through when incidents occur. I take full responsibility for my actions that occurred on Thursday evening. My apology goes out to the Taylor Family and especially to Sophia Taylor.
"What was I thinking? Honestly, I wasn't thinking, all I could think was this is my family and I am supposed to defend my family. Many know my deceased nephews were my pride and joy, I do everything I do in honor of the life they never got the chance to live, and to listen to someone speak to terrible about them really caused me to make choices, decisions and act in a manor (sic) that was out of character for me. Is that an excuse?... NO!
"I truly hope that you will find it in your hearts to forgive me for my actions. I want to apologize to those that have supported me, those who look up to me and those who I consider family. I hope that each of you will accept my apology. I was raised in church, I've asked for forgiveness and I pray for God's continued guidance as I move forward in becoming a better person."
WCBI reported that the Macon Police Department is aware of the incident.

Simmons, 18, is listed as a 6-3, 277-pound defensive end from Noxubee County High School in Macon, Miss.
The Cleveland Browns can breathe a sigh of relief after quite the injury scare.
Browns offensive tackle Ryan Miller was carted off the practice field Saturday and taken to a local hospital with what the team later said was a concussion. Miller was "resting comfortably," the Browns said, then was released from the hospital Saturday night.

Browns officials initially asked the media not to identify the name of the injured player until his family had been notified. The team later told NFL Media that Miller was taken to the Cleveland Clinic, which has a unit specifically dedicated to treating concussions.
"He was awake, alert and responsive and had movement in all four extremities," the Browns said in a statement.
"He's doing well," Browns coach Rob Chudzinski added after practice, via The Associated Press. "He's responsive, and it sounds like things are better at this point."
Miller, a second-year pro, lay on the field for roughly five minutes as trainers attended to him, Mary Kay Cabot of The Plain Dealer reported. Practice came to a halt as teammates gathered around Miller, who was immobilized and strapped to a backboard, according to The AP, then taken off the field by ambulance.
Pro Bowl left tackle Joe Thomas said Miller got hurt when "two helmets kind of hit in the wrong way, kind of freak thing" during a blocking drill.
"It's always tough to see your fellow linemen or one of your teammates go down like that," Thomas told The AP. "It's hard because obviously there are things more important than football, and your health is certainly one of them. Sometimes it's hard to get back and focused on football when you see a guy laying there and not moving."
According to The AP, the Browns continued their indoor practice after Miller was injured.
Miller was a fifth-round draft pick by the Browns in 2012 and primarily has practiced as a reserve right tackle. He has appeared in eight NFL games.

NSW Magistrate David Degnan under fire over controversial talkback radio comments
Updated
Questions are being asked about the behaviour of a NSW magistrate who expressed controversial views about crime and sentencing in a call to talkback radio.
Key points: The talk back call included controversial comments about Aboriginal sentencing
Legal expert says Mr Degnan may face claims of bias as a result of his views
Mr Degnan declined to speak to the ABC
The magistrate — who the ABC has confirmed is sitting magistrate David Degnan — failed to identify himself as a judicial officer when he made the call, which included strident comments about Aboriginal crime.
Now a former NSW District Court judge is warning the magistrate is likely to face claims of bias from defendants who appear before him in court.
Mr Degnan made the call to Sydney broadcaster Robbie Buck's Breakfast program on 702 ABC Sydney in February this year and identified himself as "Dave", who "works in the criminal justice system".
The call followed a segment which discussed crime and sentencing, including the Indigenous-specific Circle Sentencing.
"By the time people are sent to jail they are nearly always recidivists," Mr Degnan said in the talkback call on February 17.
"Jail is always a last resort, so this idea that jails don't work, I'm sorry, they do because they lock people up that don't get the message."
During the call, Mr Degnan became animated when he moved the discussion to Aboriginal crime.
"This thing about Aboriginal people in custody, they're committing the offences," he said.
"That's why they're in custody. No-one's trying to target the Aborigines. Each offender comes to the court and they're dealt with individually."
When questioned about whether rehabilitation programs could be more effective than prison, Mr Degnan said programs existed in every local court in NSW — a claim disputed by other judges who say such services are often not available in remote jurisdictions.
"Some people just keep offending," Mr Degnan said.
"Most of the people that do offend, they've been given bonds, they've been sent to different programs, they've had supervision, but they don't seem to get the message. And then eventually, yes, they'll end up in jail."
Magistrate denied he made call
Some lawyers and magistrates across NSW recognised the caller at the time of the call, and fellow magistrates questioned Mr Degnan directly.
Mr Degnan is understood to have initially denied to at least two magistrates he was the caller.
The ABC questioned Mr Degnan and chief magistrate Graeme Henson about the call at the time, and both magistrates said they had no comment.
Do you know more about this story? Email investigations@abc.net.au.
But recently at a Sydney dinner, Mr Degnan admitted in front of fellow lawyers and magistrates to making the call. He said at the dinner the controversy had "all blown over".
Mr Degnan is regarded as a tough sentencer by some lawyers.
Comments could have ramifications for future cases
Retired District Court judge John Nicholson SC said Mr Degnan may now face bias applications from defendants.
"I'd be surprised if there hasn't already been applications made to him to recuse himself on the basis of views he's expressed," Mr Nicholson said.
"There may be some Aboriginal people who would be uncomfortable coming before a judicial officer who had expressed opinions in respect of Aborigines are therefore committing offences.
"He will have lost the opportunity to make an impact on the community in terms of balanced judicial decision making. I'm not suggesting he's not doing that, but the problem is the people coming to his court may fear he won't do that in their case."
Monash University Law Professor Matthew Groves, one of the nation's leading experts on judicial fairness and bias, said the Guide to Judicial Conduct strongly cautions against judges speaking to the media.
"Talkback radio and the like as especially dangerous for judges," Professor Groves said.
"It is not that these things are not good for debate. The problem is that they are not the natural terrain of judges."
Both Mr Degnan and chief magistrate Graeme Henson offered no comment on the issue today when approached by the ABC.

Jorge Dan Lopez / Reuters A police officer watches one of the alleged leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel in Guatemala, Wilmar Anavisca (C), also known as "El Chino", after his arrest in the Supreme Court of Justice in Guatemala City, October 18, 2013.
The U.S. government allowed the Mexican Sinaloa drug cartel to carry out its business unimpeded between 2000 and 2012 in exchange for information on rival cartels, an investigation by El Universal claims.
Citing court documents, the Mexican newspaper reports that DEA officers met with top Sinaloa officials over fifty times and offered to have charges against cartel members dropped in the U.S., among other pledges.
Dr. Edgardo Buscaglia, a senior research scholar in law and economics at Columbia University, says that the tactic has been previously used in Colombia, Cambodia, Thailand and Afghanistan.
“Of course, this modus operandi involves a violation of public international law, besides adding more fuel to the violence, violations of due process and of human rights,” he told El Universal.
Myles Frechette, a former U.S. ambassador to Colombia, said while that the problem of drug trafficking in Colombia persists, the tactic of secret agreements had managed to reduce it.
The period when the relationship between the DEA and Sinaloa was supposed to have been the closest, between 2006 and 2012, saw a major surge of violence in Mexico, and was the time when the Sinaloa cartel rose significantly in prominence.

Jairus Keelon Byrd (born October 7, 1986) is an American football free safety who is currently a free agent. He played college football for the University of Oregon. He was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in the second round of the 2009 NFL Draft. He is a three-time Pro Bowl selection.
Early years [ edit ]
Byrd attended Clayton High School in St. Louis County, Missouri. He played quarterback, wide receiver, safety and special teams. As a senior, he was the Missouri 4A offensive player of the year and played a large role in leading the school to the 2004 state championship. As a senior, he rushed for 1,480 yards with 26 touchdowns, passed for 1,038 yards with 13 touchdowns, and made six receptions for 125 yards on offense. On defense, he had 71 tackles, seven interceptions, three quarterback sacks and two fumble recoveries. He also had 10 kickoff returns, 15 punt returns, and 18 punts. He also lettered in basketball and track.
College career [ edit ]
Byrd enrolled in the University of Oregon, where he played for the Oregon Ducks football team. As a freshman in 2005, Byrd was red-shirted. In 2006 Byrd was a freshman All-American second-team selection by The Sporting News and was the Pac-10 co-freshman player of the year (alongside Taylor Mays and Alterraun Verner). He started the last 11 games at cornerback, recording 56 tackles and five interceptions.
As a sophomore in 2007 Byrd was an All-Pac-10 conference honorable mention. He started all 13 games for the Ducks, recording 64 tackles, a sack, and a conference leading seven interceptions. As a junior in 2008 he was an all-Pac 10 first-team selection and was the defensive MVP of the 2008 Holiday Bowl. He started 13 games and finished with 83 tackles and five interceptions.
Byrd finished his college career starting 37 of 39 games, with 203 tackles, 17 interceptions, a sack, two forced fumbles and four fumble recoveries.
After the season Byrd announced that he would forgo his senior season and enter the 2009 NFL Draft.[1]
Professional career [ edit ]
Buffalo Bills [ edit ]
The Buffalo Bills selected Byrd in the second round (42nd overall) of the 2009 NFL Draft. Byrd was the third safety drafted in 2009, behind Patrick Chung and Louis Delmas.
On July 29, 2009, the Buffalo Bills signed Byrd to a four-year, $4.15 million contract that includes $2.47 million guaranteed.[2][3]
After spending the first couple of games as a backup, Byrd started his first career game at free safety against the Miami Dolphins due to injuries to both the Bills starting safeties Donte Whitner and Bryan Scott.[4] He finished the game with three tackles. In his second start the next week Byrd recorded his first career interception off of Derek Anderson of the Cleveland Browns. Starting for the third straight week, Byrd recorded two more interceptions off Mark Sanchez of the New York Jets bringing his total to three.[5] The next week against the Carolina Panthers, Byrd had his second straight game of two interceptions, both of them coming off Jake Delhomme, bringing his total to five.[6] For his play, he was named the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Month for October.[7]
Byrd playing for the Bills in 2009
In Week 8 against the Houston Texans, Byrd recorded two interceptions for the third consecutive week, bringing his total to seven. This tied an NFL record held by Dave Baker for consecutive games with two or more interceptions with three.[8] After the Bills bye week Byrd intercepted his eighth pass of the season off of Vince Young of the Tennessee Titans. This was his fifth straight game with an interception, setting the team record for consecutive games with an interception.[9] He intercepted his ninth pass of the season off of Matt Cassel of the Kansas City Chiefs.
On December 23, 2009, Byrd was placed on season ending injured reserve.[10] He finished the season starting 11 of 14 games, recording 45 tackles and nine interceptions. The nine interceptions were tied for the league lead and was five more than any other rookie had.[11][12] For his play, he was selected to play in the Pro Bowl, becoming the first Bills rookie to be selected to play in a Pro Bowl since Greg Bell in 1984.[13] However, he was unable to play and was replaced by Brandon Meriweather. He was also a member of the Sporting News all-rookie team.[14]
On March 1, 2013, the Bills placed their franchise tag on Byrd after he was originally designated to become a free agent after the 2012 season.[15] On August 20, 2013, Byrd signed his $6.9 million franchise tender.[16] Despite signing the tender, reports were released that he wanted the Bills to trade him.[17]
New Orleans Saints [ edit ]
On March 11, 2014, Byrd agreed to a six-year, $56 million contract including $28 million guaranteed with the New Orleans Saints.[18] Byrd played in the Saints' first 4 games of the 2014 season, but then suffered a torn lateral meniscus knee ligament during practice on October 2, 2014; the following day, the team announced Byrd would be placed on season-ending injured reserve.[19]
On March 10, 2017, Byrd was released by the Saints.[20]
Carolina Panthers [ edit ]
On October 3, 2017, Byrd was signed by the Carolina Panthers.[21]

Your characters are unrealistic stereotpyes of political correctness. Is it really necessary for the sake of popular sensibilities to have in a fantasy what we have in the real world? I read fantasy to get away from politically correct cliches.
God, yes! If there's one thing fantasy is just crawling with these days it's widowed black middle-aged pirate moms.
Real sea pirates could not be controlled by women, they were vicous rapits and murderers and I am sorry to say it was a man's world. It is unrealistic wish fulfilment for you and your readers to have so many female pirates, especially if you want to be politically correct about it!
First, I will pretend that your last sentence makes sense because it will save us all time. Second, now you're pissing me off.
You know what? Yeah, Zamira Drakasha, middle-aged pirate mother of two, is a wish-fulfillment fantasy. I realized this as she was evolving on the page, and you know what? I fucking embrace it.
Why shouldn't middle-aged mothers get a wish-fulfillment character, you sad little bigot? Everyone else does. H.L. Mencken once wrote that “Every normal man must be tempted at times to spit on his hands, hoist the black flag, and begin slitting throats.” I can't think of anyone to whom that applies more than my own mom, and the mothers on my friends list, with the incredible demands on time and spirit they face in their efforts to raise their kids, preserve their families, and save their own identity/sanity into the bargain.
Shit yes, Zamira Drakasha, leaping across the gap between burning ships with twin sabers in hand to kick in some fucking heads and sail off into the sunset with her toddlers in her arms and a hold full of plundered goods, is a wish-fulfillment fantasy from hell. I offer her up on a silver platter with a fucking bow on top; I hope she amuses and delights. In my fictional world, opportunities for butt-kicking do not cease merely because one isn't a beautiful teenager or a muscle-wrapped font of testosterone. In my fictional universe, the main characters are a fat ugly guy and a skinny forgettable guy, with a supporting cast that includes “SBF, 41, nonsmoker, 2 children, buccaneer of no fixed abode, seeks unescorted merchant for light boarding, heavy plunder.”
You don't like it? Don't buy my books. Get your own fictional universe. Your cabbage-water vision of worldbuilding bores me to tears.
As for the “man's world” thing, religious sentiments and gender prejudices flow differently in this fictional world. Women are regarded as luckier, better sailors than men. It's regarded as folly for a ship to put to sea without at least one female officer; there are several all-female naval military traditions dating back centuries, and Drakasha comes from one of them. As for claims to “realism,” your complaint is of a kind with those from bigoted hand-wringers who whine that women can't possibly fly combat aircraft, command naval vessels, serve in infantry actions, work as firefighters, police officers, etc. despite the fact that they do all of those things– and are, for a certainty, doing them all somewhere at this very minute. Tell me that a fit fortyish woman with 25+ years of experience at sea and several decades of live bladefighting practice under her belt isn't a threat when she runs across the deck toward you, and I'll tell you something in return– you're gonna die of stab wounds.
What you're really complaining about isn't the fact that my fiction violates some objective “reality,” but rather that it impinges upon your sad, dull little conception of how the world works. I'm not beholden to the confirmation of your prejudices; to be perfectly frank, the prospect of confining the female characters in my story to placid, helpless secondary places in the narrative is so goddamn boring that I would rather not write at all. I'm not writing history, I'm writing speculative fiction. Nobody's going to force you to buy it. Conversely, you're cracked if you think you can persuade me not to write about what amuses and excites me in deference to your vision, because your vision fucking sucks.
I do not expect to change your mind but i hope that you will at least consider that I and others will not be buying your work because of these issues. I have been reading science fiction and fantasy for years and i know that I speak for a great many people. I hope you might stop to think about the sales you will lose because you want to bring your political corectness and foul language into fantasy. if we wanted those things we could go to the movies. Think about this!
Thank you for your sentiments. I offer you in exchange this engraved invitation to go piss up a hill, suitable for framing.

In a decade, Seattle's minimum wageworkers would be making double what they are today, under a plan announced this morning by Mayor Ed Murray.
Murray's plan calls for the city's minimum wage to climb to $15 an hour, phased in over three to seven years depending on the size of business and whether workers receive tips or benefits in addition to salary. After that, the wage would be tied to the Consumer Price Index, with estimates showing it rising above $18 an hour by 2025. Current minimum wage is $9.32 per hour.
The deal was finalized Wednesday night, after Murray returned from a study mission with the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce to New York City.
“Once again Seattle has chosen to collaborate and Seattle workers are going to get a raise,” Murray said at a morning news conference.
Murray said 21 of the 24 members on the committee he assembled to create the proposal have agreed, indicating broad support. He thanked his committee members for taking risks and showing courage. “I believe they are going to move this city forward,” he said.
The agreement defines small business as 500 employees or fewer. Large businesses with more than 500 workers will have to pay workers $15 by 2017 if they don't also receive health care. In that case, they get an extra year.
Fewer than 1 percent of businesses in the city have more than 500 workers, but those businesses employ about 30,000 workers, or about a third of those now making less than $15 an hour, according to a study for the city by the Evans School at the University of Washington.
Small businesses will have until 2019 to reach $15 an hour if they do not offer health care or tips. All other small businesses will have to pay $15 an hour by 2021. There are no exemptions for certain industries, organizations or class of employees.
The long phase-in for some businesses and the definition of small business has already been denounced by 15 Now activists who promote their initiative effort as a “real $15.” Activists on Saturday voted to go forward with signature-gathering to place a measure on the November ballot.
The plan announced by Murray this morning falls short of the wishes of “15 Now,” an organization urging adoption of a $15-per-hour minimum wage. The organization held its first national conference Saturday at Franklin High School. With more than 250 people in attendance, it voted to begin a signature-gathering campaign that could result in a ballot measure to amend the Seattle City Charter.
The charter amendment backed by “15 Now” would have no phase-in for big businesses, requiring them to start paying $15 an hour on Jan. 1, 2015.
Murray, though, said he expected the deal would avoid competing minimum-wage initiatives on the November ballot. He said he doesn't expect business group OneSeattle to move forward with an initiative.
David Rolf, co-chair of the mayor's committee and president of SEIU 775, said the deal involved a lot of compromise on both sides, and he thanked the business leaders for their creativity in helping make it happen. He said the fast-food workers who went on strike last year were the real leaders who got the minimum-wage conversation started.
The agreement will now move to the City Council, which will be tasked with creating an ordinance.
“Now we have to act,” said Councilmember Nick Licata, also a member of the mayor's committee. “I will work with my colleagues to pass this proposal with the minimum amount of tinkering possible. The council and all of us, I believe, have to embrace this spirit of cooperation. We cannot tear it apart.”
Members of Murray's Income Inequality Advisory Committee are:
David Rolf (co-chair), SEIU 775
Howard Wright (co-chair), Seattle Hospitality Group
Seattle City Councilmember Nick Licata
Seattle City Councilmember Bruce Harrell
Seattle City Councilmember Kshama Sawant
Janet Ali, Nucor Steel
Sarah Cherin, UFCW 21
Maud Daudon, Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce
Craig Dawson, Retail Lockbox
Bob Donegan, Ivar's Restaurant
David Freiboth, Dr. Martin Luther King County Labor Council
Joe Fugere, Tutta Bella
Audrey Haberman, Philanthropy Northwest
Nick Hanauer, Second Avenue Partners
Pramila Jayapal, Center for Community Change
Eric Liu, Citizen University
Gordon McHenry, Solid Ground
Dave Meinert, Onto Entertainment
Craig Schafer, Hotel Andra
Diane Sosne, SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
Nicole Vallestero Keenan, Puget Sound Sage
David Watkins, Seattle Hotel Association
Michael Wells, Capitol Hill Chamber of Commerce
Ronald Wilkowski, Financial Services
Daudon, Dawson and Sawant were the three members who did not sign on with the agreement, Murray said.
What kinds of software—if any—deserve a patent?
It's a basic question, and one that many thought would be resolved by now, especially since the issue came up in the US Supreme Court's 2010 Bilski decision. But Bilski left the legal landscape more confusing and fractured. This was illustrated in dramatic fashion last year, when the nation's top patent court, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, practically split apart at the seams trying to decide if four patents on financial software held up. The Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank case resulted in ten judges writing seven different opinions and resolving nothing.
Main Street controversy. Dramatic examples like Wi-Fi trolls suing coffee shops and "scanner trolls" threatening thousands of businesses for the use of everyday technology have spurred debate in Congress. Several proposals were combined to become the anti-patent-troll Innovation Act , which passed the House on a rare bipartisan vote and is scheduled to be debated shortly in the Senate.
Seven months later, the Supreme Court agreed to take up the controversial case , setting off the most intense round of legal positioning over patents and software yet seen. In the four years since Bilski, the spread of "patent trolls"—that is, companies that do nothing but sue over patents—has gone from a tech-sector talking point to a white-hot,
Whatever happens in Congress, the Supreme Court's decision in this case—or indecision—matters. The court is aware of patent trolls, and it seems to genuinely dislike them. The justices also seem aware that Bilski did not do the job, and they want to devise some legal means of executing patents they don't like. The question then becomes "how?"
"How" matters a lot here. Practically no observers expect Alice Corp. to keep its four patents, but the question of how many other patents get lassoed into today's decision will resonate for years to come. Some would like to see the Supreme Court end Alice's patents with sniper-like precision, touching no other patent; others are eager for a pronouncement that would deal some broader harm to the patent troll business model.
In theory, the Court could go so far as to simply say software is not patentable. That's a very unlikely outcome, but it can't be ruled out entirely. The tiny possibility of such an outcome has spurred companies that favor software patents—including Microsoft, Adobe, and IBM—to file briefs focused on their importance. (While these companies extoll software patents as a general category, no one defends Alice's patents.)
Internet companies, meanwhile, are trying to steer the court's attention to the harm caused by vague software patents. A pointed, 12-page brief filed by LinkedIn, Twitter, Yelp, Newegg, Netflix, Rackspace, and several smaller software companies does not go so far as to call for the abolition of patents on software, but it makes the signors' distaste for them crystal clear. "Innovation happens despite software patents, not because of them," states that brief, written by Stanford professor and patent litigator Mark Lemley.
Seven lines of code, $5 trillion of trades
While many of the lawyers briefing the case, including CLS Bank's attorneys, are too polite to say it, Alice Corporation fits the classic model of a "patent troll." Despite a website with language about wanting to launch "an innovative form of derivatives market," the company appears to have never created any product. By its own admission, it has been focused on its lawsuit since 2007. The inventor of the patents and founder of Alice is Ian Shepherd, previously managing partner at the Melbourne branch of McKinsey & Company, a financial consultancy. National Australia Bank, one of Shepherd's former clients and the fourth largest bank in Australia, became a 50 percent owner of Alice in 2000.
Alice stands out from most patent trolls in that its litigation strategy is focused on a single company. Sometimes one is enough, though, and CLS is no ordinary defendant. The Economist called CLS Bank "the most important bit of the financial infrastructure you have never heard of." CLS is a membership organization, composed of a who's who list of more than 60 of the world's biggest banks, including the three largest US banks, Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, and Citigroup. Each day, CLS settles accounts worth $5 trillion in various currencies. A major patent win against CLS could have raised the cost of international money-exchange worldwide.
Alice's brief spends seven pages describing Shepherd's inventions, dividing them between "system" claims, "method" claims, and "media" claims. It describes a complicated system of "shadow accounts," updated on a "real-time basis," which mitigates risk in "exchange institutions."
But other than Alice's lawyers and several Federal Circuit judges, nobody who has delved deep into the patents has been too impressed. Underneath bloated language, critics say, Alice's patents describe how anyone performing an exchange of goods with an unknown party would proceed: find a trusted third party.
"That's what people have looked for when they've needed to exchange things since the beginning of time," says Charles Duan, an attorney at Public Knowledge who has analyzed Alice's patent claims. "If you and I want to exchange some money—dollars for euros—there's some risk that you will give the money and then I don't give you the money."
The world's banking regulators were well aware of that risk, and CLS Bank was custom-designed to address it. The systems used by CLS, which stands for "continuous linked settlement," are undoubtedly complex, but the bank itself is a classic example of an idea whose time had come—it was "decades in the making," as CLS' lawyers explain in their brief. In a 2002 article, The Economist explained that banking regulators had a name for the risk that one party in a foreign-currency trade wouldn't pay up: Herstatt risk, named after a German bank that closed halfway through a trading day in 1974.
The Alice patents are covered in complicated-sounding language about computers, but critics like Duan see the complex language as little more than smoke and mirrors. The bloated nature of the patents is cleverly addressed in the amicus brief filed by Public Knowledge and the Application Developers Alliance, written by Duan, which distills the "very simple, basic idea" that Alice hid "beneath a veneer of technical language." Duan took the most broadly accepted claim in Alice's batch of patents, claim 26 of US Patent No. 7,725,375, and wrote a computer program that satisfies all the instructions of the 200-word claim. It is seven lines long:
10 LET account1 = 200.00 20 LET account3 = 300.00 30 INPUT "Value to exchange for transaction"; exchange 40 IF account1 < exchange THEN PRINT "Inadequate value" : STOP 50 account1 = account1 - exchange 60 account3 = account3 + exchange 70 PRINT "Instruction to 1st institution: adjust 2nd account by "; - exchange
It doesn't require any programming experience to interpret what's going on in the above code. Check everyone's account to make sure there's enough money; if there is, do the trade. "This is basically a bank transfer," said Duan. But it's also the claim that split the patent appeals court down the middle.
Alice describes the claim this way:
The computer in claim 26 is configured to receive transactions from the parties to an exchange, to make adjustments electronically to the shadow accounts independently maintained by the computer after ensuring that those accounts reflect “adequate value,” and to generate instructions to the exchange institutions to implement the exchange in the separate real-world accounts maintained by those institutions.
The company goes on to note that the specification "contains flowcharts that provide algorithm support for the specific programming required." That seems to have been effective. In the Public Knowledge brief, Duan posits an explanation of how four Federal Circuit judges came to embrace the claim:
Certain judges below were misled by the language of the claims and the patent. Judge Rader believed that Claim 26 involved “a complex problem” that could only be solved with a specialized system with “at least four separate structural components.” He reviewed the “at least thirty two figures which provide detailed algorithms” to conclude that “[l]abeling this system claim as an ‘abstract concept' wrenches all meaning from those words.” Judge Moore likewise found a similarly worded claim “limited to one that is configured to perform certain functions in a particular fashion” and, based on one of the flowcharts, suggested that the claims demanded a dizzyingly long and complex algorithm. And Judge Linn concluded that, while they may be based on an abstract idea, “the claims here are directed to very specific ways of doing that.” The common thread among all of these opinions is an assumption that, given the heavy use of technical language in the specification and claims, only a specific, complex, technical computer program could infringe the patents. As the seven-line computer program on the previous page demonstrates, this assumption was in error.
The brief goes on to suggest that the Supreme Court bar courts from repeating some of the Federal Circuit's mistakes. Judges shouldn't get lost in "obfuscatory language" from patent specifications and should instead decide based on claim language alone if a patent should be allowed, the brief says. As for the idea that Alice's "system claims" survived whereas its "method" claims could not, such differences are a "drafting formality," particularly for software, and shouldn't be relied on to decide patentability.
How to kill a patent made easy: The importance of Section 101
Four years after Bilski, the Supreme Court again seems poised to limit patentable subject matter, and it has again chosen to hear a case regarding financial patents. Dozens of companies have filed their input on the issue in the form of amicus briefs. There are two key themes: the harm caused by "patent trolls," and perhaps more importantly, what legal tool is most appropriate for eliminating bad patents.
Several briefs delve into the importance of Section 101 of patent law, which bars "abstract ideas" and "laws of nature" from being granted patents. It's not the only way to kill a bad patent; Section 102 dictates that patents must be new (novel), Section 103 states they must be non-obvious, and Section 112 requires that they be claimed in a specific way. But amicus briefs from companies that find themselves constantly facing patent troll lawsuits—including Internet companies large and small, retailers, restaurants, and supermarkets—want a Section 101 test for patents that requires them to be tough and come early.
Having a tough Section 101 test up front would undoubtedly be a boon to patent defendants. A retailers' brief notes that treating the basic patentability question of Section 101 first "is not a distinction without a difference." From the brief:
[A]nticipation, obviousness, and the other invalidity defenses found in Sections 102, 103, and 112 generally require extensive, expensive discovery, prior art, searching invalidity analysis, claim construction, expert reports and depositions, and the other accoutrements of patent litigation before the district court can address them, either on summary judgment or at trial. In contrast, patentability under Section 101 can—and should—be addressed as a legal issue at the outset of the lawsuit on a motion to dismiss.
High-stakes patent cases, considered those with more than $25 million at issue, typically cost $3 million through discovery and $5 million through trial. Compare those costs to recent cases where defendants have won on Section 101 grounds, such as FindTheBest's win against Lumen View Technology, a patent troll wielding a patent on "multilateral decision-making." That patent was found to be abstract, and FindTheBest didn't have to go through discovery or hire expensive experts. (FindTheBest still paid about $200,000 in legal fees.)
Conversely, a well-known case last year in which a defendant failed to win on Section 101 grounds meant that a patent holder was able to push forward with a lawsuit over watching ads online. (The Electronic Frontier Foundation, dismayed by that outcome, wanted the Supreme Court to take up that case rather than Alice v. CLS.)
A brief filed by larger Internet companies, including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, and Rackspace, also pushes Section 101 vigorously and quickly. Making Section 101 analysis wait for formal claim construction is a "novel procedural barrier," inappropriately championed by the Federal Circuit, the companies argue.
Other parties want to see Section 101 used less, not more. The American Intellectual Property Law Association, an IP lawyers' group, bemoans the "current undefined rubric of Section 101" being "repeatedly invoked to deny patent claims." And IBM, the nation's largest patent-holder, argues that many of the court's concerns would be better addressed under Section 103, which bars non-obvious patents.
Several briefs also emphasize that abstract patent language that simply adds a general-purpose computer to a claim—no matter how detailed—is still abstract. The Microsoft-Adobe-HP brief goes so far as to suggest that the Alice patents are scarcely computer technology at all. The technology at issue is simply "Bilski on a computer," those companies suggest.
Oral arguments today may signal which of these arguments are gaining traction with the Supreme Court justices. The court is clearly dismayed that such patents, many wielded by patent trolls, are proliferating. The question remaining is how aggressive they will be in treating the problem. A decision in the case is expected by June.
CLAYMONT, Del. (AP)  A woman is charged with plotting the real-life abduction of a boyfriend she met through the virtual reality website "Second Life."
Thirty-three-year-old Kimberly Jernigan from Durham, N.C., was returned to Delaware to face charges including attempted kidnapping after she was arrested in Maryland last week.
Court records say Jernigan drove to the 52-year-old man's apartment Thursday with a stun gun, handcuffs and duct tape. She fled when he came home, discovered her and called police.
Police said the two met online on Second Life, a social site where people create alter egos. The man broke off the relationship after they met in person.
Court records did not list an attorney for Jernigan, who was being held in lieu of $65,000 bail.

In an early-morning flurry of tweets, President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say he should get less than 10 years in prison MORE on Friday took aim at Iran for the third day in a row and denied reports of a heated phone call with Australia's prime minister.
Iran is playing with fire - they don't appreciate how "kind" President Obama was to them. Not me! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2017
Thank you to Prime Minister of Australia for telling the truth about our very civil conversation that FAKE NEWS media lied about. Very nice! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2017
The tweets came amid revelations on Wednesday that the White House was planning a fresh round of sanctions on several Iranian entities in the wake of recent ballistic missile tests by the country. National security adviser Michael Flynn on Tuesday said the administration was putting Iran "on notice" after the tests.
But Tehran has largely dismissed threats from the White House, calling Trump's words "baseless ranting" from an "inexperienced" leader and vowing it would continue its missile tests.

Adding to the bout of international controversy were reports on Tuesday that Trump had lashed out against Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull during a Saturday phone call. During the conversation, The Washington Post reported, the president bragged about the size of his Electoral College victory and bashed a refugee deal between the two countries, before ending the conversation more than half an hour earlier than scheduled.
Turnbull refused to comment on the details of the conversation during a Wednesday press conference but indicated that the U.S. would uphold its end of a deal to resettle 1,250 refugees being held in Australia.
Still, the reports of the chaotic conversation prompted two Republican senators to call the Australian ambassador, as well as a meeting between the ambassador and two of Trump's top aides on Thursday.
Turnbull said in a radio interview that there was a "clear commitment from the president" that the refugee resettlement would continue.
"The alliance is absolutely rock-solid. It is so strong," he said.
Greece succumbed to EU pressure on Thursday (3 December) to accept help on defending its borders, after veiled threats it will be locked out of the bloc's passport-free Schengen zone.
Greece, which has seen over 700,000 people arrive on its shores since the beginning of the year, agreed to let EU staff help with migrant registration on its northern border, where thousands are stranded since Macedonia began to let through only people from Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria.
Thursday saw riots. A Moroccan man died when he touched a high-voltage train cable while trying to enter Macedonia from Greece.
Greece also accepted help from other EU members to reinforce Greek guards patrolling the Aegean islands.
It will receive tents, generators, ambulances, water pumps, and other supplies to help house migrants and refugees.
As EU home affairs ministers gathered in Brussels on Friday, Greece was put under mounting pressure to cooperate with EU demans or face being barred from Schengen for up to two years.
Greek migration minister Yiannis Mouzalas said Thursday that Athens had not made the request for assistance earlier because it needed to assess its needs first.
“We did not know exactly what we needed and, more importantly, how we would use what we asked for,” he said, according to Greek daily Kathimerini.
The EU Commission welcomed the move, noting that over 50,000 people have arrived in Greece since 1 November alone.
“It is the moment of delivery,” EU migration commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos said in Brussels.
In the meantime, Sweden' government is drawing up plans that could close the Oresund bridge over the Baltic sea, linking it to neighboring Denmark, in an effort to stop the flow of asylum seekers.
The bill would allow the government to halt traffic on the bridge in case of emergencies without having to go through parliament.
The bridge, used by 20,000 commuters daily, has been the main entry route for those seeking asylum in Sweden, which expects 190,000 migrants this year.
Friends of Schengen
Highlighting a growing rift within the EU over migration, eastern European leaders gathering in Prague on Thursday (3 December) rejected the idea of downsizing the EU's 26-member Schengen zone to include fewer countries in order to better cope with the refugee crisis.
The prime ministers of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia called “any open or hidden attempts to limit free movement” inside the EU “unacceptable,” Reuters reports.
They launched a “Friends of Schengen” initiative aimed at keeping the zone intact and welcomed others to join.
The group "will talk to the other EU members and try to win them over to the idea of maintaining Schengen without letting it crumble into mini-Schengens, while ensuring the functioning of the outer border," Czech prime minister Bohuslav Sobotka said.
Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem warned last week that Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden might be forced to form a “mini-Schengen” if the bloc fails to solve the migrant crisis.
“Some countries want to defend themselves against their bad migration policy by reinstating border controls,” Hungary's prime minster Viktor Orban commented on Friday morning on state radio.
The four EU members offered help in strengthening the bloc's external borders, namely in Greece.
The four easterners have fewer asylum seekers on their territory. Hungary was a key transit country for migrants heading to the richer northern Europe, until it fenced off its southern borders in October.
[JURIST] The Supreme Court of Ohio [official website] on Wednesday ruled [opinion, PDF] that the state can execute a man whose execution was halted in 2009 after a failed attempt to administer lethal injection drugs. Romell Broom was to be put to death by lethal injection, but the execution was called off [JURIST report] after two hours when officials could not insert the IV line after sticking him 18 times. In a 4-3 decision, the Ohio Supreme Court held that the state was not barred from re-carrying out the execution of Broom by lethal injection. Broom's defense attorneys had argued that he should not face execution based on double jeopardy and that another execution would be an unconstitutional second penalty. The state high court disagreed with this argument claiming that the execution did not even commence due to the lethal drugs not being injected into Brooms body prior to his reaction. The court also ruled against Bloom in holding that a second execution would not be considered a form of cruel and unusual punishment. Broom was convicted of the 1984 rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl. He maintains his innocence.
Capital punishment [JURIST op-ed] remains a controversial issue in the US and worldwide. In February the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit [official website] rejected [opinion, PDF] a Georgia death row inmate's legal challenge [JURIST report] to the death penalty. In January Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood [official website] stated that he plans to ask lawmakers to approve the firing squad, electrocution or nitrogen gas as alternate methods of execution [press release] if the state prohibits lethal injection. The US Supreme Court in January ruled [JURIST report] in Kansas v. Carr [opinion, PDF] that a jury in a death penalty case does not need to be advised that mitigating factors, which can lessen the severity of a criminal act, do not need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt like aggravating factors.
FARGO, N.D. -- Brock Jensen scored on a 5-yard quarterback draw on fourth down with three minutes left to rally North Dakota State to a 23-20 victory over Georgia Southern on Friday night in the Football Championship Subdivision semifinals.
The defending champion Bison (13-1) advanced to the championship game Jan. 5 in Frisco, Texas, against the winner of Saturday's semifinal between Sam Houston State and Eastern Washington.
"I am (a) little bit out of words," North Dakota State coach Craig Bohl said. "That's probably one of the most draining games I've ever been a part of."
Georgia Southern coach Jeff Monken, whose team lost to NDSU in last year's semifinals, had to be consoled by four Eagles players after they finished interviews in the postgame news conference. Monken sobbed and then left the room for a few minutes before taking questions.
"I apologize for losing my composure there," Monken said. "It hurts, it hurts bad."
Jensen's run came on a fourth-and-3 play and followed three timeouts, the first by NDSU and the last two by Georgia Southern. Jensen said the play was called during the first timeout. Bohl said offensive coordinator Brent Vigen decided to stick with the play after much chatter among coaches on the field and coaches in the press box.
"There was a lot of debating going on. It was a chess match," Bohl said.
"Those are the type of situations you live for as a competitor of the game," Jensen said. "We called it, there was a hole there for me and I just tried to hit it as hard as I could."
Jensen's run capped a 59-yard drive that was aided by a roughing-the-passer penalty on the Eagles. The drive started at the Bison 41 after a 15-yard penalty on Georgia Southern for a late hit.
"I talk to our guys about a lot of things. All of them have to do the fundamentals, and that's a fundamental thing," Monken said of the penalties.
The Bison survived a furious rally when Carlton Littlejohn blocked a 50-yard field goal attempt with 34 seconds left by Drew Ruggles, who recently was recruited off the Georgia Southern soccer team.
Quarterback Jerick McKinnon rushed for 168 yards and a touchdown for Georgia Southern (10-4). He scored on a 25-yard run late in the third quarter to give the Eagles a 20-16 lead after the Bison's Jordan Champion roughed the punter in the Eagles' end zone.
"Without question, in my mind, I knew it was going to be a pivotal play," Bohl said of the penalty. "Once you get through the frustration, you say, hey, here's a young man trying to make a play."
McKinnon's touchdown followed a 53-yard touchdown run by NDSU's Sam Ojuri, who scored two plays after Christian Dudzik forced McKinnon to fumble and Grant Olson recovered at the Bison 41.
"You can't turn the ball over against a good team. It cost us," Monken said.
Ojuri rushed for 71 yards for North Dakota State. Jensen added 58 yards and John Crockett 55 yards rushing for the Bison.
Georgia Southern outgained NDSU 430-277 in total yardage. Dominique Swope added 78 yards rushing for the Eagles.
"Coming into the game, we knew it would be a physical game," McKinnon said. "North Dakota State did a great job of capitalizing ... making the big plays when they needed to."
Why swallow your vitamins when you can huff them? That's the general thinking behind the world's first breathable vitamin, called LeWhif Vitamin, which launched in the UK earlier this month and is expected to hit the US market this week.
The creation of Harvard biomedical engineer David Edwards, inventor of inhalable insulin, inhalable chocolate and inhalable coffee, LeWhif Vitamin is a lipstick-like delivery device that works a lot like a miniature pipe, only instead of inhaling smoke with each toke, you inhale a fine powder of healing supplements (a sort of anti-smoke) that dissolves in your mouth.
By skipping the digestive system, which breaks down pills and diverts many of their active ingredients to the liver, LeWhif Vitamins claims to deliver more concentrated doses of nutrients into the bloodstream. Eight hits supplies 100 percent of the daily recommended amount of A, B1, B2, B3 and B5.
Whiffing takes practice, however. When I tried my first hit of inhalable chocolate a few weeks ago with Edwards, I nearly choked to death. Edwards quickly corrected my technique. "It's just a gentle breath, like this," he said, as he took a quick hit off his coffee pipe. Inhale too hard and the particles can fly into the back of your throat. Once I got the technique down, the experience was surprisingly pleasant, and almost delicious, although my illicit-seeming huffs drew suspicious glances from strangers. I've yet to sample the vitamins, but they work the same way, and come in three tea flavors—Antioxidant Green Tea, Age Smart Wine Tea (with resveratrol) and Hibiscus Tea.
Inhalable vitamins are an innovative alternative to those one-a-day horse pills that leave your urine neon, but huffing supplements is insanely pricey: In England, a 3-day supply costs £4.99 (or about $8; no word yet on US pricing). That said, the money goes to a worthy cause, as it funds Edwards' novel idea laboratory, called ArtScience Labs, which helps student inventors bring daring innovations, a la huffable supplements, to market.

Did you notice a small coincidence? The day the Delhi Government announced its controversial Odd-Even scheme to control vehicular pollution happened to be the day when Delhi assembly was going to debate and pass its “historic” Jan Lokpal Bill. This was a strange day to make this announcement. It could easily be announced a day earlier or postponed by a day, after the assembly session concluded.
In any case, it would have distracted attention from what the Delhi government claimed was a ‘revolutionary' piece of legislation, ‘the strongest Lokpal in the country'. Indeed, the evening TV debates and the headlines next morning were about the Odd-Even scheme, not about Jan Lokpal.
Just consider this suggestion. This coincidence was actually not a coincidence. This was a carefully designed and swiftly executed media strategy to save the AAP government from media mauling on the Lokpal issue. This was a classic ploy used by media managers: distract the media with a middle class issue they cannot ignore. And the strategy worked.
The entire Jan Lokpal debate in the last 10 days was a classic case of how political power uses propaganda and distraction to get away with a daylight robbery. Here is what the AAP government went about selling a brazen u-turn in one of its ‘sacred' promises.
Step one, create anticipatory celebrations, before anyone knows anything. So the government fed stories to the media about how the cabinet had finally cleared this much anticipated revolutionary legislation, how the chief minister was nostalgic and sentimental about fulfilling the promise of Ramlila Maidan. This was dutifully reported without anyone getting a copy of what was actually passed by the cabinet. This was followed by an orchestrated euphoria on social media. The bhakts were ecstatic.
When Aruna Roy and other former colleagues of Arvind Kejriwal asked for a copy of the proposed legislation, they were brushed aside. The government that swore by transparency was not willing to put such a crucial piece of legislation in the public domain for discussion. It was said that the Bill has already been sufficiently discussed in public and did not warrant more discussion!
This narrative was punctured by Prashant Bhushan, when the Bill was leaked just 48 hours before the Assembly session. He tore into the Bill and pointed out how it violated each of the major promises made during the Jan Lokpal agitation at the Ramlila Maidan: that the appointment of the Lokpal will be free of political interference, that the Lokpal will be removed only by the judiciary, that it would be in control of an investigative agency of its own, that it would function in a transparent way.
He also exposed the bluff hidden in the Bill: the provision that brought all employees and ministers of the central government and other state governments based in Delhi within the ambit of the Delhi Lokpal. He rightly pointed out that this provision would give a perfect alibi to the BJP government to hold back assent and deny the people of Delhi their Lokpal.
The propaganda machinery then swung into the second step of its disinformation campaign: plain lies and denials. AAP spokespersons claimed that this Bill was “ditto same” bill that was passed in 2014. Second-rung promotion seekers were pressed into service to hurl abuses and level counter allegations against Bhushan of being a BJP agent! This lie was nailed within 24 hours. Bhushan placed a copy of the 2014 Bill in the public domain and listed how each of the key provisions of the Bill had been removed or diluted in the current Bill.
The next move was a classic red herring: the deputy chief minister claimed on the floor of the house that the 2014 Bill had to be changed due to the Supreme Court's objection to the appointment of “eminent persons”. It turned out that the Supreme Court had not suggested any such general ban. In any case, the 2014 Bill did not contain any reference to “eminent persons”, and, funnily, the first time it was proposed was in the Bill that the Deputy CM was piloting! The Bill finally passed by the assembly has now reinforced the role of “eminent persons” in the selection committee.
Exposed on all fronts, the AAP government finally came up with a fig leaf. Emissaries were dispatched to obtain Anna's blessings. The government suddenly saw merit in Anna's suggestions — incidentally these ‘suggestions' were nothing except what the Jan Lokpal movement had demanded incessantly. This lasted only 48 hours, for Anna held a press conference and communicated to Arvind Kejriwal that he wanted the 2014 Bill back. Although Anna's ‘endorsement' was reported prominently and his subsequent rejection barely reported in the media, it was clear to the government's media managers that the Bill could not be defended.
The four-fold increase in the salary of MLAs had made matters worse. Friends of the government were turning hostile. It was difficult to get everyone except diehard bhakts to continue applauding. Hence the final spin: create a huge distraction by way of Odds-Even scheme.
What about those not so credulous? Those who think of governance get a different narrative: you need to climb down from the moral high horse of the agitation days. Those who understand the political game of power get a wink: sab chalta hai!

A report from the Waco Tribune says that Baylor and the other schools currently blocking Texas A&M's Big 12 exit are not really trying to prevent A&M from leaving. It's really all about Oklahoma:
If Oklahoma reaffirms its commitment to the Big 12, the schools are expected to sign the waiver that would allow the Aggies to go to the SEC without any legal action. The Sooners, who are reportedly considering a move to the Pac-12, are expected to make their decision within the next two weeks.
A few weeks ago (maybe a month, I can't remember at this point), the general feeling became that the Big 12 would continue with nine teams and maybe add a tenth if Texas A&M left. Two things have happened since then. First, the pie-in-the-sky expansion candidates (Notre Dame and Arkansas) declined, and the rest of the Big 12 figured out that they weren't getting anyone better than maybe BYU or more likely TCU or Houston. Second, Oklahoma became extremely vocal in insisting that it would explore all of its options. The Big 12 can survive as a BCS automatic qualifier without Texas A&M, but it can't without Oklahoma.
The non-power schools are basically using the only scrap of leverage they have left to try to keep the conference together. They're trying to slow things down and extract a pledge from Oklahoma that it will give the Big 12 without A&M a try before bolting to the Pac-12. I doubt they think that legal threats will keep OU in the conference; it's all about buying time.
It's likely a fool's errand though. Texas A&M committed to the Big 12 last summer, and look where we are now. If OU wants to go, nothing it commits to in the next few days will ultimately stop it from leaving.
UPDATE
Travis Haney reports that an Oklahoma official hasn't heard anything about this. Who knows what's actually going on, but there's your denial from OU.
David S. Goyer, co-writer of The Dark Knight, will revamp Superman with a new film called The Man Of Steel. Can he do for Supes what he and the Nolans did for Batman? Spoilers ahead. Update: It's confirmed!
Latino Review reports that Goyer's been hired to write the script for the new movie, which will be called The Man Of Steel, in addition to helping to craft the story for the third Nolan Batman film. Sources claim Goyer pitched a Superman idea that gets the character back to the mid-1980s John Byrne era, when he was last rebooted and given a fun, splashy new attitude. Says Latino Review's source, the new version will be "Modern. Believable. Fun!". And no, Bryan Singer and Brandon Routh probably won't be back.

Adds the anonymous source:
Goyer's story involves Luthor and Brainiac. It is NOT an origin and assumes audiences already know about Lois, Clark, Jimmy and Perry. I know the Daily Planet is struggling due to the internet. And I know it sets up a huge Kryptonian mythology.
Update: Variety has confirmed this report. [Latino Review]
The bar “Kreuzweise” is well-known part of the left-wing scene in Augsburg. But dissension has now broken out in the ranks, after the bar imposed a ban on African asylum seekers.
“We've had it up to here! There's no fun here any more. I'm speechless. The boys won't listen to anyone, they're highly aggressive and we can't take it any more. They're out, all of them!” said bar owner Tatjana Dogan in a Facebook post.
The asylum seekers are all young men from the Gambia. In the bar, they have been stealing, behaving aggressively and harassing women. Police have been called and forced to draw their weapons on the Africans.
Some leftists have complained that it is unjust to ban all dark-skinned people from the bar, but the owner has made it clear that only this one specific group of asylum seekers has been affected.
She also maintains her left-wing credentials by expressing sympathy for them.
Refugees from the Gambia have almost no chance of their asylum application being accepted, she says. They can't work, have little money and don't get courses in German. “That would make anyone frustrated,” she said. “The men need to be taken care of better.”
Meanwhile, an additional bouncer has been hired to deal with the African problem.

EGG HARBOR TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) — The mayor of a New Jersey shore town is selling his waterfront home because he says he can't afford the property taxes.
Egg Harbor Mayor James “Sonny” McCullough has lived in the township's Seaview Harbor section since 1974. He and his wife bought land and built their home for $360,000 in 1985.
The property was valued at slightly more than $1.1 million during last year's township-wide revaluation, which increased his property taxes nearly 60 percent to $31,056.
The 71-year-old mayor tells The Press of Atlantic City he thought he'd be able to live and die in his home.
McCullough says he hopes to find another home in the township. But if he doesn't, the couple purchased a $150,000 waterfront condominium in Florida, where the property taxes are $2,569.
New Jersey has the highest property taxes in the nation. Last year the average bill, before any tax credits, was close to $8,000.
The biggest share of property taxes is used to pay for local schools.

Brittany Burns, a former Clemson University rower and the fiancée of Buffalo Bills linebacker Tony Steward, passed away on Monday. She was 26 years old.
Burns and Steward met while the two were student-athletes at Clemson. They were engaged this past December, just days after Burns was diagnosed with a rare form of ovarian cancer. She had been receiving treatment for the disease at the University of Pennsylvania, and lived in Orchard Park with Steward.
After her diagnosis, Burns and Steward started the charitable campaign, Fight Like a Girl, which helps women who are fighting ovarian cancer. You can read more about that effort here.

Steward was a sixth-round pick of the Bills in the 2015 NFL Draft. He struggled with injuries throughout his rookie season, including a back injury suffered on December 6 that landed him on season-ending Injured Reserve.
Please keep Brittany Burns, Tony Steward, and the couple's families and friends in your thoughts and prayers today, Bills fans.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A long hoped for improvement in the economy appears to be manifesting itself in second-quarter U.S. earnings, but the next two weeks could be the real test.

Companies such as General Electric Co (GE.N) and Intel Corp (INTC.O) have reported solid results. In addition, GE believes now is a ripe moment to spin off its private label credit card division in the hopes growing consumer demand will make it more attractive.
Intel declared that personal computer sales have stabilized, while it forecast third-quarter revenue above Wall Street's expectations.
Profit growth for the second quarter is now estimated at 6.7 percent - excluding results from Citigroup Inc (C.N), which was hit by a big adjustment from a mortgage settlement - better than where they stood at the end of June.
In addition, 68 percent of S&P 500 companies so far are beating analysts' profit expectations, above the 63 percent long-term average, according to Thomson Reuters data. A similarly high percentage of companies are beating revenue forecasts.
“Analysts may be underestimating the level of prospective improvement in the second quarter,” wrote Carmine Grigoli, chief investment strategist at Mizuho Securities in New York.
The latest profit estimate is up from a July 1 forecast of 6.2 percent, while revenue growth, now 3.2 percent, is on track to be the highest since the third quarter.
Still, it's easy to overestimate the excitement. Many of the early reporting is by financial companies, not always the best barometer of Main Street activity.
The next two weeks, however, will see 60 percent of the S&P 500 release their results. That is key for investors looking for confirmation the anticipated economic rebound from the first quarter is more than just weather related.
Among the companies set to release figures are Apple Inc (AAPL.O), McDonald's Corp (MCD.N), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N). So far in July, six of 10 S&P sectors - particularly healthcare, consumer staples and energy - have shown upward revisions from June, according to Citigroup.
“The second quarter is going to be much stronger than the first for the reasons we all know, the weather. Investors are trying to decipher whether this improvement is a weather-related bounce or if there's actually internal growth happening,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.
The U.S. economy contracted at a 2.9 percent annual pace in the January-March period, its worst performance in five years.
Recent jobs and other economic data suggest the economy was growing briskly heading into the second half, with growth forecasts for the second quarter now topping a 3 percent annual pace. June's payrolls report showed a surge in job growth and the jobless rate closing in on a six-year low.
One promising sign for the second quarter: typically pessimistic analysts' forecasts, which most S&P 500 companies still tend to beat, declined just 2.2 percentage points between April 1 and July 1.
That is the smallest overall decline since the first quarter of 2011, Thomson Reuters data showed, and about half the average decline seen in the last five years.
Mike Jackson, founder of investment firm T3 Equity Labs in Denver, said his research shows eight out of the 10 S&P sectors - all but staples and utilities - should post surprises this quarter.
“It probably suggests the earnings increases are occurring across a broader sector of the economy than what was previously believed,” he said.
GE's quarterly report on Friday showed the profit margin for its industrial businesses, a closely watched barometer by Wall Street, expanded 0.2 percentage point to 15.5 percent.
To be sure, not all reports are positive. Container Store Group Inc (TCS.N) and Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc (LL.N) both warned about upcoming results, suggesting that retail weakness remains.
Apr 26, 2017-
The country's economy is projected to expand at the fastest pace in over two decades in this fiscal year driven by a bumper agricultural output, sharp decline in number of protests and steady supply of electricity.
The figure released on Tuesday by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), the government's statistics agency, shows the country's gross domestic product (GDP) growing at 6.9 percent at basic prices in 2016-17, the highest since fiscal year 1993-94 when the economy expanded by 8.2 percent.
The government's preliminary growth forecast is higher than its previous estimate of 6.5 percent. This is probably the first time in the recent history that the government had beaten its own economic growth target.
The country is expected to achieve 23-year-high economic growth rate on the back of a good monsoon, which is expected to raise agricultural output, steady supply of electricity, which has eased problems of enterprises, and improvement in law and order situation due to sharp decline in protests, according to Chandra Kumar Ghimire, member secretary of the National Planning Commission, the parent body of the CBS.
With this impressive growth in economic output, per capita income of Nepalis is expected to jump to Rs91,488 ($862) in the current fiscal year.
Nepal has been grappling with a long spell of subpar growth, with average GDP expanding at a rate of less than 4 percent per annum in the last one decade.
The highest growth rate achieved by the country in the last ten years was 5.7 per cent. That was in 2013-14. But this achievement is now considered as a blip, as the economic growth rate tumbled to 3 percent in 2014-15 due to devastating 7.8-magnitude earthquake. As the country was trying to recover from the disaster, another tragedy struck the country after India imposed trade blockade from the fourth week of September 2015 to the first week of February 2016. The trade embargo halted supply of everything from daily essentials, raw materials to petroleum products. This sent the economy into a painful tailspin, restricting growth-as per the revised figure-to 0.01 percent, the lowest since fiscal year 1982-83.
Finally, signs of recovery have started emerging, as the health of all the sectors has improved.
The torchbearer of growth in the current fiscal year is the agricultural sector, which is expected to expand by 5.3 percent. The sector is likely to expand at this rate because of projected 21.7 percent surge in paddy production. Paddy alone makes a contribution of 20.7 percent to the agricultural output. Also, production of other crops, like wheat, maize, millet, potato and vegetables, is expected to increase in the current fiscal year.
“The agricultural sector as a whole made an impressive performance because of good monsoon, smooth supply of agricultural inputs, better irrigation facilities and availability of farm insurance schemes,” Ghimire said.
Despite this, the contribution of the agricultural sector in the GDP is expected to dip to 29.4 percent in the current fiscal year from 31.6 percent recorded in the last fiscal year.
“This is because other sectors have also performed well this year,” said CBS Director General Suman Raj Aryal.
The output of the construction sector, for instance, is expected to grow by 11.7 percent in the current fiscal year. This is largely because of normalisation in the supply situation. With this, the share of the construction sector in the GDP is forecast to stand at 7.2 percent in this fiscal year from 6.8 percent a year ago.
This kind of feelgood factor has also trickled in the manufacturing sector, which is expected to grow by 9.7 percent in the current fiscal year, while the wholesale and retail trade sector, which has been bulging over the years due to surge in remittance-fuelled consumption, is projected to expand by 9.8 percent.
The almost-10-percent growth recorded by the wholesale and retail trade sector, however, is unlikely to increase its share in the economic pie, as the contribution of the sector to the GDP is expected to contract to 13.5 percent in the current fiscal year from 14.1 percent a year ago. Is this the effect of deceleration in the flow of money sent home by Nepalis working abroad is yet to be determined.
Among others, real estate, rental and other businesses, which make a contribution of 9.9 percent to the GDP, is expected to expand by 5.3 percent, while the education sector, which holds a share of 7.2 percent in the economic output, is projected to grow by 4.2 percent.
Considering the growth recorded by all these sectors, Nepal is expected to produce goods and services worth Rs2,599 billion rupees in the current fiscal year.

A textbook neckbeard. Charming.Let's face it: male nerds usually aren't very physically attractive. That's why they're nerds! If they were devastatingly handsome and had great genes, they would have spent their high school years banging away on cheerleaders instead of banging away on a keyboard in the computer lab writing awkward World War II versus Star Trek: The Next Generation fan fiction. Here's an example of WWII/ST:TNG fan fiction, by the way:
General Captian John Luc Picard turned away from the window and looked at Captain Jim Riker of the allies. "We must not surrender France to a Nazi," he says. "I don't want to." Riker nodded. "Yes i know." "But the germans have disabled our warp drive-powered paratroopers and now we are sitting ferringi." John Luc Picard frowned and faced towards the window. "We will hit them with our photon sherman tanks." he ordered. "Make it so."
Anyways, the point is that nerds aren't usually traditionally attractive (and also that – in hindsight -- attacking the Nazis with Photon Sherman Tanks wasn't a very good idea).
To make up for their shortcomings, some nerds come up with the bright idea to camouflage their skulls with facial hair. Here are a few reasons why:
It makes them feel more like they're living in the medieval "days of yore" most RPG's take place in. With a full beard, they're more likely to make a big splash at the next Renaissance Faire. It makes them look older. A nerd with a beard just screams, "hey, I may still live with my parents... but I'm no KID!" Beards are a great place to store food. So if they get hungry during a long Halo 2 session, they can just snack away on chunks of potato chips still clinging to life on the hairs of their cheeks. HEY YOU WANT 2 GO C KILL BILL VOLUME 2 L8R?? Nerds are lazy. Shaving and personal hygiene are an inefficient use of time! Why, in the time it takes to shower and shave, you could watch a complete episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force!!
I'm a huge nerd, but I'm more of a hairless nerd. Earlier this year I experimented with trying to make the transition to hairy nerd, but as you can see by the following picture, that experiment was an abysmal failure:
Gross. I'll stick to slapping razors up and down my face, thanks.
I don't have a problem with nerds who are able to grow and properly maintain a reasonably trimmed beard or goatee (soul patches and mustaches are just creepy, though), but I do have a problem with nerds who let the situation get out of control. The results can be horrific.
The result can be a neckbeard.
Beware!! This man can play bass!!! (thanks root)
A neckbeard is like a wild, untamed wilderness located beneath one's chin. In some places, the dense underbrush becomes so thick that it's nearly impassable and you'd need a machete to explore its hidden depths. In other places, there are bare patches of skin that no follicle dares to enter. And there are no tranquil oasis's in this sea of unkempt hair: there is only lingering debris from the remnants of the vanquished S.S. McChicken.
If you're living in the post-20th century, there is really no good reason for you to have a neckbeard. It's not very useful. No woman with a healthy level of self-esteem is going to walk up to you and stroke your neckbeard while swooning, "oooh, I love the greasy feel of this overgrown carrot patch protruding out of your throat!"
If a neckbeard is accompanied by a ponytail, then the guy is either a good computer programmer or a bad musician. The neckbeard/ponytail combination is very dangerous because it can generate a lot of grease. About the most dangerous thing you can do with a guy who has both a neckbeard and a ponytail is tried to play racquetball against him: once he starts sweating, the floor will be quickly covered with a thick layer of slime that'll cause you to start sliding around all over the place. Eventually you'll careen into a wall and break your collarbone. So don't play racquetball against anyone who is really good at C++.
Reach down right now try to choke yourself with one hand. No, no... try to choke your THROAT. If you can feel hair, go shave it off right now, you ninny neckbeard nincompoop. If you snag a handful of fur and happen to be of the female persuasion, contact Joshua "Livestock" Boruff right away... he'd love to hear from you!

Well, that's been a depressing few days, hasn't”t it? Have you been watching the pictures on TV? Howling mobs of blacks throwing bottles; overturned cars; stores looted and burned; police in riot gear watching passively; black faces contorted with rage; furrowed-brow white liberals excusing, explaining.
It's all too drearily familiar, isn't”t it? Newark and Detroit; Miami; Crown Heights; Los Angeles; Cincinnati; here we go again.
Is there any way out of this wretched cycle? Any hope for an end of it? Any solution? Well, I”ve heard a few suggestions.
Separation. This idea is popular with white identity types. Here, for example, is Matthew Heimbach of White Student Union fame, in conversation with black separatist Brutha Dawah:
It's much better for the white community, but also the black community, to be able to peacefully separate … No-one gets more resources than another. It's a fair separation. And what that would do is, incidents of police brutality, the industrial prison system, which primarily affects black males, that wouldn't”t be a problem any more, because the black community would be able to have its own prison system, its own police, its own justice system.
Richard Spencer (a former editor of Taki's Magazine) shares the dream:
The ideal I advocate is the creation of a White Ethno-State on the North American continent.
I know both these guys: Richard's been a personal friend for some years. I have to say, though, I find separatism hard to take seriously.
“The problem with separatism is that blacks would be nuts to want it.”
Matthews's view is the more naÃ¯ve of the two, unless he's being disingenuous. What would be the condition of blacks post-separation? The odds are: not good.
Blacks have created viable nations: Barbados, Botswana, and Ghana get good press, for example. These are exceptions, though; and Barbados, the best of the bunch, with a tiny population (same as Newark's) and flourishing tourist and offshore-banking enterprises, still only manages a South European level of prosperity (with a distinctly non-European homicide rate). Most black nations are fragile and very poor. Black populations simply don”t have enough of a smart fraction.
Assuming that the white ethnostate will be sharing North America with one or more black ethnostates, the latter will be poor and dysfunctional, certainly more so than their white neighbors. Imagine a midrange black-African state next to a midrange European state: say, Uganda (2013 GDP per capita $1,500) abutting Belgium ($37,800). I see major issues of border control.
The problem with separatism is that blacks would be nuts to want it. With all the real or imagined indignities of minority status, life is far better for them in a white nation.
Michael Hart has proposed an interesting variant of the separatist idea: a three-way partition of the U.S.A., comprising a black separatist state, a white separatist state, and an integrated state:
All American citizens who do not explicitly choose to become citizens of the BSS or the WSS will remain members of the integrated USA. Therefore, just after the partition, the tangible wealth of the integrated USA will be proportional to the number of people who choose to remain its citizens.
That's cute, but it suffers from the same problem as before: relentless pressure on the borders of the WSS and IUSA from blacks desperate to escape the poverty and disorder of the BSS. So separatism looks like a no-hoper.
There's a bit more to be said than that. Richard Spencer, for example, has his eyes fixed on the far future (“It would be a state for the 21st century”or 22nd …”) and seeks only to plant the idea of a white ethnostate, taking 19th-century Zionism as his model. This century's absurdity may be the next century's popular cause, he”d say.
I suppose it might. After all, there have been cases of the converse being true. There was, for example …
Repatriation. In my grandfathers” grandfathers” time, the idea of sending American blacks back to Africa was hugely popular with elite whites. Abraham Lincoln was friendly to “colonization” schemes, and appointed a commissioner of emigration to implement them.
The problem was that very few blacks wanted to be repatriated.
Yet despite their leaders” support for colonization, the common [black] people [of Philadelphia] unequivocally rejected the notion.
Blacks didn't”t see why they should uproot themselves and move to a distant continent just for the convenience of white people. They especially didn't”t see it in the 1860s, when a dramatic improvement in their condition seemed to be just over the horizon.
Of the era's four million American blacks, only 15,000 signed up for colonization. If they”d known how Liberia would turn out, the number would have been even smaller.

Jim Messina is president and CEO of the Messina Group, and managed President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign.
It seems that virtually every day Donald Trump and his administration are embroiled in a new fiasco. The Mueller investigation is ongoing, indictments are coming out, and the president can't help himself from picking fights on Twitter. His targets run the gamut, from the New York Times and CNN, to NFL players and ESPN hosts. There's even friendly fire directed at fellow Republicans like Mitch McConnell and Ed Gillespie.
What Trump may not realize—and what new data shows—is that he may be tweeting his way into losses in 2018 and 2020.
Story Continued Below
Ten months into his presidency, the failure of any one single scandal to sink his administration has led some in the media to suggest that Trump is like “Teflon,” with the grime that would stick to (and ruin) other politicians simply slipping right off. But the numbers show that nothing could be further from the truth—Trump's scandals aren't just damaging him, they're causing swing voters to reevaluate both his priorities and the very health of the economy.
The Messina Group recently completed a long-term research project looking at a specific group who helped decide the 2016 election: white voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin who supported Barack Obama in 2012 but in 2016, did not vote for Hillary Clinton, instead choosing to either stay home or vote for Trump or a third-party candidate. What we found—combined with this month's election results—should worry Trump and every ally who has hitched their wagon to his fast-burning star.
Among the swing voters most critical to his viability, Donald Trump isn't just vulnerable, he's harming himself. Even as Wall Street reaches new highs in profitability and Trump endlessly brags about his stock-market numbers, these voters aren't seeing the improvement in their own lives. And, most worryingly for Trump and Republicans, the president's outlandish statements cause the voters we spoke with to believe that he's focused more on his own petty dramas than on improving their families' lives.
Trump's behavior and the endless parade of controversies he drums up? They're how he loses.
***
At the beginning of April, we convened an online focus group of voters in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania who supported Obama but not Clinton. The overriding opinion expressed by the participants was that, yes, Donald Trump was racist, sexist, and offensive, but he was shaking up Washington and working to improve the economy. As one woman in Michigan put it, Trump “wants to change things that everyone has been complaining or talking about for years.”
It's a belief that was underlined by the results of our polls from both July and October, which showed that key voters in these three states gave Trump much higher marks on his handling of the economy than his job approval—among this subset of voters, a late October poll had Trump at a net -23 points on job approval but only -7 on handling the economy. This trend is consistent with what public polls are showing; in the latest NBC/WSJ poll from the end of October, Trump's job approval was -20, but his rating for handling the economy was +5.
That said, the white Obama-Non-Clinton voters we surveyed were clear: If the economy does not improve measurably, they are not going to give Trump a second chance—and they already have a clear reason to explain his failure: Twitter.
Consistently, the members of our focus groups worried that Trump was so pre-occupied with picking Twitter fights and the general chaos of his administration that he was not focusing on making the economy better. This sentiment is backed by quantitative data that offers a peek at Trump's political kryptonite.
Based on the focus-group findings, we drafted four distinct messages about Trump and his handling of the economy. In one, we explained that he had stacked his cabinet with billionaires who weren't looking out for everyday Americans; in another, we offered facts about the economy under Trump, including stagnant wages; in the third, we highlighted how Trump's budget would cut programs important to the middle class and reroute the money into tax cuts for the wealthy. And finally, we tied his incendiary, all-hours tweets to his failure to bring jobs back to the U.S.
When exposing all voters in the survey to a tough message laying out the consequences of Trump's tweeting—how it signals what he really cares about and prevents him from focusing his energy on making good on his promises to improve people's lives—we found that the overall rating of Trump's handling of the economy dropped by 6 points. And among the key Obama-Non-Clinton voter demographic? It dropped a staggering 21 points.
Similarly, when voters were told that Trump wants to give massive tax cuts to the wealthy while cutting programs for middle-class families, voters' ratings of his handling of the economy sunk by 8 points overall and by an astounding 24 points among Obama-Non-Clinton voters.
Perhaps even more interesting is that when we re-surveyed Obama-non-Clinton voters six weeks later, those who'd been exposed to the tweeting message had a much dimmer view of Trump than those exposed to other messages.
The real-world application of these findings is clear: Voters might give President Trump a pass for individual outrageous statements, but if Democrats continually tie his pattern of remarks backs to the economy, voters will not be forgiving. Progressives across the country should be driving this message relentlessly: Donald Trump is more focused on helping the rich and picking fights on Twitter then he is with making people's lives better.
Since we started this research back in March, a debate has developed within some of the Democratic Party about whether we should focus on the white working-class voters or what pollsters call the “rising American electorate,” which is usually defined as Millennials plus people of color and unmarried women. And while I hope the recent election—in which Democrats rode a cresting tsunami of enthusiasm and engagement into office from coast to coast—will quell this debate, I want to reiterate that Democrats don't need to adopt an either/or strategy, treating support from each group as though it's mutually exclusive. Barack Obama won two presidential elections because he focused on both, and going forward, Democrats would be wise to remember the lesson of his example.
It's true that Donald Trump is unlike any politician we have seen in a long time. Things that pundits say should sink him do not. He has thus far managed to rebound from even the most vile behavior.
But voters are only willing to go along with that so far.
When they realize that he is failing to deliver on the economy, the heap of fiascos he has piled up becomes evidence of what he has focused on instead. And then, Trump will be held accountable, just like every other politician.
Young Americans are showing far less fervent support for Israel than older generations, but almost no-one can agree on why the change is happening, how permanent it is likely to be, or what it all means.
Observers offer a laundry list of possibilities.

They say millennials are more likely than their elders to be liberal and Israel's actions — particularly in the current offensive in Gaza — increasingly meet with vigorous criticism in left-of-center circles.
Millennials are also much more avid consumers of social media, on which different narratives explaining the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians are more readily available — as are especially gruesome images of the human toll extracted by Israeli missile strikes.
These young people also don't have the same memories as their parents.
Many older Americans can still recall the Six-Day War in 1967 or the Yom Kippur War in 1973, during which Israel's very existence seemed to be threatened by its Arab neighbors.
By contrast, “young Americans have grown up with Israel as an incredible superpower in the region, and with occupation and intifada,” said Ira Stup of J Street, the liberal-leaning pro-Israel lobby group. “Young Americans often have a vision of Israel vis-a-vis Palestine that is more in line with what is going on now.”
There is no mistaking the depth of the generational split.
Late last month, Gallup asked Americans whether Israel's recent actions against Hamas were justified or unjustified. Those who were 65 or older backed Israel by a wide margin: 55 percent to 31 percent. But those aged between 18 and 29, said by more than a two-to-one margin — 51 percent to 25 percent — that Israel's actions were unjustified.
Another survey conducted by Pew around the same time asked whether Israel or Hamas bore the greater responsibility for the current violence.
Respondents across the board placed more of the culpability around Hamas' shoulders — with the exception of the young.
Overall, 40 percent blamed the Islamic group compared to 19 percent who blamed Israel. Among those over 65 years old, more than three times as many blamed Hamas (53 percent) as Israel (15 percent). Yet among those aged 18-29, 29 percent blamed Israel and only 21 percent blamed Hamas.
Alec Tyson, a senior researcher with Pew, told The Hill that while the findings were “significant,” it was also important not to draw too sweeping a generalization from them.
He noted that when Americans were asked whether they had more overall sympathy for Israel or the Palestinians, Israel consistently comes out on top.
“Young people are more sympathetic to Israel than the Palestinians by about two-to-one, rather than by about six-to-one among the oldest Americans,” he said.
Even the most recent data, he cautioned, “wouldn't represent a shift in the public sympathies in terms of [tipping] the balance, but in terms of the magnitude.”
It's an open question whether the current conflict is changing attitudes.
Tyson said that Pew had been asking people which side they sympathized with in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict “for at least ten years, but there is no sense that this is a record narrow gap among young people. That's just not the case.”
On the other hand, as The Washington Post recently noted, Pew also took a poll back in 2006, when Israel was engaged in a broadly comparable conflict to the current one, except against Hezbollah.
In that instance, young people remained more stoutly in defense of Israel than they are currently: those aged 18-29 back then were three times more likely to blame Hezbollah than Israel for the violence.
“Israel has taken a PR battering in the current war,” Tevi Troy, who served as a liaison to the Jewish community for the administration of President George W. Bush, told The Hill. “There is a lot of anti-Israel propaganda.”
A number of figures from the world of popular culture have expressed broad sympathies for the Palestinians in the current dispute, albeit somewhat tentatively.
Most notably, Rihanna tweeted “#FreePalestine” before deleting the tweet. Actress Kerry Washington (who called one Israeli strike in which four children were killed “heartbreaking” on Twitter) and singer Selena Gomez, (who posted the message “It's about humanity: Pray for Gaza” on Instagram) were among those who weighed in.
Still, pro-Israel figures insisted that the shift among the young was nothing to panic about — yet.
“I'm not hugely worried,” said Tevi Troy. “Over the long run, America's interests and Israel's interests are aligned.”
Meet Project SAM
Hello there! If you are new here, you might want to subscribe to the RSS feed for updates on this topic.
Having sat through two meetings of the Colorado task force I have been appointed to by Gov. John Hickenlooper to recommend a regulatory framework for recreational marijuana use in this state, it is clearer to me than ever that our nation needs to have far more educated and honest debate about this drug.
It is also clear to me that marijuana is very poorly understood and that public discourse is dominated by people who traffic in junk science — from economic analyses that are deeply flawed and/or lacking the vitally important perspective of medical science and public health, to bogus medical claims made by people with obvious conflicts of interest. Sadly, what they boldly assert is often amplified and broadcast without thorough scrutiny and analysis by journalists — who, for the most part, lack professional training that would help them spot the fakers and shysters to deliver work that is accurate, not merely “balanced perspective.”
It is for all of these reasons — and many others — that I support Project SAM and am honored to have been asked to serve on its board, chaired by former U.S. Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, Jr. I hope you'll learn about SAM by heading to learnaboutsam.com.
SAM stands for Smart Approaches to Marijuana — and that's what we need right now. We certainly don't need more lies spun for personal, professional, economic, financial or political gain. We need marijuana policy based on reputable science and sound principles of public health and safety.
believes in an approach that neither legalizes, nor demonizes, marijuana.
rejects dichotomies — such as “incarceration versus legalization” — that offer only simplistic solutions to the highly complex problems stemming from marijuana use and the policies surrounding it.
champions smart policies that decrease marijuana use — and do not harm marijuana users and low-level dealers with arrest records that stigmatize them for life and in ways that make it even harder for them to break free from cycles of substance dependence. SAM:
I invite you to support SAM. You could start by liking the alliance on Facebook. It would be an honor to work with you in this cause, too.
What does it mean to be lost outdoors? We sure all know how it feels, but how does it happen? How do we actually “get lost,” and what can we do to avoid it?
The Oxford dictionary defines lost as ‘unable to find one's way; not knowing one's whereabouts'. So being lost is when you can't find where you are trying to go, or when you can't find where you are. Is it a future problem (where do I go?), or is it a present issue (where am I?). In his book, Deep Survival, Laurence Gonzales defines lost in a way that combines both the present and the future dilemma of being lost – he defines it as “Bending the map”.
What does “bending the map” mean? When we are in an unfamiliar place, especially outdoors, claims Gonzales, we create a mental map of our surroundings to place ourselves in, which allows us to evaluate distance to objects and places around us. The problem, or how we are got lost, is when we are in unfamiliar places and not updating our mental map quickly enough. Our minds insist we are somewhere we are not, even if the map, compass and the environment are telling us differently. That state of not accepting our true location, and trying to force our surroundings to match our mental map, is what Gonzales means when he refers to bending the map.
Let's look at an example: you have a map, a compass and a pre-set route on the map. You have been walking/running/cycling or whatever for a few hours, passing a few places you are positive you can identify on the map. After a couple of hills, you look at the map and you know exactly where you are – you don't even need to look around you. An hour later you are not so sure where you are, and when looking at the map, you are sure you are at that ridge, or is it the one next to it? So you look around, you are pretty sure the tree line is that on the map, and the hill over there is right here on the map. In fact, you are actually just bending the map instead of properly taking the time to find the map location based on the surroundings, and so getting yourself lost outdoors.
I used to do this a lot – tell myself the area fit the map, instead of looking around, see what is around me, measuring properly, and then going to the map to find that location. We have all done that, and so we all have gotten lost outdoors, many times. Usually it is not a serious matter – a couple of hours more outside, a detour on the trail or just reaching camp late. But when outdoors, getting it seriously wrong needs to happen only once, and it is usually deadly.
Now that we know how we get lost, let's work to avoid it:
Step one - have the right mind set
The most important thing when going outdoors is leaving your ego at home. Yes, good old humility is all that is needed to be able to navigate securely outdoors – accept that you might be wrong, be ready to go back, question your location assumptions and check again (and again). Self-confidence in navigation is important, otherwise you won't go anywhere, but make sure to really double-check yourself when you look around – don't bend your map!
Step two - know how to navigate with a map and compass
To navigate means to know where you are (so, not be lost) while knowing where you are going. It is not accidental that the definition has two parts and we will look into both of them separately, but first we will need to define a few important tools.
Bearings
Bearings often are confused with azimuths (see below). Bearings are always used within a quadrant and are never bigger than 90°. A bearing is represented by its north/south reference, the angle from the east or west line and the east/west reference, ie: N20°E. This example is in the north-east quadrant, 20 degrees north of the eastern line. This is a tricky one but a bearing is always the relationship between the north-south line and the east-west line.
Azimuths
Azimuths are the angle between the north/south line, and an imaginary line between you and an object/location you are headed for. The important thing to understand about azimuths is that azimuths are measured in angles. Those angles are always measured clockwise starting at 0° up to 359(.999…)°.
Bearing vs Azimuth
To add to the confusion, azimuths are very often called bearings (I make the mistake too!) and most of the time when we are “taking a bearing” we are actually taking an azimuth. To make it simpler, let's see how both of those behave using a simple graph:
Line A-B - Azimuth: 300°, bearing: N30°W (30° northwards of W)
Line B-A - Azimuth: 210°, bearing: S30°E
Line D-C - Azimuth: 45°, bearing: N45°E
Line E-F - Azimuth: 170°, bearing: S80°E
I guess you are getting the point by now. When seen visually it makes a lot more sense than those random words about angles, quadrants and reference points.
Practical navigation
When we navigate with a compass and map we utilise the compass' ability to show the north and offer an azimuth with the ability to “pin point” specific features and objects on the map. To use them together effectively we need make sure they are properly aligned so that our map is oriented with the north.
Orienting a map
The problem with orienting a map to point to the north, is that in reality we have 3 norths: magnetic (true) north, geographical north and grid north. The distortion between the norths is called a declination and it can be corrected to compensate for it. So how do you properly orient your map?
Check the declination on your map (should be at the bottom of the legend next to the scale), make sure you understand what the needed correction is (is it an east or west correction and how much), if it is an east correction you need to add the degrees and if it a west correction you need to subtract. [see above] Place your compass in your hand, but make sure there are no metallic/magnetic objects nearby (a watch, pocket knife etc) and you are away from railroads or any other big metallic objects. [pic 1] Rotate the azimuth dial until the orienting arrow is aligned with the DOT arrow. Rotate the azimuth dial for the declination correction (+/-degrees). [pic 2] Rotate the whole compass (with yourself if you are holding the compass) until the needle “fits” into the orienting arrow. [pic 3] Place the compass on the map and rotate the map until the orienting lines are aligned with the map grid.
That is it, the map is now oriented. Its ma look like a tedious and long process but with practice it takes seconds to do and no thinking at all (just memorise the declination in the area you are in).
Using azimuth to finding direction
We described what an azimuth is, but how do we use it? Azimuth is the angle that is created between the north baseline and an imaginary line between your location and a clear object (a peak or a saddle). So in order to take an azimuth we need use the map and compass in conjunction. Here are some step-by-step instructions:
Finding an azimuth to follow
The idea here is to get an azimuth from the map so we can follow it while walking to an easily defined waypoint.
Set the map on a flat surface (non metallic!) Find the next point of your route on the map (a peak, a saddle, a clear structure etc) [pic 1] Put the compass on the map so that one corner of the base plate is on your current location [pic 2] Rotate the compass base plate so that the DOT arrow is pointing towards your destination (the waypoint) [pic 3] Read the angle that is marked by the index line – that is the grid north azimuth Correct for declination (add/subtract the correct degrees) [pic 4]
Following your azimuth
Place the compass flat in your hand (and away from all metals) so you can look at it at roughly a 45° down angle Make sure the needle is fitted in the orienting arrow Keep your head steady and just move your eyes from the compass to the object until you are sure you have located the right one Put the compass away and start walking (or use any other means of movement)
After finding your azimuth, you will need to follow the angle. The best way is to find, in real life, the object you pinpointed on the map to get the azimuth and just head towards it.
Checkpoints and other methods to follow an azimuth
Stay on your azimuth until you reach your obstacle Turn 90° (using your compass) and walk a set distance to go around the obstacle (point C) Turn 90° again towards your original azimuth (point D) Cover the length of the obstacle and turn 90° again (point E) Walk back the same distance you have covered previously to go around the obstacle until you are back on your original azimuth Take another 90° turn to resume your original DOT (point F)
Sometimes it will be difficult to follow your azimuth due to limited visibility, obstacles on the way or if you are going a great distance. To help with this, it is useful to pick checkpoints. Checkpoints are used to break the journey into legs that can be easy to recognize; aim for a checkpoint every 1km or so to be able to locate it easily.If you have an obstacle in your way, such as a body of water, dense vegetation or cliffs, go back to your map and plan a route around it that uses 90° changes:
In poor visibility you can use the spiral search method so you don't miss your target location when conditions mean you can't see very far: walk in a 90° spiral so each time you increase the distance covered based on your visibility conditions (see image): start by picking an object at the edge of your visibility. Walk to this place while pacing yourself so you know how far that distance is, turn 90° and walk twice the length of that distance, turn again and walk three times the distance, and so on. By using this method you will be able to see the whole area that you cover and not miss your target.
Pinpointing your location
Pinpointing your location is probably the most important thing when we are outdoors in a place we don't know. Our tendency to “bend the map” and force our environment into the wrong mental maps is the main reason we get lost outdoors. If you have a map and compass there are a few simple ways to find your location:
Back azimuth
Find your favorite object Set the compass so that the DOT arrow points to the object Fit the needle into the orienting arrow Read the azimuth set by the indexing line Correct for declination (from magnetic north to grid north) Find the object on the map Orient the map Calculate the back azimuth If the azimuth is greater than 180° (such as 215°), deduct 180° from it (215°-180°=35°) to find your back azimuth If the azimuth is less than 180° (such as 68°), add 180° to it (68°+180°=248°) to find the back azimuth Place one of the back corners on the object you choose Set the back azimuth so it is on the indexing line Rotate the compass until the needle is in the indexing arrow The base plate's ruler will lead you to your location on the trail
If you are in a place that you see an easily recognizable feature (you must be 100% sure about it), you can find your location using a back azimuth (the angle between north/south and the imaginary line from your target object to you):
Triangulation
Triangulation is the advanced version of back azimuth as it is more accurate and promises a more precise pinpoint to your location. The process is simple and only adds a little more to the back azimuth:
Find 3 (or more) objects around, this time 95% certainty is enough, and get a back azimuth from each.
When marking them on the map, draw a line with a pencil along the base plate ruler.
Your location is the meeting point of all three (or more) lines.
Slope aspect
Find a slope near your location. Stand facing the slope so that you are 90° to the grid lines (you will need to use your imagination here). Get the azimuth of the slope. [pic 3] Find a slope in your grid square that matches that slope. [pic 2] If unsure, get another aspect to double-check. [pic 1]
Another method to find your location is to get a reading of slopes around you and use them to pinpoint your location. To do so you need to know roughly (the grid square) where you are.
Tools for navigation
Map cover – it can be as simple (and cheap) as a zip lock bag, but a map cover makes map reading in bad weather much easier.
String for you compass – useful to attach the compass so you won't lose it and as a much longer ruler when plotting a route on the map.
Pencil – if you plan on pre-setting a route use the pencil to mark it, including deviations and write the azimuth so you won't have to recalculate every time you change course or take a break.
Wrap up
When you navigate with a compass and map, having those two is obviously a must; but a handful of other things will help you with your navigation:
When learning to navigate with a compass and map the process of navigation seems big and daunting, but it is just a matter of practice. It is best to start small on trails you already know and practice as much as possible; get a map of your area and a compass and work on getting azimuths and pinpointing your location. Work on learning your pace and following an azimuth locally so when you are off the beaten track in the backcountry, it will come as a second nature to find your location and your destination.
Enjoy your navigation but do so safely, don't just pick up this guide and head off. Keep your head leveled and ego at home - don't bend the map and don't get lost!

Gravitational Waves Throw Light on Neutron Star Mergers
First gravitational wave detection of colliding neutron stars sent scientists racing to collect light from the event.
Yuen Yiu, Staff Writer
(Inside Science) -- This morning, scientists publicly announced the first observation of a cosmic event with both gravitational waves and light.
The discovery marks the capstone of a huge couple of weeks for the celebrated ripples in space-time. First, on Sept. 27, a three-pronged gravitational wave detection was announced jointly by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations, enabling astronomers to triangulate the signal's source for the first time. Then on Oct. 4, Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne were awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in physics for their work making gravitational wave observation possible.
Today's announcement adds a new dimension of excitement. The new observations, of merging neutron stars, are “more complete than for any previous event in astronomical history,” said Caltech astronomer Gregg Hallinan in a press statement.

A new page in astronomy
All four previously detected gravitational waves came from black hole mergers, which emit no light, despite the enormous amount of energy they expel. For neutron star mergers, it's a different story. The latest confirmed event, now known as GW170817, marked the death dance of a pair of neutron stars about 130 million light years away from Earth. The two spiraled toward each other before colliding in a spray of light.

What Are Neutron Stars? Neutron stars are the densest objects in our universe besides black holes -- a teaspoon of neutron star material contains a mass of around a billion tons. They are formed when giant stars at least ten times more massive than our sun collapse in a spectacular supernova. The collapse is so violent that protons and electrons melt into each other to form neutrons -- hence, the name, neutron star. NSF, LIGO, Sonoma State University, A. Simonnet
On Aug. 17, the detectors at LIGO and Virgo picked up a faint signal from a passing gravitational wave. Shortly afterwards, NASA's Fermi space telescope observed a short burst of gamma rays. After a quick analysis of the incoming gravitational waves revealed the source was likely a collision of neutron stars, the news was swiftly relayed to some 70 observatories around the world. Astronomers at the observatories pointed their telescopes toward the specified spot in the southern sky, and waited for the light show expected to arrive over the coming days and even weeks, as the succession of photons of different wavelengths produced over the course of the collision arrived at Earth.
“It was the most exciting day of my life,” said Mansi Kasliwal, a Caltech astrophysicist, and the principal investigator for GROWTH, the global relay network responsible for alerting and coordinating observatories around the world for an event like this one.
Within hours, optical photons were detected by a telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. Another hour later came the infrared photons, this time detected by the Gemini South telescope, also in Chile. Nine days later came the X-ray photons, detected by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory orbiting in space. Finally, 16 days after the gravitational wave detection, 27 giant, satellite dish-like radio telescopes operated by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in New Mexico detected radio photons from the colliding neutron stars.
The detection of this event with both gravitational waves and light is an example of what scientists call multi-messenger astronomy.
“Multi-messenger events are really the holy grail, with respect to understanding issues in astrophysics,” said Mike Guidry, an astrophysicist from the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.
“We thought that multi-messenger events were possible, but my guess was that it would take a while for us to get there. It looks like I stand corrected,” said Guidry. He is currently authoring a textbook on general relativity and noted that the news might force at least a partial rewrite.
But the discovery is much more than just the first ever multi-messenger event -- GW170817 has also shed light on the process that created almost one quarter of all the elements in our universe.
The birth of gold
One of the active debates among astronomers is the origin of gold. Astrophysicists believe that about half of all the elements heavier than iron, including gold, silver, platinum and uranium, are created by a mechanism known as the r-process. Short for rapid neutron capture process, the r-process requires an abundant supply of neutrons.
For decades, astronomers have theorized about astronomical events that would produce conditions ripe for the r-process to occur. The two prevailing contenders require neutron stars. One theory suggests that r-processes can occur during a supernova explosion when a neutron star is first formed, while another theory claims that the process can also occur when two neutron stars smash into each other, casting fragments of heavy elements such as gold, silver and uranium across the universe. According to Kasliwal, supernovas are relatively common and easy to observe relative to neutron star mergers, but almost none of the observed supernova fit with the first theory. Without a way to observe neutron star mergers, the astrophysicists were stuck.
But now, with the first ever detected neutron star merger, there are now observations that support the second theory. Astronomers have now seen “unequivocal evidence of a cosmic mine that is forging about 10,000 earth-masses of heavy elements, such as gold, platinum, and neodymium," said Kasliwal in a press release.
Finding evidence for the origins of gold is just one exciting aspect of the new observations. In addition to being the birthplace of gold, neutron stars, together with black holes, are also the graves of heavy stars. That's because for stars much more massive than our sun, their final fate is to become neutron stars or black holes. The GW170817 observation, which sheds light on many neutron star properties, will revolutionize the way astrophysicists observe and study stellar evolution, according to Guidry.
“This is at least as important as the original announcement of the discovery of gravitational waves,” said Guidry.
http://www.renegadetribune.com/flat-earth-nationalism/
Six months ago the “alternative media” was spammed with high quality videos, pictures, and other materials about “the flat earth.” It wasn't just some crank somewhere, more than one person spent quite a bit of time making very polished videos.
I'm sure there is/was a commercial motive behind some of it – the History Channel is full of “Ancient Mysteries” and “UFO Bigfoots” and “Secret Nazi Technology” and the like.
But alt-media forums like /r/conspiracy were flooded with this stuff, and many of the handles promoting it were the same people that promote 9/11 disinformation (Judith Woods, Dmitri Khasolov, etc.)
Renegade Tribune, home to John Friend, was pushing this stuff at the exact same time. Not just Shiksa Goddess posting a video or two. You had the admins of the site actually going into detailed arguments about how promoting “The Flat Earth” would help “fight White Genocide.”
No, I do not think our ancestors would care one bit that we choose to question “Science”, which is currently ruled by jews. — “renegade (Admin)”
It's always hard to discuss the Jewish question because there are always people “agreeing and amplifying.” “Oh, you say Jews run the media! Limited Hangout! Jews run 100% of the banks and ALL science as well! Science itself is Jewish!”
I dunno, seems pretty obvious to me. It's a basic tactic of disruption. According to Catherine Austin Fitts, these are “adult fairy tales” and they are put out by various agencies for a few reasons – to disrupt and discredit dissident media for one. The “Disclosure Project” about UFOs is being financed by Rockefeller money and serves the same sort of purpose.
There's a commercial agenda behind it too. If Playboy magazine was a CIA front, it certainly actually turned a profit as well.
Shiska Goddess may just be a crank, but the mods of Renegade Tribune, Kyle Peterson I guess, is obviously smart enough to know this is purposeful disinformation. So in my view it doesn't take a super-genius to figure out the motivation here. These are also the people exploiting wedge issues.
Classic technique.

ELKINS PARK, Pa. (AP) -- Bill Cosby was arrested and charged Wednesday with drugging and sexually assaulting a woman at his home 12 years ago - the first criminal case brought against the comedian out of the torrent of allegations that destroyed his good-guy image as America's Dad.
The case sets the stage for perhaps the biggest Hollywood celebrity trial of the mobile-news era and could send the 78-year-old Cosby to prison in the twilight of his life and pioneering career.
Prosecutors accused him of plying former Temple University employee Andrea Constand with pills and wine, then penetrating her with his fingers without her consent, while she was drifting in and out of consciousness, unable to resist or cry out.
She was "frozen, paralyzed, unable to move," Montgomery County District Attorney-elect Kevin Steele said. In court papers, prosecutors said the drugs were the cold medicine Benadryl or some other, unidentified substance. Steele noted that Cosby has admitted giving quaaludes to women he wanted to have sex with.
The TV star acknowledged under oath a decade ago that he had sexual contact with Constand but said it was consensual.
Bill Cosby's attorney Monique Pressley says the charge is unjustified and that the comedian will be exonerated following a vigorous defense.
Cosby had no comment on his way in and out of court as he was arraigned on a charge of aggravated indecent assault, punishable by five to 10 years behind bars and a $25,000 fine. He did not have to enter a plea and was allowed to remain free on $1 million bail for another hearing Jan. 14. © AP Photo/Matt Rourke Bill Cosby arrives at court to face a felony charge of aggravated indecent assault Wednesday, Dec. 30, 2015, in Elkins Park, Pa.
Guided by his lawyers, he walked slowly into the courtroom, using a cane and wearing a gray tweed hoodie sweater. He seemed to have trouble seeing the paperwork and finding the place to sign, and his lawyers helped him hold the pen. But he seemed at ease, laughing and chatting with his attorneys.
When the judge said, "Good luck, Mr. Cosby," he shouted: "Thank you!"
The decision to prosecute him came down just days before Pennsylvania's 12-year statute of limitations for bringing charges was set to run out.
The case represents an about-face by the district attorney's office, which under a previous DA declined to charge Cosby in 2005 when Constand first told police that the comic violated her by putting his hands down her pants at his home in the Philadelphia suburb of Cheltenham.
Prosecutors reopened the case over the summer as damaging testimony was unsealed in Constand's related civil lawsuit against Cosby and as dozens of other women came forward with similar accusations that made a mockery of his image as the wise and understanding Dr. Cliff Huxtable from TV's "The Cosby Show."
"Reopening this case was not a question. Rather, reopening this case was our duty as law enforcement officers," said Steele, a top deputy in the DA's office who will take over in January.
In court papers, prosecutors said there are probably other women who were similarly drugged and violated by Cosby. Steele urged them to come forward as well.
Constand, now 42, lives in Toronto and works as a massage therapist. Her attorney, Dolores Troiani, welcomed the charges.
"She feels that they believe her, and to any victim, that is foremost in your mind: Are people going to believe me," Troiani said. The attorney added: "Naturally it is troubling that it took until the eleventh hour for this day to arrive. She is hopeful that her patience has encouraged other victims to come forward."
The case adds to the towering list of legal problems facing the TV star, including defamation and sexual-abuse lawsuits filed in Massachusetts, Los Angeles and Pennsylvania.
A key question if the case goes to trial is whether the judge will allow supporting testimony from other accusers to show similar "bad acts," even though it is too late to bring charges in most if not all of those instances. The judge could decide such testimony would be unfair.
Cosby in 1965 became the first black actor to land a leading role in a network drama, "I Spy," and he went on to earn three straight Emmys. Over the next three decades, the Philadelphia-born comic created TV's animated "Fat Albert" and the top-rated "Cosby Show," the 1980s sitcom celebrated as groundbreaking television for its depiction of a warm and loving black family headed by two professionals, one a lawyer, the other a doctor.
He was a fatherly figure off camera as well, serving as a public moralist and public scold, urging young people to pull up their saggy pants and start acting responsibly.
Constand, who worked for the women's basketball team at Temple, where Cosby was a trustee and proud alumnus, said she was assaulted after going to his home in January 2004 for some career advice.
Then-District Attorney Bruce Castor declined to charge Cosby, saying at the time that the comedian and his accuser could be portrayed in "a less than flattering light." Constand eventually settled a lawsuit against Cosby in 2006 on confidential terms.
Her allegations and similar ones from other women in the years that followed did not receive wide attention at the time but exploded into view in late 2014, first online, then in the wider media, after comedian Hannibal Buress mocked the moralizing Cosby as a hypocrite and called him a rapist during a standup routine.
That opened the floodgates on even more allegations.
The women were mostly from the world of modeling, acting or other entertainment fields, and Cosby or his representatives denied their allegations, accusing some of them of trying to extract money from him or get ahead in show business.
Earlier this year, The Associated Press persuaded a judge to unseal documents from the Constand lawsuit, and they showed the long-married Cosby acknowledging a string of affairs and sexual encounters.
Cosby, a longtime resident of Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts, testified that he obtained quaaludes in the 1970s to give to women. He denied giving women drugs without their knowledge and said he had used the now-banned sedative "the same as a person would say, 'Have a drink.'"
In his deposition, Cosby said he gave Constand three half-pills of Benadryl for stress, telling her only that they were her "friends." He said he fondled Constand, taking her silence as a green light.
"I don't hear her say anything. And I don't feel her say anything. And so I continue and I go into the area that is somewhere between permission and rejection. I am not stopped," Cosby testified. He said Constand was not upset when she left.
Prosecutors said Cosby used wine and drugs to render her incapable of resistance after "the much younger, athletic" Constand blocked two previous sexual advances.
Constand's lawyer has said Constand is gay and was dating a woman around the time she met Cosby in the early 2000s. The AP generally does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they agree to have their names published, as Constand has done.
Cosby's fall has been especially painful to many blacks who regarded his commercial and cultural success with great pride.
"There is a fatal difference now between Cliff Huxtable and Bill Cosby that can never be overcome, because Cosby depended as a figure and an icon on the goodwill he established through his characters," said author and professor Michael Eric Dyson, who wrote a book on Cosby a decade ago.
"It does add a creepy subtext and a shadow of tremendous moral weight that will inevitably be brought up each time his name is evoked."
A legal disclaimer that links to an updated Privacy Policy from Canonical has been added to the Unity Dash in Ubuntu 12.10.
The policy details how personal data is used and what it's used for when ‘online results', such as the Shopping Lens, are enabled.
The disclaimer appears on the lower right-hand corner of the Dash, a prominent spot that is hard to miss.
Clicking on this link opens a local copy of Canonical's Privacy Policy for viewing: –
Although it looks pretty plain (nothing a bit of CSS won't sort out) the text is surprisingly easy to read (as Privacy Policies go). It's free of overly complex jargon, and easy to understand. It's also pretty short – which helps!
After the notice has been opened the link in the Dash changes from text reading ‘legal notice' to a small information icon:
These changes will be landing in Ubuntu 12.10 in the coming hour or so.
End of the Issue?
Will the addition of this legal notice mean the end of complaints about the shopping lens?
I'm certainly hoping so.
Most of the arguments against its inclusion have now been well voiced and subsequently, throughout the development of this feature, countered with remedies.
The lens can be switched off or removed; what data sent is now documented; and all transfers are now secure.
The four bottles on the left, above, are bottles of what an American would call Budweiser. And, if you're an American especially, you know it well, even if you don't drink it. The marketing and branding around the product permeate the cultural landscape, from the “This Bud's For You” and “King of Beers” taglines to the Clydesdales and the “Bud-Wize-Errr” burping frogs. And to drive home how American Budweiser is, AB InBev (its Belgian owner) is even temporarily changing the branding to say “America,” with much fanfare.
And yet, there's something amiss about the labels on those bottles of Budweiser — they don't actually say “Budweiser.” These bottles use the “Bud” nickname, instead.
But the bottle to the right? It clearly says “Budweiser,” albeit in a different font. If you look closely, you'll see the words “Czech Imported Lager” on the label, too — and the Czech Republic, if you look at a map, isn't part of America.
What's going on?
Let's start in the Czech city of České Budějovice, known as Budweis in German, and let's go back to the 1200s, when the area was part of the Kingdom of Bohemia. At the time, Budweis was one of the few places allowed to brew beer, and “beer from Budweis” — or, “Budweiser Bier” — became as well known as virtually anything in Bohemia could be. (For most of the latter part of the Bohemian era, German was the most common language in the area.) While the term “Budweiser Bier” fell into disuse over time, the tradition of brewing beer in Budweis persisted for generations and, for that matter, centuries. During a tour of European breweries in the 1870s, Anheuser-Busch patriarch Adolphus Busch was introduced to the beer made in the town — and he was impressed.
So in 1876, Anheuser-Busch (the predecessor to AB InBev) introduced to American a concoction inspired by what Mr. Busch discovered on his travels. This imitation lager was named “Budweiser” in honor of (or to free-ride on) the beer from Budweis and over time, Anheuser-Busch's “Budweiser” became a (very) well-known brand in its own right. There was only one problem — Anheuser-Busch never told the brewers of Budweis about the Americanized version. And in 1895, Czech brewers, independent of what was going on in St. Louis, created their own “Budweiser.”
Shortly thereafter, Budweiser (American) and Budweiser (Czech) learned about one another. And since then, the two beers have been at odds over the name. Both have filed lawsuits around the world, hoping to own the “Budweiser” name, and with the exception of a brief period in 1939, the two haven't been able to find much common ground at the negotiating table. Instead, the two have had to find a way to co-exist while not running afoul of each other's intellectual property rights — rights which vary based on where you are.
As a result, in some places, Budweiser isn't the Budweiser you're used to — although typically, the familiar beer is available under a different name. TIME sums up how it shakes out: “While there are exceptions, in much of Europe, [the Czech company] has the rights to the name Budweiser, forcing Anheuser-Busch InBev to use the name Bud. The reverse is true in much of the rest of the world. In the United States and Canada, the Czech beer is sold as Czechvar.” The image at the top? It's from a shelf in the European Union, per Wikipedia.
Bonus fact : Whether Budweiser is truly the King of Beers is something for the beer connoisseurs to decide, but let's give Bud credit — they're one of the kings of marketing. Unfortunately, they've overreached a few times. One example dates back to 1983, when Budweiser sponsored the creation of a video game called “Tapper.” In the game, players controlled a bartender who has to fill the beer mugs of demanding customers before the patron reaches the bartender (costing the player a life). Here's a screenshot of the game, and you can see the Budweiser logo displayed prominently. But not everyone was happy with the idea of a video game — meant (arguably) for kids — was promoting alcohol. As a result, the game's publisher, Bally Midway, created an alternative version: Root Beer Tapper. As seen here, the game is almost identical, but instead of a Budweiser logo, there's a “Root Beer Tapper” sign.

The Manchester United and England striker, who scored on his debut for both, inhabits a hyper-real world and waits on Roy Hodgson's next move
There is nothing in life more affirming than watching youngsters flourish, an intoxicating blend of nostalgia and hope, mortality and immortality. Generally, though, this comes with downsides such as disobedience and disrespect.
Sport, on the other hand, offers parenting without the tricky bits: the game is our birthright which, in our minds at least, makes its stars our kin and their success our success. Meanwhile, back in reality, they go about their business oblivious to our existence, rivalling us for neither love, nor time, nor money and existing solely to make us happy.
Even in that context, the emergence of Marcus Rashford has been a moving, transformative experience. Football and existing are two devilishly difficult pastimes, and yet Rashford has made a mockery of both without the slightest hint of entitlement, cynicism or conceit. Score with your first shot in both Europa and Premier League? Giggle at the coincidence! Devastate Arsenal? Go to school as usual to mess about with your mates!
In the hyper-real world which Rashford now inhabits, its gamut of emotions running directly from “gutted” to “buzzing”, his story is not only a pleasure but a lesson. In an age of irony and artifice, he is genuinely genuine, the only rash thing about him a name that has become a worldwide synonym for joy.
Euro 2016: Sturridge leaves it late as England come back to beat Wales Read more
This is unusual because to significant, glorious extent, football is defined by hatred, a vehicle for the harmless venting of dangerous impulses. But given the hatred that currently defines our planet, the opportunity to enjoy such benign beauty is not only a change but a relief.
Part of the fun of it all is that no one saw it coming. The majority of players who make it big early – Ryan Giggs, Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney – were identified as epochal talents from an early age. Rashford, on the other hand, was ignored through the winter as Manchester United struggled for strikers and goals, and as recently as February was not even first choice in the club's under-21 side.
Even when things started happening, it was easy to make excuses. His two debut goals were gimmes and came against Midtjylland; his next two, though slightly better, came against an Arsenal team ready to begin their annual implosion; and anyway, anyone knows what Federico Macheda's up to these days?
There followed a quieter period, before explosive finishes at Manchester City and West Ham made clear that he, and this, were something special. He went on to finish the season superbly, the only surprising aspect of his England debut that it took him a full three minutes to score; what, exactly, was he doing during the first two, the useless waster?
Of course, it will not always be like this, but the sheer breadth of his competency will support him when the initial rush slows. His remarkable speed and bizarre composure have been clear from the start, and since then he has revealed not just a football brain but a football soul, intellect and instinct in perfect harmony. He knows what to do and where to be; he makes things happen and twigs before others make them happen without him.
Millenial that he is, he can also do the fancy flicks and tricks that arouse the internet; mensch that he is, they are usually the best way of finding a team-mate; and we have yet to see his ability to shoot from outside the box, nor his capacity for improvement. As an article, he is far from finished; as a player, he is already complete.
So it was no surprise to see Roy Hodgson make room for him in his squad. Lacking a single elite player and with little quality in defence and on the wing, it made sense to back momentum and attacking options. Italy did similarly before the 2006 World Cup when Marcello Lippi went to Germany with six strikers; all six scored, and his team were the most surprising champions in a generation.
The genius, though, wasn't in the taking but the selecting; Lippi matched the right players to the right opponents, which is what Hodgson must now do. In England's first game, they needed a free-kick to score, then in an effort to see out their 1-0, replaced Raheem Sterling, their only fast runner, with James Milner. Immediately, this allowed Russia to commit men forward, no longer threatened by the prospect of a breakaway, and eventually the pressure told.
Against Wales, England faced another deep-lying defence, and were unable to service a weary Harry Kane. This time, Hodgson made two enterprising changes, Daniel Sturridge and Jamie Vardy helping facilitate an equaliser, before, after impetus faded, the introduction of Rashford helped shove them towards victory.
Which and how many of the four start against Slovakia is unlikely to matter much; even if England lose, they should still qualify for the knockout stages. But it is there that things will change: better teams mean greater pressure, so Kane's ability to hold and run with the ball will be handy; better teams also mean higher defensive lines, so the pace of Vardy and Sturridge will be handy.
Or Hodgson could find room in his side for a player who combines these virtues. Last picked needn't mean last resort.

It isn't his first OGN, but Jonathan Case has something special with his most recent book from Dark Horse The New Deal. Perhaps best known of late for having worked on Batman '66, his latest work is also a blast from the past, but not an era that most modern comic book readers would know except from history books. Taking place in 1936, during the era the book takes its name from, the plot follows along with a bellhop and maid working at the famous Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York. Theresa Harris and Frank O'Mallery are both looking to elevate their place in life, Theresa through acting and Frank anyway he can. When a wealthy socialite takes a liking to them, she provides them both with support and help, but a crime in the hotel threatens both Frank and Theresa's jobs and futures.
When speaking with Jonathan Case about the book, during his promotion of it at Rose City Comic-Con, his desire to do the book came from one thing: “I love old things.” A love of movies and history, plus the chance to play with racial issues, stereotypes, and history made it a project he really wanted to do. “In the end I got to do it because of all the ideas I pitched to Scott Allie this was the one he liked the most.” In addition to selling copies of the book early, Dark Horse made 250 limited edition prints that the creator signed at Rose City and his enthusiasm about the book showed in every fan he got to give a copy to.
The book has a wonderfully polished feel and with a blue-tone coloring job that gives the story an old school “black and white movie” vibe but feels warm and inviting. Case's art in particularly is strong and serves his story very well, but in particular in his facial expressions and the lively actions of his characters. Theresa in particular seems to want to jump off the page any moment with her energy, and Frank's subtle facial expressions serve to make his character have a unique voice that doesn't always involve him speaking.
The story is clearly a period piece but done in a way to not blow out of proportion the “history” of the story. The story and elements are very well crafted and could, with some changes, happen in any time period, but the story would lose its unique voice. Jonathan Case's choice to set it during the era of “the New Deal” in American history provides a background for our characters that provides more interesting facets to their personalities, Frank's gambling, an all-African American production of Macbeth by Orson Welles (a whole story about that play would be great to read), how Theresa is unapologetically discriminated against at work; these elements of Americana during “the New Deal” era enrich the story and really give it a very rich canvas.
Jonathan Case made it very clear when talking about the book that he really wanted to play with elements of race relations, cultural stereotypes, and searching for the American Dream with the characters in this book and he has done a great job. This graphic novel serves as an excellent example of what can be done with the medium in telling enjoyable layered stories. It is very much a rich read that everyone should take time to enjoy and hopefully Jonathan Case is hard at work on another graphic novel for Dark Horse.

The surprising results in the US presidential election create both concerns and new opportunities for Israel. The most tangible opportunity has to do with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but not necessarily in the manner t it was perceived and declared by the Israeli Right.
Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter
Since 1993, the American administration has supported the “two-state” solution. For those of us who have forgotten, it was supported both by Republican George W. Bush's administration and by the two Democratic administrations which preceded and succeeded it.

This solution is based on four assumptions. One, the solution to the conflict should be geographically restricted to the area between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. Two, the solution requires the establishment of a Palestinian state with full sovereignty. Three, the border between Israel and Palestine should be based on the 1967 lines. Four, the West Bank and Gaza must constitute a single diplomatic entity.
These four assumptions create very limited room for negotiations. The Clinton Parameters (Bill's, not Hillary's), as they were presented in late 2000, are the practical translation of these assumptions. Anyone who tries in the future to return to negotiations based on these parameters will reach a similar to identical plan.
But who says these assumptions are four cornerstones we cannot do without? If we free ourselves from them and try to look into the entire range of possible solutions, we will find that some of the other solutions have an outstanding advantage over the only known solution.
Among the other solutions, we can talk about a “regional solution” with land swaps between four players—Egypt, Jordan, Israel and Palestine—or about the creation of a federation between Jordan and the West Bank, or about a functional and not necessarily territorial division between us and the Palestinians. And yes, even Bayit Yehudi leader Naftali Bennett's plan to annex C Area and establish Palestinian autonomy in the rest of the area.
We should remember that until 1992, both the Likud and the Labor Party completely ruled out the “two-state” idea. In the past 24 years, a different plan could not even be considered, as three American presidents and six American secretaries of state rushed to declare shortly after taking office that they were committed to the “two-state” solution. US President-elect Donald Trump will likely not make such a declaration, and neither will the person he selects as his secretary of state.
The Israeli government has two options: It can either determine that there is no solution to the conflict and that it should therefore continue “managing” it, or it could launch a dialogue with the new administration which would examine the entire range of possibilities, without being committed to the four aforementioned assumptions.
In the short run, the first approach may have an advantage, as the Trump administration won't pressure Israel to reach an agreement and will likely be more lenient regarding the settlements.
In the long run, this approach could be revealed as a mistake. First of all, if and when the Palestinian side realizes that there is no diplomatic hope of any kind, it will strengthen both Hamas in the West Bank and other radical elements. From there, the road to a third intifada could be short. Second, and more importantly, the Trump administration could actually be attentive to other and better solutions. If we waste the next four years, we may regret it in the future.
Today the FCC voted to apply the Title II regulations of the Telecommunications Act to broadband internet services. The commission argues that it has updated the rules for our modern age, but opponents of the plan have countered that it relies on antiquated language meant for older technologies. Verizon, responding to the vote on its public policy blog, decided to take this argument to its logical extreme.
"FCC's ‘Throwback Thursday' Move Imposes 1930s Rules on the Internet" reads the headline to a blog post written entirely in morse code. If you don't have access to a telegraph operator, Verizon has also provided a handy link to a PDF, written in smudged ink by typewriter, because these new rules are based on outdated technology. Get it?
Ironically, Verizon has described itself as a Title II common carrier
The actual content of the post is doomsaying about the impact the new rules will likely have. "Today's decision by the FCC to encumber broadband Internet services with badly antiquated regulations is a radical step that presages a time of uncertainty for consumers, innovators, and investors."
It's particularly ironic that Verizon is trying to roast the FCC for relying on Title II. After all, as first reported by The Verge, Verizon described itself as a Title II common carrier when it was trying to gain rights of way, pole access, and taxpayer subsidies to build out its FiOS fiber optic internet service in New Jersey.
Apple is close to signing a final agreement with LG Display and Samsung to provide OLED screens for next-generation iPhones, according to a new report from ET News [ Google Translate ] (via Reuters ). The OLED panels are rumored to be included with iPhones starting in 2018.The two Korean companies plan to spend around $12.8 billion (15 trillion won) combined to build up OLED production capacity over the next two to three years. ET News also adds that Apple is likely to provide some funding to both LG and Samsung to help with their investments. Additionally, LG plans on converting existing LCD production lines into OLED production lines to reduce costs. Samsung, on the other hand, will produce 30 percent fewer orders than LG.Last month, Nikkei reported that Apple plans to switch iPhones over to OLED displays starting in 2018, with both LG and Samsung sharing a large portion of OLED panel production. LG was already planning capacity upgrades for high-volume OLED screen production that would be required for iPhone demand. Earlier this month, it was reported that Japan Display was also planning mass production of OLED displays for iPhones starting in 2018.OLED displays can provide sharper images and brighter colors compared to LCD displays. However, OLED displays tend to have shorter lifespans and come with higher manufacturing costs. Apple has been reportedly "consulting with display makers" on how to minimize potential drawbacks.

Amid the standoff between Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy and the federal government, reports are growing that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's little-known ties to a Chinese solar energy giant could have played a role.
Reid, D-Nev., and his oldest son, Rory, a former chairman of the Clark County, Nev., County Commission, were both deeply involved in a plan by ENN Energy Group to build a huge solar farm in southern Nevada, according to a Reuters report from August 2012.
Land the Bundy family has been using for cattle ranching was getting in the way of that project, according to documents formerly posted on the Bureau of Land Management's government website but since removed, according to Infowars.
It has also been reported that this particular deal is no longer on the table, but was part of the story in 2012.
The acting director of the Bureau of Land Management is Neil Kornze, a former senior policy advisor for Reid.
Here is a screenshot of one crucial document from Google's cache.
The most interesting line might be:
“Non-Governmental Organizations have expressed concern that the regional mitigation strategy for the Dry Lake Solar Energy Zone utilizes Gold Butte as the location for offsite mitigation for impacts from solar development, and that those restoration activities are not durable with the presence of trespass cattle.”
The federal government's story so far is that the whole showdown was necessary for the protection of gopher tortoises.
Here's how The Blaze's Dana Loesch puts it in “The Real Story of the Bundy Ranch”:
BLM has proven that they've a situational concern for the desert tortoise as they've had no problem waiving their rules concerning wind or solar power development. Clearly these developments have vastly affected a tortoise habitat more than a century-old, quasi-homesteading grazing area. If only Clive Bundy were a big Reid donor.
From the document purged from the BLM website, it's clear there were more than tortoises at stake.
There was a $5 billion foreign energy project in the works, with Reid and his son directly involved.
And there was an American citizen and cattle rancher standing in the way.
Now, federal agents armed with guns and the full power of the federal government have engaged.
What could go wrong?
UPDATE: This story has been updated to reflect that the ENN Energy Group proposal is no longer on the table.
Sorry, Ms. Lerner, Trey Gowdy nailed it:

Two seniors from NYU Abu Dhabi (NYUAD), Maitha Salem AlMemari (UAE) and Chaimaa Fadil (Morocco) have been selected as 2018 UAE Rhodes Scholars. The prestigious international award allows exceptional students to pursue two to three years of postgraduate studies at the University of Oxford in England.
AlMemari, from the UAE, is majoring in Social Research and Public Policy with a minor in Legal Studies and Political Science. She is currently working on her senior Capstone Project, which aims to understand what different factors influence Emirati youth when it comes to their academic decisions. In 2015, she spoke at TEDxNYUAD where she addressed stereotypes about Emiratis and specifically misconceptions about the Abaya, a traditional Emirati female clothing. As a member of the RoadWatch team, she won the HE Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Best mGovernment Service Award, UAE University category, at the World Government Summit in 2016. AlMemari also volunteers to teach Abu Dhabi high school students about the power of female leadership as part of the Girls' Education Network.
AlMemari said: "I am beyond ecstatic and humbled to be chosen to join the community of Rhodes Scholars at the University of Oxford. I am extremely grateful for my family, friends, and others who have supported and encouraged me to always challenge myself and achieve the best. It is an honor to represent my country and NYU Abu Dhabi next October and I hope to continue to make everyone proud. At Oxford, I intend to continue to study Public Policy and reflect on ways we can reform education so that we empower the youth through knowledge and character development. I am so excited, and thanks to NYU Abu Dhabi, for the adventure that awaits me at Oxford.”
Fadil, from Morocco, is majoring in Biology with a split concentration in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. As a result of spending eight months in New York as part of the Desplan laboratory, one of the leading labs in the field of neurodevelopmental biology, her Capstone Project aims at characterizing the cellular diversity within the brains of Drosophila, commonly known as fruit flies. She hopes to invest her future career in genomic research, which can be used to inform more personalized approaches of clinical care. Fadil also volunteered with children at the Abu Dhabi Science Festival for the past three years, and works with children with special needs in her spare time. At Oxford, she hopes to pursue a MSc in Mathematical Sciences and Global Health Science and Epidemiology.
Fadil said: “The interesting legacy of the Rhodes Scholarship is a testament to the idea that the world is ultimately what we decide to make of the resources at hand. As much as this scholarship is an award, it is also a responsibility for me. History has its eyes on us, and I hope we will be up to the task. ”
Established in 1902 by the will of the late British businessman Cecil Rhodes, the Rhodes Scholarship is one of the world's oldest and most recognizable awards for international fellowship and academic study. Applicants are selected in a two-stage process that includes endorsement by their college or university, followed by in-person interviews.
NYU Abu Dhabi has produced 10 Rhodes Scholars in just five years, the highest number of Rhodes Scholars per student of any university in the world.
Fuck for the Heir Puppy Bear! (Russian: Ебись за наследника Медвежонка, tr. Yebis' za naslednika Medvezhonka) was political-artistic performance staged by Russian performance group Voina at the Timiryazev State Biological Museum in Moscow in February 2008.
Performance [ edit ]
On February 23, as a prelude to the event, members of Voina showed up at a meeting of the Young Guard of United Russia and displayed a white banner with the slogan "Fuck for the Heir Puppy Bear".[1]
On February 28, almost twenty people assembled in the Moscow Biological Museum. Five couples undressed in the museum hall "Metabolism and Energy of Organisms", and engaged in sexual intercourse[2] next to a glass taxidermy display case which contained a stuffed bear.[3] Participants included Vera Kondakova (from Ukraine), Alexandre Karpenko (from Ukraine), as well as other well known Voina members.
The performance was a protest of the election of Dmitry Medvedev in the 2008 Russian presidential election. It took place in front of a black flag with a slogan reading: "Fuck for the heir Puppy Bear!".[3] The title "Puppy Bear" is a play on words referring to Medvedev, whose last name derives from the Russian word medved, "bear".
The Voina's performance was photographed and videotaped by several spectators invited by the group. It was also described and photographically illustrated online, by Russian lexicographer and blogger Alexei Plutser-Sarno, who himself participated in the action.[4] Photos of the performance were also published by blogger adolfych.[5] Following these blog reports, the action was covered by the media and met with mostly conservative responses in Russian society.
On March 3, Voina reappeared with the same slogan and marched with the banner "I fuck the heir Puppy Bear" at the Dissenters March in St. Petersburg.[6]
Performance goals [ edit ]
The performance was announced as a ritual for the bear totem. Plucer-Sarno explained the reason for the action was "We do not have a goal to necessarily be radical instigators. We have a goal to be honest artists and tell what we think. We think that the government fucks the people, and the people like this. This is why the action 'Fuck for the heir Puppy Bear' was born".[7] He also said in the same interview that "This is a portrait of pre-election Russia: everybody fucks each other, and the puppy bear looks at that with an unconcealed scorn".
Plucer-Sarno published in his blog a commentary by artist Maria Perchikhina that described the performance as an "act of subversive affirmation".[8] According to this opinion, the stuffed bear symbolizes the Russian political system, termed "imitation democracy" by Dmitry Furman, and turns into the figure of the "chosen chief bear". The goal of the action then, following the analogy of archaic fertility rituals, is birth assistance for the new political system. The ideas of fertility and reproduction along with the national idea form the core of the new political system. The single transgressive feature in the performance was the publicity of sexual activity. Perchikhina interpreted that transgressive feature as subversive affirmation, in other words, a resistance to the system by outperforming it (similar to "trying to be a better catholic than the Pope"). She also quoted an article by Inke Arns and Sylvia Sasse where the principle of subversive affirmation was explained.[9]
Political science expert Ilya Prokudin commented that the action was clearly political: "The action in the Zoological museum had a political character. It was dedicated to the newly baked (we should not call him newly elected, who elected him?) puppy president, Medvedev, and mocked one of the 'national projects' curated by him, namely 'on the increase in birth rate'. For the least apprehensive, even a pregnant woman ('Nadezhda Tolokonnikova')[10] was part of the scene.
Response to performance [ edit ]
Faculty of Philosophy [ edit ]
One of the performers in phone interview with internet news agency Lenta.ru said that a student was expelled from the Faculty of Philosophy of MSU for participating in the action. However, the Dean of the Faculty, V.V. Mironov, stated that two or three students had been expelled long before the performance for poor grades.[11] Mironov condemned such performances and claimed that the majority of MSU students share his negative opinion.[12]
An unnamed organization gathered a collection of signatures under a document that condemned the performance. However, an alternative group collected signatures in favor of the performance.[citation needed]
Media response [ edit ]
Press and internet [ edit ]
Generally negative opinions of "Fuck for the heir Puppy Bear!" were published by the media. A number of publications focused on the amoral behavior of the performers. Newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda commented: "They are not unrecognized geniuses. They are losers and poseurs acting on the principle: 'come, trash the place, go away'. For the PR, they would dance on a grave, and even take off their panties in public. And they do not care that after such actions innocent people suffer - metro employees, museum keepers. These actions of urban psychos stink very badly."[13]
Mikhail Zhukhov, a lawyer from the attorney's collegium "Justice" commented that the performers' actions contained elements of crime described in Article 213, "Hooliganism", of Russian Criminal Code: "The action of the participants severely violated social order. Taking into account the place and the fact that people with photo-cameras and video-cameras were invited, a conclusion can be made about the existence or premeditation. All of this was done by a group of people by a prior arrangement. The participants might face harsh consequences - part 2 of article 213 of Russian Criminal Code makes a provision for a prison sentence for up to seven years. Museum staff should write a report to the Internal Affairs Department".[13]
A representative of the foundation for effective politics, Pavel Danilin, called the performers pornographers and jerks and claimed that they had put shame on the Faculty and the University.[citation needed]
Radio and television [ edit ]
Russian poet Dmitry Volchek, who participated along with Alexei Plucer-Sarno in the Radio Liberty program devoted to the performance, claimed that the action had not been radical enough. He had also commented that the essence of conceptual art is in targeting the most vulnerable spot in the subconsciousness. In Volchek's opinion, that spot was accidentally hit by the action, making the stroke so painful.
Television covered the performance in several programs that described Voina's activities.
Videos of the action and of its media coverage can be found on the Internet.

The integrated bridge management system (IBMS), when fully operational, would become the world's largest such system, a top Road Transport and Highways official said.
Germany has done the digital mapping of its 46,645 bridges.
So far the IBMS has mapped 50,000 such bridges and culverts out of about 1.5 lakh in the country, he said.
The system which is an initiative under "Make in India" drive will have the minutest details of bridges and culverts and would address all safety and security concerns.
"The three-year project is being implemented in 18 packages and will cost initially Rs 300 crore," the official said.
IDEC Engineers have been appointed as project consultant for it and the system will have data like national identity number, longitude and latitude details, classifications and socio economic details of the area among others.
The need for this system was triggered as the country did not have any such data while over dimensional vehicles of that of companies like BHEL had to shell out as high as Rs 50 lakh fee to get the data whether the bridge was compatible for its machines or not while crossing it, the official said.
Giving a jolt to the Congress, the BJP has won 34 out of 46 seats in by-polls to various local bodies of the state.
Gujarat State Election Commission declared the results here today.
Welcoming the by-poll results, Gujarat state BJP spokesperson I K Jadeja said BJP has snatched many seats from Congress.
"Out of four district panchayat seats, three were held by the Congress earlier. Thus, we have made a clean sweep by winning all the four seats. In addition, we won Shahpur taluka panchayat seat, which was held by Congress for almost two decades. It shows that people have full trust in BJP-led Gujarat state government," Jadeja said.
Apart from winning all the four seats of various district panchayats, the BJP also retained the Kankaria ward seat of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation.
In total, 47 seats fell vacant for various reasons. Out of these, 46 went for polls on October 12, while no one filed their candidature for a taluka panchayat seat in Banaskantha.
These 46 seats include 13 seats of 11 municipalities, four of district panchayat, 1 of municipal corporation and 28 seats of taluka panchayats.
As per final figures, BJP won seven seats, while the Congress won 6 seats of 11 different municipalities. BJP made a clean sweep by winning all four district panchayat and one municipal corporation seat.
Out of 28 taluka panchayat seats, BJP won 22 seats while the Congress managed to win merely six seats.
said Howard's 'egregious' behavior did not rise to level of sex crime
Spared: John R.K. Howard, 19, has pleaded guilty to felony injury to a child in connection to an Idaho high school locker room attack in which he kicked a coat hanger into a teammate's rectum
A white Idaho high school football player who was accused of raping a mentally disabled black teammate with a coat hanger in a brutal locker room attack has pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and will avoid jail time.
John R.K. Howard, 19, of Keller, Texas, was originally charged with forcible sexual penetration by a foreign object after prosecutors said he kicked a coat hanger into the victim's rectum during the October 23, 2015, incident at Dietrich High School involving three male students.
But during a hearing on Friday, Deputy Attorney General Casey Hemmers said he didn't believe it was appropriate for the teenage boy to suffer the consequences of a sex offender, and so amended the charge to felony injury to a child, reported the Twin Falls Times-News via Idaho Statesman.
According to the paper, Howard submitted a modified guilty plea, in which he acknowledged he would be found guilty in a trial but maintained his innocence.
Hemmers described Howard's behavior towards the victim as ‘egregious' and said that it caused the other teenager a lot of suffering, but maintained that it did not constitute a sex crime.
The prosecutor also contended that the attack on the black teen by Howard and two other students was not racially motivated, reported MagicValley.com.
'This was more of a vulnerable-victim motivated crime,' Hemmers told the court. 'I think it probably would have happened to anybody that was in the same kind of circumstances and mental state as the victim here.'
Howard's attorney, Brad Calbo, stressed that at no time was the victim pinned down, raped or subjected to forcible penetration.

When Howard is sentenced on February 24, he will be looking at two to three years of probation and about 300 hours of community service.
If Howard successfully completes probation, he could have his conviction dismissed.
If the Texas teen violates the conditions of his release, or commits new crimes, he could face up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $50,000.
During Friday's hearing, it emerged that one of Howard's alleged accomplices, 17-year-old Tanner Ward, has pleaded guilty to an amended charge in juvenile court.
Attorney R. Keith Roark, who represents the victim of the attack and his family, said on Monday his clients were outraged by the outcome of the case against John Howard.
'It's absolutely preposterous that this kid should walk away with apparently no punishment whatsoever,' Roark told The Washington Post. 'Everyone is more concerned with these young sociopaths than the victim of their violence.'

The victim's family filed a $10million lawsuit in civil court in May accusing the Dietrich School District of ignoring their warnings about threats, incessant taunts and racially-charged name-calling their children had endured prior to the coat hanger incident.
The black teen was adopted by a white couple after being exposed to drugs and alcohol in the womb. He has been diagnosed with disorganized schizophrenia.
The teen't parents have 20 adopted children and five biological children.
The victim's family filed a $10million lawsuit in civil court in May accusing the Dietrich School District of ignoring their warnings about racial threats
The complaint, which continues to make its way through the court system, alleged that the mentally disabled black student was called a 'n*****', a 'chicken eater', 'Kool-Aid' and 'watermelon', as well as a litany of other racial slurs by his teammates.
He also claimed in court filings that teammates would 'hump' him and simulate anal sex by jumping on him from behind during football practice.
The teammates were also alleged to have stripped the teenager naked on a bus and taken photographs of him exposed body.
He was also allegedly forced to sing a Ku Klux Klan song called Notorious KKK, which John Howard learned when he lived in Texas, as the other players displayed a Confederate flag.
After eight winless A-League matches this season, Adelaide United were dead last.
Under new coach, Spaniard Guillermo Amor, their best results were three draws. Crowds dropped and fans grew restless.
Things got so bad that one supporter decided enough was enough. He advertised two season tickets for the remaining home matches on Gumtree – for just $50.
How things have changed.
• Willett wins Masters after Spieth collapses
• This was the moment no footy fan wanted to see
• NRL player's son caught under buggy after game
United eventually got to grips with Amor's style and, boasting the league's best defence, embarked on a club-record 14-match unbeaten run.
They stuttered against Melbourne City in March but used it as motivation, closing the regular season with three straight wins, including a 2-0 away victory over the Victorian side on Friday.
That, and Brisbane Roar's failure to beat Melbourne Victory on Saturday, saw United finish the regular season on top of the table and win the A-League's Premiers' Plate.
So, as the finals start this weekend, United will have their feet up, preparing for a home semi-final in which a win would come with an appearance in the competition decider.
Adelaide and Australia defender Tarek Elrich said he used the disparaging ad as personal motivation.
“I remember receiving a link from Gumtree,” Elrich said.
“Someone was selling their two season passes for $50 saying they were ‘sick of watching a bunch of flops'.
“I didn't want to show the boys. It was more something for me … it was just a hard place.”
Elrich said he understood the fans' frustrations, as it was a very difficult time for the players as well. Despite the horrendous start to the season, belief remained high.
“It just shows when you stick to a goal and believe in each other, anything is possible,” he said.
As for the Gumtree ad, he said a more optimistic fan would have got a bargain.
“I guarantee those tickets are worth a lot more than the $50 now.”
‘We deserve this title'
While the silverware is Adelaide's first in the league in a decade, Amor is no stranger to success.
The 48-year-old was a superb player for both Barcelona and Spain – so much so that he is a rock star in the Catalan city.
He played 550 matches in all competitions for the European giants, scoring 89 goals from midfield and winning a swag of trophies, and he worked for Barcelona as head of youth football and technical director once his playing days were done.
Amor then arrived in Australia to assist fellow Spaniard, and ex-Reds coach, Josep Gombau in 2014.
Gombau's departure paved the way for Amor's appointment and he hopes this will be first of many trophies he wins as a manager.
“This is a fantastic achievement for our team and for our club,” Amor said.
“We deserve this title because our team has worked very hard all season.
“Even when things were not going so good, we always had belief in one another and in the football we were playing.
“I know how much my team deserves this Championship, and, as a group, we will do everything we can to make sure we win this title for the club and the people of Adelaide.”
Adelaide have never won the A-League grand final, losing twice to Melbourne Victory.
But they have never been better placed.
Bowman on Crawford: ‘He doesn't get the credit he deserves'
A little more than a week ago, ESPN analyst Barry Melrose called Corey Crawford the Blackhawks' “Achilles' heel.” That night, Crawford shut out the Minnesota Wild. Yahoo on Thursday said it wasn't “sold” on Crawford, but that he's “just good enough to win.” Two hours later, that same site wrote about what a stabilizing force Frederik Andersen has been for Anaheim.
Radio and TV pundits across North America routinely question Crawford's ability. Opposing fans deride him as a Chris Osgood type, a system goalie, the lucky beneficiary of a great team in front of him (Osgood, by the way, has his name on the Stanley Cup three times).
Even Hawks fans waver on the guy, flip-flopping like politicians after each win, each loss.
Crawford clearly doesn't care. It's one of his strengths, actually, his mental toughness and his ability to block out all the noise. But the Hawks don't understand it.
“He doesn't get the credit he deserves,” Hawks general manager Stan Bowman told the Sun-Times. “I don't know why that is. We talk about it internally; I'm not sure how that happens. I'm not part of the general public, but when you're trying to anoint who's a top-tier goaltender, this is a results-oriented business. And when you look at the results, there's Corey with a very impressive resume.”
It was Crawford who backstopped the Hawks to the Stanley Cup in 2013, and even Patrick Kane said that he probably should have won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP. Those who covered all four rounds voted Crawford; the national media that descended for the final two rounds voted Kane (who, to be fair, was brilliant in those two rounds).
And it was Crawford who stole the second-round series against Minnesota last spring. But a subpar effort in the Western Conference final against Los Angeles (he gave up 27 goals in seven games) fueled the doubts further. The Kings' Jonathan Quick, it should be noted, was largely spared from such criticism despite giving up 13 goals in the final three games of the series. Both goalies had one Stanley Cup to their names at that point.
Even after arguably his best full season in the NHL, Crawford's disastrous first round against Nashville this spring brought out more skeptics. He was yanked from Game 1 after giving up three goals in the first period behind a lifeless defense, then gave up six more in Game 2. He didn't return until midway through the first period of Game 6, and hasn't lost since. In fact, he was so good against Minnesota in a four-game sweep, a defeated Wild coach Mike Yeo compared him with Patrick Roy and Martin Brodeur.
Crawford's confidence has been tested repeatedly, and he's passed every time. He bounced back from a first-round loss to Phoenix in 2012, he bounced back from the Kings series last year, he bounced back from the Nashville series this year.
“I think you learn that,” Crawford said. “You go through the same things and it's either something that'll bring you down or make you stronger. I'm pretty sure every player goes through stuff like that. It defines how you become as a player.”
Would it be better if Crawford didn't have stretches from which he needed to bounce back? Of course. But perfection is unreasonable. Correction isn't. That's why Joel Quenneville said he never hesitated to pull Crawford when things were going poorly — because he knew the goalie was tough enough to handle it, and to be back at the top of his game when the time came.
“Part of being a goalie is moving forward, fighting through it and finding the puck the next time you get the opportunity to do so,” Quenneville said. “There's always a lot of scrutiny on goaltenders, the bounce-back factor — whether it was a tough game or a tough goal, you're always getting monitored. I think that's all part of the job description, trying to keep an even keel and being positive going forward, and fighting through any adversity you're dealing with. Corey's done a good job.”
As well as Crawford played against Minnesota and down the stretch during Kane's injury absence, Bowman was most impressed by how Crawford handled his brief demotion to the backup role behind Scott Darling. And while some knee-jerk pundits and fans were using the misstep as a call for Crawford to be traded this summer — moving his $6-million contract would significantly ease the Hawks' salary-cap issues — Bowman said that's not something he's even considering.
“No, I think when you get a goalie like Corey, who's won a Stanley Cup, you feel very fortunate,” Bowman said. “He's been excellent. You just watch the way he handled everything. Even when he wasn't in there, he was super positive and supportive of Scott. We're very lucky and very happy to have Corey.”
So while few seem to believe in Crawford outside the Hawks' dressing room, everyone does inside of it.
“We all believe in Crow; we know he's a great goaltender,” Kane said. “We have all the confidence in the world in him.”

Patidars celebrated the routing of BJP in the Bihar assembly elections Sunday and their leaders vowed to repeat the same in the upcoming elections of local bodies in Gujarat. Firecrackers were burst at a number of places in the state and the leaders of Patidar reservation said that everything would be done to defeat the BJP candidates in the local polls scheduled on November 22 and 29.

Varun Patel, chief spokesperson of Sardar Patel Group (SPG) which started the agitation, said that the celebration took place at various places in Mehsana, Vijapur, Surat, Unjha, Modhera, Visnagar, Mandal etc..
[related-post]
In Ahmedabad, he added, the Patidar community celebrated BJP routing in areas like Bopal, Vastral, Nikol, Ghatlodia and Akhbarnagar.
At one such celebration in Bopal, convener of Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) Atul Patel said that BJP had got a strong echo in Bihar of what they did to Patidars in Gujarat.
“They will realise as to what happens when they commit atrocity on Patidars,” Atul said.
He added that all the Patidar leaders associated with the reservation stir have decided to do whatever was required to defeat a BJP candidate in the local body elections even if the candidate was a Patidar.
“Out of her arrogance and ego, Anandiben Patel (Chief Minister) refused to accept our memorandum during the rally. That is why Patels are very angry with her. Now, to make sure that martyrdom of nine Patels does not go in vain, we have decided to reply through ballot in response to their bullets fired on us,” he said.
Varun said, “Patidars would not go for NOTA. They will vote for the strongest candidate against the BJP candidate in the upcoming polls.”

On the Bihar results, Varun said, “Amit Shah ji knew that Gujarat would burst crackers after Bhartiya Janata Party's (BJP) defeat in Bihar and therefore, he made an unsuccessful attempt to stop us from bursting crackers by saying that at BJP's defeat crackers would be burst in Pakistan.”

Almost immediately after watching the RWBY season 3 finale, I stumbled upon RWBY: Grimm Eclipse, currently in early access on Steam. Thinking that a good old fashioned beat-em-up might help to fix some of the shattered pieces of my soul that the finale left behind, I decided to give it a try.
For those of you not familiar with RWBY (that's pronounced “ruby”), it's an animated series wherein superpowered men and women called Hunters and Huntresses battle against terrorists, criminals, and supernatural creatures called the Grimm. It's known for having strong and compelling characters, insanely over-the-top action, and a tone that covers the full range from lighthearted silliness to utter tragedy.
Ruby Rose, the leader of Team RWBY, wields the Crescent Rose: A deadly scythe with a rifle built into it. Because reasons.
First of all, RWBY: Grimm Eclipse appears to be very early access at the moment. It's the framework for what could become a solid game, but there's still a lot missing. That said, let's take a look at what it already has to offer, with an eye on what is to come.
The Good:
RWBY: Grimm Eclipse is a cooperative brawler along the lines of Marvel: Ultimate Alliance. Up to four players can select their personal favorite member of Team RWBY and go into battle against swarms of Grimm. Aside from some framerate issues at higher settings, the combat is smooth and intuitive enough that even first time players can experience the joy punching Grimm using gloves with shotguns in them.
RWBY Preview 3.jpg Crazy weapons, lots of explosions, and way too many Grimm. It's exactly what you'd want from a RWBY game.
Each character has a few options for leveling up as they progress. I've only played as Yang so far, and her powers and abilities are certainly fitting for the character. Yang's special ability in the show is to become stronger the more damage she takes (sort of like the Hulk, but not nearly as overpowered). In Grimm Eclipse, she has an ability that replenishes her special attacks when she takes a certain amount of damage, as well as a lot of self-healing powers to keep her in the fight.
As an official RoosterTeeth game, Grimm Eclipse is being worked on by many of the same people who handle RWBY, including the voice actors, and will be considered canon to the series.
The Iffy:
As I said, Grimm Eclipse is still in the early stages of early access. It's far from finished and is definitely rough around the edges.The framerate issues really hurt unless you're playing on Potato quality (technical term), and the fact that the Grimm aren't always quite where they seem to be. Then there's the fact that so far the missions mostly consist of “go to place, protect thing from X waves of Grimm, go to next place.” It's honestly a bit dull, and while RWBY is many things—silly, weird, sometimes a bit uncomfortable—”dull” is not a word that should ever apply to it.
Duking it out with a Clockwork Orange cosplayer; just a day in the life of a hunter.
The Exciting:
Based on RoosterTeeth's most recent announcement regarding Grimm Eclipse, it seems like many of these issues are already being addressed. Framerate issues and general performance are listed as priorities in all of their announcements, so hopefully we will see this issue cleared up soon. Combat is also being revamped with the addition of heavy attacks and counters, as well as new enemy attacks. Hopefully each new addition will take us closer to the blazing fast Devil May Cry-esque action that is the hallmark of this series.
Most exciting for me is the announcement of new campaigns being released in the coming months, with the promise of new missions, new enemies, and new lore for the series. This is where Grimm Eclipse really has a chance to shine, and where I hope to see my biggest complaints addressed. There's a solid—if not exceptional—framework in place for the gameplay, but this game could live or die based on the story and the missions they come up with for it.
The Conclusion:
I really like what's already in place, and I'm looking forward to seeing where Grimm Eclipse goes from here. I'm a big fan of RWBY, and I very much want to see this game achieve the same kind of over-the-top excitement and action that drives the series so well. Look forward to a follow-up article once some of these updates are in place, when I can get a better sense of what the finished product will be like.

When Erin McLeod suffered a knee injury last March that threatened her career, the goalkeeper vowed she would get back on the soccer field. Canada's former No. 1 keeper, who is a national team coach John Herdman considered the best in the world, is making good on that vow.
Erin McLeod won a bronze medal with Canada at the London Olympics and helped the team qualify for Rio last year before suffering a knee injury. ( JONATHAN HAYWARD / The Canadian Press )
McLeod announced Friday that she has been cleared to practise with her Swedish club, FC Rosengard. The Alberta native shared the news on her website The Motive Nation. “I got off the phone with my physiotherapist today with tears coming down my face. Right away (my wife and teammate Ella Masar) asked me what was wrong. I said, ‘Nothing. I can start training with the team,' ” McLeod wrote. McLeod tore her anterior cruciate ligament, for a third time, in a Champions League match with Rosengard last year. The injury happened weeks after she helped Canada qualify for the Rio Olympics while playing with a persistent bone bruise. The Canadian team went on to win bronze at the Summer Games, without McLeod.

The goalkeeper said last April it could take between one and two years to come back from her surgery and there was no guarantee she would ever get back to professional form. She wrote on Friday that she “questioned everything” following the injury. She was told the best thing to do was to stop playing, but she knew in her mind and heart she wasn't ready to give up on the game. “I have never fought so hard for a chance in my life. Doubt has danced in my mind every day, but there has always been this quiet voice telling me everything was going to work out,” she wrote. McLeod said her cheeks were sore from smiling this week. “In a month I might be complaining about training or be upset about some mistake I made, or I might be spending too much time comparing myself to another keeper, but for now, all I know is that I worked for this moment, and I'm enjoying it.”
While the 33-year-old is unlikely to jump back into her role as Canada's starting keeper any time soon, her healthy return would undoubtedly be welcomed by Herdman and company. McLeod, who made her debut with the national team as a 19-year-old in 2002, has 115 appearances for the team and 43 clean sheets.

Since her injury, fellow Edmonton native Stephanie Labbe has taken over the No. 1 spot, with Sabrina D'Angelo and Kailen Sheridan also getting starts. The Canadian team next travels to the Algarve Cup in Portugal, where it is the defending champion. The next Women's World Cup will take place in France in 2019.

In this weekly column, former health insurance executive Wendell Potter offers commentary on matters relating to U.S. health care reform
It's been a while since you've seen a lot of stories in the media about Obamacare “rate shock,” hasn't it?
“Rate shock” stories were all the rage several months ago, like this one from Forbes last December: “Aetna CEO (Mark) Bertolini: Get ready for ‘Rate Shock' as Some Insurance Premiums to Double in 2014.”
Health insurance executives were hoping we'd swallow their scare campaign on rates, and thus get behind efforts by their friends in Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
Many of those friends, like Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., are members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which sent out a press release on March 14 with the headline: “Obamacare Oversight: The Looming Premium Rate Shock.”
The next day, that committee held a hearing entitled: “Unaffordable: Impact of Obamacare on America's Health Insurance.” During that hearing, at which I testified, Blackburn read a long list of what she claimed were names of businesses in her district that had experienced Obamacare rate shock.
Skeptical, I sent Rep. Blackburn a letter asking if I could see those letters and help her determine if Obamacare was really the blame or if, possibly, and more likely, those businesses' insurance carriers were just gouging them. Five and a half months later, I'm still waiting on a response. Even though I'm from Tennessee too.
Since that hearing, the headlines have diminished because there's little evidence that the “rate shock” allegations were based on anything other than assertions made by insurance company CEOs and lobbyists and their buddies on Capitol Hill.

The number of rate shock stories declined as state after state disclosed over the summer what insurance companies will actually charge for policies next year. Those disclosures have shown that not only will premiums not skyrocket when Obamacare's most important consumer protections kick in on January 1, most Americans who buy coverage on their states' online marketplaces will get better deals than they can today.
A study published last week by the Rand Corporation, a research group, is also helping to show that the rate shock hype was just that: hype.
Rand researchers said that although prices will vary from state to state, Obamacare will not increase premiums overall. Yes, some people, smokers in particular and folks enrolled in policies with benefits so meager they will be outlawed next year, will have to pay more. But most Americans who will be buying coverage in the marketplaces (also known as exchanges) will be eligible for tax credits that will make their coverage more affordable and, in many cases, cheaper than what is available today. Don't expect a press release from the House Energy and Commerce Committee about that.
Another study released earlier this month also indicated that Obamacare has not been the cause of recent rate increases. The Kaiser Family Foundation's annual survey of employer-based insurance showed that over the past year, premiums for family coverage increased just 4 percent. While 4 percent is still a hefty increase for many workers, it's far less than the double-digit increases that were common in previous years.
So what happened to the rate shock scare?
Politicians and the media were all too willing to repeat what CEOs of big for-profit insurance corporations were saying without analyzing their motives or taking into account the fact that the marketplaces will force real competition in the health insurance world.
What the insurance company executives were actually “disclosing” several months back was what they would like to charge for their policies on the marketplaces, not what they actually would be able to charge. Aetna, for example, might have liked to be able to charge $500 a month for a certain policy but it won't because its competitors will charge less than that for the exact same coverage.
We've already seen in Oregon and other states that insurers have been resubmitting lower prices for policies after seeing what their competitors' price plans are.
I predict that beginning Oct. 1, when the marketplaces go online, most people will discover that because of the new level of competition and the availability of tax credits, affordable coverage will actually at long last be available. To save face, though, you can also expect those politicians who have been crying “rate shock” to search high and low for constituents who believe their policies have grown more expensive because of Obamacare. And, like Rep. Blackburn did last March, some of those politicians will read the entire list of those constituents in a Congressional hearing.
Philip K Dick rewired my brain when I was a mere lad, after I plucked Clans of the Alphane Moon at random from a shelf in my local library. This was in the 1980s: PKD had not yet become a multi-million dollar industry and his best endorsements came from counterculture figures such as Timothy Leary or fellow denizens of the SF ghetto such as Michael Moorcock.
It was exciting to be a PKD reader back then. Lots of secondary material was being published, such as Paul Williams's interview book Only Apparently Real, or Lawrence Sutin's excellent biography Divine Invasions. Soon it was obvious that not only were PKD's books – with their combination of metaphysical speculation, social satire, bad relationships, and fantastic ideas tossed out as mere afterthoughts – bizarre and wonderful, but that Dick the man was Seriously Weird.
Sure, there was the paranoia, his prodigious appetite for amphetamines, his obsession with Linda Ronstadt and his fear that either the Black Panthers or FBI had raided his house – enough eccentricity for any lifetime, you might think. But that was all eclipsed by what happened on 20 February 1974, when a pink laser beam filled his mind with arcane and beneficial knowledge.
Where had it come from? God? Aliens? A healthy vitamin solution he had quaffed hours earlier? Dick loved to speculate, so much so that this event inspired not only his late "VALIS Trilogy" but also a private work he called The Exegesis. When he died in 1982 it ran to approximately 8,000 pages of analysis, hypothesis and self-questioning.
For some, the pink laser beam is mere lunacy. I recall a TV documentary in which Brian Aldiss dismissed it as the result of neurochemistry gone awry. Others have argued that it was temporal lobe epilepsy. For still others, an unsavoury whiff of L Ron Hubbard hangs over the event. After all, Dick was heavily into theology. Was he starting a cult? If not, would his fans do it for him?
Probably not: Dick's approach to 2-3-74 (as he called the experience, since the cosmic mind invasion was most intense between February and March) was not dogmatic but critical, and he was the first to suggest that it might have been a neurological event. But then again, the light had diagnosed a potentially critical illness in his son which doctors had missed, and he had received information in dream states in dead languages he could not speak. "It" knew things he did not. So what was it?
Dick never intended The Exegesis for publication, and aside from In Pursuit of VALIS, a tiny selection of extracts from the book that was brought out in 1991, it has remained a thing of legend only. Until last month, however, when Houghton Mifflin Harcourt brought out a huge 900-page volume, co-edited by Jonathan Lethem and Pamela Jackson. It's still only about one tenth of the whole thing, but it's a start. But what, if anything, does this text have to offer people who are not Philip K Dick?
Afraid that the answer might be "not much" I started in on it immediately lest it sit on my shelf unread for 20 years like In Pursuit of VALIS. The first thing I noticed is that Lethem et al assume that anyone reading this book already knows what it is, and will only come to it after deep immersion in PKD's fiction. And indeed, Dick himself begins with a discussion of 2-3-74 through the prism of his novel Ubik, where many of the characters are dead bodies lying in "cold-pac", while their ex-employer Glen Runciter seeks to communicate with them from the world of the living … maybe. Was the pink laser beam likewise an invasion of a dead world by something alive?
That PKD had published Ubik four years earlier was not a problem; he writes as if his book might still have related the truth behind appearances. But Ubik doesn't work, as the world is not visibly rotting around him as it was in the novel. However, Dick immediately conceives of another possibility, and I can't help but wonder what his friend Claudia Bush thought when she received a letter in which Dick speculates that a dead bishop named Jim Pike was invading his mind, before suddenly switching to the theory that it might be an ancient Greek named Asklepios. Asklepios's ignorance of Christ suggests something else: did the world go wrong around 2,000 years ago? Is the goal of this higher intelligence to restore man to a pre-Christian path?
A few pages later, however, and Dick confides in Ursula Le Guin that it's the prophet Elijah. Or at least that's what Thomas M Disch (a great SF writer of the 60s and 70s) had suggested. But there is precisely zero possibility that Disch was serious – his take on PKD was that the great man liked to play with his own mental illness. Disch always kept an ironic distance – which is something I miss in the ultra-reverential contemporary introductions to Dick's work written by fanboys with PhDs and MFAs.
These ideas rush past and are discarded within the first 40 pages or so. John Denver also pops up. The Exegesis is dizzying, bewildering, exhilarating, and more or less than strange as it sounds. But again, should you read it? It doesn't contain the answers to all things; it doesn't even contain the answer to what happened to Dick.
Lethem suggests that the reader must simply "surrender". I suspect he's right – but that won't work unless you've read at least 16 of Dick's novels, plus his biography, and love metaphysics. At that point, The Exegesis will bring you extraordinarily close to his unique mind, with its mixture of doubt, wild invention, minuscule detail, grandiose theory and wry humour. Reality collapses and is then remade, over and over again – but what is real?
Who cares? That's part of the game.
In short: if you want to know what it's like to have your world dissolve, and then try to rebuild it while suffering mental invasions from God, Asklepios or whomever, you should read The Exegesis. Then again, you could always try one of Dick's novels, like Ubik, or The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, or even a minor book such as Galactic Pot-Healer. That one's a lot of fun – and considerably less of an investment of time and energy.
A forbidden new champion stalks the Fields of Justice in the upcoming patch: Zed, the Master of Shadows. Deadly in many roles, including mid lane and jungle, this dark assassins energy-based gameplay revolves around conjuring and commanding shadow clones.
Abilities:
Contempt for the Weak (Passive): Whenever Zed attacks an enemy below 50% Health, he deals an additional 8% of their maximum Health as magic damage. This effect has a short cooldown.
Whenever Zed attacks an enemy below 50% Health, he deals an additional 8% of their maximum Health as magic damage. This effect has a short cooldown. Razor Shuriken: Zed and his shadow both throw their shurikens, dealing physical damage to any target they pass through. Each Shuriken deals less damage to targets beyond the first.
Zed and his shadow both throw their shurikens, dealing physical damage to any target they pass through. Each Shuriken deals less damage to targets beyond the first. Living Shadow: Zeds shadow dashes forward, remaining in place for a short duration. Zeds shadow will duplicate his spells. Activating Living Shadow again while his shadow is active will cause Zed to switch positions with his shadow. If both Zed and his shadow strike the same target with Razor Shurikens or Shadow Slash, Zed re-gains some energy and the target suffers an additional effect: Razor Shurikens deal additional bonus damage and the slow from Shadow Slash is dramatically increased.

Shadow Slash: Zed and his shadow both create a burst of shadow, dealing physical damage to nearby enemies. Zeds Shadow Slash slightly reduces the cooldown of Living Shadow by for each unit struck. The shadows Shadow Slash briefly slows enemies.

The shadows Shadow Slash briefly slows enemies. Death Mark: Zed sinks into the shadows and dashes to his target, dealing physical damage. He also spawns a Living Shadow beyond the target, which duplicates his spells and marks the target. After 3 seconds, the mark will detonate, dealing physical damage based on the damage dealt to the target by Zed and his shadow while the mark was active. Zed can reactivate this ability to switch positions with this shadow.
Unlike other champions with illusions, Zeds shadow clone is the lynchpin in his kit. With a shadow clone active, Zeds abilities are duplicated, allowing him to deal more damage, apply additional effects, or even engage an enemy from an unexpected angle. Zed can even switch places with his clones to perform surprise initiations or quickly head off a fleeing enemy. This ability to strategically reposition combined with some hefty bursts of both physical and magic damage to make Zed versatile across multiple roles.When playing Zed in lane, Razor Shuriken can both harass the enemy and rapidly clear minions, making him a powerful bully. Spamming Razor Shuriken allows Zed to shove the lane and keep pressure up, buy time to roam, or stifle a push to drive enemies off his tower. Meanwhile, using Living Shadow to set up creative angles on your lane opponent can complicate juke attempts and allow you to land full damage nukes.Zeds ganking and pursuit power also makes him an ideal jungler. Switching places with your shadow clone via Living Shadow creates opportunities for lightning-fast initiations, escapes, and even buff steals. The powerful slow from a cloned Shadow Slash can also lock down an enemy champion, leaving him vulnerable to execution from a heavy hitting attack charged with Contempt for the Weak.Once the team fights start, Zeds clone enables him to alternately deploy his abilities from a safe distance or deal even more damage when he charges into the fray. He can also combine Living Shadow with Shadow Slash to blanket an area with a high-intensity slow, throwing off enemy positioning. Finally, Death Mark is an excellent cleanup ability to chase down and finish off fleeing low-health champions. The bonus magic damage from Contempt for the Weak is a great way to top off Death Marks detonation damage for surefire killing blows.Managing this clone-and-combo kit is crucial to dominating with Zed. Strategically positioning Zed and his clone for a two-pronged assault before deploying your skillshots will ultimately make or break your success on the Fields of Justice.Zed is the first ninja in 200 years to unlock the ancient, forbidden ways. He defied his clan and master, casting off the balance and discipline that had shackled him all his life. Zed now offers power to those who embrace knowledge of the shadows, and slays those who cling to ignorance.An orphan, Zed was taken in and trained by a great ninja master. Only one other student appeared to be Zed's equal - the master's son, Shen. It seemed Zed could never win the favor of the master, as every match between the rivals ended in a draw. Frustrated and jealous, he sought an advantage. The young ninja ventured into a sealed part of the clan's temple, where he found an ornate, foreboding box. Sensing the dark knowledge within, Zed knew he should not open it, but he peered inside nonetheless. In an instant, shadows touched his mind, revealing techniques that had long been hidden. Now armed with a secret edge, he challenged Shen, and this time he defeated the master's son. He expected praise and recognition in his moment of victory, but somehow the master knew Zed had used forbidden ways, and banished him.Humiliated, the young ninja wandered for years. His bitterness turned to ambition, and he began to train others in the style of the shadows. As his power grew, so did his circle of followers, but he knew that without the box, his technique would never be perfect. One day, Zed looked at his followers and saw that his students were now an army. He led them back to the temple to claim his prize. At the gates, he was surprised to find the old master waiting, receiving Zed and his disciples as if they were welcome guests. The old man laid his sword at Zed's feet, declaring that he had failed Zed as his master. By banishing his former student, the master had doomed Zed to the shadows, instead of leading him to the balanced path. The old man implored Zed to enter the temple, destroy the box, and lead his followers to balance. The dark ninja followed the master inside. Moments later, the assembled ninjas heard Zed cry out in pain. Mysteriously, he emerged unscathed, and threw the severed head of the master at Shen's feet. Screaming in rage, Zed commanded his followers to slaughter the master's students and seize the box.That day, the old ninja order fell. Though many students died, some escaped thanks to Shen's heroic efforts. Now the temple is a dark training ground for the Order of the Shadow. Zed rules as the Order's master, and his edict is simple: perfect one's technique, and kill all ninjas who refuse to embrace the shadows.''Balance is a lie - we are the true ninjas.''-Zed
Microsoft rolled out some of Windows 10 Creators Update gaming features to some Windows Insider Program members Wednesday. The company also released a video preview of the Windows 10 Game Mode, explaining its functioning.
“Our vision is that Game Mode optimizes your Windows 10 PC for an improvement in overall game performance. This week's Windows Insider build represents the first step on our journey with Game Mode,” Scott Henson, manager of Xbox Partner Group Program said in the official press release.
With the introduction of Game Mode, Microsoft seems to be targeting PC gamers. The company has endowed the upcoming Windows update with special gaming features.
While some parts of the Game Mode have already been revealed, the full gaming experience using the mode was launched to members of the Fast Ring who are in line to get software updates first.
Game Mode is an optional setting and you can turn it off if you don't intend to use it. It isn't just a software tweak — once the feature is enabled, CPU and GPU cores will be dedicated to gaming, improving overall gaming performance as games will have a more consistent frame rate and a better peak frame rate, utilizing these system resources. It is designed for both Win32 games (32-bit games developed using Windows API) and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) games.
Windows 10 Creators Update will also make it easy for gamers to stream their games.
It has a feature called Beam which is designed especially for gamers who want to live stream their gaming experience on video sharing websites such as YouTube. The feature will help regular gamers create a gaming stream like YouTubers such as PewDiePie. It will also let users connect and engage with viewers in real-time with less than one second of delay.
A new feature called Broadcasts has also been incorporated in the gaming bar which will let you simply start a broadcast by using the ‘Windows+G' shortcut. A side menu will give users options to interact with fellow gamers.
Additionally, the System setting will now have a Gaming section. It will show settings which can be used to customize the Game bar, Game DVR and broadcasting.
The official Windows 10 Creators Update is expected to roll out to all Windows 10 PCs by Spring 2017.
Using information from articles in GQ and The Washington Post, the ad says that when Mr. Paul was a student at Baylor University, he was “a member of a secret society that called the Holy Bible ‘a hoax' ” and the society was “banned for mocking Christianity and Christ.” It also asks, “Why did Rand Paul once tie a woman up and tell her to bow down before a false idol and say his god was Aqua Buddha?”
Photo
At the top of his Web site, Mr. Paul refers to the ad and asks for money for his own counterattack commercial (“Help Rand defend against Jack's smears”); on Friday, the site showed donations of more than $300,000 in the last three days and Mr. Paul released a second counterattack commercial.
His campaign's response over the last week has included an unusual appearance by his wife, Kelley, reassuring voters, particularly women, that “faith has always been a part of my life, and I'd never have fallen in love with or married a man who didn't share my values.”
The campaign later issued a fund-raising appeal based on a video of her remarks. Mike Huckabee, the Baptist preacher and erstwhile presidential candidate, is running a radio advertisement criticizing the Conway commercial. The Paul campaign also arranged a conference call for reporters with social conservatives who vouched for Mr. Paul's bona fides as a Christian and a social conservative.
“If it was cutting against them, they would be moving on,” said Evan Tracey, president of the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks political advertising. Mr. Tracey suggested that Mr. Paul was capitalizing on the sympathy of voters who would not want their own extracurricular college activities scrutinized too closely.
Joe Gershtenson, a political scientist at Eastern Kentucky University, said that Mr. Paul understood the need to re-establish his religious credentials. “Religion is important in this state,” he said. “If you're going to be perceived as mocking Christianity, voters need to know you're one of us in terms of faith.”
Mr. Paul has maintained his lead in the polls, though it has narrowed. That narrowing could be the result of several factors, and most races tighten toward the end.

Mr. Conway has not attributed his gains to the commercial. But despite heaps of criticism — including from liberals — that the commercial unfairly relied on anonymous charges and crossed a line in questioning Mr. Paul's faith, Mr. Conway is continuing to air it. Asked whether it was effective, Mr. Conway said at a stop in Lawrenceburg, near here: “It's something we're still evaluating, but it resonates with the people of Kentucky.”
Photo
But the Conway campaign is now rotating out the Aqua Buddha commercial and replacing it this weekend with another ad that accuses Mr. Paul of wanting to impose a$2,000 deductible on Medicare claims and replace the federal income tax with a national sales tax that would amount to 23 percent. (The Paul campaign disputes both.)
But the Aqua Buddha commercial did help Mr. Conway break through the cluttered media environment. It landed him on the national stage, including on NBC's “Today” show.
With the fresh attention, Mr. Conway assures crowds that he can win this conservative Republican state as he hopes to plant seeds of doubt among social conservatives and whip up support among women who, polls show, favor Mr. Conway over Mr. Paul. Former President Bill Clinton — the only Democrat to win Kentucky since Jimmy Carter — is returning on election eve to help him build momentum and get out the vote.

Several Conway supporters, including those here in central Kentucky who came to see him at the Mercer County Democratic headquarters, said the commercial might be working, but they were not happy with it.
David Best, 43, a property assessor, said both sides “aggravate” him with negative commercials but he could see that this one might hurt Mr. Paul.
“Especially with this being the Bible Belt,” he said. “Nobody wants to hear negative against the church or religion or Jesus Christ, so I'm sure it's stuck in some people's mind — whether he did it or whether he didn't, it just puts that little seed of doubt in your mind.”
Donna Mayes, 62, a retired teacher who owns a farm here and is active in Democratic politics, lamented that positive commercials did not work. Still, she said, “It probably was not the best idea because what we do in college is not who we are.”
According to the Daily Mail among others, Haris Vučkić, who played on loan for the Rangers last season, has signed a contract extension. During his time with the Rangers, he scored in the double digits, and he also impressed with a solo goal against Ajax in a U-21 club friendly this summer.
Vučkić was undoubtedly the most successful of the 5 players Newcastle loaned to the Rangers. While Vučkić was busy scoring goals, the rest received a minimal amount of playing time. The young Slovenian midfielder speculates that he could have made more of an impact playing for Newcastle, but a string of unfortunate injuries derailed that path.
Vučkić's new team, Wigan Athletic, were relegated from the Championship to League One after finishing second to last in the league table. The news of Vučkić's loan to Wigan follows a recent 1-0 win over Crewe Alexandra and comes in the midst of a few other rumors. Presumably, Wigan are hoping to shore up their team and claw their way back to the Championship next year.
U.S. Dollar Entering Free Fall Crash Territory
Martin's off this week. So I'm writing you today from Asia with a passionate plea to our country — to its citizens and especially to our leaders in Washington.
We are now the laughing stock of Asia. Our dollars are no longer respected; our ambitions, no longer mimicked.
Our way of life, often based on consuming far beyond our means, is being flat-out rejected.
I can't even exchange a $100 bill on the street here anymore: Most of the street money changers will take euros, Singapore dollars, even Chinese yuan. But fearful of losing their shirt with sinking exchange rates, they don't want U.S. dollars.
Not long ago, I never traveled without my American Express card. Now, it sits in my office safe. Many in Asia no longer accept the card anymore. MasterCard and Visa are still OK, but they're also losing market share to locally grown cards like Aeon.
The running joke in Singapore, Hong Kong, Bangkok, and Kuala Lumpur is that the U.S. is the place where even your pet could get a credit card or a home mortgage.
So to Asians, the crisis we're going through is our own fault. And although it was also caused by blunders in Western Europe and other regions, truth be told, they are mostly right.
The message is clear: We need to immediately stop living beyond our means. But can we?
Consider the facts:
Through August, the federal deficit has already hit $1.38 trillion, or TRIPLE last year's all-time record deficit of $454.8 billion. And in September alone, the administration expects another $200 billion in red ink, bringing the total for the year to $1.58 trillion.
The U.S. government's official debt is now at an all-time high of $11.8 trillion. That's over $100,000 for each and every household in America.
Both the administration and its opponents agree that, over the next 10 years, the cumulative federal deficit will be another $9 trillion, bringing the burden per household up to $177,000.
The Federal Reserve is also in hock up to its eyeballs, with more than $2 trillion in liabilities on its balance sheet. That brings the total burden up to $194,000 per household.
Perhaps worst of all, the unfunded government IOUs that are now starting to come due on Social Security, Medicare, and Federal pension payments are also ballooning higher and now stand at an estimated $104 trillion, or $886,000 per household.
Grand total: Each and every household in America is indirectly responsible for a debt burden of over 1 MILLION DOLLARS!
Bottom line:
Even assuming they can save 5 percent of their income year after year … and even assuming every single penny of their savings is thrown into the pot … in order to pay off the U.S. government's debts and obligations, each American family — and descendents — would have to toil for the next 429 years.
Problem is, we haven't borrowed all that money from ourselves. We've borrowed more than half of the outstanding national debt from overseas investors, who now fund fully 50 percent of our debt addiction.
But now …
America's foreign creditors are haunted by the spectacle of Washington's spending binge and are starting to recoil in horror.
That's why in April, U.S. bond purchases by foreign central banks plunged 41 percent from the month before, while purchases by foreign private investors dropped 7 percent. All in a single month!
Yet even as investors flee in increasing numbers, our government continues to ramp up spending — trying to hawk even more U.S. debt to foreign lenders.
The Obama administration largely ignores the fact that overseas investors are getting tired of footing the bill for our borrow-and-spend addiction … and are also becoming increasingly skeptical of our ability to pay our debts.
The result: More foreign central banks, overseas fund managers, and investors flee, leaving the U.S. government with no choice but to pump out more and more unbacked paper dollars and dump them into the economy — further eroding their value.
Central banks over the last year have been actively replacing portions of their dollar reserves with the euro, the Canadian and Australian dollars … and gold. China alone recently announced it has quietly increased its gold reserves by more than 75 percent over the last seven years.
So it should come as no surprise that the widely watched U.S. Dollar Index, a measure of the dollar's performance against a basket of six of the world's major currencies, has plunged 15.1 percent since its high of March 4.
As you can see from the accompanying chart, that now puts the greenback in free-fall territory.
It's plunging against the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound, the Swiss franc, the Canadian dollar.
It's even sliding against the currencies of lesser-developed economies like the Thai baht, the Philippine peso, the Indian rupee, the Malaysian ringgit, the Indonesian rupiah, and the Vietnamese dong.
And it leaves …
The U.S. and All Americans Between a Rock and a Hard Place
Either …
U.S. consumers and the U.S. government must slash spending drastically, accepting a deeper economic decline or …
They will perpetuate the borrow-and-spend cycle, destroying the U.S. dollar and, ultimately, our standard of living.
I'd like to hear your thoughts on how we might get out from under this mess we find ourselves in — and, more importantly, what YOU are doing to protect yourself, your family, and your retirement from the dollar's demise.
Just jump over to my personal blog to weigh in on this issue by clicking here.
Best wishes,
Larry

Donna Hunter is a fighter. She's been fighting for years now to get just one secular school in Morinville, Alberta (Canada) — and she's only one of several mothers fighting for that cause. Right now, the Greater St. Albert Catholic Schools manages all four of the schools in the area, leaving non-religious parents with no alternatives.
The Alberta Human Rights Commission has refused to deal with two complaints filed by parents who are fighting for a non-religious schooling option in Morinville. Donna Hunter and Marjorie Kirsop received letters from the commission Thursday telling them to take their complaints to “another forum” such as the province's School Act. … Kirsop and Hunter filed their human-rights complaints late last year, alleging their non-Catholic children were discriminated against because they have not been allowed to opt out of religious instruction in a system where Catholic doctrine permeates the school day.
Last I heard, there was actually going to be a secular alternative , but it doesn't look like that's panning out. They just got denied by — of all places — the Alberta Human Rights Commission.
Kirsop isn't sure how to proceed anymore since she's just going around in circles:
“I'm extremely disappointed as my complaint to the Human Rights Commission was made after many failed attempts to obtain a genuine public education in Morinville,” she said. “After our request for a secular education was denied by our school board in mid-January of 2011, we appealed to the Minister of Education. As of today, we still have not received a response from the Minister of Education in regards to our appeal. And now, we are told by the Human Rights Commission that our complaint is best dealt with by the school board — the very school board who denied our rights in the first place. It's ironic. It seems we are just going in circles again. Should I be making another appeal to the Minister of Education?”
It's a little hard for me to wrap my mind around what's happening since I haven't followed this story too closely and I'm not very clear on Canadian laws regarding education and religion. Some of the Canadian readers out there might be able to help us understand the issues a bit more — what happened in Morinville and what courses of action are left to take?
Reader Edwin adds this bit of relevant information via email:
… there was a provincial law enacted in 1905 that guarantees the reciting of the Lord's Prayer and only recognizes the Roman Catholic and Church of England teachings in public schools… It was a condition of the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan joining Canada. It actually overrides our Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (our Constitution).
On a side note, there's a nice interview with Donna Hunter here.
Donald Trump has long talked about reining in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which is in charge of enforcing federal laws on air and water pollution. It's a top priority for his supporters in the fossil-fuel industry.
But there's still a lot of uncertainty over what, exactly, this will look like. Trump himself has been all over the map on the agency's future. In Congress, there are bills floating around that would do everything from abolish the EPA to merely curb its powers at the margins. And, while Trump's pick to lead the EPA, Scott Pruitt, was an ardent foe of Obama's environmental policies, he'll face serious legal hurdles in trying to dismantle them all at once.
So, to simplify things a bit, here are five possible futures for the EPA under Trump, based on what we know so far. As noted, some of these scenarios are way more plausible than others — and they're not all mutually exclusive. But it's a way of seeing the options here:
1) The EPA gets abolished altogether
This is the least likely scenario by far, though various politicians have brought it up. At one point during the campaign, Trump expressed interest in eliminating the EPA entirely, though he later backpedaled. And in the House, freshman Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) introduced a bill on February 3 to “terminate” the agency — which has an annual budget of $8 billion and employs more than 15,000 people.
But few of Gaetz's colleagues are taking his bill seriously, and for good reason. Congress can't just terminate the EPA with one sentence, as Gaetz's bill does, and call it a day. There are dozens of sweeping environmental laws that have been enacted since 1970 — including the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act — that require the federal government to limit air and water pollution. Those don't disappear just because everyone at the EPA has been laid off. Congress would either have to give some other agency all of EPA's responsibilities or rewrite America's bedrock environmental laws. Otherwise, those same laws would leave companies vulnerable to a blizzard of citizen lawsuits. It'd be a nightmare.
Plausibility: This one's almost certainly not happening.
2) Congress says the EPA can no longer address climate change
In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled the EPA had the authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act if it determined they pose a threat to public health or welfare. Under Obama, the EPA determined that they do indeed pose a threat, and went about enacting a flurry of climate policies: stricter fuel-economy standards for cars and trucks; limits on CO2 from new and existing power plants; regulations on methane leaks from oil and gas drilling. Those policies help underpin international efforts to tackle global warming.
Trump wants to dismantle these policies. And as head of EPA, Pruitt would have some leeway to scale back rules like the Clean Power Plan for power plants. But so long as the Supreme Court's ruling stands, Pruitt would still be obligated to enforce some regulation of greenhouse gases (as he has acknowledged). What's more, so long as EPA keeps its authority, a new president could come in after Trump and pursue more ambitious Obama-style climate policies.
Unless Congress steps in, that is. In the House, 110 Republicans have signed onto a bill, HR 637, that would strip the EPA of all authority over greenhouse gases forever and ever. If it passed, then nearly every Obama-era climate policy would vanish instantly. No more Clean Power Plan. No more carbon standards for new coal plants. No more methane standards. (Fuel-economy standards for cars would be a trickier case.) And no future president could tackle climate change through the EPA.
Plausibility: Low-ish. So far, none of the relevant House committees have taken up HR 637. Senate Democrats would almost certainly filibuster such a bill, and they have the votes to do so — at least for the next two years. And as long as Pruitt is slow-walking the EPA's greenhouse-gas rules, there's less urgency for opponents of climate action to pass this. Still, this idea has major support in the GOP caucus, and it's likely to come up again and again, especially if Republicans pick up seats in the midterms.
By the way, it's unlikely that Pruitt can tear up the EPA's Endangerment Finding, the 2009 analysis establishing that greenhouse gases were a threat and therefore need to be regulated, without Congress. “That has a voluminous scientific foundation behind it,” said Jody Freeman, a Harvard law professor and former Obama climate advisor. “The Trump administration couldn't just come in and say nope, no more endangerment! There's almost no chance that would be upheld [in court].” Plus, in a weird twist, if the EPA's authority were repealed, that could open the door for common lawsuits against polluters in the states — a potential nightmare for companies.
3) Scott Pruitt tears up Obama's environmental policies
If Congress doesn't make fundamental changes to the way the EPA does business, then it will fall to Pruitt and his team to reshape the agency. As Attorney General of Oklahoma, Pruitt teamed up with oil and coal companies to challenge much of what Obama's EPA did on environmental protection. While he usually lost those fights in court, he'll now be in a better position to roll back many of EPA's rules.
Pruitt has to work within the confines of the Clean Air Act. But he could, for instance, begin the multi-year process of rewriting the Clean Power Plan, which regulates CO2 from power plants. Whereas Obama's rule would prod states to shift to cleaner energy and slash emissions 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, Pruitt's EPA could craft a more modest version that merely pushes coal-plant operators to improve their heat-rate efficiency. That might lead to a smaller 2 to 4 percent cut in emissions — and would be a significant setback for US climate action.
Similarly, Obama's EPA crafted a rule that made it impossible for new coal plants to obtain permits unless they could capture and bury their CO2 emissions underground. A Pruitt version might merely require new coal plants to be ultra-efficient. He could also try to rewrite the EPA's “Waters of the US” rule so that the Clean Water Act applied to fewer streams and wetlands. He could tweak the EPA's fuel-economy standards for cars and trucks so that they were less stringent. “There's limited bandwidth here,” says Jeffrey Holmstead, a top EPA official in the George W. Bush administration. “But if I had to guess, I'd guess they get a couple of these big changes done.”
On top of that, although EPA is eventually supposed to regulate other sources of greenhouse-gas emissions, like refineries and chemical plants, Pruitt could delay the introduction of these rules indefinitely. Pruitt could also stock the EPA's scientific advisory board with more industry-friendly appointees, which could lead to less-aggressive environmental rules overall. And he could explore ways to weaken the agency's enforcement capabilities, as he did in Oklahoma.
Plausibility: High. Although he doesn't have unlimited power here, Pruitt would be in a good position to significantly weaken US climate policy — and make it very difficult for the country to fulfill its climate pledge under the Paris deal. The one wild card is that EPA regulatory changes have to go through a laborious rule-making process and can be challenged in court by green groups. Pruitt may lose some of those battles, though it'll be tougher to challenge him on things like delaying new climate rules.
4) Pruitt and Congress handcuff the EPA through budget cuts
Rewriting regulations isn't the only way for the Trump administration to curtail the EPA. They'll also submit budget requests to Republicans in Congress, many of whom want to shrink the agency considerably.
Last year, Rep. Ken Calvert (R-CA), who chairs the House committee overseeing the EPA's budget, pushed a budget proposal that would freeze EPA staffing levels at 15,000 positions and cut the agency's enforcement capabilities by about 6 percent. But other Republicans in the House want to go much, much further, cutting the agency's budget as much as 30 percent. And Myron Ebell, who led Trump's EPA transition team, has suggested cutting 10,000 of the agency's 15,000 positions.
On top of that, in the past, Republicans have pushed to add dozens of anti-EPA riders to budget bills that would impose various restrictions on the agency. That included riders barring the EPA from researching the environmental impacts of fracking. Riders stopping the EPA from enforcing pollution from livestock production. Riders preventing the EPA from enforcing lead-paint exposure rules. Riders to block certain greenhouse-gas reporting requirements. And on and on. The Obama White House typically opposed these. The Trump White House may be more receptive.
Plausibility: Medium to high. While it's less likely that Ebell's grand ambitions to gut the EPA's workforce will come to fruition — he no longer has much influence with the White House — Congress is very likely to chip away at the EPA's budget and add various riders to curtail the agency's regulatory authority. Industry groups will be lobbying for these constantly, and environmentalists may struggle to play defense here.
5) The EPA survives the Trump years (mostly) intact
After years of Trump, it's quite possible the EPA will find itself radically transformed. Congress rewrites the laws guiding US environmental policy — or at least chips away at them through budget riders. Pruitt dismantles Obama's climate rules. Budget cuts and layoffs do lasting damage to the agency's regulatory capacity. Enforcement is pared back drastically or handed over to the states, and industry enjoys far looser oversight. US greenhouse-gas emissions are much higher than they would've been otherwise.
But that's not inevitable. It's also possible that Congress will be unable to strip the EPA of its greenhouse-gas authority or to pass bills like the REINS Act that would drastically restrain new agency rule-making. It's possible that Pruitt's efforts to reshape Obama's EPA rules could get bogged down by lawsuits from opponents, and he finds himself unable to change all that much. It's even conceivable that the EPA could emerge from the Trump era in roughly the same shape it's in today — albeit having made little progress on climate change in the interim.
Plausibility: Who knows? Both Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush tried to downsize the EPA, attempting to hack away at regulations and make life easier for industry. Both made some headway in weakening environmental protection — but at the same time, many of their more brazen efforts got beaten back in court. (See, for instance, Bush's failed attempts to issue weaker standards on smog.) During the Bush years, states sued the EPA and got the Supreme Court to order the agency to deal with greenhouse gases. By 2009, the US had lost time in tackling carbon emissions, but Obama was able to reorient the agency in just a few years.
That said, Bush's team was never as outwardly hostile toward the EPA's mission as Trump's has been. And there are so many variables here: How active will Congress be on legislation? How savvy will Pruitt's team be about crafting legally defensible EPA rules? How will federal judges swing? Will the agency's career staffers resist drastic changes in policy? It's going to be an unpredictable four-plus years.

Research links two millennia of cyclones, floods, El Niño
Stalagmites, which crystallize from water dropping onto the floors of caves, millimeter by millimeter, over thousands of years, leave behind a record of climate change encased in stone. Newly published research by Rhawn Denniston, professor of geology at Cornell College, and his research team, applied a novel technique to stalagmites from the Australian tropics to create a 2,200-year-long record of flood events that might also help predict future climate change.
A paper by Denniston and 10 others, including a 2014 Cornell College graduate, is published this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The article, “Extreme rainfall activity in the Australian tropics reflects changes in the El Niño/Southern Oscillation over the last two millennia,” presents a precisely dated stalagmite record of cave flooding events that are tied to tropical cyclones, which include storms such as hurricanes and typhoons.
Denniston is one of few researchers worldwide using stalagmites to reconstruct past tropical cyclone activity, a field of research called paleotempestology. His work in Australia began in 2009 and was originally intended to focus on the chemical composition of the stalagmites as a means of reconstructing past changes in the intensity of Australian summer monsoon rains. But Denniston and his research team found more than just variations in the chemical composition of the stalagmites they examined; they discovered that the interiors of the stalagmites also contained prominent layers of mud.
“Seeing mud accumulations like these was really unusual,” Denniston said. “There was no doubt that the mud layers came from the cave having flooded. The water stirred up the sediment and when the water receded, the mud coated everything in the cave—the floor, the walls, and the stalagmites. Then the stalagmites started forming again and the mud got trapped inside.”
The stalagmites were precisely dated by Denniston, Cornell College geology majors, and Denniston's colleagues at the University of New Mexico. Once the ages of the stalagmites were known, the mud layers were measured. Angelique Gonzales '14, who worked with Denniston on the research and is third author on the paper, examined nearly 11 meters of stalagmites, measuring them in half millimeter increments and recording the location and thickness of mud layers. This work gave the team more than 2,000 years of data about the frequency of cave flooding.
But the origins of the floods were still unclear. Given the area's climatology, Denniston found that these rains could have come from the Australian monsoon or from tropical cyclones.
“We were sort of stuck,” Denniston said, “but then I started working with Gabriele.”
Gabriele Villarini, an assistant professor of engineering at the University of Iowa and the second author of the paper, studies extreme meteorological events, what drives the frequency and magnitude of those events, and their impact on policy and economics. With Denniston and Gonzales, Villarini examined historical rainfall records from a weather station near the cave.
“The largest rainfall events, almost regardless of duration, are tied to tropical cyclones,” Villarini said.
Next, they compared flood events recorded in a stalagmite that grew over the past several decades to historical records of tropical cyclones. This analysis revealed that timing of flood events in the cave was consistent with the passing of tropical cyclones through the area. Thus, the researchers interpreted the flood layers in their stalagmites largely as recording tropical cyclone activity.
The resulting data tell scientists about more than just the frequencies of tropical cyclones in one part of Australia over the past 2,200 years. A major driver of year-to-year changes in tropical cyclones around the world is the El Niño/Southern Oscillation, which influences weather patterns across the globe. During El Niño events, for example, Australia and the Atlantic generally experience fewer tropical cyclones, while during La Niña events, the climatological opposite of El Niño, the regions see more tropical cyclones.
“Our work, and that of several other researchers, reveals that the frequency of storms has changed over the past hundreds and thousands of years,” Denniston said. “But why? Could it have been due to El Niño? Direct observations only go back about a hundred years, and there hasn't been much variation in the nature of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation over that time. Further back there was more, and so our goal was to test the link between storms and El Niño in prehistory.”
Denniston noted that the variations over time in the numbers of flood events recorded by his stalagmites matched reconstructed numbers of hurricanes in the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean.
“Tropical cyclone activity in these regions responds similarly to El Niño, and previous studies had also suggested that some periods, such as those when we had lots of flood layers in our stalagmites, were likely characterized by more frequent La Niñas. Similarly, times with fewer storms were characterized by more frequent El Niños.”
The results of this study mark an important step towards understanding how future climate change may be expressed.
“It is difficult to use climate models to study hurricane activity, and so studies such as ours, which produced a record of storms under different climate conditions, are important for our understanding of future storm activity,” Denniston said.
Gonzales, who is planning to pursue a Ph.D. in geology, said that her experience with Denniston and his research, including two senior seminars and an honors thesis, was valuable because she got both field and lab experience as she helped determine not just what had happened in the past, but what that meant.
“There were a lot of different aspects to put this together—dating, measuring, literature review, and modeling”, she said. “It was really exciting.”
Denniston is now gearing up to establish a detailed cave monitoring program in this and other regional caves. “We want to extend this study,” he said, “to examine what conditions trigger cave flooding.”
In addition to Denniston, Villarini, and Gonzales, the other authors on the paper were Karl-Heinz Wyrwoll from the University of Western Australia, Victor J. Polyak from the University of New Mexico, Caroline C. Ummenhofer from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Matthew S. Lachniet from the University of Nevada Las Vegas, Alan D. Wanamaker Jr. from Iowa State University, William F. Humphreys from the Western Australian Museum, David Woods from the Australian Department of Parks and Wildlife, and John Cugley from the Australian Speleological Federation.
Dungeon Master (DM) Workshop is a regular feature in which Charles draws on his experience as a DM, as well as what he's learned from the other DM's, to help people run better games.
This particular entry is part of a series designed to help DM's craft custom campaigns from scratch.
Every story has moments or events which are their focal points. Foreshadowing, character development, exposition, etc… all exist to set these up. I call the culmination of all these focal points “narrative focus.” The points may all be different things, but when combined they form the meat of the story, the reason the consumer is interested in the story in the first place.

In a tabletop RPG campaign, narrative focus is comprised of a series of events experienced by the players. We talked about the different kinds of experiences a DM can incorporate into their campaigns in the last installment of this series. While it's entirely possible to just string together a series of interesting experiences and create a perfectly serviceable campaign, if you have a narrative focus in mind ahead of time you can carefully select your experiences in order to deliver an especially memorable campaign.
The following are some examples to help you understand how to think about narrative focus.
Combat Focused Narratives
One of the most common narrative focuses of a campaign is combat. For many players, the core of RPG's like Dungeons and Dragons is the challenge of overcoming difficult combat encounters. They want a campaign where they are rewarded for carefully building their characters and making good decisions in battle.
In such a campaign non-combatant NPC's, plot-lines, and other forms of character interaction are kept to a minimum, and only used to carry the party from encounter to encounter in a meaningful way.
A combat focused narrative creates a story about the player-character's power and achievements. Players will walk away from the table telling stories of how they masterfully dealt with a difficult situation, or how their unique build made them a force to be reckoned with.
Dungeon Crawls
A campaign built with dungeon crawling as its narrative focus is similar to a combat focus in many ways. However, there are key differences.
The players' take aways are still their sense of accomplishment that comes from overcoming adversity. However, in this case combat is merely one of the challenges they face. Their builds and battle prowess are still important, but they are only there to help them defeat their true enemy – the perilous dungeon (or series of dungeons) they find themselves in.
This a slower paced campaign than a combat focused one, but delivers a comparable narrative focus.
Exploration
When people think of exploration they tend to focus on scouting out or discovering a geographical area. However, there are many forms of exploration that are suitable for table-top RPGs. Player's could be exploring an unfamiliar society through character interaction, for instance. Or perhaps the campaign takes place in a setting created by the DM, and narrative focus is learning about the unique setting by thrusting the player-characters into it headlong.
Of course, it's perfectly acceptable to build a campaign about exploring some wild, unknown region as well. But it's important to remember that at it's core an exploration focused narrative isn't just about moving from point-a to point-b without knowing what's in between the two. It's about the joy of discovery, and the challenges the party overcomes to get to those discoveries.
Social Narratives
Table-top RPGs provide an unparalleled player interaction experience. A DM can use this to create a campaign designed to drive interesting interactions between the player-characters, creating a narrative focus on the social aspects of the game.
Some of my personal favorite RPG moments have come from thrusting a difficult decision on the party that I know will be contentious. In most campaigns, doing so is a good way to derail the game and seriously dampen the player's enjoyment. However, in a social narrative focus it becomes one of the key experiences of the game.
Survival
If the player's do not feel that their characters' lives are in jeopardy there will rarely be much interest in any campaign. However, their survival does not need to be the focus of the narrative.
In the types of campaigns mentioned above the player-characters' well being is of concern, but not necessarily the narrative focus. Instead, the focus is on the things putting them in danger.
In a survival focused campaign, the threats are secondary to the players' goal of making it out of
the campaign alive. The party often does not find itself in their situation willingly – perhaps they were thrown into a vast prison of some kind, or bad weather separated them from their caravan in a vast expanse of wilderness. In any event, the players are driven first by their desire not to die, and second by their desire to escape the predicament they find themselves in.
Closing Thoughts
Knowing what your narrative focus is going to be allows you to more effectively choose a rule set, setting, and set of experiences to deliver on the kind of campaign you want to create. When determining your narrative focus, it's important to consider what tools you have available to you, where your skills as a DM lie, and what your players are looking to get out of the game.
In the next installment of this series we'll discuss one of the most critical tools in delivering your desired narrative – your campaign setting.

Politico's media blogger, Dylan Byers, regularly supplies his readers with tidbits on comings and goings in the news business, but this week he provided an additional service: a lesson in the limitations of armchair journalism.
After my column appeared Tuesday on a Heritage Foundation event on Benghazi that devolved into anti-Muslim ugliness, Byers tweeted that I had “totally misrepresented the panel.” It linked to a nine-minute video clip from the session. Byers followed that up shortly with a blog post titled “Dana Milbank's Heritage Disaster,” based on the same excerpt.
I read Byers's post, and there was indeed a disaster: the sort of disaster that occurs when a journalist, from the comfort of his office, levels accusations based on a nine-minute clip of a 65-minute panel he hadn't attended. (Heritage didn't post the full video until well after the Byers report, and Byers didn't take me up on my offer to provide him earlier with my audio recording.)
Byers wrote that the Heritage Foundation “feels that the event was ‘mischaracterized' by Milbank. It also notes that while the event took place at Heritage, it was hosted by the Benghazi Accountability Coalition.”
But had Byers been at the event himself, he wouldn't have swallowed the Heritage spin — hook, line and sinker. He would have been handed the agenda, printed on paper with the Heritage logo, announcing: “The Benghazi Accountability Coalition and The Heritage Foundation Cordially Invite You to a Symposium” on Benghazi. He would have seen the accompanying paper noting that Heritage is a member of the Benghazi Accountability Coalition, and he would have heard John Hilboldt, the head of Heritage's lecture program, give remarks opening the panel. This wasn't in the video excerpt Byers viewed.
Byers wrote, based on his perusal of the video, that Saba Ahmed, the woman in an Islamic head covering whom I reported had been taunted by panelists and audience members, “didn't appear at all troubled or upset at the end of the exchange.” The footage on Byers's computer screen also indicated to him that she “does not seem to have been ‘taunted.' ”
But had he been there, Byers needn't have relied on appearances: He could have asked Ahmed himself, as I did. She told me she felt “targeted” by those in the room. And no wonder: She had just endured a raised-voice tirade directed at her by panelist Brigitte Gabriel, who had asked Ahmed's citizenship, condemned her for taking the limelight, tossed in a Nazi Germany comparison and disparaged the very notion of “peaceful” Muslims – all for Ahmed's sin of pointing out that not all Muslims are evil and that Muslims weren't represented on the panel. The diatribe brought most of the 150 in the room to their feet, and they gave Gabriel two raucous rounds of applause lasting 28 and 17 seconds. Byers couldn't see or hear much of that on his video clip – particularly the shouts of “hey!” and “hear, hear!” and “yeah!” and “woo-hoo,” which were on the recording I made from the audience. The moderator made no attempt to calm things and indeed made it worse by mockingly challenging Ahmed to name “the head of the Muslim peace movement.”
Byers made four numbered points in support of his argument that my column was a “disaster.” Two of them took issue with my verb choice: In both cases he quarreled with my use of “demanded” when referring to questions people on the panel had posed to Ahmed. Byers's other two points took issue not with what I wrote but with what I hadn't written. He said the column “omits” pieces of the exchange in which two panelists agree that not all Muslims are bad.
It's certainly fair, if not in the realm of “disaster,” to quibble with verb selection, and there's always a question of context when you boil down to 780 words an event where tens of thousands of words were uttered. But the panelists were rather grudging in their acknowledgments of the obvious truth that not all Muslims are evil.
Panelist Frank Gaffney allowed that there are Muslims who don't practice or even know about sharia and who “don't speak Arabic, aren't imbued with the traditions of the faith as out of Saudi Arabia, for example, and they are not necessarily the problem, at least not yet.” And panelist Gabriel said explicitly that the majority of peaceful Muslims are “irrelevant” because 15 to 25 percent of Muslims are seeking to destroy Western civilization.
In a broader sense, Byers was arguing that I took out of context the happenings at the panel (he later qualified his language, taking issue only with my portrayal of the exchange with Ahmed). But he was doing this without having been there to interview participants or to witness the audience reaction, and he was doing this based on a clip of only nine minutes of the 65-minute event.
Had he experienced the entire thing, he would have heard Gaffney repeat the canard that “in every single one of the national security agencies under this administration, we have had people with identifiable associations, some of them quite extensive, to the Muslim Brotherhood.” Gaffney provoked laughter in the audience when he repeated the falsehood that Hillary Clinton aide “Huma Abedin, also known as Mrs. Anthony Weiner,” had “deep personal and family ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.” Gaffney suggested that this Muslim adviser may have been urging Clinton to “embrace” the Muslim Brotherhood and laws making it illegal to oppose sharia.
Byers also would have heard Gaffney when he condemned the words of “the president of the United States, at the United Nations, where he said, ‘the future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam,' a statement you could have found on al-Qaeda's Web site.”
It's possible, of course, that Byers could have sat at my side for the entire event and still thought I misjudged it; such interpretations are subjective. But had he witnessed all these remarks, and heard the hisses in the audience and observed the moderator's sneers, he might have understood better the exchange with Ahmed that followed. That's why there is no substitute for shoe-leather reporting.
Brian Beutler, a senior editor at the New Republic, understood this. He had attended Heritage events before, and he wrote Tuesday: “I think the video format in general does a disservice to how uncomfortable lopsided encounters in that strange environment really are. It's really jarring, and difficult to dislodge. There's just no way you leave thinking the altercation wasn't the key moment, or that the panel and the guests didn't let their collective id get the better of them.”
Beutler continued: “The point is that the diatribe itself was ugly and its reception unflattering to Heritage. And if you've attended similar events there, the atmospherics Milbank describes won't surprise you at all, even if the video doesn't convey them as well as he does.”
Byers, alas, may never have the experience. He reports that he's moving to California, where it will be just as easy to cover journalism the way he has covered it from Virginia. They have armchairs on the West Coast, too.
Midori 0.4.7 has reached a new level of downloading experience. Panel and statusbar consistently verify file integrity, show size, remaining time and speed of a file. An icon and expected file size are displayed before saving a file. External download managers, namely SteadyFlow, Aria2 or command-line based such as wget are available in the preferences. To counter phishing sites which fake downloads as demonstrated by Michal Zalewski the origin of the file is clearly visible. Finally, you can now save whole websites including any images, scripts and other resources – optionally.
On the topic of security Midori has reached another milestone. Goodbye colorful urlbar, you were beautiful but let's face it, once you get used to the colors nobody pays attention even when it's read. What this means is that SSL errors are now fatal by default – conveniently we can use GCR, a library based on GNOME keyring, to show plenty of detail for a certificate. Once you “Trust” a website other GCR-using applications can also trust it.
The cherry on the secure cake is HSTS, not to be confused with whatever Wikipedia may suggest it stands for, HTTP Strict Transport Security, which Midori recognizes and caches behind the scenes – no UI by design, you get SSL without typing https.

NEW YORK – The 2011 MLS season will see the league's two Canadian clubs operate on a more even playing field compared to their US-based counterparts.
The league announced on Friday that players considered domestic players in the United States will also be considered domestic players in Canada.
“We want to make sure the MLS teams from Canada are competitive with other MLS teams and, at the same time, we want to make sure we're creating the best environment for domestic players to develop in Canada,” MLS executive vice president of player relations and competition Todd Durbin told MLSsoccer.com.
“The backbone of the league has been and will continue to be the US domestic players, and that is a very large pool upon which our teams can draw from. If the Canadian teams are limited in their ability to draw from that pool, there's a possibility that it could impact them competitively on the field.”
With the freedom to select players from the pool of US and Canadian domestic players, the Vancouver Whitecaps, Toronto FC and future Canadian clubs will also be required to maintain a minimum of three Canadian players on their roster. Montreal is set to join the league in 2012.
The rule sets the first ever domestic-player minimum for MLS clubs in league history. Durbin expects Canadian teams to regularly exceed this number.
“You could in theory have a team with no Canadian domestics on it,” Durbin said. “That is clearly not our goal and it's not the goal of Vancouver or Toronto, who are committed to developing players.”
In order to monitor the impact on the development of Canadian players, MLS has partnered with the Canadian Soccer Association (CSA) in setting up a task force that will continually evaluate the rule, which expires after the 2015 season.
“MLS and the CSA will be working together to ensure that there's optimal player development opportunities for players in Canada,” Durbin said. “We'll also be reviewing the number of Canadian players on each MLS roster with the idea of balancing the need for MLS teams to be competitive and our collective commitment to developing players in Canada.”
Can religion help reduce violent crime?
Some new research suggests the answer is yes, both by creating a moral climate that fosters respect among neighbors and by helping to form individual consciences of young adults.
Violent crime decreased as greater numbers of people were religiously active in a community, according to a study analyzing crime and religion data from 182 counties in three states.
The effect was particularly pronounced in black violence in disadvantaged communities that are most likely to have the highest number of victims.
"In the big picture, religious presence seems to matter to the amount of violence and crime in a community," says Jeffery Ulmer, a professor of sociology and crime, law and justice at Pennsylvania State University who led the county-level study. "It matters to blacks, whites and Latinos."
Just don't expect young men and women who are among the growing numbers of people who consider themselves "spiritual but not religious" to have the same moral inhibitions.
A separate Baylor University study of more than 15,000 people ages 18 to 28 found that while young adults who considered themselves religious were less likely than others to commit violent or property crimes, those who claimed to be spiritual but set apart from organized religion were more likely to engage in both types of criminal activity.
Building social capital
Faith may be one of the most personal areas in the lives of individuals, but it can also collectively exert moral influence over a community, scholars say.
As a crime stopper, faith may be particularly effective in setting moral norms, building social ties and investing communities with a sense of meaning and purpose, counteracting the "moral cynicism" and individualism that can foster criminal behavior, researchers Ulmer and Casey Harris of the University of Arkansas note in the latest issue of The Sociological Quarterly.
Ulmer and Harris explored "Race and the Religious Contexts of Violence" in their study. They analyzed data from the U.S. Census, the Religious Congregations and Membership Study and crime reports from nearly 200 counties in New York California and Texas. All of the counties had substantial numbers of black, white and Latino residents.
What they found was not only evidence that religion may exert a protective influence discouraging violent crime, but that there are also racial-ethnic differences in the role of faith communities.
Consider these findings:
• Black and white violence decreased significantly as the percentage rose of county residents who belonged to congregations or were regular attenders.
• Black and Latino violence was lower in communities where residents belonged to similar types of religious institutions, indicating faith groups from similar traditions were able to exert greater influence on community values when they had a significant presence.
• Religious homogeneity was not associated with overall rates of white violence, but further breakdowns showed communities with larger percentages of evangelicals had lower rates of white violence. Latino violence was significantly reduced in communities with large numbers of active Catholics.
• Black violence dipped dramatically in counties with high levels of poverty, unemployment and low levels of education where large percentages of residents were active in congregations. This is a key finding, as communities with severe social and economic disadvantages are more likely to have high violent crime rates.
The findings suggest that religious groups have the ability to cultivate moral attitudes "that counteract the code of the streets," Ulmer says.
Building moral codes
But what about the impact of faith on the individual level?
Baylor researchers Sung Joon Jang and Aaron Franzen analyzed data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to examine differences in crime rates among young adults in four categories:
• Religious and spiritual.
• Spiritual but not religious.
• Religious but not spiritual
• Neither religious nor spiritual.
Individuals who identified themselves as "religious" were less likely to be offenders.
However, individuals who were "spiritual but not religious" were more prone to commit violent crime than their "religious and spiritual" counterparts and more likely to commit property crime than emerging adults who were "religious" or "neither religious nor spiritual."
"Is being 'spiritual' enough to reduce criminal propensity without also being religious? Our study suggests the answer is no - at least during emerging adulthood," Jang and Franzen write in a recent issue of the journal Criminology.
What both studies also suggest is that the role of religion should be considered as communities address issues of violent crime.
Communities lose out when they marginalize or trivialize the potential pro-social influences of religion, Jang says.

We've all seen them — the parents on the playground sitting hunched over their iPhones as their children teeter toward (or egg on) disaster. And chances are, we've also likely been them. But are the effects of our digital distraction really such a big deal? One father, a research fellow at Yale University, decided to find out, and the results of his study might make you cringe: Smartphones, Craig Palsson concludes, have caused an spike in the number of children getting injured, particularly for the 5-and-under set.
“I argue that smartphones have caused an increase in child injuries, and that at least part of this reason is that smartphones distract parents while they are supervising their children,” he writes in his 35-page report, “That Smarts! Smartphones and Child Injuries.” Palsson established causation between smartphones and child injuries by tracking two sets of data: the 10 percent increase of nonfatal, unintentional injuries to children between 2006 and 2012, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); and the 3G rollout data of corresponding cities as tracked by the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System.
VIDEO: Watch Kids React to Camera From 1998
“When 3G comes to the area, injuries increase, and I can control for other changes by looking at hospitals that don't have 3G yet,” Palsson explains in an email to Yahoo Parenting. “Furthermore, the patterns match what we expect if phones are distracting parents: Younger kids are affected more than older kids (who are under less supervision). And injuries increase in activities where parental supervision could make a difference — children are hurt on playgrounds, at pools, and falling down stairs.”
STORY: Is Mother's Intuition Real?
Palsson was in fact his own case study: He began noticing that using his phone — not even a smartphone! — was distracting him during playtime with his kids. “If parents are distracted enough that their kids are injured,” he says, “I think it's worth questioning how interactions are affected where the consequence is not immediate and salient.”
Those are the types of questions Catherine Steiner-Adair, clinical psychologist and author of “The Big Disconnect: Protecting Childhood and Family Relationships in the Digital Age,” contends with often in her research. “There is no question that parents are now challenged by the lure of their iPhone and the desire to ‘just check.' But that's when we'll miss our baby slipping in the bathtub or climbing out of a booster seat,” she tells Yahoo Parenting, noting that she's heard many parents speak of the guilt they felt when their child wound up with stitches for an injury received while they were busy texting. “When you are, quote, watching your child at the playground, and they are up on a slide and you are ‘just checking' your text or email, you are not watching them.”
But what if you've got really good, important reasons for using your smartphone when you're with your kids? Writer Jennifer Hicks recently raised that question in her essay “Dear Mom on the iPhone: You're Doing Fine,” pointing out that parents may be doing something worthwhile such as “responding to clients, sending a proposal,” or even posting on Facebook to “offer condolences for the loss of a loved one,” all while their child gets the benefit of playing in the fresh air. “Or maybe,” she writes, “you realize that watching your kid every second of every day isn't necessary and that it's totally acceptable and actually good for everyone involved — for you to have a few minutes to yourself. At the park. On your phone.”
But physical injuries may not be the only possible repercussions of such behavior, Steiner-Adair notes. In her 1,000-plus interviews with young children for her book, she's heard heartbreaking comments along the lines of: “My mommy's smartphone is the ‘stupid phone' — she talks on it when she's pushing me on the swing and I don't like it.” Because we've developed a psychological dependence on our devices, she warns, “we are unintentionally giving kids the idea that they are boring — because with just the sound of a ‘ping,' we will divert our attention from them, midsentence.”
She has a few suggestions to balance your attention between the kids and the device:
Former Toronto Maple Leafs coach John Brophy has died at the age of 83.
The native of Antigonish, N.S., had a legendary hockey career, spanning many leagues and decades. The news of his death was first reported by Hockey Night In Canada's Elliotte Friedman. Brophy passed away Monday morning, according to his family.
"Brophy is credited with more than 1,000 pro coaching victories, a number surpassed only by Scotty Bowman," Friedman tweeted.
Here he is last summer with CHI's Sr. V-P of Hockey Operations, Al MacIsaac, celebrating the Stanley Cup victory. <a href="https://t.co/SxVDBjWLiW">pic.twitter.com/SxVDBjWLiW</a> —@FriedgeHNIC
Old-school coach
The East Coast Hockey League, where Brophy coached for 13 seasons, said in a statement Monday that he died after a lengthy illness.
Mark Holden played under Brophy for three seasons in the 1980s on the Nova Scotia Voyagers team. He recalls Brophy as an "old-school type of coach."
"He didn't hold back, he wanted the win so bad. He certainly brought a 100 per cent to the game every night and expected that from his players too. "
'Demanding, intense'
Brophy took over head coaching duties of the Maple Leafs for the 1986-87 season, leading Toronto into the second round of the playoffs. He was fired 33 games into the 1988-89 season after the Leafs got off to an 11-20-2 start.
"Sad to hear on the passing of John Brophy - Maple Leafs coach who was demanding, intense, a tad out there & passionate," former Leafs centre Ed Olczyk posted on Twitter.
Brophy signed on as head coach of the ECHL's Hampton Roads Admirals for the 1989-90 season. He led the Admirals to three league titles over 11 seasons.
He ended his ECHL coaching career with two years behind the bench of the Wheeling Nailers, retiring after the 2002-03 season.
'Very popular'
It was after Brophy's time as a head coach with the Toronto Maple Leafs that CBC host Bruce Rainnie crossed paths with him.
Rainnie said during his time as a host with Hockey Night in Canada he often saw Brophy at charity golf events in the Maritimes. He remembers him as a "character."
"I think the most famous image of him was when he would get furious with the referee, he had this wicked shock of thick white hair and he had a face that would just get beet red so you had the contrast of the red face and the white hair," said Rainnie.
"He'd always punctuate every one of his outbursts with a door slam at the bench and he'd just fire it closed and glare at the referee with his red face and white hair."
A Million stitches and stories
Brophy was also known for his love of the good old-fashioned hockey game.
"He loved hockey played a certain way, played in that old style where it was a tough game, you took no quarter, you gave none and you fought for your space on the ice and your space on the team. He was a tough guy from that old school and he had a million scars, a million stitches and a million stories," Rainnie said.
And even though Brophy is well known for his character, Rainnie hopes he will be remembered as a tremendous coach as well.​
Many hockey insiders and fans took to Twitter to remember him Monday.
John Brophy was the perfect coach for the old Norris Division. What an amazing character. We'll never see another like him. —@DownGoesBrown

Meeting Michael Che in his office on the 17th floor of 30 Rockefeller Plaza would be considered a “home turf” interview. Visiting that famous 17th floor is always intimidating. It's lined with pictures of SNL cast members past and present, never letting you forget just where you are. The last time I was here, the show was off for winter break. It felt more like a museum. On this night, it was time for the famed Tuesday night writing sessions for the show Kristen Wiig will host four days later. There are real-life familiar faces everywhere. Kate McKinnon walks by and kind of gives me one of those, “Why is this stranger in my way?” kind of looks. New cast member Alex Moffat walks from one office to another. It kind of feels like a dormitory during the week of finals. Everyone has a “it's going to be a long night” look on their faces as they dart in an out of their respective offices.
Michael Che's office is tucked away in an area that I'd never be able to find if I wasn't led there. For being an office building, there are a lot of surprising nooks and crannies to this floor. Che's office is small, and it seems even smaller when the much-taller-than-expected Che stands up.
On November 25th, Netflix will release Che's comedy special, Michael Che Matters. Filmed in August, it's an hour of Che's opinions on social matters from Black Lives Matter, to Donald Trump, to the many times people on social media have gotten mad at him for the things he's said. As Che admits though, current events in our world change so fast and his opinions on Trump have changed drastically since this was filmed in early August. (Che jokes there should be a disclaimer that this was filmed in August.)
Not surprisingly, Che comes off a little guarded at first, as any normal human being would at the beginning of a long interview. Over the course of just under an hour, Che's guard did seem to let down a bit and he became a very compelling interview. He's honest and straightforward. He's funny, he's thoughtful, and he can be controversial. He still thinks Trump should have hosted SNL last season. I admit to him that I disagree with that. And that's the thing, I may not always agree with him, but he's always honest and he explains why he feels the way he does.
Michael Che is Michael Che. And in an era of constant fakery, there's something to be said for someone who is real.
On the way from my apartment to 30 Rock, I read that my shoes have been declared the official shoe of neo-Nazis.
I just found out about that today.
I have to get new shoes.
The Neo-Nazi party, I don't know that they are allowed to just say what businesses' brand statement is. They can say that about anything. What if they said that about Coca-Cola? Then is Coca-Cola not delicious anymore?
Well, since I was also drinking Coca-Cola, I'd really be having a bad day.
Exactly. I think with something like New Balance sneakers, people will make New Balance sneakers the victim of that because it's easy to cut New Balance sneakers out of your life.
These are kind of new. Do I have to get a new shoe right now?
Why is anyone listening to the Neo-Nazi party?
Because it's fucked up right now.
Don't listen to anybody! Let's just pretend for four years these people don't exist. Like, it's not a thing. It only affects us if we let them. Like, I could care less what the Neo Nazi party truly believes. They also believe in Christianity. That doesn't mean I can't believe in it.
Maybe I should just get Nikes.
Wait until you find out how Nike makes their sneakers. It's way worse than what the Neo Nazis say! What until you find out who makes these. Oh my lord. If you're only looking to buy products from good people, good luck being buck-naked. Because I've got to tell you, you're not going to find a lot of choices.
9th episode of the fourteenth season of South Park
"It's a Jersey Thing" is the ninth episode of the fourteenth season of the American animated television series South Park, and the 204th episode of the series overall. It premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on October 13, 2010. In the episode, New Jersey is rapidly taking over the nation one state at a time and their next stop is South Park. As the Jerseyites spill into Colorado and approach South Park, the town stands strong against the onslaught.
The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. In its original American broadcast on October 13, 2010, "It's a Jersey Thing" was watched by 3.253 million viewers, according to the Nielsen Media Research. It was the highest-viewed scripted show. It received a 1.9 rating/5% share among adult viewers between ages 18 and 49. This is the first episode to be announced immediately following another's airing since "The Passion of the Jew"; all other episodes since Season 9 have been announced on a Friday or a Monday. However, it is not the first to release a preview clip right after the previous episode. The episode "200" had a preview clip released for it the day after the episode before it, "You Have 0 Friends", was aired (even though that preview clip was not used in the final episode).
The episode revolves around the invasion of the Jerseyites, based on characters from the MTV reality show, Jersey Shore and from The Real Housewives of New Jersey on Bravo. Footage from the opening credits of the MTV series is used.
Plot [ edit ]
When a family from New Jersey moves into South Park, Sharon invites the family into their home for dinner. The tacky Jersey woman, Teresa Giudice from the Real Housewives of New Jersey becomes very obnoxious very quickly, and starts to insult Sharon and her friends, leading Sharon to insult her calmly. Teresa goes crazy and flips the dinner table and shouts expletives at Sharon, but is calmed down by her husband. Soon after, many people from New Jersey move into South Park and everyone starts to get annoyed with them. Randy calls a meeting at the Park County Community Center, where he reveals that New Jersey is trying to take over the country and already has everything east of the Rocky Mountains, with all of Colorado in danger of becoming "West Jersey". Meanwhile, after another altercation with the New Jersey housewives and Sharon at the hair salon Sheila reveals that she is originally from New Jersey after defending Sharon from the other ladies, and that she was once a notorious party girl nicknamed "S-Woww-Tittybang".[1] When the other families find out, Cartman shuns Kyle from their group, stating that if he is Jersey (along with being Jewish and ginger, which Cartman already hates him for), he is all bad. Later that night, Kyle (in a parody of the first transformation scene in Teen Wolf), seemingly unable to control his actions, begins to cut and grease his bushy Jewfro into a style similar to Pauly D's hairstyle from Jersey Shore. He is even more shocked to find Sheila now fully decked out in this fashion; Sheila tells Kyle that "it's not so bad, some people like the Jersey look", only to have Ike faint after looking into the room and spotting them. Sheila reveals to her son that he's technically from New Jersey: Kyle was conceived in New Jersey and during the first two months that Sheila was pregnant with him, she and Kyle's father, Gerald, were living with Sheila's parents in Newark, New Jersey. Whenever either of them is around New Jersey influences, she says, they will start to exhibit the same behavior.
Cartman's usual distrust of Kyle grows even stronger, since Kyle is now the "three J's" - "Jinger (ginger), Jersey and Jew", although Stan and Kenny don't seem to care and they just help out the other townspeople try to drive the Jerseyites out. Desperate for assistance, after having built a barricade of junk and handing out a stock of what appear to be lever-action rifles and muskets from crates of mysterious origin, Randy pleads for help from California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who tells him that the state cannot provide any assistance due to budget problems and general lack of concern (then Randy tries telling him that "if Colorado falls, you're next", only to be told that actually Utah and Nevada stand between California and the invasion). Likewise, Japan also refuses to help. At this, Randy decides they must seek help from their enemies: al-Qaeda. The townspeople are shocked at this idea, saying that the feelings of the families of the victims of 9/11 matter "another ten months" (the tenth anniversary of the attacks). But then Randy and other men are called to the bar, where in a satire of horror movie cliches they encounter a sex-crazed and barely human Snooki. In desperation, Randy videotapes a request for help from al-Qaeda and sends it to Osama bin Laden.
As the townspeople arm themselves and barricade the streets to stave off the invasion, Cartman asks Kyle to meet him at the Sizzler, with the intent of locking him in the meat freezer so he can't help the Jerseyites. Once Cartman opens the freezer, Snooki springs out and begins to rape him and Dog Poo. Kyle now fully transforms into a guido, complete with rings and gold neck chain and calling himself "Kyley B", and proceeds to insult and hit Snooki, until she flees the restaurant—which Cartman thanks Kyle for. In the streets, Randy violently interrogates Michael "The Situation" Sorrentino, who can only answer "It's just a Jersey thing, you know, you just gotta be from Jersey to get it." The townspeople hold off the hordes of Jerseyites until their ammunition runs out and their defense seems futile. However, just as the invaders begin to overrun the barricades, a fleet of al-Qaeda suicide pilots fly in and crash their planes into the ground, killing them all in a parody of Saving Private Ryan. At a town meeting soon after, Randy proudly thanks bin Laden for his help in stopping the invasion and reveals that their victory has inspired the rest of the East Coast to drive the Jerseyites back to their own state.
With the Jerseyites defeated, Cartman tells Kyle "You're a monster, but you're my little monster" - and just as bin Laden receives a hero medal, a Special Forces commando comes in and kills him. At first the people are shocked, but then Randy exclaims "We got him!"

Brad Trechak of AOL's TV Squad stated in his review "As a New Jersey native, I should have been really offended by tonight's episode of 'South Park.' Sadly, I was laughing too hard to notice."

So my Bath & Shower gift just arrived today, hot on the tail of my birthday, and what a gift it is...
First, let me start with the origin. The sender's address was a bit unusual to my eyes, so I looked it up. It is, ladies and gentlemen, a frikkin' warship! It looks super badass and impressive!
The package itself was quite large and had a cute drawing on the side. And inside.... oh my, the inside. So. Much. Stuff. I unpacked it with my boyfriend watching and we both giggled over some of the items and exclaimed at how awesome and thoughtful everything was.
The racks and the brush are very handy and I can't wait to try the soaps and the shampoos and the bath salts and those cute little cloth things which I have no idea what they are but they're so cute!
My gifter also included a hand-written note (fear not, dear sender, I have friends who do read Japanese, so they can figure out labels for me) and the empty box has already been claimed by one of my cats (because you can't have Japanese stuff without cats!).
This is, hands down, the best gift exchange experience I've ever had. Thank you, thank you, thank you!
And although I'm not an US citizen... thank you for your service.
It's now official: The country has lost more jobs as a percentage of peak employment than any time since the Great Depression.
This includes the recessions of the early 1980s, even when they are combined.
Those looking for a v-shaped recovery keep insisting that jobs will come roaring right back, the way they did in the 1948 recession (see the blue line in the chart from Calculated Risk below).
Anything's possible, but this seems unlikely. In 1948, U.S. consumers were not still saddled with the massive debts that are stifling consumption today. And consumers still represent 70%+ of spending.
The other interesting point with respect to the 1948 "V" is that we have now gone as many months from the peak as it took employment to recover in full in the 1948 recession. And we're still losing jobs.
Most importantly, regardless of what the jobs recovery eventually looks like, it hasn't started yet. The economy is still losing 250,000+ jobs a month. The average workweek, which should be the first indicator to turn up, also fell in August to match its record low. This would not seem to be consistent with a sustained, v-shaped recovery.
Calculated Risk:
UPDATE: Calculated Risk has published another version of this chart, one that shows the impact of estimated revisions to the jobs numbers. It looks even worse.
Here's CR's explanation:
The dashed line is an estimate of the impact of the large benchmark revision (824 thousand more jobs lost). The graph compares the job losses from the start of the employment recession in percentage terms (as opposed to the number of jobs lost). Instead of 7.2 million net jobs lost since December 2007, the preliminary benchmark estimate suggests the U.S. has lost over 8.0 million net jobs during that period.

Republicans are hopeful after Republicans' sweeping electoral victories on Tuesday night. They have every right to be. Republicans now control the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the presidency. President-Elect Donald Trump has promised to enact a largely conservative agenda; although he strayed from those proposals throughout the campaign, Republican domination across the land should encourage him to move forward on those promises.
There is, however, one possible obstacle.
His name is Mitch McConnell.
Senate Majority Leader McConnell will likely have 52 Republican votes with which to ram through elements of the Trump agenda. The top of that agenda is replacement of Justice Scalia with a conservative. In all likelihood, the Democrats will attempt to filibuster any such nomination. That means that McConnell will have to invoke the so-called “nuclear option,” whereby he appeals to the presiding officer of the Senate – in this case, Vice President Mike Pence – to allow a vote on the new justice without a three-fifths majority necessary to shutting down a filibuster. A simple majority vote is then taken to decide the new rules, and the justice is suddenly confirmable.
It's certainly questionable whether McConnell would invoke the nuclear option. That's particularly true if certain left-leaning Republican senators like Susan Collins (R-ME), John McCain (R-AZ), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) decide not to support such a maneuver. Then, McConnell would be stuck – he'd have to go back to Trump and bring forward a judicial nominee acceptable to a broader majority of senators. It's up to McConnell to keep Republicans in line.
The same is true with regard to the repeal of Obamacare. Democrats will undoubtedly attempt to filibuster; McConnell will once again be called upon to utilize the nuclear option. Will he do so? He hasn't said. Will enough Republicans back him? They haven't said.
All of this could foreshadow a serious break between Trump and McConnell from the beginning. Or, alternatively, it could presage a move to the left from both Trump and McConnell. In the best of all worlds, McConnell holds together the Republican coalition and pushes through some of the much-needed change Trump has promised to bring forth. But only time will tell if McConnell – a man many Republican voters thought was too weak-kneed in the first place – will stand up, or even if he can.

You hear words like “heartbreak,” “inspiration” and “comeback” used with Ole Miss junior wide receiver Laquon Treadwell, but none of them seem to be entirely fitting or worthy.
Perhaps that's because the way he sustained a horrific injury, on national television with a high-profile game on the line, or that it had such a wide-reaching impact. Regardless, Treadwell remains on pace to be back in the starting lineup when Ole Miss opens the season against Tennessee-Martin on Sept. 5.
“He's killing it,” junior tight end Evan Engram said. “He's come a long way from his injury, strength-wise, confidence-wise. He's back to being that leader—I mean he's never left as being a leader—but he's running around getting guys right, teaching the young guys.
“It's good to see him back, and he's having fun.”
Although Ole Miss players won't officially report to training camp until early August, Treadwell pushed himself through the spring and remained busy over the summer in hopes of not just returning but coming back a better player.
Teammates say he's lost a little weight, is jumping higher and may be even more explosive. Granted, there can be some hesitation when he's going through drills opposite defenders, which is normal for any player coming off a serious injury, but even his coaches can't stop raving about his progress.
“I'm anxious to get pads on him and see how he responds when the ball's a little high and in traffic,” Hugh Freeze said.
Of course, the last time Treadwell was in uniform was Nov. 1. Although Ole Miss was coming off a 10-7 loss at LSU, it was still ranked fourth in the playoff standings and hosting No. 3 Auburn. At minimum the winner would control its own destiny, and the stadium atmosphere matched the intensity from what was at stake.
Down 35-31, the Rebels' season was hanging in the balance in the fourth quarter. The offense had just lost a fumble inside the Auburn 10, while the defense was in the process of giving up a then-season high in points and yards (507).
Brynn Anderson/Associated Press
Only one minute, 38 seconds remained on the clock when the Rebels snapped the ball facing 3rd-and-3 at the Auburn 20. With three wide receivers lined up to the left, the call was a play-action, catch-and-run screen pass to Treadwell, who stepped back and caught it at about the 23. With a burst he eluded two would-be tacklers and quickly closed in on the goal line.
With Auburn attacking, the only player who had a chance to stop him was Kris Frost, who had started the play on the other side of the field. Because Treadwell already had a step on him, the linebacker had to try and pull him down from behind.
The force of the tackle caused Treadwell to swing back the arm carrying the ball, which had yet to cross the goal line, but in the process Frost landed on the speedster's planted left leg, resulting in a fracture and dislocated ankle.
“Extremely unfortunate,” Frost said. “It was one of those freak accident plays that just kind of happens when playing this rough sport that we play.”
Although initially ruled a go-ahead touchdown, replay confirmed that it was actually a fumble, with Auburn's Cassanova McKinzy recovering in the end zone. For Ole Miss, whose fans had been poised to celebrate another dramatic win, it didn't just suck the joy out of Vaught-Hemingway Stadium but the season too.
“The way it ended, it hurt,” senior safety Mike Hilton said. “We all thought he scored at first. He didn't, and the way he got hurt it really brought our energy down.”
Things just weren't the same after that, even in practice, and coupled with some other key injuries, Ole Miss struggled down the stretch. It meandered through a 48-0 victory against Presbyterian and the subsequent bye week, only to make six turnovers during a crushing 30-0 loss at Arkansas.
Ole Miss closed out the regular season with a 31-17 victory against rival Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl but was pounded by a hungry TCU team in the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl, 42-3.
“For it to happen like it did, adversity is certainly a teaching tool, but that next week, I don't know—I tried everything in the world, but I didn't sense that we could rebound from it,” Freeze said.

Only now can the players fully see that Treadwell's injury was really a mortal wound for the 2014 season.
“It took a lot out of us,” senior linebacker C.J. Johnson said. “To lose any player like that would hurt, but to lose Laquon, that was something that was tough for us to bounce back from.”
But with Treadwell back, optimism has returned to Oxford, and he's become one of those rare players who just about everyone in the SEC can't help but root for. Even Frost, who reached out to Treadwell the day after the injury, made a point to watch the Ole Miss spring game and enjoyed seeing the wide receiver run around on the sideline.
He might not like it so much in a couple of months.
“We feel like we're refreshed,” Johnson said.
“I think we're going to do something special,” Hilton said.
