Keys hitting a forehand (Noel Alberto/VAVEL)
Madison Keys and Coco Vandeweghe met once again after meeting a couple of weeks ago at the Bank of the West Classic in Stanford. Keys won that in a tight, straight sets affair. At the Western and Southern Open, it would be Keys who would once again get the better of her good friend winning 6-4, 3-6, 6-3.
Key Takes Opener As Vandeweghe Struggles On Serve
Both women struggled on serve early on as they had to save break points in their opening service game. The 25-year-old continued to struggle and was broken in her second service game after hitting a shot into the net. Keys would hold quickly to love to consolidate a 3-1 lead.
After Vandeweghe was broken, we were back to seeing what many are used to, quick service games. Once again however, the Australian Open semifinalist was pushed to deuce. In this game, Keys hit a ball that was called out but the 16th seed challenged it, and the ball was clearly inside the baseline, much to the dismay of the 22-year-old as they had to replay the point.
Keys would finish off the first set on her second set point, taking the set on a forehand winner.
Vandeweghe Dominant On Serve Once Again
Vandeweghe opened the second set serving and quickly fell into a 15-30 hole with Keys really attacking the Vandeweghe backhand. The 25-year-old would get pushed to deuce but held with a forehand cross-court winner. Vandeweghe was beginning to take control of the points, and it showed as she broke Keys at 15 for a 2-0 lead.
With the world number 23 down a break point in her following service game, she put away a volley to get it to deuce. She went on to hold for 3-0. Keys would go on to hold at 15 but still remained down 1-3.
At 3-5, 30-15 down, Keys was looking to try and put some pressure on the 25-year-old, but a huge forehand put Keys on the defense before an easy cross-court put away gave Vandeweghe set points. The American number four closed out the set with a massive ace down the tee to take it 6-3.
Key Prevails Despite Conceding Break Lead
Keys held easily to start the decisive set and then broke Vandeweghe in her opening service game to grab the early lead. The Stanford champion was dominant on serve to take a 3-0 lead. The 25-year-old American would not back down though, holding at 30 to get on the board to in the final set.
The 22-year-old faced break point in her next service game but a huge forehand forced an error out of Vandeweghe to get to deuce. After staving off another break point, a long backhand by Keys put the final set back on serve. Vandeweghe went on to level it at three-all.
After holding for 4-3, Keys went on to break for a 5-3 lead to serve out for the match. Despite going 40-0 up, Vandeweghe would try and go down swinging saving all three match points with the third coming off of a huge forehand winner. Despite her efforts, it was not enough as Keys would go on to prevail 6-3 in the third
HELSINKI – Finland has become the first country in Europe to pay its unemployed citizens a basic monthly income, amounting to 560 euros ($787 CAD), in a unique social experiment which is hoped to cut government red tape, reduce poverty and boost employment.
Olli Kangas from the Finnish government agency KELA, which is responsible for the country's social benefits, said Monday that the two-year trial with the 2,000 randomly picked citizens who receive unemployment benefits kicked off Jan. 1.
Those chosen will receive 560 euros every month, with no reporting requirements on how they spend it. The amount will be deducted from any benefits they already receive.

The average private sector income in Finland is 3,500 euros per month, according to official data.
Kangas said the scheme's idea is to abolish the “disincentive problem” among the unemployed.
The trial aims to discourage people's fears “of losing out something”, he said, adding that the selected persons would continue to receive the 560 euros even after receiving a job.
A jobless person may currently refuse a low-income or short-term job in the fear of having his financial benefits reduced drastically under Finland's generous but complex social security system.

“It's highly interesting to see how it makes people behave,” Kangas said. “Will this lead them to boldly experiment with different kinds of jobs? Or, as some critics claim, make them lazier with the knowledge of getting a basic income without doing anything?”
The unemployment rate of Finland, a nation of 5.5 million, stood at 8.1 per cent in November with some 213,000 people without a job — unchanged from the previous year.
The scheme is part of the measures by the centre-right government of Prime Minister Juha Sipila to tackle Finland's joblessness problem.
Kangas said the basic income experiment may be expanded later to other low-income groups such as freelancers, small-scale entrepreneurs and part-time workers.

SHIMLA - Indian police on Wednesday were forced to escort water tankers through the streets of Shimla as an unprecedented shortage sparked brawls and desperation in the Himalayan hotspot popular with the rich and famous.
The mountain getaway is generally crowded with vacationers but hotels are closing and tourists being told to stay away as a crippling water shortage pinches the picturesque retreat.
Anxious residents have been waiting for hours in queues hundreds deep to collect water, filling buckets at tankers guarded by police.
“We all know for the past fortnight the situation is so bad that people are getting water barely once in a week,” Sanjay Chauhan, a former mayor of Shimla, told AFP.
Shimla, the erstwhile summer capital of British India, requires around 42 million litres per day but often suffers water shortages in the summer.
But supply has dipped by nearly half this year, sparking what residents say is the worst shortage in living memory.
The mountainous northern state of Himachal Pradesh endured record-low snowfall during the winter which experts say is responsible for taps running dry earlier than usual.
But some residents in Shimla, the state capital, say water has been syphoned off to hotels for the well-heeled or to VIP estates.
Protests outside the chief minister's home late Tuesday turned violent, with demonstrators clashing with police and chanting slogans against the local government.
The state's highest court has asked for an explanation from authorities and a plan for managing the crisis.
But critics say the water scarcity underscores the strain placed on Shimla every summer as tens of thousands descend on it.
A social media campaign urging tourists to avoid Shimla until the crisis passes has gone viral online.
“Don't visit Shimla this year, let the place breathe for a while, it's overcrowded and exploited to the limits,” reads the campaign slogan circulating on social media platforms like WhatsApp.
Many hoteliers and travel agents say the bad publicity is already having an impact.
Shimla is usually brimming with tourists in summer as temperatures on India's lower plains hover around 46 degrees Celsius (115 Fahrenheit).
But visitors were cancelling bookings or shortening their trips, said travel agent Mohit Sharma.
“Booking inquiries for June have dried up. Those who had booked rooms are asking to be shifted to other places outside Shimla or cancelling their bookings,” he told AFP.

Peru's President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski speaks during an interview at the Reuters Latin American Investment Summit in Lima, Peru August 11, 2017.
LIMA (Reuters) - President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski told Reuters Friday that he was more focused on improving government administration by cutting red tape than on proposing new economic reforms as growth slows to a likely 2.5 percent or "maybe a little bit more" this year.
In an interview for Reuters Latin American Investment Summit, Kuczynski said economic growth in Peru was gathering steam and would likely show an "important change" in coming months, thanks to recovering internal credit and increasing prices for the Andean nation's key copper and gold exports.
Severe flooding and a massive graft scandal involving Brazilian builder Odebrecht early this year knocked 2 percentage points off the government's initial 4.5 percent growth forecast for this year.
"It's disappointing but that's how life is," Kuczynski, a former Wall Street banker and World Bank economist, said in the presidential palace in Lima's historic center.
But Peru's growth prospects going forward are solid, Kuczynski added, shrugging off questions about whether he might propose new economic reforms.
"Everyone talks about reforms and more reforms," said Kuczynski. "In Peru, we don't need a lot of legislation. We already have more than 32,000 laws. What we need is good administration. And administration has become...impeded by too many regulations, bureaucracy, paperwork."
The central government's payroll rose sharply during the term of ex-President Ollanta Humala, swelling Peru's already-bloated bureaucracy even more, Kuczynski said. But he ruled out any lay-offs, saying he would instead work to make public administration more efficient as the economy expands.
Companies in Peru have long complained about slow government approvals that stalls investments. At the same time, government offices in Peru, from ministries to small municipalities, often fail to spend all of their budgets - delaying public work projects that could drive growth.
Kuczynski said his government was now in the final stages of fine-tuning the rules for new laws that will slash red tape.
"Almost all of it is ready," Kuczynski said.
Last year, Kuczynski's government posted a fiscal deficit equal to 2.6 percent of gross domestic product, missing its 3 percent target as it strove to balance pleasing credit ratings agencies with providing a stimulus to bolster domestic demand.
"Things might have been done better," said Kuczynski, a centrist who took office a year ago. "Peru has a very modest fiscal deficit."
Kuczynski's government now aims to post a 3 percent deficit this year before widening it to 3.5 percent in 2018 as it rebuilds infrastructure in parts of Peru hit by flooding.
"Peru has a strong internal economy. We're seeing it now. Cement sales, for example, are recovering after falling for three years," Kuczynski said.

Millions of Americans are sporting fitness trackers these days.
These devices track your activity, but they also collect data on your sleep.
Doctor Cathy Goldstein is passionate about sleep. She gets eight to nine hours a day.
She's a neurologist at the University of Michigan Sleep Disorder Center.
“You're not as productive of a person, you're not as happy as a person, and you're not as healthy as a person without sufficient sleep," Goldstein said.
She cautions most activity trackers tend to overestimate our sleep time.
But Goldstein says anything that makes you more aware of how much sleep you're getting can be helpful.
"If you're trying to track your weight, your calories, your exercise, even your mood… you could use a sleep tracker, track your duration, and how it relates to those other outcomes," Goldstein said.
Goldstein says one of the most useful new features of sleep trackers and smart phones is focused on helping you maintain a consistent sleep schedule.
Keeping your bedtime and wake time the same even on weekends can dramatically improve your sleep.
"Spend eight hours at a minimum attempting at sleep. Avoid bright light particularly that from electronics before sundown and wake up at the same time every day even on the weekends to stabilize that internal clock. That works better than any pillow, mattress, app or wearable on the market in improving your sleep" Goldstein said.
Experts also say that if your activity tracker shows you are getting sufficient sleep, but you still don't feel rested, you may be suffering from a sleep disorder and you should see your doctor or a sleep specialist.

The soldiers arrived, as they often did, long after sunset.
It was June, and the newlyweds were asleep in their home, surrounded by the fields of wheat they farmed in western Myanmar. Without warning, seven soldiers burst into the house and charged into their bedroom.
The woman, a Rohingya Muslim who agreed to be identified by her first initial, F, knew enough to be terrified. She knew the military had been attacking Rohingya villages, as part of what the United Nations has called ethnic cleansing in the mostly Buddhist nation. She heard just days before that soldiers had killed her parents, and that her brother was missing.
This time, F says, the soldiers had come for her.
The men bound her husband with rope. They ripped the scarf from her head and tied it around his mouth.
They yanked off her jewelry and tore off her clothes. They threw her to the floor.
And then the first soldier began to rape her.
She struggled against him, but four men held her down and beat her with sticks. She stared in panic at her husband, who stared back helplessly. He finally wriggled the gag out of his mouth and screamed.
And then she watched as a soldier fired a bullet into the chest of the man she had married only one month before. Another soldier slit his throat.
Her mind grew fuzzy. When the soldiers were finished, they dragged her naked body outside and set her bamboo house ablaze.
It would be two months before she realized her misery was far from over: She was pregnant.

The rape of Rohingya women by Myanmar's security forces has been sweeping and methodical, the Associated Press found in interviews with 29 women and girls who fled to neighbouring Bangladesh. These sexual assault survivors from several refugee camps were interviewed separately and extensively.
They ranged in age from 13 to 35, came from a wide swath of villages in Myanmar's Rakhine state and described assaults between October 2016 and mid-September.
READ MORE: UN says Myanmar forces may be guilty of genocide against Rohingya
Foreign journalists are banned from the Rohingya region of Rakhine, making it nearly impossible to independently verify each woman's report. Yet there was a sickening sameness to their stories, with distinct patterns in their accounts, their assailants' uniforms and the details of the rapes themselves.
The testimonies bolster the U.N.'s contention that Myanmar's armed forces are systematically employing rape as a “calculated tool of terror” aimed at exterminating the Rohingya people. The Myanmar armed forces did not respond to multiple requests from the AP for comment, but an internal military investigation last month concluded that none of the assaults ever took place.

And when journalists asked about rape allegations during a government-organized trip to Rakhine in September, Rakhine's minister for border affairs, Phone Tint, replied: “These women were claiming they were raped, but look at their appearances – do you think they are that attractive to be raped?”
Doctors and aid workers, however, say that they are stunned at the sheer volume of rapes, and suspect only a fraction of women has come forward. Medecins Sans Frontieres doctors have treated 113 sexual violence survivors since August, a third of them under 18. The youngest was 9.
The U.N. has called the Rohingya the most persecuted minority on earth, with Myanmar denying them citizenship and basic rights. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees now live in sweltering tents in Bangladesh, where the stifling air smells of excrement from a lack of latrines and of smoke from wood fires to cook what little food there is.
The women and girls in this story gave the AP their names but agreed to be publicly identified only by their first initial, citing fears they or their families would be killed by Myanmar's military.
Each described attacks that involved groups of men from Myanmar's security forces, often coupled with other forms of extreme violence. Every woman except one said the assailants wore military-style uniforms, generally dark green or camouflage. The lone woman who described her attackers as wearing plain clothes said her neighbours recognized them from the local military outpost.
Many women said the uniforms bore various patches featuring stars or, in a couple cases, arrows. Such patches represent the different units of Myanmar's army.
The most common attack described went much like F's. In several other cases, women said, security forces surrounded a village, separated men from women, then took the women to a second location to gang rape them.
The women spoke of seeing their children slaughtered in front of them, their husbands beaten and shot. They spoke of burying their loved ones in the darkness and leaving the bodies of their babies behind. They spoke of the searing pain of rapes that felt as if they would never end, and of days-long journeys on foot to Bangladesh while still bleeding and hobbled.
They spoke and they spoke, the words erupting from many of them in frantic, tortured bursts.
N, who says she survived a rape but lost her husband, her country and her peace, speaks because there is little else she can do – and because she hopes that somebody will listen.
“I have nothing left,” she says. “All I have left are my words.”
After showing signs of progress two weeks ago, the Arizona Coyotes took a few steps backward last week, as they lost all three of their contests in regulation and were outscored 10-2 in the process.
Coyotes Endure Rough Week
The ‘Yotes had a few days off following their 3-2 overtime loss in Las Vegas on Dec. 3, but they got back to work in Boston on Thursday night with a matchup against the Bruins. The Coyotes had lost 11 straight against Boston entering the game, and things quickly went downhill in this one as well – Brad Marchand scored just 15 seconds into the first period and David Backes added his first two goals of the season during the second frame as the Bruins ran away with a 6-1 victory.
Following their blowout in Boston, the Coyotes headed to Columbus and looked to redeem themselves against the Blue Jackets on Saturday night. However, just as they did in Boston, the Coyotes again conceded an early goal, as Josh Anderson scored at the 30-second mark of the first period. Antti Raanta shut the door the rest of the way, but the ‘Yotes couldn't solve Jackets' netminder Sergei Bobrovsky, who turned away all 35 shots he saw for his league-leading fourth shutout of the season.
The Coyotes finished the week on Sunday night in Chicago with a matchup against the Blackhawks. Despite playing the night before, Arizona played well during the game's first two periods. However, things fell apart in the third, when Chicago's potent offense finally broke through for three goals on Scott Wedgewood as the ‘Hawks earned a hard-fought 3-1 victory at the United Center.
Coyotes Hosting Top Teams
After returning home following Sunday's loss in Chicago, the Coyotes will be back in action on Thursday night at Gila River Arena as they'll kick off a five-game homestand against the Tampa Bay Lightning. Thanks to their league-leading offense (3.75 goals per game), the Lightning sit atop the standings and are the league's best team – as of this writing, they hold a .759 points percentage (P%). If they continue to win at their current pace, they'll become the first team to finish an 82-game season with a P% of .750 or higher since the 2005-06 Detroit Red Wings. Puck drop is scheduled for 7:00 P.M. in Glendale.
Things won't get any easier on Saturday, as the two-time defending Stanley Cup-champion Pittsburgh Penguins will come to town. It should be an interesting night in Glendale – Pittsburgh already defeated Arizona earlier this season at PPG Paints Arena, but the Coyotes have won the last two matchups at Gila River Arena, including a 4-3 overtime victory last season. Puck drop is scheduled for 6:00 P.M. in the Valley of the Sun.
Raanta Returns
Saturday night's 1-0 loss in Columbus likely didn't draw much attention throughout the league, but it was indeed a significant game for Arizona – it marked Antti Raanta's first appearance since suffering an upper-body injury against the San Jose Sharks on Nov. 22.
After an inauspicious start (Josh Anderson scored at the 30-second mark of the opening period), Raanta locked things down in goal – he stopped 33 of the 34 shots he faced on the night, but ended up on the wrong end of a 1-0 decision, as Blue Jackets' netminder Sergei Bobrovsky pitched a shutout.
It appears as if Raanta has picked up right where he left off prior to his injury, and that's good news for the Coyotes – the 28-year-old netminder has now stopped 99 of the last 103 shots (good for a .961 SV%) thrown his way over his past four contests. He's kept Arizona in each of his past handful of appearances in net, and, barring another injury, should be a key piece for the Coyotes moving forward.
Pacific Division Roundup
We've entered the season's third month, and the Los Angeles Kings are threatening to run away with the Pacific Division crown. Here's how Arizona's other division rivals fared last week:
Anaheim Ducks (12-11-7, 31 points)
Last week: 1-0-2 (4-3 SOL at VGK, 3-0 W vs OTT, 3-2 OTL vs MIN)
1-0-2 (4-3 SOL at VGK, 3-0 W vs OTT, 3-2 OTL vs MIN) Analysis: Anaheim extended their point streak to four games last week, but, unfortunately, they have just one win over that stretch. There's no shame in losing in overtime, but the Ducks will need to start winning some games if they wish to climb up the standings in the Western Conference.

2-1-1 (5-2 L vs PHI, 2-1 SOL at TOR, 3-2 OTW at MTL, 4-2 W vs VAN) Analysis: After suffering a 5-2 home loss to the Philadelphia Flyers on Monday night, the Flames bounced back in a big way – the went 2-0-1 to finish the week and kept pace with the rest of the pack in the Western Conference as a result. If Calgary can get some consistency from Mike Smith (allowed 2, 1, 5, 5, and 0 goals in last five appearances), they can be a dangerous team come playoff time.

1-2-0 (4-2 L vs PHI, 6-2 W at MTL, 1-0 L at TOR) Analysis: The Oilers continue to struggle in the consistency department – they scored six goals on Saturday against the Montreal Canadiens, but scored two goals combined in their other two games against the Flyers and Maple Leafs. Laurent Brossoit is doing all he can to keep the Oilers in contention while Cam Talbot recovers from an injury, but he'll need some support from his offense in order to do so.

3-0-0 (5-2 W vs MIN, 4-3 OTW vs OTT, 3-2 OTW vs CAR) Analysis: The Kings stayed hot last week – they've now won eight straight games and are running away with the Pacific Division. Los Angeles has it all – two outstanding goaltenders (Jonathan Quick and Darcy Kuemper), a Selke candidate (Anze Kopitar), a Norris candidate (Drew Doughty), and a resurgent Dustin Brown, who is on pace for his first 50-plus point season since the 2011-12 Stanley Cup championship campaign. Could the Kings potentially bring home the Cup once again this season?

2-1-1 (4-1 L at WSH, 5-4 OTW vs CAR, 5-0 W vs OTT, 4-3 OTL vs MIN) Analysis: After struggling offensively for most of the season, it appears as if the Sharks' offense has finally broken through – San Jose generated 14 goals in four games last week and picked up five points in the standings as a result. Brent Burns, in particular, is red-hot – he's recorded two points in each of his last three games and is making up for a slow start in a big way.

1-2-0 (3-0 W vs CAR, 4-1 L vs PHI, 4-2 L at CGY) Analysis: It was a strange week in Vancouver – the Canucks opened their week up with a 3-0 shutout victory over the Carolina Hurricanes, but then allowed four goals in each of their next two games to fall out of a playoff spot in the Western Conference. Vancouver needs to be better on home ice – their 5-6-3 home record is the fifth-worst in the league.

We're almost halfway through the season, folks – it's time to start taking the Golden Knights seriously. They're contenders in the Western Conference and will get Marc-Andre Fleury back this week, as the veteran netminder was activated from injured reserve on Sunday after missing 25 games with a concussion.

HARARE,– Demand for rice has increased by 300 percent from 50,000 tonnes per year in 2007 to 200,000 tonnes per year in 2016 as Zimbabweans shift to alternative cereals to bridge the shortfall for grains and the high cost of maize, Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe chairperson, Tafadzwa Musarara told Parliamentarians on Tuesday.
The southern African nation has suffered from intermittent droughts in recent years, forcing the country to rely on grain imports. An El Nino-induced drought in the 2015/2016 season has left at least 4,1 million people needing food aid, and the country importing 1,4 million tonnes of maize.
“Rice is slowly becoming a staple food in the country as consumer behavior is changing….in 2007 rice demand was 50,000 per year but in 2016 it was 200,000 per year,” Musarara told members of the parliamentary portfolio committee on lands, agriculture mechanisation and irrigation.
Changing tastes and consumer options have seen increased preference for rice as a substitute for maize. At the turn of the century, Zimbabwe's consumption of the staple maize grain was close to 2 million tonnes annually.
“Maize meal production currently stands at 38,000 (monthly) metric tonnes with imports of maize meal supplying another 20,000 (per month). Cheap GMO maize meal imports dominate the southern part of the country and they are killing small scale indigenous millers and slowing the full resuscitation of Blue Ribbon represented here which was recently acquired by a foreign investor,” Musarara said.
He said the GMAZ expects to take up approximately 800,000 metric tonnes of maize produced under the government's command agriculture programme. The government is yet to provide its crop forecast for the 2016/17 season, but has indicated that the hectarage under maize has increased by 61 percent, to 1.2 million hectares, over the previous season.
“In order to enhance its sustainability, the GMA has committed to off-take 800,000 metric tons of maize that will be grown this year. This arrangement will also serve as import substitution, saving the country more than $250 million.”
Blue Ribbon also committed to buy about 100,000 tonnes of maize from the scheme.
However, Musarara called for the repeal of Statutory Instrument 20 (SI20), which imposes a 15 percent value added tax on commodities such as maize meal, potatoes and rice, saying it was making life difficult for producers and consumers.
Last week, Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa told Parliament that government was shelving the tax, but is yet to legally revoke the statutory instrument. – Source
Kim Kardashian did a lot of opening up during her appearance at the Forbes Women's Sumit yesterday. The reality star and mother of two shared details on her upcoming cosmetics line, social media behavior and recovering from her traumatic robbery.
Read some of the best soundbites, from her onstage appearance and interviews, below:

On Kanye West's performance as an Instagram Husband: "We tried to [have a photoshoot in Tokyo], and it was such a mess. He just was not the best photographer. I was like, 'You ruined what my social media was going to look like.' So we scrapped that shoot, but we got the good experience."
On the difficulty of choosing what to post on social media: "It's such a struggle. It really is. If people think you just post and it's so easy, it's not. I like my Instagram to look a certain way."
On dealing with online haters: "Absolutely it affects me… there could be one or two negative comments that really do affect you, and get to you. You know I'm human just like everyone else. Like things do hurt my feelings, but I think that I do have a really thick skin."

On why she and Kanye are starting a kids' clothing line: "[It's] something that Kanye and I have worked on for, really, years just having our own kids' clothes made. Almost everything we've had made. That's been such a fun journey to have our kids really inspire us, and to see our creations, from the cutest bathing suits, to dresses, to fancy clothes. And now we've been trying to make shoes, and getting our kids' input. It's just been so fun."
On what she learned from taking time out of the spotlight after her robbery: "I think it was so beneficial to take time off. I think people don't realize, in life, no matter what you do, no matter who you are, you have to take time off for yourself and for your family, other than work, especially if you're a workaholic like I am. I think it was really beneficial and a great growth process for me."

Such a tremendous honor to be on the cover of @forbes! I never dreamed this would happen and know my Dad would be so proud. #NotBadForAGirlWithNoTalent 😍😜 A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Jul 11, 2016 at 8:16am PDT
On why she tagged #NotBadForAGirlWithNoTalent when she shared her Forbes cover last year: "That was such a proud moment. That was powerful, to me. It was a marker to prove to me how hard I really have worked. Not to say that everyone needs a cover to make them feel like they really achieved something, but I think for all the scrutiny that's out there, for people that think that 'What am I doing?' or 'How did I get here?' That was a prideful [sic] moment for me. I think that's why I kind of put that cheeky hashtag when I posted it."
On trying to be a role model: "I definitely obviously have made my fair share of mistakes like everyone else, but I hope to never repeat those mistakes and just learn from what I've done. If people or young girls or kids can look up to just someone that works really hard and focuses on really what I want and makes that happen, then I hope that inspires them."

South Korean prosecutors said Monday they have indicted a mixed martial arts fighter for his involvement in a match-fixing scam.
Bang Tae-hyun has been accused of taking a bribe of 100 million won ($87,950) from match-fixing brokers in exchange for throwing a bout at the Ultimate Fighting Championship event in South Korea in 2015. He will face a trial without detention.
According to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, Bang agreed to lose the contest against Leo Kuntz at UFC Fight Night 79 in Seoul. The scam, however, didn't succeed as the lightweight fighter apparently changed his mind at the last moment and went on to beat Kuntz with a split decision.

Bang reportedly decided not to throw the match after UFC officials warned him about fight fixing following a sudden shift in betting patterns on gambling websites. The 34-year-old was first listed as the slight favorite against Kuntz, but just hours before the fight the UFC officials caught drastic changes in odds that made him the underdog and his American opponent the overwhelming favorite.Bang is no longer with the UFC, the world's largest MMA promotion. After the UFC event in Seoul, Bang fought once more in Germany at the UFC Fight Night 93, where he lost to Nick Hein by unanimous decision.Bang was the seventh South Korean to enter the Octagon after he signed with the UFC in late 2013.The prosecutors also indicted fight-fixing brokers and those who helped them, adding that one of them was former MMA fighter Kim Dae-won.Kim, who previously completed in Japan-based MMA promotions like DEEP and Pride, told his acquaintances that he can fix the UFC bout by persuading Bang and later consulted with the brokers for fixing, according to the prosecutors.

Altered Carbon, released today by Netflix, is adapted from a science fiction novel by Richard K. Morgan. It tells the story of Takeshi Kovacs, a one-time rebel (played by Joel Kinnaman) who's forced to take on the role of detective and track down a rich man's murderer.
The twist: The murder victim is also Kovacs' employer, because the series takes place in a future where human consciousness can be transferred between bodies.
In this week's episode of TechCrunch's Original Content podcast, Jordan Crook, Darrell Etherington and Anthony Ha offer their initial thoughts on the series, which livens up a familiar, Blade Runner-y setting with some big science fiction ideas — and it expects viewers to keep up without much explanation.
We also discuss YouTube TV's launch on Roku and Apple TV and HBO's online growth. And while it's not streaming-related, we had to talk about the accident Darrell was in while testing out automated driving tech.

NEW DELHI - Fierce storms which swept across northern India have killed at least 47, taking the death toll from freak weather over the past month to several hundred, officials said Tuesday.
The storms and lightning strikes toppled walls and power pylons or electrocuted victims, as temperatures in India rose as high as 48.6 Celsius (119.5 Fahrenheit).
Disaster management officials in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand said 47 people had died in night-time storms that swept across the region.
Bihar was the worst hit, pounded by strong winds and thunderbolts.
“At least 19 people have been confirmed dead. 11 of them due to lightning,” Yoginder Singh, a Bihar state disaster management official, told AFP.
The wild weather extended into neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, where winds of up to 70 kilometres (43 miles) an hour buffeted India's most populous state.
“Fifteen people were killed by overnight lightning and high-speed winds,” said T.P. Gupta of the Uttar Pradesh disaster management department.
Another 10 people were injured, some with burns after being struck by lightning, he added. Many people in rural India sleep outdoors in summer to escape the searing heat, making them more vulnerable to storms.
Nearly 200 people have died in Uttar Pradesh this month in powerful sandstorms. Scores have died in other states.
In Jharkhand east of Bihar, 13 people died and six were injured in violent weather overnight, said Sushil Kumar, the head of the state's disaster management department.
The Indian Meteorological Department has warned that more storms and heavy rain could hit Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in the next two days.
Extreme heat has also gripped many parts of India, with a high of 48.6 degree Celsius recorded Monday in Khajuraho in the central state of Madhya Pradesh.
In Delhi and much of northern India, daytime temperatures have been above 40 Celsius for the the past week.
Weather experts said there would be some respite this week after the annual monsoon season began in the southern state of Kerala on Tuesday. The monsoon will gradually move north.
Storms are customary during the summer months but the intensity and death toll has been higher than normal this year.

He's both the mayor of one of Canada's fastest-growing cities and chairs a group of Canadian mayors that lobbies the federal government on urban issues. But while Don Iveson may wield plenty of political influence, it seems the mayor is less persuasive when it comes to starting NHL playoff traditions.

Edmonton's mayor is taking part in a solo “#PlayoffBeard” challenge, letting his facial fuzz flourish as the Edmonton Oilers embark on their first NHL playoff run since a Cinderella-like trip to the Stanley Cup finals in the 2005-2006 season.

The playoff beard is an NHL tradition among hockey players, the length of their bristles bespeaking the level of post-season success their team has achieved. But Iveson never planned to forego the razor and shaving cream on his own.
After the Oilers' loss to the San Jose Sharks in their first-round playoff series, Iveson tweeted out a playoff beard challenge, calling on several of Canada's big city mayors to join in.
“Last night was tough for (Canada flag emoji), so let's change it up & grow some #NHLplayoffs beards!” Iveson tweeted on Thursday. “You in @DenisCoderre @johntory @JimWatsonOttawa @nenshi?”
Well, it seems the other mayors weren't as hyped about the hockey challenge as Iveson took to the social media platform again on Sunday to display a scruffy new look and tweeted the following:
“#PlayoffBeard challenge may not have caught on with other Mayors, but what the heck… I'm all in for #orangecrush. #GoOilersGo!”

Perhaps Iveson's playoff beard is having a positive effect on the Oilers. After losing Game 1 to the Sharks, the team posted back-to-back wins since Iveson tweeted his playoff beard challenge and now holds a 2-1 series lead over San Jose.

Fittingly, the player who scored the game-winning goal in both games is none other than forward Zach Kassian, a man sporting some impressive facial hair of his own these days: mutton chops.
Game 4 of the series between the Oilers and Sharks gets underway in San Jose on Tuesday at 8 p.m. MT.
PARIS-French world number 60 Oceane Dodin risks a five-year ban after refusing to play in this weekend's Fed Cup tie against Spain.
The 20-year-old was called up by last year's finalists, captained by former French great Yannick Noah, to replace injured Caroline Garcia for the world group playoff in Roanne in central France. But the French Tennis Federation announced Monday that Dodin was refusing to play, leaving her facing punishment from a simple warning to a five year ban from competition.
At the Australian Open in Melbourne in January, Dodin said she was not enthusiastic about playing for her country. Dodin's snub comes after France's number two player Garcia rejected her place in the national team 24 hours after being picked, blaming sciatic nerve pain.
After losing last September's final to the Czech Republic Garcia had told the federation she did not want to take part in France's 2017 campaign.
She was summoned last week to the tennis headquarters to prove her injury to a federation approved doctor. With Garcia and Dodin, missing Noah has called on world number 204 Amandine Hesse to join Alize Cornet, Kristina Mladenovic and Pauline Parmentier on Saturday and Sunday's play-off.
Dodin is coached by her father Frederic. She turned professional in 2012 and has one WTA title to her name, defeating American Lauren Davis in the final of the Quebec tournament last year. The federation revealed her decision in a Twitter post: "Oceane Dodin has refused to play, replaced by Amandine Hesse. Team in place in Roanne."
France, champions in 1997 and 2003, are one of only four nations to have taken part in every Fed Cup since its inception in 1963. Spain will be without French Open champion Garbine Muguruza who is recovering from an ankle injury. They will be led by world 59 Lara Arruabarrena.
At Thornlea Secondary School, Alek Minassian would sometimes come into the computer lab during class but Reza Fakhteh couldn't recall him ever speaking a word.
“He'd basically just purr and meow and act like a cat. I never heard him speak,” said Fakhteh, who graduated in 2009. “He'd literally act like a person who was trying to act like a cat.”
Seemingly harmless and innocent, Minassian appeared to live in his own world, he said. “He didn't talk,” Fakhteh said. “He ran away from girls. If you bothered him, he might hiss at you.”
Minassian, 25, appeared in court on Tuesday charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and 13 counts of attempted murder. Toronto police said a 14th attempted murder charge would soon be laid.
On Monday morning, as Toronto was basking in its long-awaited spring weather, Minassian went to a Ryder truck outlet north of the city and rented a panel van, Det.-Sgt. Graham Gibson said at a news conference.
Then he “is alleged to have posted a cryptic message on Facebook,” the homicide detective said. The brief message read, “The Incel Rebellion has already begun … All hail the Supreme Gentleman Elliot Rodger!”
An Incel is an involuntarily celibate man. Rodger killed six people in California in 2014 and left a manifesto expressing his inability to find a girlfriend and hatred of women.

When Minassian got to the Yonge and Finch area, he proceeded south on Yonge Street “deliberately striking pedestrians on the sidewalk and roadway with the vehicle,” Gibson said.
Police said they received a call about the incident at 1:25 p.m. Seven minutes later, Minassian was arrested and taken to Toronto Police 32 Division. The victims were “predominantly female,” Gibson said.
Police would not comment on Minassian's motive.

On Facebook, former students of the high school Minassian attended north of Toronto described the alleged killer as a “special needs” student. “He was known to meow like a cat and try to bite people,” a Facebook user named Alexander Alexandrovitch wrote.
Said Fakhteh, “He just seemed like a really innocent kid.”
According to property records, a Richmond Hill home that police attended following Monday's attack is owned by Vahe and Sona Minassian. A 2009 article in the Richmond Hill Liberal newspaper quoted Sona Minassian saying that her son “lives with a form of autism known as Asperger's syndrome.” But the article did not name the son and it remained unclear whether she was referring to Alek Minassian.
Following high school, Minassian studied for several years at Seneca College, according to a LinkedIn account in his name. The Department of National Defence said he was a member of the Canadian Armed Forces from Aug. 23 to Oct. 25, but did not complete recruit training and asked to be released after just 16 days.

A few weeks ago, Morrissey said some awful shit in two separate interviews with German newspaper Der Spiegel and British newspaper The Sunday Times that amounted to defenses of serial sexual predators like Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey, saying that victims should have known what could have happened. “You must be careful as far as ‘sexual harassment' is concerned, because often it can be just a pathetic attempt at courtship,” he told The Sunday Times. Morrissey later said on stage that the Der Spiegel interview was “the last print interview [he] will ever do.”
And now he's doubled down on that in a new statement, which says that Der Spiegel misquoted him. (No mention of The Sunday Times interview.) “Would I kill Donald Trump? No, never,” it reads in a list of hypotheticals. “Would I support Kevin Spacey's private proclivities? No never. Would I ever support abuse of children? No, never. Would I support sexual harassment? No, never.” It goes on from there, and ends with a note saying that Morrissey's team requested “unchopped, un-fiddled-with audio” of their interview together but were allegedly refused. Here's the full statement:
Morrissey cancelled the last few shows of his North American tour, including his scheduled appearance at this past weekend's KROQ Christmas show.
It all started 12 years ago with a pack of lights from the pharmacy.
Now, Sammi Hajjar's Christmas display features a whopping 100,000 lights and endless Christmas magic at his Ahuntsic-Cartierville home.
The 24-year-old worked on the installation for 300 hours and spent $50,000 to bring his vision to life: a Frozen-themed castle complete with 30 inflatable Olafs.
Hajjar says he does it all to bring a little Christmas cheer to his neighbourhood.
“Everyone that comes and says thank you and all the smiles it puts on people's faces,” Hajjar said.
Every year, he adds more lights and this year he has music synched up to the display.
His passion is drawing visitors from across Quebec.
WATCH: A home in Cartierville is attracting a lot of attention with its Frozen-themed Christmas light display.
Christina Mokouch and her children took a two-and-a-half hour flight from Northern Quebec just to see the display in person.
“It's the first time I see a lot of lights like that,” Mokouch told Global News.
During weekends, Hajjar says it's hard to keep up, with up to a thousand visitors.

The over-the-top decorations can even create some traffic in the area.
This year, Hajjar is putting an extra effort in the hopes of landing a spot at an international Christmas lights competition.
“They sent me an email that they really found it nice and that I actually have a chance,” Hajjar says.
“I'm gonna have to step it up a lot,” Hajjar said with a smile, confessing he already has big plans for next year.

The Payne County District Attorney's Office has released surveillance video showing a Stillwater, Oklahoma bonds woman shooting and killing a client on August 9, 2017. 41-year-old Chasity Carey was acquitted last week of the first-degree murder of 38-year-old Brandon Williams. Williams was one of her clients and Carey reportedly told officers she had called Williams to her office that morning with the intent of taking him into custody and revoking his $35,000 bond. She was arrested hours after she called 911 saying she had shot Williams at her office. She told investigators a fight broke out between her and Williams during the meeting and that she shot Williams in self-defense.

Ann Arbor — Moving from quarterback to tight ends wasn't exactly what Zach Gentry had envisioned when he got to Michigan.
But Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh saw Gentry as a natural fight at tight end, and the 6-foot-7, 244-pound redshirt sophomore made the move.
He admits it wasn't something he immediately understood.
“Maybe not at first, but I do now,” Gentry said this week.
Gentry is coming off a Purdue game two weeks ago in which he scored his first career touchdown, a 12-yard pass from quarterback John O'Korn. So far this season he has six catches for 119 yards and it is an obvious matchup problem for the defense.
The seventh-ranked Wolverines (4-0, 1-0 Big Ten) face Michigan State (3-1, 1-0) at Michigan Stadium in a prime-time kickoff.
That Gentry is now the second-leading receiver among tight ends — just behind Sean McKeon who has 120 receiving yards — does not surprise the easy-going New Mexico-native.
“I worked really hard during the offseason, gained the weight I needed to gain,” Gentry said this week. “The athleticism was always there, but I just needed to piece it all together and really figure out the position through and through. There are a lot of little things that take a long time to get used to, but once you get them down they become second nature.”
It was never his nature as a quarterback, obviously, to learn how to block. Besides adding weight and strength, working on this aspect of the game was a priority.
“Definitely blocking. Pass protection and blocking,” Gentry said when asked where he made big improvements in the offseason. “That was something that was completely new to me at first — I was pretty bad at it. I definitely think I've improved a lot in that area.”
Just how bad?
“It was completely foreign to me,” he said. “I was the guy in practice (as a quarterback) that you weren't allowed to touch. Having to block Taco Charlton and Chris Wormley was…”
Gentry paused to laugh at the thought of facing those two current NFL defensive linemen.
“That was something that — I was pretty bad in just getting down, pad level and aggression and firing out. Those are things that take a while to get used to. It's been a process.”
And sometimes the process was slow.
“It's been tough,” Gentry said. “There have been a lot of things that go rough. Things go south. You have to keep getting back up and practicing harder every day.”
The tight ends have developed a strong on-field rapport with the quarterbacks, both Wilton Speight, who is injured and sidelined for several games, and John O'Korn, who will make his first start of the season Saturday night against MSU.
Gentry said O'Korn won't miss a beat.
“We (the tight ends) have a strong chemistry (with O'Korn),” Gentry said. “Every day after practice, we stick around with the quarterbacks and get some extra balls and run some extra routes, so the chemistry is there. The tight ends, we're a hard-working group and have a lot of guys who can contribute. We're constantly rolling guys in and out, so as long as we keep working hard we'll keep making plays for us.”
Because Gentry is from New Mexico, he obviously did not grow up in the Michigan-Michigan State rivalry. Back home it was all about the Rio Grande Rivalry between New Mexico and New Mexico State, but he was not unfamiliar with this rivalry.
“I was definitely aware of it,” Gentry said. “I used to wake up and because of the time change, the Michigan games were always the first ones on TV so I was aware of it. Always watched it growing up.”
His first experience was the game two years ago with the wild finish in the final 10 seconds that gave Michigan State the victory.
“We always practice pretty intensely, but there's been a little different feeling in the air,” he said this week. “We're flying around a bit more and hitting a little harder.”
While it's the next game on the schedule, even those from out of the state know this is not just another game.
“There are a lot of guys from the state of Michigan, so everybody knows it's an important one for us,” he said.

With director Baltasar Kormakur's Adrift opening in theaters this weekend, I recently sat down with stars Shailene Woodley and Sam Claflin to talk about bringing the incredible true story to the screen. If you're not familiar with the film, Adrift is based on the true story of sailors Tami Oldham (Woodley) and Richard Sharp (Claflin), who set out on a transpacific journey only to get caught in a massive hurricane and lost adrift at sea. With Richard badly injured and their boat seriously damaged, Tami must work to save both of them from the hardships of the ocean.
During the interview, they talked about being part of a survival film where the woman is the protagonist, the various challenges of filming on the ocean, what it was like working with cinematographer Robert Richardson, if they felt any pressure to get it on the first take due to the hard conditions, what they had to do to get the impressive shot for the cliff jump, and a lot more.
Check out what they had to say in the player above and below is exactly what we talked about followed by the synopsis.
Shailene Woodley & Sam Claflin:
How you don't see many films about survival with a woman being the protagonist.
What was it like working with cinematographer Robert Richardson?
The challenges of filming this on the ocean.
They talk about filming the cliff jump and what they had to do to get the shot.
Did they feel additional pressure on set to get it right the first time they shot it?
Here's the official synopsis for Adrift:
The strongest reduction was recorded in construction. Jobs in this sector fell by 3%. Construction companies projected a decline in employment for March, although in a smaller proportion than the previous two months. That situation is reflected in the streets. From 08:00 until 18:00, Fulton Meldranda, a 48-year-old father of four, holds a sign that can read: electrician, plumber, and builder in downtown Guayaquil.
“The situation remains difficult. There is no work,” he said last Thursday. Since 2016 the job offer has been reduced for this worker and so far in 2017, the situation has not changed. In the best of weeks you can earn up to USD 200, but there are also bad days.

On the basis of recommendations by six members search committee, reputed educationist Dr Tariq Banuri has been appointed as chairman of the Higher Education Commission (HEC). Dr Banuri, an economist with significant national and international distinctions, has been selected as the 4th permanent chief of the HEC. He was also a member of the original steering committee that prepared the blueprint for the reform of higher education in the country. Academic & civil society circles, vice chancellors and Chairperson of Punjab HEC have hailed the transparent and merit-based appointment of Dr Banuri.
In his initial media talk, the new HEC Chairman vowed to work for the improvement of quality standards in the higher education. Expressing his views about bringing improvement in the higher education sector, he said that students and faculty would be the major focus under his stewardship. Higher Education Commission –established in 2002– is one of the significant institutions of the country. It performs important functions in higher education sector pertaining to accreditation of new and existing universities, degree awarding institutions, funding (both development and recurring), planning and development, recognition and equivalency of degrees, setting policy guidelines such as in the appointment and promotion of faculty, research, quality assurance, faculty development programs and in improving the standard of university education in country.
The stakeholders have also expected that new HEC chief would address the key challenges and problems being faced by higher education sector and especially ascended during last few years.
The recent annual report released by Human Rights Commission of Pakistan described the state of higher education in Pakistan in one sentence “The focus has not been on the promotion of higher education, but on legal battles and survival issues.” The report, like that of the previous year, stated that higher education remained neglected and according to Quacquarelli Symonds-(QS) World Universities Rankings for the year 2017 saw only one of our 180 plus universities included in the top 500 universities. In the World University Ranking for 2017, issued by Times Higher Education, one Pakistani university made it to the top 500, whereas only two universities were included in the top 800.
The first and foremost challenge is to follow transparent and merit-based mechanisms for the appointment in higher education sector following the universal principle of “right man at the right job.”
When HEC was established in 2002, it was easy to manage thirty plus university, but now in Pakistan, the number of recognised universities has been increased to 188 with more than 110 additional countrywide campuses. Out of them, only 19% of universities are federally charted universities while provincial governments chart the majority of the universities, 81% (152 out of 188). Like the other federations, the provincial governments are governing the universities established by provincial authorities.
The multiple challenges that Pakistani higher education sector is facing can be effectively dealt through meaningful and collaborative continuous engagement among federal and provincial higher education bodies, i.e. provincial HECs especially in the light of 18th Constitutional Amendment and the decision of 35th meeting of Council of Common Interests (CCI).
Special attention is required for improving quality of teaching and research in higher education, the inclusion of Pakistani universities among top-ranked international and regional universities, playing a facilitative and supportive role to universities through catering their growing needs. It is only possible through harmony and respecting one another's constitutional and legal role/mandate.
The most critical challenge for the new HEC head is bringing about positive reforms within HEC through ensuring regular meetings of HEC s' governing board, the key body responsible for the formulation of policies and responsible for the improvement of higher education in the country. It is unfortunate that the body remained dysfunctional during last few years and even the critical policy decisions were made without its prior approval. Other organisational issues which require immediate attention are ensuring transparency and merit in key decisions, bringing an end to adhocism within HEC through discouraging the culture of deputation & extension and ensuring publication of HEC annual reports.
The other significant challenges in the higher education sector which require the immediate attention of new HEC chief include, restoring HEC‘s role as a supportive and facilitative body through respecting the autonomy of universities in the light of recommendations of Steering Committee on Higher Education 2002. Dr Tariq Banuri himself played a vital role in preparing these recommendations along with other reputed academicians. The other important recommendations of the steering committee also included guaranteed academic freedom, enhancing academic quality, faculty empowerment through greater participation in decision-making, de-politicisation of campuses and involvement of civil society and the corporate sector.
It is quite misfortunate that hundreds of jobless PhD holders could be seen protesting sometimes outside the HEC and press club. It is hoped that new HEC chief would also play his role in their placements.
Being first HEC chairman with social sciences background, it is expected that he would play his vital role for revival of social sciences in Pakistan through meaningful engagement with other organisations working for strengthening social sciences i.e. Inter-University Consortium for Promotion of Social Sciences, American Institute of Pakistan Studies, Working Group on Higher Education Reforms and Council of Social Sciences.
He would also play a proactive role in effective implementation of the decision by Senate of Pakistan‘s Functional Committee decision regarding amendments in HEC Act in the light of 18th Constitutional Amendment, extending the retirement age of university faculty from 60 to 65 years and restoring 75% tax rebate for university teachers and researchers.
As per the United Kingdom higher education model which is ranked as the 2nd most robust higher education system, there is need to separate the functions of funding, quality assurance and university ranking in Pakistan.
It is also hoped that new HEC chief would undertake some concrete steps to address structural problems in higher education through wider consultation and involvement of concerned stakeholders.

The Army's Explosive Ordnance Disposal team safely detonated a live hand grenade at a remote location in Kalaheo, Kauai, on Monday afternoon.
No injuries were reported.
A male resident discovered the grenade in his belongings and walked it to the Kalaheo fire station on Saturday afternoon.
Kauai police were immediately notified and requested the assistance of an explosive specialist from the Transportation Security Administration, who determined that the device was a live M22 hand grenade.
The TSA explosive specialist and Kauai police contained the grenade in a secured location until the Army's EOD team, based out of Kaneohe, arrived on island on Monday.
The device was transported to a remote location in Kalaheo and safely detonated at approximately 3:23 p.m.
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP)  A Missouri Republican legislator has come under strong criticism for cutting the microphone to silence the head of the state's NAACP chapter, who was speaking out at a public hearing against a bill that would restrict discrimination lawsuits.
A video by liberal advocacy group Progress Missouri shows Pineville Republican Rep. Bill Lant telling NAACP President Rod Chapel, "please contain your speech to speaking on the bill, sir," during the hearing Monday.
"Oh, but I am because this is nothing but Jim Crow," Chapel responded, referring to the bill. "You do not legalize discrimination on an individual basis and call it anything else."
Lant then turned off the microphone for Chapel, who continued speaking until Lant interrupted him and called on someone else to speak.

The bill would require plaintiffs bringing discrimination lawsuits to prove that race, religion, sex or other protected status was the motivating factor for discrimination or being fired, rather than just a contributing factor. It also would prevent employees from suing other employees and cap damages.
Chapel said at a news conference Tuesday that Lant's actions were discriminatory. Lant told The Associated Press that he apologizes if Chapel "got that feeling."
"I was trying to control the hearing," Lant said. "I had made the statement early in the hearing that time was precious, that we were trying to conserve time (and) that we were asking everyone to stay on point. He was off point."
Chapel and others have called for Lant to be replaced as chairman of the House Special Committee on Litigation Reform.
"A white man abused his power to stop a black man from expressing a contrary view, and on legislation that seeks to turn back the clock on Missouri's anti-discrimination laws, no less," House Minority Leader Gail McCann Beatty, who also is president of the Legislative Black Caucus Foundation, wrote in a letter to the Republican House Speaker Todd Richardson calling for Lant to be replaced. "In his silencing of the NAACP president, Rep. Lant proved that discrimination continues to thrive in our state and demonstrated the need for strong laws protecting our civil rights."
Richardson told reporters that he's not demoting Lant. He told Chapel in front of a crowd gathered in the Capitol for a St. Louis County NAACP event that he's "always welcome" to present his views and the views of the organization.
"This is a place where more than anywhere else, we are supposed to respect the times we disagree with each other but still have that dialogue," Richardson said.
Gov. Eric Greitens also spoke at the event but didn't mention the incident. He didn't take questions from reporters, and his office didn't respond to requests for comment.

Feb 1 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc on Thursday reported a profit near $2 billion, the largest in its history, as the online retailer drew millions of new customers to its Prime fast-shipping club for the holiday season and as changes to U.S. tax law added to its bottom line.
Shares rose more than 6 percent in extended trading, after previously closing down 4 percent on the Nasdaq.
Seattle-based Amazon is using fast shipping, television shows exclusive to its website and forays into new technology, such as its voice-controlled Alexa devices, to attract high-spending Prime members. Amazon said price cuts at Whole Foods Market, which it acquired for $13.7 billion last year, are helping it win grocery sales, too.
The world's largest online retailer said net income more than doubled to $1.86 billion, or $3.75 per share in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. Its profit received a provisional $789 million boost from the U.S. Republican tax bill passed in December. Analysts on average were expecting just $1.85 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. (tmsnrt.rs/24gibla)
“This was another blow-out quarter for Amazon,” said GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives. “The retail strength was eye-popping as the company had a banner holiday season and looked to capture roughly 50 percent of all e-commerce holiday season sales.”
As expected, the period running from before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday through New Years was Amazon's biggest-ever by revenue. Sales rose 38 percent to $60.5 billion in the quarter, beating estimates.
The company's fast delivery, like its two-hour Prime Now service, has helped win over holiday shoppers eager to avoid the crowds of big box retailers. Prime saw more than 4 million sign-ups in one week alone last quarter, and revenue from subscription fees grew 49 percent to $3.2 billion, Amazon said.
That figure is expected to rise this quarter in part because the company recently raised the fee for month-to-month Prime plans, affecting some 30 percent of subscribers, according to analysts at Cowen & Co. Some 60 million, or close to half of all U.S. households, are estimated to have Prime subscriptions.
Advertising and other revenue rose 62 percent to $1.74 billion.
Perhaps the surprise star of the past quarter was Amazon's voice aide Alexa, embedded in the company's Echo speakers and Fire TV players, as well as some cars and house gadgets. Millions of Amazon customers ordered goods by voice with Alexa in the past year, said Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, on a call with reporters.
“Our 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them,” added Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief executive, in a statement. “We don't see positive surprises of this magnitude very often — expect us to double down.”
HEAVY SPENDING
Amazon's stock has outperformed the S&P 500, rising almost 50 percent since the start of the fourth quarter, compared with the S&P's 12 percent rise.
Its shares trade at a premium to those of many peers. The stock's price-to-earnings ratio is nearly 12 times that of cloud computing rival Microsoft Corp, for instance.
Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is dueling with Microsoft to handle data and computing for large enterprises, saw its profit margin expand from the third quarter.
This was a “sign of platform strength despite increasing competition,” said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian in a research note.
AWS posted a 45 percent rise in sales to $5.1 billion.
Amazon said it expects operating profit in the current quarter of between $300 million and $1 billion. Analysts were expecting $1.5 billion, according to analytics firm FactSet.
Olsavsky, Amazon's CFO, told reporters, “We're still in heavy investment mode.”
The company has become notorious for running on a low profit margin. Yet its big bets on new services and entry into new industries have reaped shareholders rewards over the past decade, including its founder Bezos, now the richest man in the world.
Amazon continues to spend on a wide array of areas. It is expanding its retail footprint outside the United States, particularly in India, and almost doubled its international operating loss to $919 million in the fourth quarter. Amazon's global headcount is up 66 percent from a year ago at 566,000 full-time and part-time employees, thanks to a hiring spree and an influx of workers from Whole Foods Market.
And earlier this week, it announced a partnership with JPMorgan Chase & Co and Berkshire Hathaway Inc to determine how to cut health costs for hundreds of thousands of their employees.
The company said it plans to spend more on video content this year as well, with a prequel television series to “The Lord of the Rings” in the works. Analysts estimate Amazon spent $4.5 billion or more in 2017.
“Revenue and margins vastly exceeded expectations, and cost control was impressive, so that's what people are focused on,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter, adding, “It's clear that they will spend a lot more in 2018.”

While the Ottawa Senators made it past the trade deadline without dealing Mike Hoffman, rumors about the team shopping the 28-year-old have persisted. With Senators GM Pierre Dorion taking in back-to-back Edmonton Oilers games last week, there have been rumblings that the Senators are interested in acquiring Ryan Nugent-Hopkins from the Oilers in exchange for the scoring winger.
The Oilers were one of the many teams attached to Hoffman since trade rumors first surfaced in December, but the two parties never worked out a deal. Of course, the Oilers would likely want more than just Hoffman in exchange for a 24-year-old centre who has proven his worth at both ends of the ice.
Hoffman, while an extremely talented scorer with elite skating and shooting ability, has a reputation of being a one-dimensional player. Assuming the Oilers want to acquire Hoffman to put him on Connor McDavid's wing, though, the 28-year-old could very well be scoring so many goals that fans won't have time to complain about his defensive play.
Hoffman could be a great fit in Edmonton, but with any deal that involves two highly skilled players, it isn't easy to evaluate whether or not the trade would be worth making.
Senators Need Centre Depth
The Derick Brassard trade created a significant hole at centre in Ottawa, with Jean-Gabriel Pageau currently centring the team's second line. Pageau's play has improved since taking on this bigger role, but he does not provide the offense that Nugent-Hopkins would.
Prospects like White and Logan Brown should be on the Senators soon, but there's no guarantee that they'll immediately contribute at the level expected of a top-six forward.
This makes adding a proven centre like Nugent-Hopkins a logical move. Similar to Brassard, Nugent-Hopkins is an effective two-way forward that could give the Senators two very good forward lines. Considering Ottawa's plan to get younger and faster, Nugent-Hopkins is a good fit.
Adding another talented centre gives the Senators some flexibility, letting them play Zack Smith on the wing and giving Pageau more favorable matchups on the third line. Nugent-Hopkins is also able to play left wing, and even though Ottawa would probably rather have someone who could play on the right side if they're losing Hoffman, this still gives the Sens more options at forward.
Cody Ceci Another Option for Oilers
While bringing in Nugent-Hopkins would solve some of Ottawa's issues, losing Hoffman would bring other problems to light. Without Hoffman, the Sens are going to need a scoring winger to play with Matt Duchene. Duchene and Hoffman have developed excellent chemistry over the course of the season, and it's definitely in Ottawa's best interest to keep their number-one centre happy.
If Hoffman isn't part of the deal, would the Oilers be interested in someone else on the Senators? It's no secret that Edmonton GM Peter Chiarelli has been looking to add a defenceman, and with Cody Ceci heading into restricted free agency this summer, the Sens need to figure out how the 24-year-old defenceman fits into their plans.
While the Sens GM has been public about his adoration of Ceci, the Sens are already due to sign Mark Stone, another impending RFA, to a big extension in the offseason. The big minutes that Ceci has taken on this year mean that he will want to be paid top-four-defenceman money despite his inconsistent play.
Does This Trade Improve the Senators?
The Oilers would likely ask for a package in return for Nugent-Hopkins, though, no matter who the centerpiece of the trade is. While Chiarelli has a history of making one-for-one deals, he'll be pressured to get a great return for this former first overall pick after the fallout from the Taylor Hall trade.
Whether or not Dorion pursues Nugent-Hopkins in the offseason will give Sens fans a better idea of what his plan is going forward, particularly if the Oilers want another roster player from the Senators as part of the deal. Nugent-Hopkins is a phenomenal player, so this trade would be less about selling assets than it would be about Dorion actually trying to improve his team. However, depending on what the Sens have to give up, there's no guarantee they'll actually be better off in the end.
When the Senators added Matt Duchene, they showed a willingness to pay a big price to land an elite player. The team had enough good prospects to justify trading futures, but if the Sens are serious about getting younger, they'll have to be very careful in their dealings with Edmonton.
The Kelowna Fire Department responded to a house fire in Kelowna around 6:30 a.m. on Friday.
When crews arrived they found smoke coming from the eaves of the residence.
When firefighters went inside, they found the fire originated in the basement.
The fire was knocked down quickly, but not before there was some damage to the main floor of the house.
Four people were at home at the time of the fire. Two females were taken to hospital to be checked out with smoke inhalation.
The fire is under investigation.
SYDNEY (Reuters) - The All Blacks juggernaut hit a road bump in the British and Irish Lions series but it should be back to business as usual for the world champions when they take on South Africa, Australia and Argentina in the Rugby Championship.
New Zealand reduced their rivals to roadkill when they took the title last year, winning all six matches with try-scoring bonus points and bookending their campaign with crushing wins in Australia (42-8) and South Africa (57-15).
The sustained pressure the Lions were able to put the All Blacks under in their drawn series in June and July would normally offer hope to the Wallabies and Springboks were not both proud rugby nations at such a low ebb.
Argentina look even less likely to beat the All Blacks for the first time and it is against the other two nations they will be targeting the two wins they want in their sixth crack at the southern hemisphere championship.
The Pumas take their quest initially to Port Elizabeth to face South Africa on Saturday after reigning champions New Zealand and Australia have opened the tournament in Sydney, the first of three Bledisloe Cups tests this season.
The Wallabies once again have the unenviable task of taking on the All Blacks in back-to-back tests at the start of their campaign and only the most optimistic of Australians are expecting a first win in six matches against their neighbours.
A wretched Super Rugby campaign when none of the five Australian teams managed a single victory over New Zealand opposition in 26 attempts sandwiched a disappointing June test window when the Wallabies were humbled at home by Scotland.
Michael Cheika remains confident the re-building process he embarked upon after reaching the final of the 2015 World Cup is on course and that his team have a genuine chance of taking possession of the Bledisloe Cup for the first time since 2003.
Australia have won just eight of their 18 tests since the World Cup final, however, and coach Cheika was not exactly spoiled for choice when he named flanker Michael Hooper his new captain last month.
All Blacks coach Steve Hansen has, by contrast, been able to maintain New Zealand's extraordinary winning rate despite rebuilding his team in the wake of the departure of a handful of greats after the successful defence of the Webb Ellis Cup.
IMPRESSIVE SPINE
Beauden Barrett will lead the line from flyhalf, Kieran Read captains the side from the back of the scrum and a third World Rugby Player of the Year, lock Brodie Retallick, completes an impressive spine.
Dane Coles has the talent to join that trio in claiming rugby's highest individual prize and the hooker should play some part in the championship despite missing the opener because of a head knock.
South Africa restored some pride to the Springboks shirt in June with a 3-0 home sweep of France and some of their players have at least enjoyed some success at provincial level after the Lions reached a second consecutive Super Rugby final.
The exciting Lions outfit now provides the spine of Allister Coetzee's Springboks team even if the inspirational captain of both sides, Warren Whiteley, will miss the Rugby Championship because of a groin injury.
Coetzee still has to convince many that he is the right man to lead South Africa to the next World Cup and will be looking to harness the spirit Johan Ackermann built with the Lions in Johannesburg.
While South Africa are languishing at fifth in the world rankings, Argentina is a lowly ninth after two home defeats to a second string England side in June.
Daniel Hourcade's side are in danger of plateauing after taking a single win each of his first three seasons in charge and have yet to reap the expected dividend of having most of the squad also playing for the Jaguares in Super Rugby.
It is now 10 years since Argentina's breakthrough third place at the World Cup and, with the future alignment of southern hemisphere rugby by no means certain, the Pumas could do with making a statement or two in this Rugby Championship.

DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson held almost an hour of talks with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday after flying to Tehran to seek the release of a jailed British-Iranian aid worker.
“Both spoke forthrightly about the obstacles in the relationship and agreed on the need to make progress in all areas,” said a spokeswoman for Britain's Foreign Office after Johnson concluded what was only the third visit to Iran by a British foreign minister in the past 14 years.
The Foreign Office confirmed Johnson had raised “consular cases of dual nationals” during talks. These cases include Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who Britain says was visiting family on holiday in April 2016 when she was jailed by Iran for attempting to overthrow the government.
The woman's husband later told Sky News that a court appearance scheduled in Iran for Sunday had been postponed. “I think I am very optimistic today,” Richard Ratcliffe said.
He added that he hoped his wife would be home before Christmas but cautioned that there could still be setbacks.
“Without doubt having the foreign secretary there was a big thing. Without doubt the court case not happening is a big thing. There may be a number of big things that have to happen before she's home, but ... as I sit here I am a lot more optimistic than I was.”
Iranian state television had reported that “bilateral relations, the nuclear deal and regional developments made up the axis of the talks”, between the president and Johnson.
TWO-DAY VISIT

The case of Zaghari-Ratcliffe has taken on domestic political importance after Johnson said last month that she had been teaching journalists in Iran, which her employer denies. Johnson later apologised. Opponents have called for him to resign if his comments lead to her serving longer in prison.
Johnson met Ali Akbar Salehi, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization earlier on Sunday and had talks with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif on Saturday.
The two-day visit took place against a complex backdrop of historical, regional and bilateral tensions.
“It has been a worthwhile visit and we leave with a sense that both sides want to keep up the momentum to resolve the difficult issues in the bilateral relationship and preserve the nuclear deal,” the Foreign Office spokeswoman added.
International sanctions against Iran have only recently been lifted as part of the 2015 multilateral nuclear deal to curb Tehran's disputed uranium enrichment programme.
That deal is under threat after U.S. President Donald Trump decided to decertify Iran's compliance with its terms. Johnson told Zarif he believed the deal should be fully implemented.
Zaghari-Ratcliffe is not the only dual national being held in Iran, but has become the highest profile case.
A project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, she was sentenced to five years in prison after being convicted by an Iranian court of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment. She denies the charges.
The Thomson Reuters Foundation is a charity organisation that is independent of Thomson Reuters and operates independently of Reuters News. It says Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been on holiday and had not been teaching journalism in Iran.
WATERLOO — A 26-year-old Waterloo man has been charged with dangerous driving following a collision with an OPP cruiser Monday afternoon that left one officer with serious injuries.
Xiaobing Zheng was driving eastbound on Highway 407 near Mavis Road when he collided with the rear and side of the police cruise that was parked on the shoulder, according to OPP spokesperson Sgt. Kerry Schmidt in a video posted online. The officer was trapped inside and emergency crews had to remove the roof and doors.
Schmidt said the officer, who was conducting a "traffic investigation," remains in hospital.
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)  Sacramento Kings rookie Harry Giles will not play until at least January while he rehabs his surgically repaired knees.
Giles is the 20th overall draft pick out of Duke. He missed summer league to rest his left knee. The team said Friday he will work with the training staff to build strength and endurance. He will participate in some "controlled" parts of practice.
Giles had an arthroscopic procedure on his left knee last October after a ligament tear during high school in 2013. He also tore a ligament in his right knee in 2015.
The Kings say they are taking a "methodical approach" and Giles will be "reevaluated routinely throughout the program."

Fossil fuels—petroleum, natural gas, and coal—have accounted for at least 80% of energy consumption in the United States for well over a century. The fossil fuel share of total U.S. energy consumption in 2017 was the lowest share since 1902, at a little more than 80%, as U.S. fossil fuel consumption decreased for the third consecutive year.
The decline in fossil fuel consumption in 2017 was driven by slight decreases in coal and natural gas consumption. Coal consumption fell by 2.5% in 2017, following larger annual declines of 13.6% and 8.5% in 2015 and 2016, respectively. U.S. consumption of coal peaked in 2005 and declined nearly 40% since then.
Natural gas consumption fell by 1.4% in 2017, a change from recent trends. Unlike coal consumption, which has decreased in 8 of the past 10 years, natural gas consumption has increased in 8 of the past 10 years, and in 2017, was twice that of coal. Natural gas consumption growth has been driven by increased use in the electric power sector. Overall, U.S. consumption of natural gas increased by 24% from 2005 to 2017.
Petroleum consumption increased in 2017, but remains 10% lower than its peak consumption level, also set in 2005. Mainly used in the transportation sector, several petroleum-based fuels are also used in homes, businesses, and industries. Petroleum has been the largest source of energy consumption in the United States since surpassing coal in 1950.
The renewable share of energy consumption in 2017, which includes hydroelectricity, biomass, and other renewables such as wind and solar, was 11.3%, the highest since the late 1910s, when overall energy consumption was lower and biomass consumption—mainly wood—made up a larger share. The largest growth in renewables over the past decade has been in solar and wind electricity generation.
Energy consumption in the United States has undergone many changes over the course of the nation's history, from wood as the primary resource in the 18th and 19th centuries, to the onset of coal and petroleum use, to the more modern rise of nuclear power in the late 20th century, and to renewables in the early 21st century.
Of course, EIA did not exist to collect data in 1776. The Monthly Energy Review's pre-1949 estimates of U.S. energy use are deeply indebted to two sources. Much of the data used in earlier energy estimates are from the book Energy in the American Economy 1850-1975, Its History and Prospects by Sam Schurr and Bruce Netschert. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Circular No. 641, Fuel Wood Used in the United States 1630–1930, published in 1942, provides some of the earliest biomass consumption estimates for the United States.

The City of Charleston Traffic and Transportation Department wheeling out the first of a two-part traffic monitoring system.
The department added nine 60-inch screens and one 98-inch screen. It also includes cameras, infra-rays, and reactionary timing at intersections. Staff is working with the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) to upgrade all signals.
"Thanks to funding from city council and our signal maintenance agreement, we were able to upgrade our entire system," Keith Benjamin said. Benjamin is the director for the City of Charleston Department of Traffic and Transportation. "On the 98-inch screen, it showcases the various intersections, the lights, the traffic patterns and where congestion is. It's going to help us create a better traffic flow throughout the city, help us alleviate, and open the door to new technologies like automation."
Phase two is upgrading the department's computer systems and working with city council on growing the traffic division staff.
"Think about innovative ways we can be thinking about making traffic congestion better for citizens. That means thinking about how people travel on the road, how safe they are, thinking about smart-city initiatives that we can take advantage of to move the city forward," Benjamin said.
The project cost a total of $300,000.

Obama lied, promising the infamous torture prison's closure during his first year in office. The vast majority of its detainees committed no crimes. Claims otherwise were fabricated.
According to The New York Times, a draft executive order it obtained dropped earlier language relating to reopening CIA black sites.
It “kep(t) language that would direct the Pentagon to bring future Islamic State detainees to the wartime prison at Guantanamo Bay Cuba,” permitting them to be held at “other facilities.”
America created the terrorist group, actively supports it. Trump said he wants to smash it. Whether rhetoric becomes policy remains to be seen.
The latest version of his draft EO calls for using Guantanamo to imprison suspected members of “Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces, including individuals and networks associated with the Islamic State.”
It omits mention of likeminded groups, no explanation, of course, about America using terrorists as imperial foot soldiers.
Trump vowed to keep Guantanamo open, expand it, and “load it up with some bad dudes.”
The infamous facility operates illegally, victims brutalized, denied habeas rights, due process and judicial fairness, pronounced guilty by accusation.
Fidel Castro demanded the return of Guantanamo. So does brother Raul. When Obama announced restoration of diplomatic relations in December 2014, a statement by Cuba's government said “(t)o achieve normalization, it will be essential also that the territory illegally occupied by the Guantanamo Naval Base is returned” to its rightful owner.
It's 45 square miles of Cuban occupied territory. In 1903, it was leased as a coaling and naval station. Now it symbolizes US contempt for humanity.
Since Gitmo detainees first arrived in January 2002, most were transferred to other countries, their fate unknown in most cases, 41 remain. At least nine died from torture or were otherwise murdered.
Human rights attorney Shelby Sullivan-Bennis calls Guantanamo “a national security disaster…a toxic policy.” Its operations flagrantly violate international and constitutional law.
Bush/Cheney and Obama institutionalized indefinite detention without charges or trial. Trump apparently intends continuing their policies – ignoring rule of law principles.
Warpaint guitarist Theresa Wayman recently announced plans for a solo project under the name TT, with an album called LoveLaws dropping May 18. You can hear the album's lead single, “Love Leaks,” below.
For LoveLaws, Wayman took a new approach to songwriting: writing for Warpaint usually involved a stream of consciousness process with little to no revision in order to maintain a raw and unfiltered sound. But as TT, Wayman worked on polishing her songs and ideas further in order to find her own sound. She cites Björk and the trip hop genre as major influences, as LoveLaws explores Wayman's interest in beats, baselines, and samples.
Born and raised in Oregon, Wayman started playing with Warpaint in Los Angeles 14 years ago. The group has gone on to release three full-length, critically-acclaimed albums.
Yorkshire readers perusing a copy of The Sunday Times this weekend will have been delighted to read of the accolade handed out to the county's most historic city.
The newspaper has named York its official Best Place to Live in Britain after releasing their annual guide to desirable locations across the country.
It's appeared in the list most years for its history and romantic beauty, but has never won the overall title before due to concerns that it was not modern or forward-thinking enough.
Sunday Times writers chose the Roman city due to its new status as a 'mini metropolis', and cited its cafes, restaurants, innovative businesses and fast broadband as big draws.
They also highlighted congestion reduction schemes and fantastic rail connections as reasons to move to York.
Food and drink destinations are a vital criterion for inclusion in the guide - the newspaper chosen Partisan, Arras, Polish restaurant Barbakan and the Haxby Bakehouse as their favourite dining spots, and they were also impressed by Newgate Market's recent makeover.
On the cultural side, the universities' public lecture programmes were praised, and a nod was given to the recent revamps of the art gallery, Theatre Royal and the Jorvik Viking Centre.
Good schools, low crime rates and community spirit all add to York's popularity, although ongoing flood risks were referenced.
The writers chose two streets in Clifton, Marygate and St Peter's Grove, as the city's top addresses, with a nod to trendy Bishopthorpe Road and the suburbs of Fulford and Haxby, the latter being a good bet for renters and first-time buyers.
They also loved York's 890 listed buildings and 11 museums.
Six Yorkshire postcodes also appeared in the guide's top 10 locations in the north - Beverley, Malton, Chapel Allerton in Leeds, Pateley Bridge, Skipton and Wetherby.
Harrogate dropped out of the list for the first time due to its rising property prices, while Hull was not included again after being featured in 2017 due to its City of Culture status - although writers hope it will make a return. The ongoing tree felling dispute in Sheffield was a factor in the city failing to appear in the guide, while Bradford was rejected over its crime rate and lack of gentrification.
Shipley was highlighted as a good spot to raise a family in, and Whitby was named as a great retirement destination.

Torres linked to Japan after deleted post
TOKYO - Embarrassed J-League officials issued an apology Wednesday after announcing that Spanish World Cup winner Fernando Torres had completed a transfer to Japanese club Sagan Tosu. But the leaked post, which was dated May 31 but hastily removed from the J-League's official website, could still signal Torres' arrival in Japan after speculation linking the former Liverpool striker with a move. Before being deleted, the news was widely shared on social media, triggering rumours of a formal announcement from Kyushu-based Sagan. Japan's professional football league welcomed Barcelona icon Andres Iniesta to rival club Vissel Kobe last week. On its Twitter feed, the J-League apologised for the gaffe. "We deeply apologise to staff and fans of Sagan Tosu for the misunderstanding," officials tweeted.–AFP
French football 'needs' Neymar: Fed chief
PARIS - French football "needs" Neymar, according to the country's federation president Noel Le Graet, who said the Brazilian star "must stay" at Paris Saint-Germain. "We need this image, he's a fantastic footballer," Le Graet told AFP Wednesday. "He's on a five-year contract. He must stay. PSG shows that it can attract the big stars." Neymar became the world's most expensive footballer after his transfer to PSG last August from Barcelona for a whopping fee of 222 million euros. He won the French player of the year prize this season despite a foot injury meaning he has not featured for the Parisian club since the end of February. There has been constant speculation that the 26-year-old's stay in the French capital could be a short one, with Real Madrid linked to a move for the Brazilian.–AFP
Hamann slams Karius for tears in Kiev
BERLIN - Dietmar Hamann, a former Champions League winner with Liverpool, has criticised the Reds' goalkeeper Loris Karius for his tearful behaviour after the European final defeat against Real Madrid. "My sympathy with Karius is limited," Hamann said. "We don't have to discuss that he decided the final with his two mistakes. "Something like that can also happen to a professional footballer. "But what I didn't like was his behaviour afterwards. "To publically show his suffering after the final whistle was just as unnecessary as his tearful asking for forgiveness from the Reds fans." Karius' double mistakes in Kiev allowed Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale to snatch goals for Real in a 3-1 defeat and the goalkeeper cut a sad figure as he tearfully applauded travelling fans after the final whistle.–AFP
Lewandowski wants to leave Bavaria
BERLIN - Bayern Munich's star striker Robert Lewandowski wants to leave the Bundesliga club this summer to seek ‘a new challenge', his agent said Wednesday. "Robert feels that he needs a change and a new challenge in his career," Pini Zahavi said. "The managers of Bavaria know about it." Lewandowski, whose Bayern contract runs until 2021, has been linked with Real Madrid while PSG and Premier League giants Chelsea and Man United are also understood to be interested. He was the Bundesliga's top scorer in the just-completed season with 29 goals, the third time he has won the trophy after success in 2015/16, also with Bayern, and 2013/14 while at ex-club Borussia Dortmund. Zahavi said: "Robert's motivations are not money or a specific club, because almost all top clubs would like to sign him up.”–AFP

It's travel Tuesday, where we check in with travel expert Claire Newell from Travel Best Bets for tips to make your next vacation a breeze.
Do you dread the “airline seat squeeze?” Trying to fit your carry-on and your legs in a space not comfortably made for many of us can be a challenge.
Well, good news. One by one, airlines have been rolling out programs that offer slightly larger main cabin seats and a little extra legroom – for a fee, of course.
READ MORE: Travel Tuesday: cramped aircraft causing customer complaints
You might have heard the terms that have started popping up: Economy Plus, Economy Comfort and Preferred Seating. It seems like just about every airline is joining the “buy added legroom” market and, yes, it's officially a trend.
Some of the airlines offering extra legroom in economy for a fee now include United Airlines, JetBlue, American, Delta, Air France and Virgin.
If you don't have elite status and aren't flying on a full-fare ticket, you'll have to pay to sit in those enhanced economy seats for fees varying from $50 to $150 per person.
Be careful when you opt to upgrade your seat though. There are some airlines that charge extra money simply to make a seat selection towards the front of the plane that usually doesn't have extra legroom.
For example, U.S. Airways has “choice seats” that are simply seats towards the front of the economy cabin. And both Delta and American have “preferred seats” that are usually aisle or window seats towards the front of the cabin.

If you don't want to shell out extra money to get prime seating you still have options.
Look for a good seat as soon as you book your ticket. Check back the week of your flight, as some people may leave a good seat behind if they get upgraded or change their travel plans.
Use the online check-in as soon as possible to get access to seats that may not have been available pre-booking, such as exit rows or bulkheads.

The website Seatguru.com offers comparison charts to help you compare seat options across carriers and different aircraft. Expertflyer.com offers free seat alerts that allow travellers to be notified when a better seat becomes available on their flight.

LONDON: -Legendary Sri Lankan batsman Kumar Sangakkara scored the 100th century of his professional career in Surrey's One-Day Cup quarter-final win over Yorkshire at Headingley on Tuesday. The 39-year-old, who will retire from first-class cricket at the end of the season, made 121 out of a total of 313-7. Yorkshire came up short in their run chase as they closed on 289-9 to lose by 24 runs. Sangakkara's 39th one-day hundred adds to his 61 in first-class matches, 38 of which came in Test matches for Sri Lanka.
Thousands filled the Rogers K-Rock Centre for the first-ever ToyCon event.
“We brought one to Quinte. The Quinte show runs annually in June. Kingston kept asking us to bring something so we decided to try it out at the K-Rock Centre,” said ToyCon organizer Trevor Smalldon.
From unique figurines to old school comic books, there was something for all ages.

Many said this was the local convention they've been waiting for.
“We normally go out of town to Anime North in Toronto. So it's nice that there's something local for once,” admits Stephanie Bell.
“I know a lot of people in Kingston that are into cosplay, comics, and Anime etc…and unless you know where to look you really can't find each other,” said Reanna Cooke.
It was also a win-win for the more than 100 Ontario vendors like a local G.I JOE buff who was proud to showcase just a portion of his massive collection with an epic 12-ft. display.
“There are some homages to the movie too. If you look at some of the pieces and some of the sets. There are a lot of custom figures, too, in the display,” said G.I. Joe collector, Edwin Pinaroc.

Another big draw was a masterpiece created by Graeme Dymond. He holds the title of Canada's first ‘Lego Brick Master Builder' and now works freelance all across the country.
“It doesn't really matter what your background is. What matters is done you have that creativity and that passion and most importantly do you have that patience?” said Dymond.
Patience is key as his creation took about six hours and involved 7,000 Lego pieces to make a 5 1/2-foot tall Star Wars character, Yoda.
Organizers say as long as collectors, dealers and fans are on board, The REAL Kingston ToyCon will be back for many years to come.
With the New Year's arrival, I have seen around me yet again a round of resolutions- promises that are made each year to be broken. I see people vowing to eat clean and quit smoking. I see people promising to call up their friends more often. I see people promising to travel the world. I see people hoping 2017 will be better than 2016, failing to understand that time is what man makes it. While we all wish for new things for ourselves, we seldom wish for new things for our country. While criticism is good since it challenges existing systems, sometimes one needs to sit back and wish for the best.
May 2017 be the year when Pakistan becomes tolerant- when differences in ideology fail to divide the people of my country any further. My deepest wish is for my countrymen to learn that the most common factor present within each individual is the fact that each individual is different. May we stop spilling blood over religion, politics and wealth and be united as one nation. I wish for the new year to be the year in which we love God with such intensity that we see a reflection of him in every creation of his; may we finally stop killing in his name.
May 2017 be the year when the liberal people in my country truly become liberal and not just carry around the label to attain an elevated status within society. May they stop discriminating amongst individuals on the basis of wealth and social status. Can we make this year the year when we stop considering a girl covered in a burqa as someone inferior? Can we stop discriminating amongst individuals on the basis of how fluently they speak in English? May we actually be liberal enough to accept the differences in other people's lifestyles and may we stop imposing our own standards on everyone else.
May 2017 be the year when the conservative individuals start accepting change. May this be the year that no girl is forced to cover her hair and when no girl is married without her consent. I wish with all my heart for this year to be the year when education is prioritized over marriages. May this be the year when no girl has to drop out of school only to be forced to start a family.
May 2017 be the year when a Shia boy can marry a Sunni girl without any difficulty. May this year be a year when people from different social classes accept and celebrate the differences between them instead of maintaining the existing divides. May we learn to accept that love knows no boundaries; may this be the year when nothing stands in the way of love. May 2017 be a year when all taboos revolving around love actually diminish. May the term ‘love marriage' finally get the respect it deserves. May this year be the year when we open our minds and our hearts and learn the true essence of the words ‘live and let live'.
May 2017 be the year we stop running greedily after money. May this be the year when parents come home and spend time with their children. May we understand that the best things our children can get from us cannot be bought, that our children need us more than they need the latest iPads and Play Stations. May we finally understand that wearing designer clothes won't make us happy if we don't have time for meaningful relationships, that luxurious cars won't mean anything if they're only used for our daily commute and that bank balances aren't worth anything if we have no time to spend all that money. May this year be a year when we embrace a slow paced life so that we enjoy the things that we've missed for so long.
While everything I have said so far sounds utopian, may this year be the year when nothing stops us from dreaming, even if we dream of the unthinkable. May the hope stay alive that better days will come and that all our dreams for our country will eventually come true.
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The Pakistani opposition party led by former cricket star Imran Khan appears to be gaining ground ahead of a July 25 general election, with one new poll showing it pulling ahead of the outgoing ruling party and another showing it only slightly behind.

A survey by Pulse Consultant showed Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI, or Pakistan Justice Movement) ahead with 30 percent of the respondents nationwide, compared to 27 percent for its main rival, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N). The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) was at 17 percent.
A separate nationwide poll by Gallup Pakistan had PML-N on top with 26 percent, PTI with 25 percent and the PPP at 16 percent.
Both polls were commissioned by Pakistan's Jang Media Group and were published on Wednesday in its affiliated newspaper, The News. They each surveyed about 3,000 people, with a margin of error of 1.6 percent for the Pulse survey and 2-3 percent for Gallup.

The new polls indicate a swing towards Khan's party compared to similar nationwide polls in 2017, which put the PML-N 8-9 percentage points ahead of PTI.
The Gallup poll showed most of the PML-N's losses were to voters who responded “undecided” in the most recent poll, conducted between May 1 and June 6, while the Pulse poll indicated that most of PML-N's losses went directly to PTI.
Khan's political fortunes have improved since PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif was removed as prime minister by the Supreme Court last year over undeclared assets.
Sharif, who was disqualified from politics for life, now faces a verdict in an anti-corruption court on Friday along with his daughter Maryam, who is running for parliament. The case, which involves the purchase of luxury apartments in London, could see Sharif jailed and Maryam disqualified.
Sharif's has accused the military and courts conspiring to oust him and using legal cases and intimidation to help Khan's PTI party, accusations denied by Khan, the army and the judiciary.

Khan, a former cricket captain of Pakistan, has portrayed the legal cases as a long-overdue corruption crackdown on the PML-N, which he has labeled a graft-ridden “mafia”.
This past weekend I spoke at the first Southeast Texas Bigfoot Conference. Such is the interest in Bigfoot in the Lone Star State, more than 700 people rolled into town (Huntsville, TX) to listen to the latest news on the United States' most famous monster. A great time was had, and there was a lot of debate, questions and new developments. Of the many questions that came my way, one surfaced a couple of times: is it possible that the Bigfoot are, as one attendee worded it, “a person?” Or, as another termed it, are the Bigfoot “something that's part of us?” The theory that the Bigfoot are a form of primitive human is without doubt controversial. And, it's a fact that the vast majority of witnesses describe something that looks far more like an ape than it does like us. But, there are a few exceptions to the rule. I'll share one case with you which most assuredly makes such a point.
The origins of Anniston, Alabama date back to the height of the American Civil War. It's a city, in Calhoun County, of around 23,000 and which is dominated by the huge, picturesque, Blue Ridge Mountains. In 1938, however, it was something else that was dominating the people of Anniston: a strange and distinctly out of place ape-like thing. It was in April 1938 that sightings began, in the Choccolocco Valley, of what was quickly referred to by the local press as “a hairy wild man.”
Rather notably, the beast would walk on two legs, but then drop down onto all fours when it wanted to run, which was usually when it was being pursued by frightened and enraged gun-toting locals. Most fascinating of all, the beast was not always spotted alone. On several occasions witnesses reported seeing it with a female and “a child,” both displaying thick coats of hair and both having the ability to move around in bipedal and quadruped mode, as the mood took them.
Interestingly, one of the main reasons why the Alabama wild things were not killed was because those hunting them backed off from taking definitive shots, due to the eerie human-like appearances of the mysterious beasts. One of those was Rex Biddle, a farmer, who told Sheriff W. P. Cotton that: “He was about five feet tall and had hair all over his body. He was unclothed. Despite his beast-like appearance, his nose and other features indicated he was human.”
Rather tellingly, Biddle admitted that the human qualities the beast possessed had a major bearing on his decision not to kill it, despite the fact that he could have done exactly that if he had wanted to. He said to the press: “I didn't know whether that would be legal.” It's an interesting scenario. It's a quandary that more than a few hunters have found themselves in. Personally, I'm not a fan of hunting – at all. I am, however, encouraged by the fact that a number of hunters have backed away from killing the mysterious creatures.
Just as an aside, a few decades later the Choccolocco monster returned – albeit in a very strange way. It was May 1969 when sightings of the “Choccolocco Monster” began. It was a strange beast, to be sure: upright, white, and with what looked like a cow's head on its shoulders! It turns out that is exactly what it was: on Halloween 2001, a local man, Neal Williamson, admitted that he – just fifteen years old at the time – was the monster. He roamed around the area late at night, sometimes wearing a bed sheet and on other occasions a long coat. And he would top it all off by holding a cow's skull above his head! He was fortunate enough not to get his head blown off his shoulders by frightened locals. “Back then, you didn't have anything to do, really. You didn't have computers. You just had to create your own fun,” said Williamson.
It's important to note that the events of the 1960s were inspired by what were undeniably real cases in the 1930s. And, it's some of those same cases of 1938 that led many to muse on the possibility that what, today, we call “Bigfoot” maybe closer to us – in its DNA and make-up – than we imagine.
The Transportation Safety Board of Canada said Saturday that it had completed its work at the scene of Thursday's fatal helicopter crash near Drummondville, Que.
Three people died after the Robinson model helicopter crashed and caught fire in a snow-covered field just outside the city, about 110 kilometres northeast of Montreal.
TSB spokesman Alexandre Fournier told The Canadian Press that the field phase of the investigation was over, and the wreck had been removed.
“Investigators have left the site and the wreck has been taken away until it is decided which components will be analyzed at the TSB lab in Ottawa,” he said.
He said there was no new information on what caused the crash, which claimed the lives of the 57-year-old businessman Jean-Claude Mailhot, his 32-year-old daughter Janie, and her friend Nathalie Desrosiers.
Police have said the crash is not believed to have been a criminal act.

The relatives of the Mailhot family released a statement late Friday, in which they thanked the public for their messages of support and expressed their devastation at the tragedy.
“Our father and our sister died in a tragic accident last night,” read the statement signed by Tommy, Vincent and Alexandrine Mailhot.
“Words do not suffice to express the desolation and incomprehension that an event like this can bring.”
On Saturday, many in the Lanaudière region were remembering the victims for their dedication to their families and communities.

The Diocese of Joliette said Jean-Claude Mailhot was an active volunteer for the last 14 years, and had been especially involved in selling tickets to an annual draw.
Desrosiers, for her part, was remembered by a friend as a “luminous” personality and a loving mother who volunteered at her daughter's theatre group.
“She marked everyone who met her with her deep and natural kindness,” said Nathalie Côté, who volunteered with her. “She was really someone with heart.”
Côté said Desrosiers was a “natural leader” who pitched in with the group to be closer to her teenage daughter, Amy.
“To be there with her daughter and to do volunteer work was something she wanted to pass on to her daughter,” she said.
Alberta RCMP have arrested three people after a vehicle believed to be used in multiple armed robberies refused to stop while travelling on the Trans-Canada Highway.
Investigators said it started with a string of armed robberies on Saturday, the first of which occurred just after 9 p.m. at a Petro Canada gas station in Strathmore. RCMP said a teenage girl and two men armed with a rifle and bear spray entered the store and demanded cash from the attendant.
Shortly after, another armed robbery was reported at a nearby Husky gas station. In that robbery, RCMP said a man doused an employee with bear spray after stealing “several items” from the store. Not long after, a third robbery was reported in the hamlet of Cluny.

Investigators were able to get a description of the vehicle the suspects were using and located an SUV matching that description travelling eastbound on Highway 1.
While attempting to pull the vehicle over, RCMP said the driver refused to stop. Officers pursued the SUV and eventually used a tire deflation device to stop it.
Afterward, the suspects took off on foot. RCMP used a police dog and the Calgary Police Service's (CPS) HAWCS helicopter to locate them and take them into custody.
In a Sunday news release, RCMP said one of the three suspects “discharged bear spray” at one of the officers during their arrest. The officer was treated for exposure to bear spray but wasn't seriously injured.

RCMP found a firearm they believe was used in the robberies not far from where the vehicle had been stopped.
Bradley Josh Blackhorse, 27, and Justin Lee Nathan Cutter, 24, both of Siksika Nation, are facing numerous charges.
Officers have also charged a 15-year-old who cannot be named under the Youth Criminal Justice Act.
Blackhorse and Cutter are scheduled to appear in court on Dec. 15 and 19 respectively.

Lewandowski wants to leave Bavaria: agent
Berlin, May 30 (AFP) Bayern Munich's star striker Robert Lewandowski wants to leave the Bundesliga club this summer to seek "a new challenge", his agent told Sport Bild today.
"Robert feels that he needs a change and a new challenge in his career," Pini Zahavi told the weekly.
"The managers of Bavaria know about it."
Lewandowski, 29, whose Bayern contract runs until 2021, has been linked with Real Madrid while Qatari-backed Paris Saint-Germain and Premier League giants Chelsea and Manchester United are also understood to be interested.
He was the Bundesliga's top scorer in the just-completed season with 29 goals.
In late February, the Poland international parted ways with his previous agent of 10 years, Cezary Kucharski, and signed up with Zahavi, one of the most powerful agents in world football.
Zahavi said that "Robert's motivation are not money or a specific club, because almost all top clubs would like to sign up the world's best striker." He said he hoped Bayern president Uli Hoeness and CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge would understand the player's position.
"Everyone in the Bayern club leadership has their own great career to look back on. They should understand his situation," he told Sport Bild.
Rummenigge told Kicker magazine earlier this month that Bayern fans "do not have to worry about Robert Lewandowski and the relationship with Bayern ... We have a very good one
It is a support group they wish they weren't a part of.
“I have lost a piece of myself, it is so hard,” Norma Arnold told Global news.
The Kelowna woman belongs to a small support group of parents who have all lost a child.
“We don't just sit and cry, we laugh about our kids and stuff too and we laugh at each other and we share the good and the bad,” Arnold said. It makes it easier to have somebody that you can talk to that knows.”
Arnold's son Dustin Knelsen was involved in a bad car accident in 2012. Shortly after, he got hooked on drugs and eventually died of an overdose in December, 2015.
For Arnold, being part of the support group is comforting.
“Just finding out I am not the only crazy person in the world…because that is how you feel after something like this happens,” an emotional Arnold said.
Leslie and Ron Leew also belong to the group. The Penticton couple lost their 16-year-old daughter Madison to suicide in March, 2015.
“It's just a massive hole in your life, a massive hole,” Ron Leew told Global News.
Madison Leew was a competitive swimmer and horse lover. Her parents described her as a happy child, up until she started high school and developed depression.
“She was put on medication, started withdrawing from her friends, started skipping school,” Ron Leew said.
And even though more than three years have passed since their daughter's passing, the emotions are still raw.
“You look to see your daughter get married, fall in love, have children, you have grandchildren, that is gone and there is no way to bring that back,” a tearful Leslie Leew said.
The grieving parents said they find solace at the support meetings.
“I can open up to these people, talk to them about the real details of everything and how I feel whereas I can talk to my family, I can talk to my friends, I can talk to Leslie's family but they are pretty uncomfortable with the topic, I just feel I am burdening them.” Ron Leew said.
The support group was started by Kelowna resident Laura MacDonald. She too knows what it's like to lose a child. Her son Adam Fettes was murdered in his West Kelowna home 11 years ago.
MacDonald is hoping other parents who've lost children will reach out if they need to.
“There's people who don't know this service is here and they don't have to pay for it,” MacDonald said. “You've got this lifeline of people that you want or need to email or talk to or whatever, it's there. It's kind of like — counseling goes, and it's ended after an hour or two hours — and this is, we are just open.”
The group meets once a month at MacDonald's house.

ATHENS:- A large wildfire was raging Monday on the coastal front of Athens, officials said, with summer homes under threat and a local village evacuated. The fire in Kalamos, about 45 kilometres (28 miles) east of the Greek capital, was burning across a wide front for a second day and had already burned a number of homes. There were no immediate reports of injuries. A force of more than 200 firefighters with over 100 fire engines, water trucks and a handful of aircraft had been mobilised, the fire department said. “It's a strong fire in an area full of summer homes,” civil protection official Ioanna Tsoupra told ERT television.

BURNABY, B.C. – New Democrat Leader John Horgan took aim on Monday at the Liberals' failed pledge to match every British Columbian with a family doctor by promoting his party's strategy to build urgent-care centres that use a team-based approach.
The centres would be open evenings and weekends and would allow patients to see the care provider that fits their needs, whether it's a doctor, nurse practitioner or counsellor, Horgan said at a campaign stop ahead of the May 9 election.
Horgan said Christy Clark's Liberals are letting down patients, who are waiting for hours at walk-in clinics or emergency rooms. The NDP said 700,000 people don't have a family doctor, with 200,000 still looking for one.
“It's a fundamental right in Canada to access our public health care system. I will defend that to my last breath,” Horgan said.
The NDP leader made the promise in Burnaby, flanked by two local residents who can't find a family doctor. Sky Belt said her friend visited walk-in clinics several times for pain and was told she had anxiety before she was finally diagnosed with cancer.
“Those months that she spent not having a family doctor has made her situation very critical,” Belt said.
The Liberals estimated in 2013 that 200,000 British Columbians didn't have a family doctor. It campaigned in 2010 and 2013 on providing a family doctor to every resident who wanted one by 2015, but conceded two years ago it would not meet its target.
The website for the “GP For Me” program says 178,000 people who did not have a family doctor were able to get one by 2016. But B.C.'s population also grew by 162,600 between 2013 and 2016.
The Liberal platform includes $2.7 billion for new hospitals, 500 additional long-term care beds and 5,500 more hip and knee surgeries.
Campaigning in Campbell River, Clark highlighted her government's record in helping business, such as phasing out the provincial sales tax on electricity that she said would save businesses $160 million a year, including pulp and paper companies in the northern part of Vancouver Island.
Vancouver Island has been a stronghold for the NDP but Clark said the province has a successful economic record on the island because of Liberal policies. She said the unemployment rate on the north island is half what it was under the last NDP government before the Liberals came to power in 2001.
“More people are working and our jobs plan has worked for British Columbia,” she said.
“We've supported the private sector in creating thousands of jobs here and I don't think people, whether in the south island, the mid-island or the north island, want to give up that prosperity. We want to keep this going.”
Horgan's promise was short on specifics, with no precise number of urgent-care centres a NDP government would build or a cost estimate. Horgan would only say the party would shift priorities to make room in the existing health budget.
“We want to assemble those teams in a cost-effective way,” he said.
Green party Leader Andrew Weaver, who is campaigning on a promise to “do politics differently,” unveiled his party's platform on democratic reform in Victoria.
He said his party would establish a public watchdog to oversee government advertising and communications, block cabinet ministers from engaging in partisan fundraising, ban corporate, union and out-of-province donations, and place limits on individual contributions that would be in line with current federal limits.
The Liberals, and to a lesser extent the NDP, have faced intense scrutiny over lavish fundraisers and unlimited donations. The NDP has promised to ban corporate and union donations if elected, while the Liberals say they would convene a panel to make recommendations. The Greens banned big money in September.
Weaver also promised to introduce proportional representation.
“After decades of broken promises, British Columbians have lost trust in their government — and rightfully so,” he said in a statement. “We have a duty to regain that trust and to demonstrate through action that the government is there to serve British Columbians — not politicians.”

Islamabad
The Islamabad Chamber of Commerce & Industry has shown great concerns over the rising circular debt which has reached Rs.573 billion as it would give rise to loadshedding and badly affect the production activities. ICCI called upon the government to take urgent measures to clear circular debt in order to save the economy from its damaging consequences.
Sheikh Amir Waheed, President, Islamabad Chamber of Commerce & Industry said that the circular debt had exceeded Rs.500 billion in May 2013 and the current government after assuming power had cleared circular debt of Rs.480 billion in July 2013 after which it was hoped that this issue would not rear its head again. However, contrary to the expectations, circular debt has again crossed Rs.500 billion in May 2018 which showed that no concrete measures were taken to resolve this critical issue.
He said that Pakistan was producing about 9000 MW electricity through oil fuel while the receivables of PSO have increased to over Rs.300 billion. He was afraid that if PSO's payments were not cleared, it would not be in a position to ensure oil supply due to which the oil-based electricity would disappear from the system creating serious power crisis in the country. It would badly affect the production activities, exports, employment and growth in the country. He emphasized that the government should devise a comprehensive strategy to resolve all these issues in order to save the economy from further damages.
Muhammad Naveed Malik Senior Vice President and Nisar Mirza Vice President, Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that as per figures of Pakistan Electric Power Company, there were total 8631 feeders in the country majority of which were facing 10 percent losses while some feeders were facing 80 percent losses. They stressed upon the government to develop a mechanism to control the distribution and transmission losses along with feeders' losses that would bring significant improvement in power supply situation enabling the business and industry to flourish in the country.—INP

NEW YORK (AP) - Target is buying a delivery-logistics company to help it offer same-day delivery service to in-store shoppers.
Software made by San Francisco-based Grand Junction connects retailers with about 700 delivery companies around the country that pick up items from distribution centers and take them to customers.
Expanding delivery and making it faster have been key areas retailers have focused on to attract convenience-seeking shoppers.
Target has been working with Grand Junction to test same-day delivery at a New York store. Shoppers there can ask to have items delivered that day for a fee. Target plans to expand the service to other New York locations this year, then bring it to other major cities next year.
Minneapolis-based Target Corp. did not say how much it is paying for Grand Junction.
A fatal single-vehicle crash took place near Brock, Sask. on Dec. 30, 2016.
Kindersley RCMP were called to the single-vehicle collision at a rural location at around 8:50 p.m. CT.
READ MORE: Woman, 22, found dead in Saskatoon on New Year's Day
Two men and a woman were inside the vehicle at the time of the crash.
RCMP officials said the 51-year-old woman was pronounced dead at the scene. Her name has not been released but she was from the Kindersley area.
Both the 48-year-old driver and a 41-year-old passenger were taken to Kindersley Hospital. The driver was transferred by STARS air ambulance while the passenger had non-life threatening injuries.
A collision reconstructionist and the office of the chief coroner are assisting with the investigation.
Earlier this month, students of the Grand Bay Primary School (GBPS) took part in two projects: tree planting (grades 4 to 6) and recycled arts and crafts (grades K to 3).
These projects were initiated by Karllen Lawrence, a native of Grand Bay who resides in New York.
Additionally, Lawrence provided kitchen appliances and utensils to the staff of the GBPS.
About two months ago, Lawrence decided that she wanted to visit Dominica to contribute to the post-Maria rebuilding efforts in her community of Grand Bay.
After brainstorming with key resource community members such as Julian Pacquette from the Youth Division (also a Grand Bayrian), she came up with three project ideas, which would focus on the children of Grand Bay.
The central underlying motivation for these projects was the goal of building community spirit and keeping with the government's call for a climate resilient Dominica.
She reached out to her team “Rebuilding Grand Bay”, which had conducted a relief project over the Christmas holidays, spearheaded by her sister, Professor Royette Tavernier (a native of Grand Bay, who resides in Connecticut).
Through this relief project, fifty packages were hand-delivered to villagers of Grand Bay who were most in need. That team consisted of Grand Bayrians including Police Sergeant Nicaise Leatham, High school Teacher Claudia Toussaint, as well as other key community members such as Alixia Athanaze, Gesha Gregoire, Kendra Roach, and Jovan Lewis all based in Grand Bay.
She connected with former student of the GBPS and musical star, Michele Henderson, who agreed to contribute to the efforts and also had the idea to reach out to other former students.
Through this snowballing effort, funds were collected and used to purchase most of the kitchen appliances and utensils that the principal (Evans James) had indicated was needed. Some funds also were used to provide snacks for the students on the day of the projects.
After contacting the Ministry of Agriculture Officials about the tree planting project idea, Lawrence was asked to submit a proposal.
Later, she coordinated with Forestry Officer, Ricardo Dominique, who immediately asked her “how can I help?” From then on, things moved quickly.
On the day of the project, Lawrence spoke to the students about the importance of the projects: the need to recycle and to create some fun crafts with recyclable materials; as well as the importance of planting trees and plants.
The recycling arts and crafts segment was led by Ms. Alixia Athanaze. Foresty Officer, Mr. Dominique was hands-on on the day of the projects explaining to the children the importance of taking care of the newly planted trees.
Over 60 plants and trees were planted by the students. The principal, Mr. James, indicated that the care of the trees would be the responsibility of the various houses of the school.
The children had an educational and fun day capped off by snacks prepared by the teachers and parents.
The needs of the student and staff of the Grand Bay Primary School remain high – there is still a lot that needs to be done. The hope is that this initiative will spark other ideas from Dominicans far and near. It is expected that further collaboration will continue in the future.
A group of volunteers searching for a missing man in Ozark found the man's body Wednesday, according to the Ozark Police Department.
Robert Dylan Gunter, 20, had been missing since Sunday. He was last seen near Alcuri Drive around 7:15 p.m.
He was reported missing to Ozark police around 9:30 that night. Family, friends and law enforcement conducted searches for Gunter.
Gunter's body was found Wednesday approximately 250 yards into the trees off Alcuri Drive, police said. Authorities believe he died from a single gunshot wound.
The Ozark Police Department, Dale County Sheriff's Office and Dale County Coroner's Office are investigating.

KARACHI - Aafia Movement Pakistan leader Dr Fowzia Siddiqui has congratulated Chief Justice of Pakistan (r) Justice Nasir-ul-Mulk on his nomination as the caretaker prime minister, and said that she is now appealing the tenth prime minister of Pakistan to dole out justice to Aafia Siddiqui.
In a statement here, she said Dr Aafia Siddiqui was kidnapped along with her children from Karachi when Zafarullah Jamali was the prime minister. She said then Chaudhry Shujaat Hussian, Shaukat Aziz, Muhammad Mian Soomro (caretaker), Yusuf Raza Gilani, Raja Pervez Ashraf, Hazar Khan Khoso (caretaker), Nawaz Sharif and Shahid Khaqan Abbasi became prime ministers of Pakistan.
Addressing the nominee caretaker prime minister, she said now you are the 10th prime minister of Pakistan and I appeal to you to dole out justice to Aafia Siddiqui. She said presently a common citizen cannot get justice due to the faulty justice system in the country.
She said this system gives us the dead body of innocent Zainab thrown to a garbage dump, this system results in the murder of Tania, who was killed inside her home, and this system ensures that Aafia Siddiqui is kidnapped from the megacity Karachi along with her three minor children and trafficked and sold for the US dollars.
She told the caretaker prime minister that you have already served on the highest post of the justice system in Pakistan and you know that the ‘daughter of the nation' has been demanding justice from the state of Pakistan since 2003.
Dr Fowzia said the nation has pinned a lot of hopes on the caretaker prime minister, who is going to assume his duties at a very critical juncture of time. She said some quarters are spreading panic in the nation through fake news about the demise of Aafia Siddiqui. She hoped that the caretaker prime minister would give the gift of release and repatriation of Aafia Siddiqui to the Pakistani nation.
SV Hospital looks to pair with ‘world-class health care' partner
Posted on February 2, 2018 by Sonoma Valley Sun
Sonoma Valley Hospital plans to partner with UCSF Health to form an integrated health care network to serve Sonoma Valley residents.
“This agreement, with its close ties to a world-class health care system, strengthens our ability to serve our community, including providing access to the latest technology and treatment options,” said Kelly Mather, SVH CEO. “At the same time, we are able to continue operating as an independent district hospital.”
UCSF Health is the top-ranked medical center in California and one of the top five hospitals in the nation.
As part of the proposed agreement, UCSF Health will provide the hospital with a new Medical Director, replacing Robbie Cohen, MD, who recently retired.
The affiliation agreement has approved in principle by the Sonoma Valley Health Care District Board. It awaits approval by the UCSF Health Board.
“Independent community-based hospitals face a challenging future across the health care industry as competition and the continuous need for cost containment have heated up,” Mather said. “For those reasons, we have been looking to align with a larger hospital.”
The affiliation agreement would include offering services for out-of-area transport of sick patients, and the transfer of patients back to SVH when they require less intensive care. It also would enhance the availability of physician and administrative services in Sonoma Valley, Mather said.
“We couldn't have hoped for a better and more prestigious partner than UCSF Health because of their size, reputation and quality of care,” she said.
Mather noted that SVH has had an informal working relationship with UCSF Health for a number of years, which has provided SVH with access to several specialized services.
In the past few years, UCSF Health has affiliated with a number of Bay Area providers and health systems, ranging from Children's Hospital Oakland (now UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland) to John Muir Health, Dignity Health Bay Area, Washington Hospital Healthcare System, Golden Gate Urgent Care, and Hospice by the Bay.

KARACHI - Pakistan People's Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari Wednesday strongly condemned murder of human rights activist Sardar Charan Jeet Singh in Peshawar and asked the KP government to arrest the culprits without any delay.
The PPP chairman stressed that KP government should take fool-proof security measures to protect the tiny minority in Peshawar and rest of the province and restore sense of security among the Sikh community.
He sympathised with bereaved family members of slain Sardar Charan Jeet Singh and expressed solidarity with them.
Also, Bilawal has said that Sindh province is citadel of Bhuttoism, which binds the people of all colours, creed and religions and announced a total rout out opponents from the province in 2018 general elections.
The PPP chairman said that his party will win elections in all the four provinces overwhelmingly to form next elected governments in Centre and provinces as well.
Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and President PPP-P Asif Ali Zardari jointly headed the Parliamentary Board which conducted interviews from hundreds of party aspirants from three divisions including Sukkur, Mirpurkhas and Shaheed Benazirabad for different national and provincial assemblies seats at Bilawal House on Wednesday.
Other members of the board present during the interviews included President Pakistan People's Party Women Wing Faryal Talpur, Senator Sherry Rehman, Syed Qaim Ali Shah, Syed Khursheed Shah, Murad Ali Shah, Naveed Qamar, Nisar Ahmed Khuhro, Waqar Mehdi and Shagufta Jumani.
Bilawal Bhutto said that all the members who have applied for party tickets are equally respectable for the party and the parliamentary board will decide the tickets after looking into the collective party interest, ground realities, political and electoral strategy of the party.
The attorneys of the CREO-SUMA alliance have appealed this Sunday against the National Electoral Council's resolution to deny the total re-counting of the votes and has requested a new vote-by-vote count.
The representatives of the candidate representing the political opposition, Guillermo Lasso, base their request on Section 260 of the Code of Democracy. The Electoral Dispute Court will have seven days to respond to this request.
CREO maintains that the partial count ordered by the National Electoral Council for Tuesday, April 18, is “a show.” And this party claims the existence of 13,000 votes tally sheets with zero white votes, and another thirty-one thousand sheets in which white votes are less than three. They also refer to supposed faults “in the whole system, since results do not add up.”

After showing signs of progress two weeks ago, the Arizona Coyotes took a few steps backward last week, as they lost all three of their contests in regulation and were outscored 10-2 in the process.
Coyotes Endure Rough Week
The ‘Yotes had a few days off following their 3-2 overtime loss in Las Vegas on Dec. 3, but they got back to work in Boston on Thursday night with a matchup against the Bruins. The Coyotes had lost 11 straight against Boston entering the game, and things quickly went downhill in this one as well – Brad Marchand scored just 15 seconds into the first period and David Backes added his first two goals of the season during the second frame as the Bruins ran away with a 6-1 victory.
Following their blowout in Boston, the Coyotes headed to Columbus and looked to redeem themselves against the Blue Jackets on Saturday night. However, just as they did in Boston, the Coyotes again conceded an early goal, as Josh Anderson scored at the 30-second mark of the first period. Antti Raanta shut the door the rest of the way, but the ‘Yotes couldn't solve Jackets' netminder Sergei Bobrovsky, who turned away all 35 shots he saw for his league-leading fourth shutout of the season.
The Coyotes finished the week on Sunday night in Chicago with a matchup against the Blackhawks. Despite playing the night before, Arizona played well during the game's first two periods. However, things fell apart in the third, when Chicago's potent offense finally broke through for three goals on Scott Wedgewood as the ‘Hawks earned a hard-fought 3-1 victory at the United Center.
Coyotes Hosting Top Teams
After returning home following Sunday's loss in Chicago, the Coyotes will be back in action on Thursday night at Gila River Arena as they'll kick off a five-game homestand against the Tampa Bay Lightning. Thanks to their league-leading offense (3.75 goals per game), the Lightning sit atop the standings and are the league's best team – as of this writing, they hold a .759 points percentage (P%). If they continue to win at their current pace, they'll become the first team to finish an 82-game season with a P% of .750 or higher since the 2005-06 Detroit Red Wings. Puck drop is scheduled for 7:00 P.M. in Glendale.
Things won't get any easier on Saturday, as the two-time defending Stanley Cup-champion Pittsburgh Penguins will come to town. It should be an interesting night in Glendale – Pittsburgh already defeated Arizona earlier this season at PPG Paints Arena, but the Coyotes have won the last two matchups at Gila River Arena, including a 4-3 overtime victory last season. Puck drop is scheduled for 6:00 P.M. in the Valley of the Sun.
Raanta Returns
Saturday night's 1-0 loss in Columbus likely didn't draw much attention throughout the league, but it was indeed a significant game for Arizona – it marked Antti Raanta's first appearance since suffering an upper-body injury against the San Jose Sharks on Nov. 22.
After an inauspicious start (Josh Anderson scored at the 30-second mark of the opening period), Raanta locked things down in goal – he stopped 33 of the 34 shots he faced on the night, but ended up on the wrong end of a 1-0 decision, as Blue Jackets' netminder Sergei Bobrovsky pitched a shutout.
It appears as if Raanta has picked up right where he left off prior to his injury, and that's good news for the Coyotes – the 28-year-old netminder has now stopped 99 of the last 103 shots (good for a .961 SV%) thrown his way over his past four contests. He's kept Arizona in each of his past handful of appearances in net, and, barring another injury, should be a key piece for the Coyotes moving forward.
Pacific Division Roundup
We've entered the season's third month, and the Los Angeles Kings are threatening to run away with the Pacific Division crown. Here's how Arizona's other division rivals fared last week:
Anaheim Ducks (12-11-7, 31 points)
Last week: 1-0-2 (4-3 SOL at VGK, 3-0 W vs OTT, 3-2 OTL vs MIN)
1-0-2 (4-3 SOL at VGK, 3-0 W vs OTT, 3-2 OTL vs MIN) Analysis: Anaheim extended their point streak to four games last week, but, unfortunately, they have just one win over that stretch. There's no shame in losing in overtime, but the Ducks will need to start winning some games if they wish to climb up the standings in the Western Conference.

2-1-1 (5-2 L vs PHI, 2-1 SOL at TOR, 3-2 OTW at MTL, 4-2 W vs VAN) Analysis: After suffering a 5-2 home loss to the Philadelphia Flyers on Monday night, the Flames bounced back in a big way – the went 2-0-1 to finish the week and kept pace with the rest of the pack in the Western Conference as a result. If Calgary can get some consistency from Mike Smith (allowed 2, 1, 5, 5, and 0 goals in last five appearances), they can be a dangerous team come playoff time.

1-2-0 (4-2 L vs PHI, 6-2 W at MTL, 1-0 L at TOR) Analysis: The Oilers continue to struggle in the consistency department – they scored six goals on Saturday against the Montreal Canadiens, but scored two goals combined in their other two games against the Flyers and Maple Leafs. Laurent Brossoit is doing all he can to keep the Oilers in contention while Cam Talbot recovers from an injury, but he'll need some support from his offense in order to do so.

3-0-0 (5-2 W vs MIN, 4-3 OTW vs OTT, 3-2 OTW vs CAR) Analysis: The Kings stayed hot last week – they've now won eight straight games and are running away with the Pacific Division. Los Angeles has it all – two outstanding goaltenders (Jonathan Quick and Darcy Kuemper), a Selke candidate (Anze Kopitar), a Norris candidate (Drew Doughty), and a resurgent Dustin Brown, who is on pace for his first 50-plus point season since the 2011-12 Stanley Cup championship campaign. Could the Kings potentially bring home the Cup once again this season?

Could the Kings potentially bring home the Cup once again this season? Player of the week: Anze Kopitar – 2 goals, 5 assists, +7

2-1-1 (4-1 L at WSH, 5-4 OTW vs CAR, 5-0 W vs OTT, 4-3 OTL vs MIN) Analysis: After struggling offensively for most of the season, it appears as if the Sharks' offense has finally broken through – San Jose generated 14 goals in four games last week and picked up five points in the standings as a result. Brent Burns, in particular, is red-hot – he's recorded two points in each of his last three games and is making up for a slow start in a big way.

PALM BEACH - US President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday left open the possibility of meeting with Taiwan's president if she visits the United States after he is sworn in on Jan. 20 and also expressed continued skepticism over whether Russia was responsible for computer hacks of Democratic Party officials.
In remarks to reporters upon entering a New Year's Eve celebration at his Mar-a-Lago estate, Trump said, "We'll see," when pressed on whether he would meet Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan's president if she were to be in the United States at any point after he becomes president. Taiwan's president will be in transit in Houston on Jan. 7 and again will be in transit in San Francisco on Jan. 13.
Trump, citing protocol, said he would not meet with any foreign leaders while President Barack Obama is still in office. Beijing bristled when Trump, shortly after his Nov. 8 victory, accepted a congratulatory telephone call from the Taiwan leader and has warned against steps that would upset the "one-China" policy China and the United States have maintained for decades.
Talk of a stop-over in the United States by the Taiwan president has further rattled Washington-Beijing relations. On another foreign policy matter, Trump warned against being quick to pin the blame on Russia for the hacking of U.S. emails. The Washington Post also reported on Friday that Moscow could be behind intrusion into a laptop owned by a Vermont electric utility.
US intelligence officials have said that they are confident Russia was behind the hacks of political figures, which could have played a role in Trump's defeat over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
"I think it's unfair if we don't know. It could be somebody else. I also know things that other people don't know so we cannot be sure," Trump said. Asked what that information included, the Republican President-elect said, "You will find out on Tuesday or Wednesday."
He did not elaborate. But he said that any computer is subject to hacks. "It's very important. If you have something really important write it out and have it delivered by courier the old fashioned way," Trump said, adding, "No computer is safe, I don't care what they say."
Trump tried to end the year on a positive note, however, despite questions about the future of U.S.-Russia relations because of escalating tensions between Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as Trump's promise to crack down on China's trade practices, which he says unfairly target American workers.
"Hopefully we're going to have great relationships with many countries and that includes Russia and that includes China," Trump said. But he criticized U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry for earlier this week offering a stark assessment of Israel's policies in the Middle East, which he said could threaten the possibility of establishing a Palestinian state co-existing with Israel. Trump called Kerry's speech "very unfair."
As he wrapped up a four-minute informal chat with reporters, Trump also was asked what his 2017 new year's resolution was. "Make America great again," he said.

Detroit — The Red Wings produced lots of shots, plenty of scoring chances, got good goaltending, played decent team defense, generally took care of the puck and demonstrated ample moxie.
And they lost again.
In a game they could have wrapped-up well before overtime, the Red Wings lost a fifth straight that went to the extra frame on Monday, this time 2-1 to the Florida Panthers, who came to town a point behind the Red Wings in the Atlantic Division and left tied.
The Wings are now 1-5 in the last six.
BOX SCORE: Panthers 2, Red Wings 1, overtime
“I'm still wondering how we lost that game,” said Luke Witkowski, who fought the leading pugilist in the NHL, Micheal Haley, twice; two of the three fights in the contest.
“I don't know how many grade-A scoring chances we had.”
Witkowski credited Panthers goalie James Reimer with a fine effort, but the Wings need to get some “finish” in their game before the season goes for naught in advance of the new year.
“It's frustrating,” Witkowski said.
Luke Glendening punished Florida defenseman Aaron Ekblad in the third tilt of the evening, landing three consecutive rights and other punches before knocking Ekblad to the ice.
Asked about that effort and a lot of good play by the Wings in general, Glendening emphasized that it simply is not sufficient in the NHL.
“It's a points-based league,” Glendening said. “If you're not winning, you're doing something wrong.
“We're doing some things right, but we're not winning. We have to find ways to do that.”
It was a game the Red Wings probably should have had wrapped up an hour before it ended.
Instead, they played well and lost a fifth consecutive game in the overtime.
Mike Matheson, a Panthers defenseman, scored his first goal of the season in 28 games played at 2:02 of the overtime.
Jimmy Howard, down and out after making a tremendous pad save on one shot and managing to save a second by scrambling into position after the rebound, could not stop a third shot, observing the proceedings from the seat of his pants in the crease.
For the second consecutive game, Howard needed more help.
It never arrived on the winner.
Outshooting the Panthers 35-29, the Wings had many scoring chances throughout the game and could convert only one.
Henrik Zetterberg scored his fifth of the season, and his first after a 22-game drought, with 1:33 left in the first period.
For yet another game, the Red Wings played better than the score indicated. They had multiple chances to build a two-, three- and even four-goal lead. From about the 13-minute mark of the first period until 8:18 of the third period, the Wings outshot the Panthers 23-9.
Tomas Tatar, Gustav Nyquist, Anthony Mantha, Dylan Larkin and others had clear scoring chances and failed to tally.
The Red Wings, challenged offensively for at least couple of seasons, lacked “finish” once again.
Asked after the game if the roster needs more scoring talent, Jeff Blashill argued against it.
“Well, I think if we stay with the process, with this, we have enough natural goal-scorers. I do,” Blashill said.
“We have to bear down and keep staying with it.”
Leading 1-0 halfway through the third period, the Wings were again victimized by a simple mistake. Nick Jensen's delay-of-game penalty at 8:22 put the Panthers on a power play and their stars capitalized.
After the Wings spent far too long in their own zone killing the penalty, Dylan Larkin finally got hold of the puck and skated it to within a couple of feet of the blue line before two Panthers approached him, deterred him and swiped the puck.
Within moments three talented Panthers, Aleksander Barkov, Jonathan Huberdeau and Vincent Trocheck, combined on Trocheck's 13th goal of the season at 10:11.
Regulation time ended 1-1, with the Red Wings outshooting the Panthers 28-14 for about the last 47 minutes.
Portions of the game were like NHL games of a different era: Danger seemed to lurk everywhere, and a penchant for violence hung in the air.
The Red Wings and Panthers collected six fighting majors in the first two periods, with the heavyweights Witkowski and Haley going at it twice and Glendening and Windsonr-native Ekblad once.
Witkowski, returning from a 10-game suspension, kept the fights with Haley close.
His fights were the eighth and ninth fighting majors for Haley this season, and he is making a career of fisticuffs, an unusual role in the sport in recent seasons in which fighting is generally in decline.
The Red Wings were skated hard by the Panthers for much of the first as Florida built a 12-6 advantage in shots on goal 2/3 of the way through the period.
Panthers' forwards descended upon a defenseless Howard at times, and controlled the puck directly in front of him in the crease without a lot of opposition.
Red Wings schedule
But the Wings got some offense going, and outshot the Panthers 5-0 late in the period.
The offensive produced a goal by Zetterberg, at 18:27.
The Red Wings outshot the Panthers 12-6 in the second period, picking up the pace and possession of the puck as the period went on, and beginning to dominate the game geographically.
Hotly contested, the period featured lots of combativeness in scrums and after whistles, and linesmen frequently intervening.
Despite all the action, the Wings could not add to Zetterberg's goal.
“In the end, if you look at the game, the real story was we had lots of chances and we couldn't score,” Blashill said.
“I don't know, for two games in a row, that's kind of been the story for me.”

Bitcoin made its debut on a major exchange on Dec. 10, 2017, opening at $15,000 per unit at the Chicago board options exchange. (Photo: Anthony Wallace / Getty Images)
Is bitcoin in a bubble?
The price of bitcoin has been soaring this year, and last week alone it jumped from $11,000 to well over $17,000, according to Coindesk. It started the year below $1,000.
That rocketing level of appreciation smells a lot like an irrational investor mania to many economists and financial pros, the kind that sent prices for unprofitable startup internet companies soaring in the dot-com boom. Those prices eventually came crashing down.
“We saw this in the 1990s,” says Barry Ritholtz, chairman and chief investment officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management. “Any of those things sound familiar? ‘This is unique, this will change everything?'”
Like many others in finance, Ritholtz expects the bitcoin bubble to pop. The only question is when. “Some people think it's early days, some people think it's late,” Ritholtz said. “We'll find out in the not-too-distant-future who is right.”
Robert Shiller and Joseph Stiglitz, two Nobel-prize winning economists who've seen their share of speculative manias, recently have called bitcoin a bubble. Stiglitz went so far as to tell Bloomberg TV that bitcoin should be “outlawed.”
Bitcoin was created in hopes it would become a new kind of currency that people could use outside of the traditional banking system, without backing from any country or central bank. It was also supposed to operate outside of government oversight, which has raised concerns that it will be a haven for criminals.
Unlike traditional currencies, bitcoin doesn't have a country backing it, a central bank, interest rates, or a long history of exchange rates against other currencies, making it extremely difficult to place a value on. Its value is tied only to what people believe it's worth at any given time.
Despite the growing interest, bitcoin still is not widely accepted in stores to buy merchandise, and you can't deposit it at a bank. One of the problems with using it as a currency is that its value keeps bouncing around, sometimes very suddenly.
“We have seen bitcoin more as a speculative investment rather than an equivalent to cash,” says J. Craig Shearman, spokesman for the National Retail Federation, the world's largest trade association of retailers. “Even if it were a foreign currency, you need to dependably know what the exchange rate is, and bitcoin doesn't meet any of those tests.”
Backers of bitcoin say it's about time for a new kind of currency that can be exchanged in private and secure ways. Its promoters include internet entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.
This week mainstream financial markets are for the first time allowing investors to make future bets on the direction of bitcoin, but bitcoins themselves will be continued to be traded only on private exchanges, which are mostly out of reach of regulators.
Mark Fratella, a teacher who lives in Elmhurst, Illinois, bought some bitcoin “for the novelty of it” back when it was worth $700 or $800.
Fratella is holding onto his bitcoin, and buying a little more from time to time. He's also buying other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum and Litecoin. He's heard the talk of a bitcoin bubble.
“But I have also seen a few analysts talk about how, in the grand scheme of things, there are a relatively low amount of people into bitcoin and there is a huge potential for growth,” he said. With the futures trade starting, Fratella thinks people who have been leery of its decentralized, deregulated nature will start buying into it too.
The futures also give investors the opportunity to “short” bitcoin – that is bet that its price will go down — which presently is very difficult to near impossible to do.
While the value of bitcoin itself may be inflated, even some of its biggest critics say that the technology that's behind bitcoin has promise. That technology is called blockchain. It's a kind of digital ledger that securely records transactions and prevents the same bitcoin from being spent twice.
Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase, has called bitcoin “a fraud” that will eventually “blow up.” But Dimon also said he thought the blockchain technology was “good” and could be used to make transactions faster and easier.
For now, people keep buying bitcoin, even with all the talk of a bubble. To Ritholtz, the enthusiasm is a combination of the novelty of bitcoin, the built-in scarcity of it – only 21 million of them will ever be created — and the psychology of people being attracted to assets whose prices appear to keep going up.
“One of the first rules of investing is, only invest in things you understand,” Ritholtz said. “If you want to speculate in a cryptocurrency and you don't understand it, you might get lucky for a while but those sorts of speculations don't work out well.”

ISLAMABAD - The recent affection and benevolence of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan on the electables, who have joined his party in droves, have surprised many but not those who knew his impulsive nature and wavering stance, which kept on changing most of the time drastically.
Once considered pariahs in Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and party chairman Imran Khan used to dub them the ugly faces of the Pakistani politics and symbols of status quo, now he seemed defending these electables and justifying their adoption and absorption in the party only to ensure stepping into the power echelons.
A critical view of Imran Khan's politics revealed that even when his party had not hit the popularity he had taken many summersaults and U-turns.
Soon after the October 1999 coup and toppling of Nawaz Sharif government, PTI Chairman Imran Khan attempted to come closer to the military dictator and even supported him but when he failed to make inroads into the power corridors after 2002 elections he took a U-turn and turned against him.
In those days, Imran Khan raised the slogan of bringing a change in the national politics, which at that time he considered not possible with the old faces, and even up till 2013 general elections he was having the same views.
But now he was seen defending induction of electables and granted preference to them on the old and diehard party loyalists standing with him in thick and thin. Now he was of the view that without having electables in the party fold it would not be possible to win elections as just loyalty and longstanding affiliation with the party is not sufficient to get the party ticket.
In his recent television interviews, Imran Khan said that in certain constituencies without electables one could not even think of winning elections, adding he believed in making the institutions strong and whosoever would be in their fold would automatically be moulded in the system.
The impulsive nature of PTI Chief Imran Khan not only landed him in difficult position but also landed the party in embarrassing position making it hard for the party leadership to defend his decisions and policies.
The recent in the list was the appointment of caretaker chief minister Punjab when Shahbaz Sharif picked Tariq Khosa, included in the list of the names proposed by PTI, but a few hours later withdrew his candidature in the face of severe criticism on his candidature in social media.
The U-turn rather about turn was so sudden and abrupt that the PTI Leader of Opposition in Punjab Assembly Mahmoodur Rashid found it hard to defend it and ultimately faced embarrassment.
Right from staging sit-in alleging massive rigging in the 2013 general elections to the formation of judicial commission and initiation of probe into the Panamagate scandal, PTI moves were replete with massive U-turns, which even led to dubbing Imran Khan as U-Turn Khan on social media.
The impulsive reaction of PTI Chief Imran Khan on sensitive political issues was causing a lot of problems for him and his party, admitted some of the senior party leaders who did not want to be named and said that this casual handling of sensitive political issues had caused enormous damage to the party's popularity, especially in the educated class, which mainly attracted to PTI and Imran Khan in the name of change and bringing in and introducing middle class political leadership.
The claim of ‘35 punctures' in 2013 general elections and the retraction from this very serious nature of allegations by just saying that it was a political statement would not do any good to Imran Khan and would only lower his political stature and make an impression of him as a non-serious person.
Once again taking of an extreme position against other main political players in the arena like Pakistan People's Party had also landed the PTI leadership in an awkward position when in elections for Senate Chairman and Deputy Chairman the party had to vote for PPP-backed candidate for deputy chairman Senate Saleem Mandviwala.
Similarly, the fresh statement of Imran Khan that he would sit on opposition benches instead of forming coalition government with PPP was again an impulsive statement not wise on part of a national level leader, as in politics anything can happen and the situation after July 25 elections could compel Imran Khan to go for a coalition government in case of split mandate and obviously PPP would be one of the stakeholders in the exercise.
Around 10 p.m. New Year's Eve, Regina police were dispatched to The Tap Off-Sale at 4245 Rochdale Boulevard for a report of an armed robbery.
According to police, two suspects entered the business and attempted to steal a bottle of alcohol.
When staff members attempted to stop the men, one suspect pulled a machete and struck the employees in the hands.
The two men fled the scene, but were later located and arrested.
Thomas Chartrand is charged with robbery, two counts of assault with a weapon, and possession of a prohibited weapon.
Charles Wapan is charged with robbery and breach of probation.
They can be as small as a rock or baggage tag, but foreign objects on the airport runway can have real consequences.
The Kelowna International Airport held a special exercise Friday to remind staff to stay vigilant when it comes to debris on the tarmac.
Clad in high-viz vests, airport staff and others whose work brings them to the Kelowna International Airport, were sweeping the tarmac for what officials call “foreign object debris.”
These foreign objects on the runway or apron can have serious safety implications.
“A screwdriver could punch a hole in an aircraft tire, so when he lands or departs he is landing not quite the way he should. It could cause him to veer off slightly,” said Darrell Belgrove, chief of airport operations and fire.
“Today we found a piece of bubble wrap that was probably about two feet square. If an aircraft ingested something like that…the hazards and the risks are high.”
Belgrove said some items, like the bubble wrap, may be carried by the wind onto airport property.
The worst-case scenario was the deadly Concorde crash in France 17 years ago that was triggered by a piece of metal on the runway.
Airport staff routinely look for debris. Friday's exercise was meant to be a reminder for the entire airport community to be on the lookout for foreign objects on the runway and apron.

THE newly-constructed St. Jude Hospital morgue has moved one step closer to becoming operational after the building was officially handed over to the Board of Directors of the hospital by the Ministry of Health on Wednesday.
Minister for Health and Wellness, Mary Isaac, along with Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Health & Wellness, Felix St. Hill, joined the hospital's Board of Directors and management team for the handover and a walkthrough of the facility.
Following the walkthrough, the group met at the George Odlum Stadium to discuss the way forward for the morgue. St Hill stated that the plan is to have the facility operational in short order.
“We would like to put it into operation almost immediately. So that is what we're going to be doing with the morgue. Rather than wait till the completion of the entire hospital, we're going to put the operations of the morgue into use almost immediately,” St Hill said.
The morgue, along with the ambulance and security monitoring buildings, was constructed by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) with financing from the government of Mexico. The keys and operational manuals for the morgue were handed over to the Government of St. Lucia by UNOPS in July after the building was retrofitted.
St. Jude Hospital Chairman, Dr. Ulric Mondesir, said it would have been a more joyous occasion had the entire hospital been handed over to the Board of Directors and people of Vieux Fort.
“I'm in relentless pursuit to see that this hospital, St. Jude Hospital, be opened. If it is opened between December and January, it will be a gift for Christmas to the sick man. It will be a New Year's gift for the sick man. We need this hospital opened sooner than we think,” Dr. Mondesir said.
The morgue building is located at the original site of St. Jude Hospital. The facility is fully-equipped and also contains water and electricity.
BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (AP)  Three years after her husband was found shot to death, a Southern California woman was convicted of murder after prosecutors said she conspired with her lover to kill him.
A Kern County jury on Thursday found Sabrina Limon, 37, guilty of murder, conspiracy to commit murder and accessory to murder.
Robert Limon, a railroad worker, was found fatally shot near Bakersfield in 2014.
Prosecutors said Sabrina Limon conspired with former firefighter Jonathan Hearn in the killing so they could be together.

As part of a plea deal reached in January, Hearn, 27, agreed to plead no contest to counts including voluntary manslaughter in exchange for helping the prosecution of Sabrina Limon.
"Hearn saved his own butt," Limon's attorney, Richard Terry, said after Thursday's verdict was read.
Terry argued throughout the trial that Hearn's testimony  the only direct evidence against his client  could not be trusted.
During three days of testimony, Sabrina Limon acknowledged the affair but said she knew nothing of Hearn's plan to kill her husband.
She also explained her failure to tell investigators about Hearn  even after they repeatedly asked if she or her husband had lovers  as an effort to preserve their reputations.
Prosecutor Eric Smith said the jury returned "a just result" and said he believed the evidence supported its findings.
Limon was found not guilty of attempted murder and of mingling harmful substances into food or drink, according to the Bakersfield Californian (http://bit.ly/2gfMlDR ).
She could face 25 years to life in prison at her Nov. 3 sentencing.
Outside the courthouse, Robert Limon's sister, Chris Wilson, said she was relieved the trial is over.
"It'll never bring my brother back, but it will bring justice, and that's what we've been looking for," she said.

This animation—produced in collaboration with Yoni Goodman—covers cholera transmission, prevention, signs, and care in a simple and accessible way.
The award-winning animated film—The Story of Cholera—is designed to help affected populations around the world better understand how to prevent cholera. The film has been seen in virtually every country in the world, and is currently narrated in 35 languages.
The story features a young boy who helps a health worker save his father and then guides his village in preventing cholera from spreading. By making the invisible cholera germs visible, this simple animated narrative brings to life the teaching points of cholera prevention.
The Story of Cholera is widely used as a general tool for teaching sanitation and hygiene, and has become a favorite educational tool among communication for development specialists, aid workers, animators, and public health experts. It has been translated and narrated by groups all over the world, and used in diverse settings such as refugee camps in Lebanon and state-wide training programs in India.
The importance and excellence of the film has been recognized by a large number of awards: it has won 10 and been an “official selection” at 12 film festivals, including Annecy, the most renown in the world of animation. The film has been featured on numerous websites including the Harvard School of Public Health.
The last few years have seen the FCC move to the foreground of the tech world with some far-reaching decisions that were aimed at protecting the open internet — but also made the agency some powerful enemies. Commissioner Mignon Clyburn is still holding the net neutrality torch, and she'll be joining us at Disrupt NY to talk about it.
Clyburn, originally from South Carolina, was appointed to the FCC in 2013 by President Obma. Since then she has made it her business to “put #consumersfirst,” as she often puts it. Under former Chairman Tom Wheeler's leadership, that meant putting strong rules in place around net neutrality and privacy — rules now being openly targeted by the agency's new leadership.
But while that has led to some conflict, Clyburn has other issues on her plate that aren't as subject to partisan interference: overseeing new broadband deployments, promoting transparency and diverse leadership in TV stations and other organizations, and ensuring the economically disadvantaged and disabled aren't excluded from the modern internet-based economy.
She has also led efforts for years to expose and change the trend of private prisons restricting communication and charging inmates and their families exorbitant fees for simple video or audio calls.
Commissioner Clyburn joins a list of all-star speakers at TC Disrupt NY, which goes down May 15 to May 17. You can pick up your tickets here at the Early Bird price until this Friday, 4/21.

BSTDB ready to issue bonds in Azerbaijani manats (exclusive)
2017-10-06 20:00 | www.trend.az | 1
Baku, Azerbaijan, Sept. 29
By Azad Hasanli – Trend:
The Black Sea Trade and Development Bank (BSTDB) is ready to issue bonds in Azerbaijani manats, BSTDB President Ihsan Delikanli said in an interview with Trend.
"We have initiated the discussion with the relevant Azerbaijani authorities earlier this year and are ready to continue this dialog," he noted. "As a matter of business strategy, we are developing and gradually introducing bonds and financial products denominated in the national currencies of our member states."
The BSTDB has started this program from Georgia in 2015 and already issued bonds in national currency for Georgia (worth 60 million laris in 2015), and most recently provided a national currency loan worth one billion rubles in Russia in June 2017.
Other international financial organizations are also interested in issuing bonds in manats. For example, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Developlment (EBRD) has repeatedly announced such plans.
EBRD President Suma Chakrabarti said earlier that all the procedures necessary for issuing bonds are ready, but the bank expects the relevant situation on the market.
The BSTDB was established by Azerbaijan, Albania, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Moldova, Armenia, Romania, Turkey, Ukraine and Russia. The bank's authorized capital is 3.45 billion euros.
Paediatricians should offer intrauterine methods of contraception as first-line birth control options for youth, the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) says in a new position statement.
The statement, released Thursday, looks at the pros and cons of each type of birth control method and provides healthcare providers with the strategies and tools to help them discuss suitable contraception methods to youth.
READ MORE: One-third of young Canadian women can't afford menstrual products, report finds
“Long-acting reversible contraception is a really effective and safe way to provide contraception,” says Dr. Giosi Di Meglio, member of the CPS Adolescent Health Committee. “In Canada, the only long-acting reversible contraception that we currently have been the intrauterine system (IUS) and the intrauterine devices (IUD), but providers are often under the misperception that they're not safe to use in teenagers and we're trying to get the message out that they are safe to use with teenagers.”
According to Di Meglio, this outdated perception dates back to the 1970s where people thought that the intrauterine contraceptives increased the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, which is actually not the case. They were worried about fertility so they tended to use intrauterine contraception for people who already had completed their families, or felt that the risk of infertility was not a concern to them.
An IUD or IUS is a small, often T-shaped device implanted inside the uterus by a healthcare provider to prevent pregnancy. Both methods can stay in place over the course of several years but can be removed at any time by a healthcare provider.
The two methods are more than 99 per cent effect, the CPS says. This is compared to the hormone pills which are 91 per cent effective and condoms which are 82 per cent.
Just like with any method of contraception though, intrauterine methods do come with some potential risks and side effects, but they are often minimal.
If you are allergic to copper, there may be a possibility of an allergic reaction, De Meglio says. However, that is rare.
If you have an untreated pelvic infection, then the device or system may also impact your fertility. This is something physicians will discuss before putting the device or system in and any potential symptoms of an infection will be discussed beforehand.
As well, there is a slight increased risk of acquiring an infection from the bacteria within the vagina after insertion.
“Any time you do anything in the womb as a procedure and you go through the vagina, you have a tiny risk of infection,” Di Meglio explains. “But if you treat it promptly, then it's not an issue for fertility.”
There is also a small risk of perforation when the device is inserted. And lastly, some people's body may reject the device and it may fall out. That, too, is rare, Di Meglio says.
As for side effects, some devices come with more than others.
“With the copper IUD, it can increase cramps and the volume of bleeding when you have your period,” Di Meglio points out. “And with both types of IUDs, sometimes when you insert it, there is a period of time when you have a lot of spotting after the insertion but that usually settles down.”
READ MORE: Should women be entitled to time off work during their periods?
And with the IUS, Di Meglio says sometimes people will bleed a lot less or not at all while menstruating. Usually, with this method, there aren't a lot of side effects. In fact, the cramping one experiences during a period is often less.
Every now and then, Di Meglio says she'll encounter people who have side effects from the small levels of hormones that come with these methods, like nausea.
However, the benefits of IUD and IUS methods far outweigh the minor and rare side effects and risks.
The CPS statement also advises that providers:
Discuss sexual health, fertility, family planning and contraception with all youth starting early in adolescence, preferably before they become sexually active
Have a collaborative approach that empowers youth to makes informed decisions about their birth control options
Encourage youth to always use condoms, regardless of the method of birth control they use, to prevent sexually transmitted infections
Inform youth about emergency contraception as back-up methods of preventing pregnancy
Di Meglio hopes that these recommendations help in reducing common barriers adolescent girls run into today when it comes to contraception and their sexual health — barriers like the cost and the referral process, which Di Meglio says hinders an efficient process because healthcare providers would rather send patients to another doctor rather than doing the process themselves.
“We want to make contraception use as simple as possible for youth,” Di Meglio says. “We want providers of all sorts to have contact with youth to facilitate the use of contraceptives and we're encouraging also discussion before people are even sexually active. We also want to encourage providers to encourage parents to have those conversations so that parents are then in the loop as much as possible so that they too can encourage young people to use effective contraception.”
The biggest news in the Dragon Ball FighterZ world this weekend was Dominique “SonicFox” McLean finally defeating rival Goichi “GO1” Kishida, but the rest of Combo Breaker was pretty thrilling too. One tense standoff in particular served as a perfect example of a confusing fighting game concept known as ‘neutral.'
Neutral is hard to parse simply because everyone has a different idea of what the term means and what constitutes neutral play. At its most basic, neutral refers to the moments in fighting game matches when neither player is at an advantage or disadvantage in terms of positioning, spacing, or momentum. Another core concept known as ‘footsies'—a back-and-forth tug-of-war—is a common sight in neutral, but it's also possible to play footsies outside this state, like when one player has been backed into a corner.
An experienced fighting game player might not be able to completely spell out the definition, but they can typically tell when they enter and exit neutral against their opponent. Spectators don't have the benefit of perceiving momentum in the same way competitors do, but we got a rare glimpse of what neutral feels like in one of Combo Breaker's Dragon Ball FighterZ quarterfinal matches.
Eduardo “HookGangGod” Deno and Ryo “Dogura” Nozaki are considered among the best players in the world, but neither was prepared to wrap up their weekend, making for a high-energy match from the start. In their first game, HookGangGod and Dogura found themselves whittled down to a final character (Dragon Ball FighterZ competitors start with three characters each), and that's when the intense neutral game set in.

An intricate dance of attacks and strategic movement followed as both players tried to find an opening. In addition to fishing for strikes, HookGangGod and Dogura did their best to remain in the air to simplify defense by removing the high-low ground game (known as ‘chicken blocking'). The situation is especially dangerous for Dogura thanks to his low health and HookGangGod's usage of Sparking, which considerably increases a character's offensive potential.
Neutral moments are a common in Dragon Ball FighterZ due to the way it handles incoming characters. Unlike Marvel vs. Capcom, which allows players to move and set up offense after defeating an opponent's character and waiting for the next one to enter the battlefield, Dragon Ball essentially resets the match, returning both characters to the middle of the stage separated by a set distance. Just like at the start of a match, there is no inherent advantage for either player, which makes these situations fertile ground for neutral play.
The competitors kept up this tense back-and-forth for almost a minute, during which Dogura countered multiple Dragon Rush attempts from HookGangGod. As the closest thing Dragon Ball FighterZ has to a traditional throw, Dragon Rushes—signified by the flash of green around the player using it and a flurry of blows between characters—have a nine-frame (or .15 seconds) window where they can be broken by the defender. Dogura was able to avoid a sure death from these Dragon Rushes four times in total until finally succumbing to a mid-air punish that secured the game for HookGangGod.

A core part of learning how to play games like Dragon Ball FighterZ at a basic level is being able to dissect the action on-screen and strategize on the fly. Very rarely are situations as simple and clear as this one, and that's what made it so exciting: everyone was on the same page and breathless as they waited for that final hit.

April 24 (UPI) -- A federal judge Tuesday ruled the government must resume accepting applications to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
Judge John D. Bates of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia issued the decision giving the Department of Homeland Security 90 days to provide a legal reason for the Obama-era program, which protects hundreds of thousands of children of undocumented immigrants from deportation, to be rescinded.
If the department is unable to provide a valid reason to rescind the DACA program it will be reinstated in full and the agency will be required to begin accepting applications.
"Each day that the agency delays is a day that aliens who might otherwise be eligible for initial grants of DACA benefits are exposed to removal because of an unlawful agency action," Bates wrote.
He ruled the department's decision to end the program on the premise it was unlawful was "virtually unexplained."
"Neither the meager legal reasoning nor the assessment of litigation risk provided by DHS to support its rescission decision is sufficient to sustain termination of the DACA program," Bates wrote.
Spokesman Devin O'Malley said the U.S. Department of Justice is reviewing the judge's decision.
"Today's order doesn't change the Department of Justice's position on the facts: DACA was implemented unilaterally after Congress declined to extend benefits to this same group of illegal aliens," O'Malley said. "The Justice Department will continue to vigorously defend this position."
Two other federal judges in New York and California previously blocked President Donald Trump's efforts to end DACA on the principle his administration hadn't offered legally adequate reasons to rescind the program.
Executive director of the Washington D.C.-based advocacy organization National Immigration Forum Ali Noorani praised Tuesday's decision.
"This decision verifies the Trump administration failed to prove the DACA program is illegal," Noorani said. "Either President Trump finds another way to end the program, tossing hundreds of thousands of young people into deportation proceedings, or he works with Republicans and Democrats to find a legislative solution that secures our border and ensures Dreamers continue contributing to our economy."
"After six years of war and human carnage in Syria... six years of heartbreak for so many Syrian families... there comes a new horror that must break the heart of anyone who has one,"
"More than 60 children reportedly killed in an attack on a bus convoy yesterday outside Aleppo. A convoy of families who for so long had already known so much suffering. Now the survivors must bear such a new and terrible loss,"
"We must draw from this not only anger, but renewed determination to reach all the innocent children throughout Syria with help and comfort. And draw from it also the hope that all those with the heart and the power to end this war will do so."
"This is one of the worst, most horrifying massacres. We urge our president Assad to help us out. What happened can't be described. Oh, dear God! We don't know what to do,"
WARNING: GRAPHIC VIDEO, WATCH AT YOUR DISCRETION
The UN Children's Fund has condemned the killing of more than 60 children in a recent Aleppo bomb attack targeting evacuees.Lake urged not only for regret, but for action to ensure that the war ends soon, saying,While Syrian state media reported up to 40 fatalities on the day of the blast, on Monday the toll rose to 125 people killed, according to local human rights groups. The attack came at the same time as the Syrian government was carrying out the internationally-brokered evacuation of two towns.The evacuation was continued soon after the attack, for which no one has yet claimed responsibility.

A naughty wild elephant attacked a broken down bus as its driver filmed the rampage from inside.
The tour bus had no passengers on board when it broke down on a road in Wild Elephant Valley, a protected habitat, in China.
China News Service reported that conservation officer advised the driver to get out and abandon his vehicle, but he decided to stay put.
He managed to record the huge animal head butting and smashing the bus' windscreen, but stayed back away from his driving seat.

Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., August 14, 2017.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several big-name hedge fund investors trimmed their stakes in healthcare companies in the second quarter as the sector led the broad U.S. stock market higher, rallying as Republican efforts to repeal and replace President Obama's signature healthcare law dimmed.
New York-based Jana Partners sold all of its shares in nine healthcare companies, ranging from small-cap biotech company Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc to health information company WebMD Health Corp to insurance giant Aetna Inc, according to quarterly filings released Monday.
Billionaire Daniel Loeb's Third Point sold 175,000 shares, or about 18 percent of its stake, in health insurance company Humana Inc and 5 million shares of hospital products maker Baxter International Inc, a cut of approximately 10 percent of its prior position.
Healthcare stocks in the S&P 500 rose 6.7 percent in the second quarter, more than double the 2.6 percent gain in the broad S&P 500 index. Senate Republicans delayed a vote on a healthcare overhaul bill on June 27 after it became clear that they did not have enough votes for it to pass. One month later, a scaled-down plan to replace the Affordable Care Act failed in the Senate.
Quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers' stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are one of the few public ways of tracking what the managers are selling and buying. But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some risk because the disclosures come out 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions.
Overall, hedge funds gained 1 percent in the second quarter, according to Chicago-based fund tracker Hedge Fund Research, less than half of the 2.5 percent gain in the first quarter.
There were few signs that hedge fund managers were attempting to call a bottom in energy stocks as the falling price of oil helped send the sector down 7 percent in the quarter. New York-based Third Point sold all of its stake in Rice Energy Inc, Halcon Resources Corp, Enerplus Corp, and Pioneer Natural Resources Co
Jana Partners sold all of its stake in Resolute Energy Corp, while New York-based Omega Advisors sold its entire stake in seven energy companies, including Cheniere Energy Inc, Eclipse Resources Corp, and Williams Partners LP.
Workers in Ontario have fought long and hard for the $15-an-hour minimum wage, and there is no good reason to delay the increase. With data coming in since the January 2018 increase, it's clear that improving standards for all workers helps our province. Shortly after the government tabled Bill 148, Ontarians began to see a steady stream of ominous headlines about the negative consequences of a $15 minimum wage. Some critics warned that the size and speed of the increase would almost certainly lead to large-scale job losses and runaway inflation.
“It's simply not fair for people in Ontario to go to work every day and still not be able to afford rent or groceries for their families,” writes Naureen Rizvi. “Paying all workers an increased minimum wage is the first step towards addressing this inequality, though that's not where it ends.” ( Jonathan Hayward / THE CANADIAN PRESS )
These apocalyptic predications have not come true since the changes were enacted. Workers knew that by raising standards, we would all benefit. When we compare Ontario's labour market with other large Canadian provinces, zeroing in on those segments where minimum wageworkers are over-represented found that Ontario's job numbers did not significantly underperform provinces with stagnant minimum wages. In the first four months of 2018 Ontario's overall number of jobs contracted by one per cent, which was in line with Quebec (also one per cent) and the Canada-wide average (0.9 per cent).
Article Continued Below
Workers aged 15 to 24 in Ontario, who are over-represented in minimum-wage work; saw a 4.4 per cent reduction in their employment, which was slightly above the Canada-wide average (4.1 per cent) but below the average in British Columbia (6.5 per cent). As for inflation, prices across Canada rose by 1.9 per cent over the past four months. In Ontario, the figure is only marginally higher at 2.1 per cent. These numbers are not indicative of catastrophe. If an elevated minimum wage did not lead to significant job losses or high levels of inflation, what did it do? It changed lives. In Ontario, average hourly earnings are up 8 per cent in retail and over 9 per cent in accommodation and food services. These figures dramatically outpaced other provinces. Ontario-wide, the average wage rate is up by 2.1 per cent in the first four months of the year, which is 50 per cent higher than the Canadian average.
What's special about this growth is that it's combatting income inequality. The growth is concentrated in the lower part of income distribution, and it actually increased median wage growth. I cannot stress how rare this is, and how important. It's simply not fair for people in Ontario to go to work every day and still not be able to afford rent or groceries for their families. Paying all workers an increased minimum wage is the first step towards addressing this inequality, though that's not where it ends.

Both the NDP and the Liberals have committed to increasing the minimum wage to the legislated $15 an hour in January 2019. Andrea Horwath's NDP further pledged to expand the higher minimum wage to apply to servers, students under 18, homeworkers and all other workers who are currently carved out from the increase and allowed to be paid an even lower amount. Ontario PC leader Doug Ford, on the other hand, is still trying to sell the corporate line that a higher wage will decimate the economy, and vowed to freeze the minimum wage at $14 an hour, depriving hundreds of thousands of workers of a scheduled pay raise. Even coupled with his tax scheme this could cost minimum wage earners $800 a year. Ontarians have a stark choice to make about what kind of government we want to elect on June 7. I hope voters choose a party that is able to look at the facts in front of it and create a platform that works for working people. Because it is clear, there is no good reason to freeze the minimum wage. Naureen Rizvi is Unifor Ontario regional director.

With flu season upon us, a Canadian doctor has taken it upon himself to explore whether there's a scientific basis to the widely held idea that men exaggerate flu symptoms.
The so-called “man flu” is defined by the Oxford dictionary as “a cold or similar minor ailment as experienced by a man who is regarded as exaggerating the severity of the symptoms.”
But as family medicine professor Kyle Sue of Memorial University of Newfoundland wrote in the British Medical Journal, there has been no scientific review of research pertaining to gender differences in flu symptoms.
“Tired of being accused of overreacting, I searched the available evidence to determine whether men really experience worse symptoms and whether this could have any evolutionary basis,” Sue wrote.
His conclusion: Men may genuinely have more severe symptoms when they're hit with a common cold.
WATCH: Canadian researchers prove ‘man flu' is real
Sue arrived at his thesis after analyzing the scientific literature and unearthing several pieces of evidence which suggest men may actually be more vulnerable to the flu.
For example, a 10-year observational study from the U.S. found that men had higher rates of flu-related deaths compared to women, while a study from Hong Kong found that adult men were more likely to be admitted to hospital due to flu.
Sue also cited studies which found women are more responsive to the flu vaccine than men, including one which found that high testosterone levels could weaken men's immune responses following flu vaccination.
READ MORE: The ‘man flu' is real – viruses want to kill men more than women: study
There may even be an evolutionary reason — in a review article titled “The sicker sex,” biologist Marlene Zuk posited that the advantages of high testosterone in males' reproductive strategy may override the cons associated with immune system suppression.
“Arguments about the weaker sex notwithstanding, there is no contest about the identity of the sicker sex—it is males, almost every time,” Zuk wrote in her introduction.
However, Sue cautions that the evidence is very limited in scope and that several more studies will need to be carried out before anyone can come to a conclusive understanding of the “man flu.”
He says one potential study could look into whether whether men with strong immune systems are less successful at mating, and vice versa.
WATCH: Flu shot update
Scientific theorizing aside, Sue also offered a tongue-in-cheek insight into the potential advantages of exaggerating one's flu symptoms, dubbing the common definition of the man flu “potentially unjust.”
“There are benefits to energy conservation when ill. Lying on the couch, not getting out of bed, or receiving assistance with activities of daily living could also be evolutionary behaviours that protect against predators,” he wrote.
“Perhaps now is the time for male friendly spaces, equipped with enormous televisions and reclining chairs, to be set up where men can recover from the debilitating effects of man flu in safety and comfort.”

B.C. Hydro contractors have run into “geotechnical and construction challenges” that mean the Site C dam project will not be able to make its target of diverting the Peace River in the summer of 2019.
B.C. Hydro president Chris O'Riley confirmed the delay in a letter to the B.C. Utilities Commission, estimating an extra cost of $610 million that brings the total estimate to $8.9 billion for the most expensive construction project in B.C. history.
O'Riley said there is enough money in the project's contingency fund for the cost, and a “one-year float” in the project schedule means it can still be completed as scheduled by November 2024. Other risks remain, including a road realignment to avoid evicting the last two holdout farming couples who live on the narrow riverside land and have already been paid in an expropriation to make way for the dam.
“Due to the project's complexity, we expect to continue to face risks in other areas, including our second largest procurement (i.e. the generating station and spillway) that remains open and the highway realignment,” O'Riley wrote. “We will work to mitigate those challenges.”
The project is undergoing a review by the commission on the orders of Premier John Horgan, who made it a prominent issue during his years as NDP opposition leader. Under a tight deadline of Nov. 1 to make recommendations to the B.C. cabinet, the commission has already noted that Site C has been drawing heavily on contingency funds to deal with a tension crack in the riverbank and other issues.
Energy Minister Michelle Mungall said the delay is not a result of the NDP government's review, ordered after former B.C. Hydro CEO Jessica Macdonald was fired this summer. The new government has commissioned reports on the cost of delaying or abandoning the project, which O'Riley says should continue after two years of work and nearly $2 billion spent.
“Despite the challenges we have encountered and the risks that remain, our analysis continues to confirm that completing Site C as planned is still the most cost-effective option for our customers,” O'Riley said. “Suspending or terminating and finding the power we need from other sources – which carries its own set of uncertainties – would cost billions more than completing Site C.”
South Korea's major pharmaceutical firms saw their revenues from exports of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) increase last year, industry sources said Tuesday.
API refers to key chemicals used to produce pharmaceutical drugs.
Yuhan Corp., a major drug company, said its revenue from overseas shipments of API jumped nearly 30 percent on-year to 250 billion won ($220 million) in 2016, company officials said.
(Yonhap)
Yuhan said its API business also accounts for 19 percent of the company's total revenue worth 1.32 trillion won.Major demand growth comes from leading global pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer Inc. which manufacturers drug for AIDS and high-priced Hepatitis C treatment.ST Farm, a subsidiary under Dong-A Socio Holdings Co. manufacturing API, also generates 82 percent of its revenue from overseas shipments.The company currently exports API for anti-virus to the Britain-based pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline Plc. (GSK) as well as Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis.Chong Kun Dang Bio, an API arm of Chong Kun Dang Pharmaceutical, said 81 percent of its revenue came from overseas markets. (Yonhap)

LAHORE - Subordinates and batch-mates burst into tears as coffins of seven martyred officers were brought, in a row, for funeral prayers at the Elite police training center on Lahore's Badian road yesterday.
Hundreds of people were attending the prayers to pay respects to the sons of the soil, who were among the 13 people killed in a suicide attack on Monday in Lahore that saddened the whole nation.
The bomber had exploded his suicide jacket close to a group of policemen on The Mall, city‘s leading artery housing key government installations, business centers, and shopping malls.
Lahore's chief traffic officer, DIG Syed Ahmed Mobeen and Acting DIG (Operations) Zahid Akram Gondal were among the police officers who laid their lives in the line of duty.
At the funeral, senior politicians, police officials and friends and relatives of the victims were standing in queues as a group of smart cops presented traditional gun-salute to the martyred cops.
Some of the colleagues of the martyred officers were weeping profusely, others struggling to control their emotions while consoling and comforting each other. Until Monday evening, they could not even imagine that they would be meeting like this at the prayers ground next morning.
Punjab Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who is said to have been a close friend of DIG Capt (r) Mobeen, was in tears, and so was inspector general of police Mushtaq Ahmed Sukhera. Some senior military officers present there also failed to control their emotions. They offered funeral prayers and comforted the relatives of the victims.
Following the funeral prayers, the bodies were taken for burial in local graveyards amid massive security arrangements. Police commandoes were seen escorting the convoy of vehicles including ambulances.
Besides those killed, over 100 people were wounded in the deadly assault on a protest demonstration of pharmacists against the new drug sale laws in front of the Punjab Assembly. The suicide bomber struck when the police officers were holding negotiations with the protesters to get the blocked road cleared.
“DIG Syed Ahmed Mobeen and Acting DIG Zahid Akram Gondal were buried in police uniforms,” a police spokesman told The Nation. “They are heroes of the police department. They will live in the hearts of police force forever.”
Syed Hammad Raza, who worked as public relations officer with DIG Mobeen, said that the city traffic police department and its facilitation centres almost remained closed on Tuesday to mourn the death of the chief, who was very kind to his subordinates.
Mobeen had distributed welfare funds worth millions of rupees among the deserving policemen days after he took the charge of his new assignment in November.
“He used to admonish his staff over mistakes but he rarely awarded punishments to his subordinates. He was the captain in the true sense of the word,” Hammad said sobbingly.
Thousands of Lahore policemen remained on-guard across the provincial metropolis amid security threats as traffic officers were standing at duty-points to ensure smooth flow of vehicular traffic on the city roads. The police patrol was intensified in the town amid VVIP movement as police equipped with assault rifles stood guard on various routes. Gun-mounted police vehicles were also continuously on patrol.
Gloom prevailed at Lahore's almost over 100 police stations. Most of the cops at their stations sat highly depressed, showing little interest in their routine work. Special prayers were also held for the martyred officers at all the police stations in city.
“We are performing our duty with broken hearts. [But] the terrorist, the enemy of this land, can't deter our resolve and commitment with the uniform we are wearing. The loss we suffered last night is however irreparable,” said police officer Sajid Noor, who works as a station house officer in Lahore.
Police constable Farooq said that Tuesday was a sad day as far as their day-to-day working was concerned.
“We miss our officers. Most of the (police) force remained busy on law and order duties throughout the day. When the cops came back to barracks in the evening, they met their colleagues and they kept discussing the sacrifices of their friends and officers,” said Farooq, who works at the Qila Gujjar Singh police station as clerk.
Besides the aforesaid two officers, the policemen who lost their lives in Monday's bombing included DIG Mobeen's telephone operator ASI Muhammad Amin, and bodyguards Muhammad Aslam and Ifran Mahmood. Constable Nadeem Kamyana and Muhammad Azmat Ali were also among the martyred.
Hundreds of policemen have lost their lives in recent years while fighting terrorists in a relatively peaceful Punjab province. The provincial police also killed hundreds of terrorists and their accomplices during many successful security operations.
The battle is on, as stated by the provincial police chief on Monday night. “We will chase the terrorists. We will fight and win this war,” IGP Mushtaq Ahmed Sukhera vowed as he reached a hospital to inquire after his men a few hours after Monday's blast.
Cops mourn colleagues
Boffins from the University of Edinburgh's School of GeoSciences have found 91 previously unknown volcanoes beneath the West Antarctic Ice Shelf, a total that suggests it might be the most volcanic region on Earth.
In a paper [PDF] titled “A new volcanic province: an inventory of subglacial volcanoes in West Antarctica”, authors Maximillian Van Wyk De Vries, Robert G Bingham and Andrew Hein explain that with radar surveys and other techniques they were able to detect 91 cones that suggest the presence of volcanos. The cones are sometimes massive – they range in size from 100m in height to 3850m, with an average relief of 621m. 29 of the features are over 1km tall. All are beneath ice, in some cases kilometres of it.
We already knew about over 40 volcanos in the region. The discovery of 91 more therefore heats things up a little, although we don't know if any are active.
The discovery appears to be significant for three reasons.
Firstly, the density of volcanos in the region is matched only by the East African Rift System, which stretches from Tanzania to the Arabian Peninsula and is home to many active volcanos.
Second, whatever is causing climate change on Earth, news that there's a larger-than-previously-thought heat source under a major ice sheet is worth knowing. Or as the authors put it, “The presence of such a volcanic belt traversing the deepest marine basins beneath the centre of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could prove to be a major influence on the past behaviour and future stability of the ice sheet.”
Lastly, those who believe that the works of HP Lovecraft possess more than entertainment value have a new candidate front for the Elder Things vs. Cthulhu conflict. Which if revived would make any climate-induced chaos resemble little more than the flapping of a butterly's wings.
So delve not too deep, geo-boffins. For who can know knows what lies beneath these new Cones of Chaos, and what madness might be unleashed by disturbing them? ®

Dorothy Sewell, 80, was one of 10 people who were killed in the deadly van attack in Toronto on Monday.
Her grandson, Elwood Delaney, who lives in Kamloops, B.C., confirmed that she died in the attack.
Delaney said she was a massive sports fan, loving the Blue Jays and Leafs, nearly as much as her family.
He said she was “the best grandmother anyone could have asked for. Almost had as much love for the Blue Jays and Leafs as she did for her family.”
Sewell had lived in Toronto for more than 40 years.
Ten people were killed and 14 others were injured Monday when a man drove a ban down a busy Toronto sidewalk.
Alek Minassian, 25, was charged with 10 counts of first degree murder and 13 counts of attempted murder during a court appearance Tuesday.

I didn't really get Super Troopers the first time I saw it. Some friends had raved about it, but when I finally got around to seeing it, I didn't see the appeal beyond the “big” jokes like Geoffrey Arend tripping on mushrooms and the various Farva (Kevin Heffernan) antics. And yet a few months later I decided to give the film another chance, and oddly enough, it worked even better. Little jokes started to stick (“The lice hate the sugar.”) and the film's bizarre structure started to gel.
Looking back at the film today, it's a miracle the film ever got a wide release and eventually found an audience. It's a movie where the biggest star is Brian Cox, and it has a loose plot that will just pause for entire scenes so that the characters can engage in various shenanigans. Although Broken Lizard has gone on to make more movies, no one has ever tried to emulate their template, and even the group itself has struggled to recapture the magic of their 2001 feature.
Of course, Super Troopers has a formula that at first glance you wouldn't want to emulate. It has no stars. It's not high concept. It's not really in the mold of any other successful movie. And it's a film that requires repeat viewings to really make you fall in love with it. Compare that to something like Office Christmas Party, which is a painful experience but is filled with stars and has an easy concept, and it's easy to see why studios greenlight garbage like that but a film like Super Troopers slips through the cracks.
And yet I'm kind of in awe of Broken Lizard's movie. It's a film that's very much playing by its own rules, and it's unafraid to be weird and offbeat, albeit in a way that's incredibly liberating. Usually, when you have a comedy where it seems like everyone involved is just trying to make each other laugh it's a painfully indulgent experience. But with Super Troopers, it creates an odd kind of purity. Yes, there are jokes and they want you to laugh, but it always feels like Broken Lizard is on their own comedic wavelength and they're confident enough that you'll eventually catch on.
There are some jokes, especially the pot gags, that feel fairly traditional, and Fox certainly tried to market the movie along those lines. But where Super Troopers really lives are in scenes where characters will play the “Meow” game. It's a scene that doesn't advance the plot and isn't a traditional set-up/pay-off joke. If you take a step back, it's one of the weirdest scenes in the movie, and in a traditional comedy, it would likely be cut. Instead, it's one of the more memorable moments in the movie to the point where an NFL player did it on TV.
To include scenes like that, scenes that don't really work on a first viewing, is a huge gamble for any film. Traditionally, movies need to work the first time you see them, or at least be intriguing enough that you're willing to give it another go. While there are plenty of comedies that improve upon repeat viewings and become endlessly quotable, I can't think of one other than Super Troopers that struggles to click on a first viewing and then eventually falls into place. Super Troopers is a movie that shouldn't work, should be forgotten to history, and never heard from again, and yet it's one of the funniest comedies of the 21st century.
To be fair, Broken Lizard itself has had trouble recapturing the magic of their 2001 film. Club Dread is a run of the mill horror parody, and while it has some good moments (“I believe you mean ‘Piñacoladaberg.'”), it's never as memorable as Super Troopers. Beerfest is a fun film, but it feels fairly traditionally when compared to Super Troopers. It's a parody of a sports film, and while it has good jokes, it never feels like it's willing to get weird. And the less said about The Slammin' Salmon, the better.
While Super Troopers 2 is on the horizon, I'm trying not to get my hopes up. It's nothing against the Broken Lizard team as much as we've seen what happens when a comedy sequel comes out over a decade since the original (Zoolander 2 and Bad Santa 2 serving as painful reminders). But more than that, Super Troopers feels like lightning in a bottle. It came out of nowhere, did its own thing, demanded that viewers give it more than one chance, and became a cult classic in the process. It's hard to match that kind of success, meow.
Target has acquired San Francisco-based transportation technology company Grand Junction, in order to help it move more quickly into the business of same-day delivery. The company had already been working with Target on a same-day delivery pilot program in New York's Tribeca neighborhood, prior to this deal. That pilot will expand this fall to more New York area stores before a broader rollout to other large metros starting next year.
The retailer had already dipped its toe in the water of on-demand, local delivery. It has tested same-day delivery in 2014, and later in partnership with Instacart. And this May it announced its plans for Target Restock, a next-day delivery service focused on “everyday essentials,” like household items, personal care products and other dry goods – similar to those you can order through Amazon Prime Pantry.
The Restocking service had been in testing with staff at Target's headquarters before expanding to a consumer-facing pilot with customers in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, where Target is based.
Around the same time, Target also announced a small test of same-day delivery in New York. The pilot allowed guests shopping the Tribeca location to have their in-store purchases delivered anywhere in Manhattan, and to parts of Brooklyn or Queens. This eliminated the need for customers to haul their heavier purchases home themselves, or on public transit.
Grand Junction's technology was used in this NY area test, Target says.
The company offers a software platform that's used by retailers, distributors and third-party logistics providers to manage local deliveries through a network of more than 700 carriers. The software helps to determine the most efficient, the fastest route for a local delivery, while also tracking deliveries and giving the retailer an overview of carrier performance.
By bringing this technology in-house, Target says it will be able to offer same-day delivery in more areas, as well as assembly and installation services. Potentially, this could be used to speed up Target Restock from a next-day to a same-day delivery service, as well.
However, the deal is about more than just same-day, Target says. That includes all last-mile logistics needs, from regular online orders to same-day or next-day from stores.
With the acquisition, Target gains immediate access to Grand Junction's technology and carrier network, which will allow it to more quickly move into same-day delivery. Grand Junction's 13 employees will become a part of Target's technology team in San Francisco, where they'll best tasked with expanding the New York area pilot this year, ahead of a wider same-day delivery service rollout next year.
“Grand Junction's technology and algorithms will help Target deliver to guests faster and more efficiently,” said Arthur Valdez, executive vice president, chief supply chain and logistics officer, Target, in statement. “This acquisition is part of Target's ongoing efforts to strengthen Target's supply chain to provide greater speed, reliability and convenience for guests.”

Same-day delivery is an area where there's an increasing amount of competition. Amazon today offers Prime Now in over 30 U.S. markets, promising 2-hour delivery of thousands of items. A good handful of same-day grocery delivery services are also gaining steam, including Instacart, Shipt, Peapod and others. There's also Postmates for restaurant and general product delivery. And Uber is figuring out how to leverage its technology for than just moving more than people.
Meanwhile, Walmart has doubled down on a same-day pickup service for groceries, and even incentivized customers with discounts when online customers chose to ship items to the store for pickup instead of delivery. Walmart has also taken on Amazon with a free 2-day shipping service and has begun testing using store staff for last mile deliveries.
Lastly, startups like Curbside are working with major companies like CVS, Pizza Hut and Yelp, to expand access to same-day pickup services, too. (Target had also worked with Curbside before.)
“Target is seizing a tremendous opportunity to leverage local delivery as a retail differentiator,” said Rob Howard, Grand Junction's founder and CEO, who will become a vice president of technology at Target, as a result of this deal. “We're thrilled about helping to pursue this opportunity, and to join Target at this unprecedented time in retail.”
The move could help Target retain its footing as more brick-and-mortar stores face waning foot traffic and store closures. Target's online sales have been improving, having rose 22 percent in the last quarter, but it still faces huge threats from Amazon and Walmart in this area. That's especially true when it comes to groceries – something that's been made worse by Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods. However, Target recently boosted its Q2 earnings forecast due to an expected increase in comparable-store sales.
WASHINGTON - Embattled US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigned Monday evening, after reports that he misled senior Trump White House officials about his conversations with the Russian Ambassador in Washington, marking an embarrassing setback for an administration only three weeks old.
President Donald Trump has named retired Army Lt Gen Keith Kellogg as acting national security adviser. Kellogg previously served as Flynn's chief of staff on the National Security Council. Flynn blamed his resignation late Monday on the “fast pace of events” that led him to “inadvertently” give Vice President Mike Pence and others “incomplete information” about his phone conversations with Russia's ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak.
“I have sincerely apologised to the president and the vice president, and they have accepted my apology,” Flynn wrote in his resignation letter. Pence had defended Flynn's contacts with Russia, and when it became clear the national security adviser had not been forthcoming, serious questions were raised about his ability to keep his job.
A senior naval officer who served under Trump's Defense Secretary James Mattis is the leading candidate to replace Michael Flynn, two US officials revealed.
Vice Admiral Robert Harward, who was deputy commander of US Central Command under Mattis, will likely replace Flynn, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the White House scrambled to contain the fallout from the abrupt departure of one of the president's top advisers.
White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters on Tuesday that President Donald Trump asked for the resignation of his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, after his level of trust in Flynn eroded to the point that he felt he needed to make a change.
Spicer said Trump had been concerned that Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence over his contacts with Russian officials before Trump took office on Jan. 20. Trump had been reviewing Flynn's situation for a few weeks, he said.
Amid congressional calls for an investigation into the extent to which Flynn discussed the possibility of lifting US sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to Washington, Spicer said the White House legal counsel had reviewed the situation and believed Flynn's case was viewed "not as a legal issue but a trust issue."
Spicer said Trump was informed of Flynn's conversations with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak and asked counsel to review the case. "The erosion of that trust, frankly, was the issue," Spicer said.
Flynn's sudden exit comes just 24 days into Trump's presidency and represents a dramatic overhaul of his team of senior aides that has been consumed by controversy. Flynn, the former head of the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) was a trusted adviser to Trump throughout the 2016 campaign, but was seen as a controversial figure by many inside and outside the White House. He noted his friendship with the president in his resignation letter, thanking him for “his personal loyalty” and adding, “This team will go down in history as one of the greatest presidencies in US history.”
Flynn's future at the White House had been the topic of intense speculation since last Friday, after reports first emerged that he backtracked on his denial that he talked about sanctions against Russia for its election-related hacking with its top envoy in the US. Those reports, along with his longstanding ties to Russia, sparked concerns among US officials and members of Congress in both parties. The Justice Department reportedly warned Trump White House counsel Don McGahn shortly after Trump's inauguration that Flynn may have been vulnerable to blackmail by the Russians due to discrepancies between what he told Kislyak and Pence. Pence and others publicly said Flynn never discussed sanctions against Russia during his pre-inauguration conversations with Kislyak. Flynn later admitted the topic may have come up during his talks with the ambassador. Relying on Flynn's account, Pence told CBS News in mid-January that Flynn “did not discuss anything having to do with the United States' decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia.”
The vice president was reportedly angered after a Washington Post report was published last week claimed Flynn did discuss the sanctions, and he later apologised to Pence. But that apparently was not enough for Flynn to save his job. Trump stayed silent on Flynn's status; he was not asked about it during a news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, while his senior aides sent mixed signals to the press about Flynn's future.
Flynn joined other senior aides to Trump during the press conference, sitting in the front row of the East Room and prompting speculation he might be spared.
Senior counselor Kellyanne Conway said he enjoyed the “full confidence” of Trump on Monday afternoon. But soon after, White House Spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters the president was “evaluating” the Flynn situation with the vice president. Flynn's departure is sure to spark even more questions about how much Trump knew about Flynn's conversations with Russia.
Spicer was unequivocal, however, when asked whether Trump has been aware that Flynn was speaking about sanctions with the Russian ambassador. "No, absolutely not,” the spokesman said. Flynn reportedly spoke with Kislyak multiple times during the transition, including on Dec. 29, the day then-President Obama retaliated against Moscow for its hacking of Democratic political groups that intelligence agencies allege was done to aid Trump's campaign. Russia declined to respond with reciprocal sanctions, prompting questions about whether Flynn had provided assurances to the Russian diplomat the punishments would be rescinded once Trump took office. While there is no evidence an explicit assurance was given, US officials who saw a transcript of the call told the Post and other outlets it merited investigation. Flynn's talks also represented a break with longstanding protocol. Some legal experts believe they could have violated the Logan Act, which bars private citizens from interfering with official US diplomacy. No one has ever been prosecuted under the law.
US Secret Service director stepping down
US Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy plans to step down next month, the agency said on Tuesday, two years after he took charge of the agency following high-profile security lapses by the service responsible for protecting the president.
"Congratulations Dir Clancy on your retirement! The men & women of the @SecretService are grateful for your 29 years of service & leadership," the Secret Service said on Twitter.
Clancy will leave on March 4, an agency spokesman said.
Clancy's departure means that President Donald Trump will be able to select his own security chief. The Secret Service has almost 7,000 employees and is charged with protecting the president and his family as well as combating counterfeiting.
February 2, 2018 (KHARTOUM) - The British Ambassador to Khartoum Michael Aron has expressed his country's support for the peace talks between the Sudanese government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/North led by Abdel-Aziz al-Hilu.

The Sudanese army has been fighting the SPLM-N in the South Kordofan and Blue Nile states, also known as the Two Areas since 2011.
The two sides resumed talks on Thursday in Addis Ababa for a cessation of hostilities agreement for the first time since 16 months.
According to Ashorooq TV, Aron said 2018 would be a year for peace in Sudan, expecting the two sides to reach an agreement during the ongoing round of talks.
Speaking at a meeting with Sudan's National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) Thursday, Aron pointed to progress made in peace efforts in Sudan, saying the disarmament campaign was successful and contributed to achieving stability in the country.
He added the right to peace is placed first among all human rights.
The African Union (AU) is brokering peace talks between the Sudanese government and opposition including the armed groups in Darfur and the Two Areas.
Sudan Troika countries including the U.S., Norway and United Kingdom are facilitating the peace talks and seeking to bring all stakeholders to the negotiating table.

Uber won't be following through on a threat to leave the City of London, after council passed a by-law change Tuesday night exempting them from installing dashboard security cameras.
Council voted 7-6 in favour of Ward 4 Counc. Jesse Helmer's proposed amendment, requiring only “street-hailing” vehicles — traditional taxis — have the equipment.
Two weeks before Tuesday night's decision, council voted in favour of requiring the ride-sharing company to install cameras just as taxis had been required to do in 2009.
The move prompted Uber to issue an ultimatum: if council forced the camera issue, they'd leave the city.
London Taxi Association spokesperson Roger Caranci said the decision came as a bitter disappointment, specifically in regard to Counc. Michael Van Holst.
“I had a discussion with [Van Holst] last week in a Tim Hortons in London, and he was very, very scared of the pressure Uber was putting on him,” Caranci said.
“He bent to what Uber wanted. That's very troubling to me, that a member of council — a member who duly-elected by representatives of the ward he represents, bows down to a company and does exactly what they want him to do.”
During the Jan. 31 vote, Van Holst was in favour of cameras in Uber vehicles.
This week, Bill Armstrong, Mo Salih, Josh Morgan, Paul Hubert, Anna Hopkins and Harold Usher voted against Helmer's amendment, while all other councillors voted in favour save for Tanya Park and Jared Zaifman, who were absent.
During a debate about the amended by-law, Ward 10 Counc. Virginia Ridley told council cameras likely make for a safer world, but residents want to be able to chose whether they take a cab with a security camera, or an Uber without one.
“They recognize what the risks are, they recognize what the implications are,” she said. “We need to be removing barriers, allowing for innovation … that's what Londoners want from us.”
Ward 5 Counc. Maureen Cassidy questioned whether cameras really impact consumer safety, and suggested a by-law change that would remove the camera requirement for all vehicles, which she later withdrew.
“Cameras are — as we've stated in the past — a false sense of security,” Cassidy explained, citing London's Chief of Police John Pare comments that cameras do not deter crimes from happening in the first place.
Cassidy says she isn't interested in helping Uber make profit in #ldnont. Cab drivers laugh and say "yes you are!". Brown calls for order. — Liny Lamberink (@LinyLamberink) February 14, 2017
But London Taxi Association President Jason Kukurudziak pointed out they've been helpful in the past in the prosecution of crime.
“It's a great tool, many criminals have been caught with the cameras for bank robberies, home invasions,” he said. “I'm a little bit disappointed that [council] didn't protect the public, like they're supposed to do. Their job as a councillor is to pass by-laws that protect public safety, and Orest [Katolyk]– the manager of licensing — proved Uber isn't safe.
“They took bogus rides with made up information multiple times, so it just goes to show that political feelings override consumer safety.”
The election sign of BC Liberal candidate for North Vancouver-Lonsdale Naomi Yamamoto has been defaced this weekend.
On Sunday evening, Yamamoto, who is currently serving as Minister of State for Emergency Preparedness, posted the photo of the sign, which has been marked with a Swastika sign and red paint. She captioned the photo with, “this is not my B.C.”
The tweet prompted messages of support from other social media users and at least one running mate in Abbotsford South, MLA Darryl Plecas, who said “[the situation] is revolting and has absolutely no place in our province and communities.”
Some of Yamamoto's opponents also pitched in with their reactions.
BC Green Party candidate for North Vancouver-Seymour tweeted to say, “regardless of political views, this extremely offensive display is completely unacceptable. Greens stand against it too.”
Another Green Party candidate, Greg Powell — who is running in Richmond South Centre — also left a comment on Yamamoto's Twitter thread saying, “I'm so sorry that happened. Nobody should have to experience that.”
In an emailed statement, Yamamoto told Global News she deeply appreciates the outpouring of support from across party lines in response to what took place.
“My team and I are not going to allow this to distract us from communicating positively with people of North Vancouver,” she said.
Wesley Bryan has completed the leap from YouTube sensation to PGA Tour winner. That's quite a trick.
What's the best part of Bryan's journey? And what should we make of Padraig Harrington's unflattering comments about Masters champion Sergio Garcia?
Our panelists address these questions and more in this week's Monday Four-Ball.
1. After Wesley Bryan's first PGA Tour victory Sunday, what's your favorite part of his backstory?
ESPN SportsCenter anchor Jonathan Coachman: The most amazing thing is that he is best known for being a trick-shot artist, which is why I think no one ever gave him a chance to be a legitimate golfer as a professional. But he is showing the entire world that his trick-shot days are behind him and a career on the PGA Tour is ahead of him.
ESPN.com senior golf analyst Michael Collins: Before the trick-shot fame, I love that his dad had a "backyard" golf academy where both Wesley and brother George IV learned to play and love the game. I'm sure the George Bryan Golf Academy is going to be flush with students this summer!
ESPN.com senior golf writer Bob Harig: He gets a lot of attention for the trick-shot videos that have gotten tons of views, but I just like the fact that he won three times on the Web.com, graduated to the PGA Tour, got himself in contention a few times and then broke through in his home-state tournament in South Carolina. All of that is really neat, and a rookie winning on the PGA Tour is certainly no sure thing.

ESPN.com senior golf writer Jason Sobel: It's just the fact that he went from a trick-shot mini-tour player to the Web.com Tour Player of the Year to a PGA Tour champion in such a short time. That's a natural progression for young players, but not often one that takes just two years.
2. How do you feel about Padraig Harrington's "sore loser" comments about Masters winner Sergio Garcia?
Coachman: I thought they were in poor taste -- bad timing at best. I have always had an issue with someone who tries to bring down a person at his or her greatest heights. I am quite sure that Harrington has some moments in his life that he is not proud of. You have to know when to let it go. It wouldn't have changed anything if Harrington would have just kept his feelings about Garcia to himself.
Collins: I think they were honest. He said exactly how he felt about Garcia and how he remembered feeling after he beat him in majors. One of the reasons I love the European golfers so much is because so many will tell you exactly how they feel with no sugarcoating or regard for "protecting their brand." Be mad at a guy for doing what we always complain they don't do enough? Not me.
Harig: I found it to be remarkable in Garcia's time of glory, and it shows just how deep the rift is between them. Harrington is honest to a fault, but there is likely more to it than even he is acknowledging. He felt Garcia acted improperly in the aftermath of those major victories and hasn't forgotten.
Sobel: I love the fact that he was honest about it. And I hate the fact that those words are the only ones making the rounds. If you read the entirety of Harrington's comments, you'll also find that he acknowledged how Garcia has matured and insisted that he's happy for him.
3. How big a deal is it for Lydia Ko to fire her caddie after nine tournaments together?
Editor's Picks S.C. native Bryan rallies to win RBC Heritage Wesley Bryan, a South Carolina native who played college golf for the Gamecocks, closed with a 4-under 67 on Sunday to win his home-state RBC Heritage for his first PGA Tour title.
Report: No. 1 Ko fires caddie after 9 events Lydia Ko has made another change to her team, firing caddie Gary Matthews, according to a report. Matthews, a former caddie for Sergio Garcia, worked with Ko for just nine tournaments.
Harrington recalls Sergio being a 'sore loser' Padraig Harrington praised Sergio Garcia for his Masters victory, but recalled his rival being a "sore loser" after beating him at the 2007 Open and the 2008 PGA Championship. 2 Related
Coachman: It's a big deal. It shows me that despite a good finish in Hawaii, she is not comfortable with her game or her environment. Top players don't go through this many changes if they are remotely happy with the direction of their career. Some people might not understand because she is still No. 1 in the world, but her lead is shrinking and she hasn't been playing well. Hopefully this will be a step in the right direction.
Collins: On the LPGA Tour, it's not a big deal at all. I haven't covered a lot of LPGA Tour events, but I remember the Caddie Confidential I did in which the source said the turnover rate for caddies out there is huge. That did seem to be true.
Harig: It's not just the nine tournaments. It's all the different caddies in such a short career. There are few examples in the game of successful players who swap out their caddies so often. Continuity in that regard is so important. It takes time for the caddie to learn the player's game and the various quirks, to get a feel for what works and doesn't work. Maybe there was a rift, but has that been the case in each of these switches? Ko needs to find someone for the long haul.
Sobel: Zero. Nada. None. This isn't exactly Phil Mickelson sacking Bones here. Ko tried a new caddie; it didn't work out; they'll both move on.
Coachman: If I watch any more of it I am going to get mad that I did not have a bro trip of my own like this when I was in my 20s. I think every player on tour should take time to let out all of the stress of the year. I have a feeling we will be doing this question for several years to come.
Collins: Thumbs way up! Another complaint people make about golfers is that we don't really know who they are or what they do off the course. Four guys who regularly try to beat each other on the course but are good friends give us a glimpse into their dude vacation. Anyone complaining is wearing socks and sandals also yelling "Stay off my lawn!" at the neighborhood kids walking home from school.
Harig: It was fun and entertaining the first time, but sequels are almost never as good as the original.
Sobel: Like most sequels, this one didn't live up to the original. But still, it was more "Hangover 2" than "Anchorman 2" -- which is to say, it wasn't completely terrible.
Tue, Feb 14: Two people were sent to hospital after a stolen pickup truck slammed into a cab along Northmount Drive in northwest Calgary.
“America First Policies, a pro-Trump nonprofit outfit … is starting a $3 million advertising campaign to bolster a dozen House Republicans who publicly backed the health-care proposal that has stalled on Capitol Hill,” the Washington Post reports.
Two people are facing drug trafficking charges in Yorkton, Sask., after police seized what is believed to be meth and cocaine during a traffic stop.

In today's film news roundup, “Detective Pikachu” gets a release date, T.C. Boyle's “The Relive Box” is being turned into a movie, and Dimitri Thivaios is cast in “Rise of the Living Dead.”
RELEASE DATE
Legendary Entertainment's live-action “Detective Pikachu” has been set for a May 10, 2019, release.
The film, based on the Pokémon franchise, will star Ryan Reynolds, Justice Smith (“Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom”), and Kathryn Newton (“Big Little Lies”). Rob Letterman will direct.
Universal Pictures will handle distribution outside Japan. Toho will distribute in Japan, as it has done in its partnership with Legendary on the blockbuster monster reboot “Godzilla.”
PROJECT UNVEILED
Condé Nast Entertainment is developing the feature film “To Relive Box,” based on T.C. Boyle's short story in the New Yorker about a tech device that allows you to relive your past.
Daniel Arsham is making his feature directorial debut and Chai Hecht (“Unorthodox”) is writing the screenplay based on the short story written by Boyle. Dawn Ostroff and Jeremy Steckler of CNE will produce. Hunter Ryan and David Ryan will produce and finance the film through their company, Lost Lodge Productions.
Boyle's story explores modern-day society's reliance on technology in this story about a single father morally challenged by tech's endless possibilities and the opportunity to change his life. The premise is set in the not-too-distant future, where one of the founders of America's largest tech company becomes addicted to a prototype of the company's newest product — a device that lets you relive your past. His growing obsession threatens his relationship with his teenage daughter
Arsham said, “In my visual art practice, I have often explored ways to manipulate time. To compress it, to stretch it, and to dislocate audiences from this particular moment in time. I look forward to bringing these notions to life with ‘The Relive Box.'”
Boyle has published 26 novels and more than 100 short stories since the 1970s. “The Relive Box” is the title story of a new collection published in October 2017 by the Ecco imprint of HarperCollins.
Condé Nast Entertainment, Arsham, Hecht, and Boyle are all represented by CAA. Hecht is also repped by Madhouse Entertainment and attorney David Fox of Myman Greenspan. Boyle is also represented by Georges Borchardt.
CASTING
Dimitri Thivaios from the electronic duo Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike has become the first actor cast for George C. Romero's film “Rise of the Living Dead,” the prequel to his father's horror film, “Night of the Living Dead.”
Thivaios made the announcement on his Facebook page. He was cast alongside his brother Like Mike in the upcoming “Gangsta: The Movie” by Adil El Arbi & Bilall Fallah.
Thivaios took a voiceover role for the Belgian version of Disney's “Big Hero 6” and will reprise his role in the 2018 follow-up TV series.

Though Sylvester Stallone was previously reported as being onboard to direct MGM/Warner Bros.' Creed 2, we now have word that Steven Caple Jr. (The Land) will be handling those duties. Stallone, who won a Golden Globe and earned an Oscar nomination for his role as Rocky Balboa in Ryan Coogler‘s Creed, will return to star alongside fighter Adonis Johnson, played by Michael B. Jordan. Caple will direct from a script by Stallone and Cheo Hodari Coker (Luke Cage).
Caple Jr. was apparently hand-picked by both Stallone and Jordan following the original Rocky's discussions with studio execs and his ultimate decision not to return to the director's chair. Plot details are still vague, especially with production not expected to start in Philadelphia until March 2018, but the sequel is expected to follow Adonis' struggles with his new-found fame, family drama, and his journey to become a champion. Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) may factor into the story and may even return to the screen, if not the ring. Also returning for Creed 2, due out November 21, 2018 as of this writing, are Tessa Thompson as Bianca, and Coogler himself as an executive producer, though his deal has yet to close.
Here's what Caple had to say about getting this opportunity, which will be his first major feature:
“It's an honor to be a part of such an iconic franchise and to work with such great collaborators. Mike, Sly, and Tessa are extraordinarily talented and bring something special to today's culture. I look forward to joining the family and continuing the precedent set by this franchise's alumni of incredible filmmakers.”
Here's a bit more from Stallone via his Instagram:

The decision to approve the Site C dam isn't official yet, but opponents of the project are already slamming the BC NDP government.
Speaking with CKNW's The Jon McComb Show on Monday, Steve Gray with the Peace Valley Solidarity Initiative said the government appears to have bowed to pressure from BC Hydro, rather than listening to evidence from the BC Utilities Commission (BCUC).
“The NDP ran on a program that said they could generate more electricity without flooding our farms and sensitive ecosystems or encroaching on First Nations land title,” Gray said.
“What their platform was, they go to the utilities commission, and if the commission report proved unfavourable they would cancel Site C. We don't understand what's going on.”
LISTEN: Site C protesters upset ahead of dam announcement
During the campaign, the NDP refused to take a firm position on the future of the dam, pledging only to send it to the commission for review.
An update to the BCUC's final report on the project has acknowledged that if B.C. were to absorb the full $4-billion cost of scrapping the program in one decade, it could lead to an electricity rate hike of more than 10 per cent.
READ MORE: Site C dam unlikely to be on time or on budget: BCUC report
But Gray argued that bump would be worth it — and would be cheaper in the long run.
“If, in fact, we have to increase hydro rates to a moderate degree to take care of the problem, we think that's a preferable thing than to take on billions of dollars of costs and kick this down to our children to pay for much higher costs in future and much higher rates in future.”
WATCH: Site C cam unlikely to be on time or budget: Report
Gray dismissed arguments that the dam is needed to meet B.C.'s clean electricity goals, particularly amid the province's climate change commitments.
He argued that B.C.'s wind-power capacity is up to four times greater than that of the Site C project, and that the BCUC's figures showed it could be done more cost effectively than the dam.
READ MORE: Green Leader Andrew Weaver suggests recall campaign of NDP energy minister if Site C approved
“The Utilities Commission says at the same or lower cost than continuing with Site C. And that's what baffles us, why would we destroy valuable farmland at a time of climate change?”
BC Hydro has disputed BCUC figures regarding alternative power sources, arguing that the commission had overstated their benefit by $800 million compared to the dam.
Premier John Horgan is slated to make an official announcement on the $10-billion project at 11:30 a.m., however senior government officials have confirmed to Global News that the project will proceed.

ISLAMABAD - Pakistan on Tuesday has signed two financing agreements worth $400 million with the World Bank including Punjab Cities Programme ($200 million) and Punjab Green Development Programme ($200 million).
Economic Affairs Division Secretary Syed Ghazanfar Abbas Jilani signed the financing agreements on behalf of the Government of Pakistan while representatives of Government of Punjab signed their respective Programme/Operation Agreements. Patchamuthu Illangovan, Country Director signed the Financing and Programme/Operation Agreements on behalf of the World Bank.
The World Bank last week has committed $728 million through four projects to put Pakistan on the path of climate resilient development which would benefit millions of its citizens. The projects included Punjab Cities Programme and Punjab Green Development Programme, which were signed Tuesday.
These projects will protect the environment and improve the quality of life in cities while being engines of growth and promoting sustainable water management through efficient irrigation, robust weather forecasting and improved disaster preparedness. The $200 million Punjab Cities Programme will benefit 4.1 million people in 16 urban areas by strengthening local govts' ability to deliver basic and green infrastructure.
The programme will also build systems to improve transparency, accountability, and responsiveness of municipal committees and other structures. Punjab Cities Programme aims to strengthen the performance of participating urban local governments in urban management and service delivery.
The programme will Support the Operation Implementing Entity's implementation of its Performance Based Grants (PBG) programme to selected 16 MCs for strengthening their institutional performance and the carrying out eligible infrastructure investments.
The $200 million Punjab Green Development Programme will strengthen the province's environmental management through empowering its departments to provide better environmental services to citizens and the private sector, with a focus on strengthening the capacity of the Environment Protection Department. It will help modernize laws and regulations and promote investments in cleaner technologies to reduce air and water pollution.
The objectives of the Punjab Green Development Programme are to strengthen environmental governance and promote green investments in Punjab Province.
Activities under the first results area will aim to restructure the Environment Protection Department (EPD), reform the environmental regulatory regime, and build the EPD's capacity to deliver transparent and efficient environmental management services to the private sector and to the public.
Activities under the second results area aim to promote selected green investments in both the public and private sectors and develop green financing schemes to finance such investments beyond the implementation period of this programme. The Economic Affairs Division secretary thanked the World Bank for extending its continuous support to the Government of Pakistan in its efforts to achieve sustainable development in the country.
German startup N26 is now live in 17 European countries, but many features first launched in Germany and never made their way to other markets. The startup is slowly expanding core features to other key markets. That's why the company is partnering with Younited Credit to launch consumer credit in France.
It works pretty much like the existing credit feature in Germany. In the app, you swipe to the credit tab and answer a few questions about yourself. You'll tell how much money you need, if you're single or married, if you're a homeowner, etc.
A bit later, the app will give you a clear quote telling you how much money you're borrowing, how much you'll end up paying in total, the effective or nominal interest rate and your monthly payments.
You can also adjust your credit line by adjusting the length of the repayment process or the amount you're willing to pay back every month. N26 doesn't try to hide anything from you.
If you're not familiar with Younited Credit, the company is a leading crowdlending platform in Europe. The startup has recently raised nearly $50 million in its latest founding round.
On Younited Credit's website, consumers can borrow anything between €1,000 and €40,000 for 24 to 72 months without talking to an actual bank. N26 users access the same product without any restriction.
The platform matches those credit lines with other users willing to lend money, as well as companies, pension funds, insurance companies, etc. And Younited Credit thinks it can build an efficient credit rating system from scratch.
N26 users won't have to sign up to Younited Credit to borrow some money. Everything happens in the N26 app using Younited Credit's API. And I'm sure N26 also takes a small cut on each transaction.
N26 recently partnered with Auxmoney in Germany to offer credit to more customers. It's another credit marketplace, and it shows that N26 is willing to partner with multiple companies in the same space if it makes sense. N26 wants to build a thorough financial hub so that you'll end up buying new all sorts of financial products through the N26 app.
PHILADELPHIA (AP)  A Philadelphia sports radio personality says he lost a weekly television gig after saying a female announcer calling an NFL game "sounds unnatural."
Mike Missanelli said on his radio show that he was fired from "Sports Sunday" on WPVI, Philadelphia's ABC station.
He says it's because on Tuesday he questioned why ESPN was using Beth Mowins to do play-by-play on ESPN's Monday Night Football double-header.
He says he has no one to blame but himself and calls it a "harsh result."

The firing comes the same week Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton made sexist comments to a female reporter. When a Charlotte newspaper reporter asked Newton about a wide receiver's route running, Newton laughed and said, "it's funny to hear a female talk about routes." He has apologized.
When fire broke out in a south Calgary strip mall on Macleod Trail March 25, Kaden Clouston and Mackie Martineau sprung into action – banging on doors and helping tenants escape.
It was an act of valour the Calgary Fire Department feels is worthy of formal recognition.
READ MORE: Fire at Calgary strip mall shuts down Macleod Trail
“They have been nominated for the ‘Beyond the Call' recognition program, where firefighters nominate citizens who respond above and beyond in emergencies and help out and make a real difference at the scene,” said Carol Henke, public information officer for the fire department.
The men are recovering addicts residing at the Calgary Dream Centre, which is located across from the strip mall. The centre provides support to people trying to escape homelessness and addiction.
Others, including a business owner in the strip mall, also want to reward the men.
“We have collected roughly 20 donations so far,” said Blair Fason of Juniper & Teal Wellness Studio.
And so far they've collected enough gifts to fill two large baskets for the men.
“More are expected and the collections are going to the two men that put their lives at risk to come into our burning building to make sure that everyone was out safely,” Fason said.
The Calgary Fire Department said the blaze has been deemed accidental based on a preliminary investigation by the arson unit.
Some of the tenants said repairing and rebuilding the strip mall could take six to eight months.
A Sherwood Park man is expected to be sentenced Wednesday for the death of his wife.
Brian Beglau, 60, pleaded guilty last week to the second-degree murder of his estranged wife, Melanie Hunter.

Police found Hunter's body inside a home in northeast Sherwood Park on the evening of Sept. 22, 2015, after responding to an alarm at the home. A man was arrested at the scene and taken into custody.
Two days later Beglau was charged in connection with her death.
Officers had been called on two previous occasions to the home where Hunter's body was found, but those calls didn't result in charges.
READ MORE: UPDATE: Husband of Sherwood Park woman charged in her murder
Beglau was charged with first-degree murder, but entered a guilty plea to the lesser charge of second-degree murder last Thursday, which carries an automatic life sentence. The judge in the case will decide when Beglau can apply for parole, which can range from a minimum of 10 years to a maximum of 25 years.
RCMP said Beglau and Hunter were married but had been living separately for three years before Hunter's death.
Hunter had a son and daughter.

A 106-year-old Edwardian-style building in Edmonton's Oliver neighbourhood now has assurances its character will be preserved and protected after receiving a heritage designation.
On Tuesday, Edmonton city councillors designated the West End Telephone Exchange building as a Municipal Heritage Resource.
The building, located at 12019A 102 Avenue, was designed by Alberta architect Allan Merrick Jeffers, whose career included early 20th-century stints as Alberta's provincial architect and Edmonton's city architect.
Jeffers also designed the Alberta legislature, Athabasca Hall at the University of Alberta and Government House in Edmonton.
“Typical of Edwardian-style architecture, the building has modest ornamentation and strong symmetry,” the city said in a news release. “Other distinctive features include the raised parapet at the north gable, the multi-paned semicircular attic window.”
The West End Telephone Exchange building was one of two Edmonton-area buildings constructed in 1912 to help meet the needs of Edmonton's growing population.
“These exchanges housed some of the first automatic switching stations in Canada, a major technological advancement over the standard manual switching systems,” the city said.
Beljan Development is turning the building into what it calls “a collaborative mixed-use office, retail and workshop hub for inter-business activity and commerce in the heart of Oliver,” called Oliver Exchange.
Edmonton's Historic Resource Management Plan is aimed at identifying, protecting and promoting the preservation of historic resources.

Houston was under siege and underwater Wednesday as storms drenched the region with up to eight inches of rain.
More storms were forecast Wednesday night, and authorities canceled the Freedom Over Texas concerts because of the weather. Mayor Sylvester Turner warned residents that flooding was rampant throughout the city.
"Do not put yourself in a position that will put yourself and others in danger," he said on Twitter.
Authorities are wary about storms after the damage wrought by Hurricane Harvey, which blasted Texas, Louisiana, Florida and other states in the region in August. That storm, one of the worst on record, caused more than $100 billion in damages.
"Today's event gave us a trial run to be prepared," Turner said. "Our operations have been a lot smoother, and we still have some fine tuning to do."
Dave Samuhel, senior meteorologistat AccuWeather, said some areas near downtown Houston were hit with 4-6 inches of rain, with one or two spots registering 8 inches.
"It was very intense earlier, with some areas seeing three or four inches of rain in an hour," he said.
The city's main fireworks show will go on as planned. But no one is allowed on site, meaning fans must watch the fireworks from home or nearby neighborhoods.
Turner said he was a "kid at heart" and rarely will sign off on canceling fireworks.
"The show allows us to pay homage to those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice so we can enjoy the freedoms we cherish everyday," he said.
Harvey also brought infamy to little Nederland, Texas, near the Louisiana border when one location near the town of about 20,000 was walloped with 60.58 inches of rain. That broke the record for the greatest rainfall amount ever recorded in the Lower 48 from a single storm, WeatherBug reported.

ADEN - A roadside explosion killed 12 civilians and wounded four in southern Yemen on Monday when a bomb targeting a military car hit their vehicle instead, a security source said.
"The bomb was planted on a road in the Qaataba district of Daleh province and hit a civilian vehicle instead," said the source, who requested anonymity as he was not authorised to brief the press.
Along with most of southern Yemen, Daleh is controlled by government forces loyal to President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi, who is backed by an Arab military alliance led by Saudi Arabia in a war against Iran-backed Huthi rebels. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has exploited years of conflict between the government and the rebels to expand its presence in Yemen, particularly in southern provinces. The militant group regularly targets military outposts in the south. Yemeni special forces trained by the United Arab Emirates and backed by the United States this month launched a major operation against Al-Qaeda in the southern Shabwa province.
The UAE is a key component of the coalition which intervened in Yemen in 2015, when Hadi fled into exile as the rebels threatened to overrun his last stronghold. The militants are thought to have moved farther south into neighbouring Abyan province, which almost borders Daleh.
PAGE, Ariz. – The Coconino County Public Health Services District (CCPHSD) is offering free flu shots from 9 – 11:30 a.m., Feb. 7, at the CCPHSD Northern Region office, 467 Vista Ave. Page, Ariz. No appointment is needed.
Influenza (flu) is still at elevated levels in Coconino County. Health Officials recommend that individuals who have not received a flu vaccination get one now. Getting a flu shot can reduce the risk of getting the illness and lessen the severity of the symptoms and complications associated with the flu.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a yearly flu vaccination as the first and most important step in protecting against flu viruses. It is strongly recommended that everyone 6-months old and over get a flu shot each year.
It's especially important that the following groups get a flu vaccination either because they are at high risk of having serious flu-related complications or because they live with or care for people at high risk for developing flu-related complications, including:
Pregnant women
Children younger than five, but especially children younger than 2-years old
Children with special healthcare needs
People 50 years of age and older
People of any age with certain chronic medical conditions
People who live in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities
People who live with or care for those at high risk for complications from flu, including:
Health care workers
Household contacts of persons at high risk for complications from the flu
Household contacts and out of home caregivers of children less than 6 months of age (these children are too young to be vaccinated)
Flu symptoms include fever, chills, muscle aches, cough, congestion, runny nose, headaches and fatigue. Complications of flu can include bacterial pneumonia, ear infections, sinus infections, dehydration and worsening of chronic medical conditions, such as congestive heart failure, asthma, or diabetes and can cause death.
-MORE-
In addition to getting a seasonal flu shot, good health habits will help you stay well. These simple actions can stop the spread of germs and help protect you and others from getting sick:
Wash your hands frequently during the flu season.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.
Avoid contact with people who are sick.
Cover your mouth with your upper sleeve or with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.
Don't share eating utensils, cups and straws.
Stay home when you are sick.

I once had to take a personality test as part of a job interview, and I thought it was weird at the time. Now, as a personality test junkie, I totally get it, and the MBTI and enneagram tests are two of my go-to faves. What's the difference between the enneagram test and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator? While there are a lot of personality typing tests out there, these two are pretty popular. It's true that they have some things in common, but there are a lot of important differences too. The biggest difference between the Myers Briggs Type Indicator and the enneagram is that the Myers-Briggs test focuses on nature, while the enneagram is more about nurture, according to Dr. A.J. Drenth on the website Personality Junkie.
Additionally, Pat Wyman, INFJ, M.Ed., L.P.C., who uses both the MBTI and the enneagram tests in her counseling practice, noted that every person can be viewed through the lens of both tests. "It soon became evident to me that the enneagram portion of personality acts as the defense system providing a set of coping skills to protect the true self. It did not take long to realize that the MBTI type was a profile of the 'true self,'" she wrote on the website Personality Pathways. "Through my work with clients and in workshops, I have discovered that the enneagram portion of personality dominates during periods of stress and relaxes during periods of well-being."
If you're not familiar with the enneagram, here's the quick and dirty. "The enneagram is a [nine]-pointed system. Each of the nine types is a different strategy for dealing with trauma. Some argue that you discovered your enneagram type at your first childhood trauma, and it's been with you ever since," Antonia Dodge wrote for Personality Hacker. "Considering side-stepping, mitigating, handling, and dealing with trauma is a big deal for the psyche, your mind created a ‘go-to strategy' for navigating it, and so your enneagram type — your 'trauma navigation tool' — is born and subsequently becomes an influential part of you."
The enneagram tends to be a lot more complicated than the MBTI, and you could easily fall into a multi-day rabbit hole exploring your basic type, subtypes, and centers. If you haven't taken the enneagram test, you can take a free one online. The enneagram is based on how you deal with trauma whereas the MBTI assesses how you judge and perceive the world. According to the Myers & Briggs Foundation, the MBTI is based on the theories of psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Carl Jung, and centers around these two key components.
"Perception involves all the ways of becoming aware of things, people, happenings, or ideas. Judgment involves all the ways of coming to conclusions about what has been perceived. If people differ systematically in what they perceive and in how they reach conclusions, then it is only reasonable for them to differ correspondingly in their interests, reactions, values, motivations, and skills." As you develop as a person your MBTI can change over time, while the website The Enneagram explained that your enneagram is fixed and will never change. Basically, you were born this way.
I am an enneagram type five, also known as the investigator, which is described as intense, cerebral, perceptive, innovative, secretive, and isolated. So, my key motivations according to The Enneagram Institute include a need to posses knowledge, "to understand the environment, [and] to have everything figured out as a way of defending the self from threats from the environment." The enneagram triad is also divided into three centers; thinking, instinct, and feeling, also described as fear, anger, and shame.
"Depending upon your enneagram type, it means you run toward one of these three emotions as your ‘go-to' emotion," Dodge explained on Personality Hacker. "The types that ‘internalize' tend to turn the emotion in on themselves or experience the emotion inwardly, those that ‘externalize' experience the emotion outside of themselves or project it outwardly, and those that repress the emotion do what they can to pretend the emotion doesn't exist for them at all."
While the MBTI and the enneagram do seem to overlap in some instances, The website The Enneagram noted that there is no conclusive evidence that these two tests will deliver similar results. "Some comparisons show that certain enneagram types seem to match certain MBTI types with a higher degree of frequency than other MBTI types. But there is no reliable data to show that such matches are consistent on a large segment of the population. The enneagram and the MBTI measure or evaluate different aspects of a person's personality. The enneagram focuses on an individual's habits of attention and other patterns of thoughts, feelings, and emotions."
That being said, I did find an overlap between my enneagram, the investigator, and my INFP Myers-Briggs identity. The bottom line is that both tests are useful to help you understand different parts of yourself, and it's likely that some of your MBTI traits will overlap with your enneagram type. However, each test will reveal different insights into how you interact with both yourself and the outside world. So, if you seek to understand yourself and others, the enneagram test is a must to learn whether you're a reformer, helper, achiever, individualist, investigator, loyalist, enthusiast, challenger, or peacemaker.
After news of Judas Priest's first-ever Rock Hall nomination was announced on Oct. 5, frontman Rob Halford hopes Priest's nomination will open the door wider for metal bands.
Halford told Billboard, “When the nominations come up and the inductions come up, you often wonder that it would feel like if you were able to be on stage at that moment making an acceptance speech and particularly having the pleasure to be in the company of all the other musicians and industry people. So, yeah, if we do get in it will be an absolute dream-come-true moment. Fingers crossed, as they say.”
Priest has been eligible for consideration since 1999, but heavy metal inductions and nominations have been limited. Acts such as Black Sabbath, Metallica and Deep Purple have been inducted so far.
“I've often talked about metal being the underdog in rock ‘n' roll music,” Halford said. “We remember the times through the punk and New Wave moments when it was proclaimed that heavy metal music was dead, it didn't stand a chance of surviving, that it was Neanderthal music that had limited scope and wasn't very intelligent and all those bad things. I still don't understand the kind of pushback that we still kind of have to bump up against now and again, but this recognition by the Hall of Fame helps to slowly chip away at that kind of stereotype. The metal dog is wagging it's metal tail, which is a great feeling. We do deserve this.”

Ambien, the popular sleep aid drug, has a ton of side effects, with many of them being very scary. However, contrary to the claim by Roseanne Barr, the now-former TV star whose eponymous show was canceled Tuesday because of a hateful Twitter rant, racism isn't spurred on by popping an Ambien or two.
no, i didnt i blamed myself. stop lying. Yes, I have had odd ambien experiences on tweeting late at night-like many other ppl do. I BLAME MYSELF OK? it's just an explanation not an excuse, Ok, bully? — Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) May 30, 2018
Barr, whose entire existence seemingly got canceled within hours after she compared a Black woman to an ape on Twitter on Tuesday, tweeted early Wednesday morning that she was “Ambien tweeting” when she posted the hateful message about 24 hours earlier.

Even if that was true, Ambien (generic name, Zolpidem Tartrate) is a sleep aid – so why wasn't she sleeping?
Technicalities aside, Barr's tweet Wednesday morning implied that it was the Ambien to blame for inspiring the racist tweet.
Vomiting; shaking; nervousness; hell, even bad driving – those things can all happen from taking an Ambien. But not racism.
Even the pharmaceutical company that manufactures Ambien, said as much.
People of all races, religions and nationalities work at Sanofi every day to improve the lives of people around the world. While all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication. — Sanofi US (@SanofiUS) May 30, 2018
Sanofi listed on its website some of the “adverse” effects Ambien could cause, including but not limited to: body pain, amnesia, depression and even a skin rash.
According to WebMD, dizziness, “ memory loss, mental/mood/behavior changes (such as new/worsening depression, abnormal thoughts, thoughts of suicide, hallucinations, confusion, agitation, aggressive behavior, anxiety)” could happen as a result of taking Ambien.
Ambien can also increase the chances of “sleep-driving” (see Tiger Woods for more on this), sleep walking, having sex, drug abuse and experiencing withdrawal symptoms, according to DrugAbuse.com.
There is also the chance of getting a stuffy nose, dry mouth, sore throat, constipation, headache, muscle pain and, ironically, insomnia, according to rxList.com.
Conspicuously missing from all of the above lists: Racism.
Sorry, Roseanne, please try to justify your ignorant hate another way.

The granddaughter of a man who was instrumental in promoting the use of hybrid corn is urging GOP lawmakers not to close an ag-related research center at Iowa State University.
Liz Garst, who manages her family's 3500 acre farm in the Coon Rapids area. said the work of the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture is not done.
“Thanks to the help of the Leopold Center, we have started doing more and more with cover crops,” Garst said. “…There is a huge amount of research that still needs to be done to make this technology viable, which will help protect our soil, which is Iowa's most important asset.”
Garst was among more than three dozen people who testified today at a hearing in the state capitol that gave Iowans a chance to weigh in on GOP budget proposals. Several spoke against Republican legislators' plans to cut state support of the ISU research center. Mills County Supervisor Mark Peterson farms about 500 near Stanton and he's board president of Practical Farmers of Iowa.
“As a conservative Republican, I am disappointed with what I hear happening,” Peterson said. “…The Leopold Center was founded in tough ag economic times. Through their research and funding of everything from waterways to wineries, rural Iowa has improved both economically and environmentally. We are in tough times again. The work of the Leopold Center is nowhere near done.”
Another ISU graduate told legislators it makes Iowa “look bad” to shut down crucial efforts to improve water quality and stop soil loss.
Other speakers at the hearing urged Republicans to abandon their goal of “defunding” Planned Parenthood. Erin Davison-Rippey of Planned Parenthood of the Heartland targeted her remarks to Republican moderates.
“Don't let those extreme individuals lead you around by the nose,” Davison-Rippey said. “You may think that passing this language may quiet them, but make no mistake. They are not done. You pass this language and they will be right back with more demands.”
The other major topic raised during today's hearing was the legislature's proposed cut to victim services. Mary Ingham, executive director of Crisis Intervention Service in Mason City which serves 14 counties in north central and north east Iowa, drove to Des Moines to testify.
“We acknowledge this is a tough budget year for our state, but singling out programs supporting victims of violence for a disproportionate cut is frightening,” Ingham said. “A 25 percent reduction in state funds will have immediate, harmful consequences.”
Each speaker was limited to three minutes. A large crowd gathered around a big-screen TV in the statehouse rotunda and cheered as speakers made their points. People seated inside the hearing room waved pieces of green construction paper to signal their support for what was being said.
ISLAMABAD - The verdict that a judge of the apex court will supervise accountability court proceedings against the Sharif family in the Panama Papers case has raised eyebrows and the legal fraternity is insisting on fair application of the law.
The legal experts are of the view if the apex court's priority is to eradicate corruption from the society, a judge should have been appointed to supervise the Ogra and Eobi scams in which the SC had itself observed that billions of rupees had been misappropriated.
Senior advocate Tariq Asad commented: “If we really want the rule of law and supremacy of the Constitution, it should be applied equally to every citizen of Pakistan whether he is a civilian, a military or a judiciary official. If we want a different treatment on the basis of the position or the job, it is better to amend or withdraw Article 25 from the Constitution,” he added.
The Panama Papers contain names of around 400 Pakistanis, including a high court judge. The apex court proceeded against the Sharif family only and disqualified former prime minister Nawaz Sharif while the case against the high court judge for allegedly having an offshore company has not been decided despite a lapse of 15 months.
Former chief justice Anwar Zaheer Jamali, while addressing the New Judicial Year gathering and the Islamabad High Court Bar Association in 2015, had said the fate of pending cases against judges in the Supreme Judicial Council would be decided on priority basis.
Senior lawyers say that in the case of former chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry's son Arsalan Iftikhar, the JIT was changed when it was pointed out by Arsalan that its members were not impartial. The lawyers question why the apex court in the Sharifs' case outright rejected the allegations of Hussain Nawaz against the JIT members' bias without giving reasons.
Supreme Court Bar Association former president Kamran Murtaza said the money-laundering and corruption issues were not bigger than the subversion and abrogation of the Constitution. He asked why the Special Court comprising three judges of different high courts could not decide the case against former dictator Pervez Musharraf in four years. “Why could they not even secure the presence of Musharraf?” he further asked.
Lahore High Court Bar Association former president Sheikh Ahsan-ud-Din said when Musharraf was summoned by the court, the whole military establishment stood behind him, he was kept in AFIC and a medical certificate was issued to him declaring him a heart patient.
Sheikh Ahsan, who is also a focal person for Pakistan Justice and Democratic Party, said after the Panama Papers case, the people of Pakistan were now looking towards the judiciary for equal application of law and Constitution. He said it was responsibility of the courts to provide justice to every litigant. He said the case against Musharraf was of very serious nature and the superior judiciary should take notice of it and intervene. He said like trial of politicians the court should not hesitate to take trial against a military dictator to its logical conclusion.
Justice Asif Saeed Khan Khosa's judgment on former chief justice Hameed Dogar's appeal against the special court's order to include others in the Musharraf high treason case was not complied with. His judgment says: “The Special Court is expected to proceed with the trial of respondent No 2 (Musharraf) without any unnecessary delay.” The apex court has not taken any notice of its compliance despite a lapse of one year.
Similarly, the apex court on October 19, 2012, announced a judgment in the Asghar Khan case in which it had clearly stated that former president Ghulam Ishaq Khan, ex-army chief Aslam Beg and ex-DG ISI Gen (r) Asad Durrani acted in violation of the Constitution by facilitating a group of politicians and political parties. “The acts of Mirza Aslam Beg and Asad Durrani have brought a bad name to Pakistan and its armed forces as well as its secret agencies in the eyes of the nation,” the SC said, directing the federal government to take necessary steps against them under the Constitution and law, although they had retired from service.
The legal experts are of opinion that the Supreme Court should have proceeded in the same manner against the army men as it did in cases against politicians and civilians.
The apex court supervised compliance of its judgments directly or indirectly in the National Reconciliation Ordinance, the rental power projects, National Insurance Company Limited (NICL), the appointment of Tauqir Sadiq as Ogra chairman, Bank of Punjab, Hajj scam, missing of ISAF containers cases and sought reports from the FIA or the NAB. Former Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani was sent home for not writing a letter to Swiss courts. Former chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry had issued a contempt of court notice to former interior minister Rehman Malik for transferring Tariq Khosa as he was heading an FIA team which investigated corruption in Pakistan Steel Mills.
However, in the appeals against the death sentences awarded by the military court, the lawyers who represented the convicted persons' families had complained to the apex court bench that despite its orders the record of military courts trial was not shown to them, but the bench which heard the cases neither took contempt notice nor did it pass any judgment against the military officials.
A petition challenging the removal of Musharraf's name from the ECL is pending even after lapse of two years.
Abida Malik, wife of Tasif Malik, had filed an application before the court to arrange a meeting with her husband detained in an internment centre in Kohat. The then chief justice Nasir-ul-Mulk had passed an order to arrange the meeting, but despite the clear order, Abida Malik has not been able to meet her husband. Although she had filed a contempt of court petition, no action was taken against the internment centre authorities. Similarly, the Lal Masjid case also is still pending.
Tariq Asad said that ex-premier Sharif and Punjab Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif had made history by following the Supreme Court order and appeared before the joint investigation team. Former PMs – Sharif and Gilani – not only appeared before the court but also stepped down following the apex court judgments, he said.
On the other hand, when the military personnel were summoned by the courts, they, instead of complying with the orders, took refuge in the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology, Rawalpindi.
Musharraf was summoned by the special court on three occasions in the high treason case, but he defied the orders. When non-bailable warrants were served on him and the Islamabad police were directed to produce him before the court, he was admitted to the AFIC.
Former Defence Secretary Lt-Gen Asif Yasin Malik was issued a contempt of court notice in December 2013 in a case of local government polls in cantonments. The next day he also got himself admitted to the AFIC and remained there till the retirement of ex-CJP Iftikhar who had summoned him.
Similarly, when Balochistan Frontier Corps Inspector General Maj-Gen Ijaz Shah was issued a contempt of court notice by the Supreme Court in a law and order case, he was also admitted to the AFIC in connection with a heart ailment.
TERENCE J SIGAMONY
A man is dead and a woman is in custody after a shooting in northwest Iowa. Plymouth County Sheriff Mike Van Otterloo says it happened shortly after midnight, Friday morning, at a home in rural Akron.
Thirty-three-year-old Becky Hebert is facing charges that include second-degree murder. “The investigation allowed officers to learn that Hebert and the deceased had been arguing and they were having a disagreement prior to the shooting,” Van Otterloo said at a news conference Friday afternoon.
The identity of the victim, a man in his 40s, is expected to be released sometime Saturday. There were others in the home at the time of the shooting — believed to be Becky Hebert's children. “There was a witness to the shooting…neither the witness nor any others in the residence at the time were injured in any way,” Van Otterloo said.
Hebert was arrested over the noon hour on Friday in LeMars. Van Otterloo said police have been sent to rural Akron home in the past on domestic abuse calls. He also confirmed there was a no contact order in place for the individuals at that residence.

Saskatchewan's wildfire crews are preparing for an average season of forest fires, according to a spokesperson for the ministry of environment.
Across Saskatchewan, government figures show moisture levels have ranged from average to above average.
READ MORE: New Alberta wildfire prevention regulations take effect March 31
“Significant snowfall over the weekend in many areas has provided additional moisture,” the spokesperson said in an email.
Along with runoff, wildfire factors include timing and speed of the snow melt, precipitation, water table levels, forest fuel conditions and temperature.
A warmer than normal summer is forecast in Canada, which raises the probability of more fires countrywide, according to University of Alberta meteorologist and professor Mike Flannigan.
“If it rains every three to five days like it did last summer, starting in June, we don't have a fire problem,” Flannigan said.
“If you get a week or more warm, dry and windy weather then it's ripe for fire.”

SALT LAKE CITY (AP)  Anti-police brutality groups in Utah are livid after a prosecutor this week determined police were legally justified in a fatal shooting of a black man in August that was captured on body camera video released this week.
While one video appears to show the victim, Patrick Harmon, 50, shot from behind as he ran from police, a slowed-down version shows he pivoted toward officers with a knife, Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said Friday.
Officer Clinton Fox told investigators Harmon threatened to stab him before he fired the fatal shots. Body camera video shows Fox shot Harmon at close range after Fox yells, "I'll f....ing shoot you."
Lex Scott, an organizer with Black Lives Matter in Utah, said the community is livid over the footage and wants the district attorney to resign. The Harmon family, which lives in Colorado and St. Louis, is "shell shocked," Scott said.

"You can't watch that video and not realize it is a clear case of murder," Scott said. "It is one of the clearest cases of murder we've ever seen."
African Americans make up about 2 percent of the population in Utah yet are over-represented in the criminal justice system, Scott said.
About 50 protesters rallied in front of Salt Lake City police building last weekend, including members of Harmon's family, demanding police release the footage. They did that this week after Gill's ruling.
The shooting comes amid an intense debate throughout the United States about race and policing following the fatal shooting of many black victims.
In 2014, police in Saratoga Springs, Utah, shot and killed Darrien Hunt, 22, after receiving reports of a man with a samurai sword. The Utah County attorney's office ruled the two officers involved were justified in shooting Hunt because they feared for their lives and the lives of others.
Hunt's family said the shooting was racially motivated. Hunt was black; the officers who shot him were white. He was wielding the sword as part of a Japanese anime costume.
Harmon was shot and killed on Aug. 13, after an officer saw him ride his bicycle across all six lanes of traffic and a median on a downtown Salt Lake City street.
He was stopped because he didn't have a required red rear tail light on his bicycle, according to the district attorney's report. Police say that Harmon gave "a couple" of different names and eventually they found warrants for felonies including aggravated assault.
As they put him in handcuffs, Harmon pleaded with them not to take him to jail.
The video shows a distraught-looking Harmon peacefully putting his hands behind his back, then suddenly breaking into a run. The video from Fox's body camera is difficult to decipher as the officer ran.
Fox said that as he chased him, Harmon suddenly turned and pulled out a knife and threatened to stab him. Neither that statement nor an obviously visible knife are captured on the video. But two other officers at the scene reported hearing Harmon say he would cut or stab the officers and a knife was found near Harmon's body.
"Officer Fox said he was terrified by how close Mr. Harmon was to the officers when Mr. Harmon stopped and turned toward them," the district attorney report on the shooting states. "Officer Fox said that in 10 years of law enforcement and two military deployments, it was the scariest situation he had ever been in."
The report also includes stills from the video and an image of a knife found at the scene.
Gill said that when his investigators slowed down the video, it showed that Harmon was pivoting toward the officer.
Harmon was shot on his side, and a knife was found at the scene, he said.
His office has to decide whether to file criminal charges by weighing whether the officer could reasonably fear being seriously injured or killed, Gill said.
Given the slowed-down version of video from the body camera worn by Fox and a second officer, the knife found at the scene and the relatively close distance between Harmon and Fox, Gill found that fear would have been reasonable, he said.
Gill said he didn't come to that conclusion easily. The first time he saw the video at full speed, he thought, "Oh my god, this isn't right," he said.
"These are not easy decisions. They're difficult decisions. I don't take them lightly, and this was a very trying decision," he said.
Jeanetta Williams, president of the Salt Lake branch of the NAACP, said Friday that the group will follow up with prosecutors to get more information before deciding what action to take.
"He ran, but in the video I didn't see a knife," Williams said. "I just saw him try to run and then they just shot him."

The city of Ottawa and Ottawa Tourism announced Wednesday that they have collaborated to create the destination development fund, which, according to the city, will build on the momentum of 2017 by adding new and innovative tourism experiences in the nation's capital.
“This investment is made possible by the new municipal accommodation tax, which was approved by city council in December 2017, and came into effect on January 1,” wrote the city in a release.
“An estimated $1 million of the projected tax revenue will go towards the destination development fund annually, which will be used by Ottawa Tourism to support tourism entrepreneurs who are creating new attractions and events, and enhancing festivals to bring new visitors to the nation's capital.”
READ MORE: Ministry of Canadian Heritage announces Canada Day schedule
According to the city, there will be five funding streams within the program which will include: attractions, facilities, and tourism infrastructure projects, tourism project studies, expansion of regional and/or niche tourism opportunities, festivals and events and the tourism innovation fund.
The city says that the tourism innovation fund, which is a legacy of Ottawa 2017's Ignite 150 program, will take applications for projects that will offer “exciting visitor experiences in Ottawa.” The city cited examples from 2017 including SugarLumberfest, the Oyster Garden at the War Museum, and Music Ignites, as well as neighbourhood events like Water Dance and Scavenger Hunt.
“After welcoming 11-million visitors to Ottawa during the incredible success of 2017, we have been hard at work to find ways to keep up the momentum,” said Mayor Jim Watson. “The destination development fund will ensure that we are able to invest in new initiatives brought forward by innovative local tourism partners; experiences that will generate excitement and keep putting Ottawa on the map.”
READ MORE: Ottawa increases major event fund to $2.5 million after 2017 tourism success
According to the city, the destination development fund is an application-based program, which will have rolling intake periods throughout the year.
Applications will be approved during each quarter by the tourism development council, which is composed of local tourism and business leaders.
Priority areas have been identified where the city believes there is potential for greater visitor experiences in Ottawa. Those include: rural tourism, Indigenous tourism, waterfront and shoreline tourism development, projects that enhance Ottawa's destination image, improvement of the visitor experience including cycling. Also included are bilingualism and/or francophone tourism and expansion of cultural tourism.
“The Destination Development Fund is an absolute game-changer for Ottawa and the local tourism economy,” said Michael Crockatt, CEO and president of Ottawa Tourism. “It tells the world that we recognize the value of destination development as an important factor in keeping Ottawa as an innovator in the visitor experience, which is key to our ability to compete successfully as a destination.”
Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey discussed updates on the state's efforts and planning ahead of Tropical Storm Nate at a news conference Friday afternoon.
Ivey was joined by state EMA Director Brian Hastings, State Meteorologist Jim Stefkovich and other members of the Emergency Operations Team. Ivey stressed the need to prepare ahead of this storm, saying residents on the gulf coast should be in their safe place by noon on Saturday. Ivey said the Alabama National Guard is in place to respond, and the state is pre-positioning resources to assist local communities.
Hastings advised the State Emergency Operations Center in Clanton is continuing to monitor and make staffing adjustments. The center will activate level 2 operations, meaning 24/7 operations, starting Saturday.
Ivey had already declared a state of emergency, which went into effect at 7 a.m. Friday.
While still a tropical storm, Nate is expected to grow into a Category 1 hurricane as it enters the Gulf of Mexico and moves northward in the direction of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama coastlines. The storm is already responsible for at least 22 deaths.

NEW YORK, 2018 - U.S. stocks joined a broad decline in global equity markets on Monday as traders turned cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting this week and amid continuing concerns about the threat of a global trade war.

MSCI's main 47-country world stock index fell 1.1 percent in afternoon trading after European stocks dipped and benchmark U.S. indexes declined. Global equities are on their worst run since November.
The defensiveness came as fears of a global trade war triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump's imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports cast a cloud over a two-day G20 meeting in Buenos Aires this week.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 425.6 points, or 1.71 percent, to 24,520.91, the S&P 500 .SPX index lost 49.48 points, or 1.80 percent, to 2,702.53 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite .IXIC index dropped 182.31 points, or 2.44 percent, to 7,299.67.
Shares of Facebook Inc (FB.O) shed nearly 7 percent after reports that a political consultancy that worked on Trump's 2016 campaign gained inappropriate access to data on 50 million of the social network's users. That decline helped sour investors on other technology stocks, which have led the market higher over the last two years.
“If they start to decay, then it may leave investors wondering what's left to become the new leader to resume the bulls' advance,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
EYES ON CENTRAL BANKS
The drop in European and U.S. indexes came as central banks appeared to be preparing for more rate hikes. A Reuters report that the European Central Bank expects a rate hike by mid-2019 started helping the euro recover from a difficult morning against the dollar.
Wall Street is looking toward the Fed's two-day policy meeting, which concludes on Wednesday, with 104 analysts polled by Reuters expecting that the central bank will raise rates by 25 basis points to a range of 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent.

Yields in benchmark 10-year Treasuries held steady, reflecting investor expectations of higher interest rates.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference after the meeting, his first as the central bank's new chief.
Analysts at JPMorgan see a risk the Fed might not only add one more rate rise for this year but for 2019 as well.
“The worst case is the ‘18 and ‘19 dots both move up - the Fed is currently guiding to five hikes in ‘18 and ‘19 combined, but under this scenario that would shift to seven hikes,” they warned in a note to clients.
“Stocks would probably tolerate one net dot increase over ‘18 and ‘19, but a bump in both years could create problems.”
Any nod to four hikes would normally be considered as bullish for the U.S. dollar, yet the currency has shown scant overall correlation to interest rates in recent months.
Dealers cite concerns about the U.S. budget and current account deficits, chaos in the White House, better growth in overseas markets, particularly Europe, and the risk of a U.S.-led trade war, as among the reasons.
The dollar index .DXY fell 0.4 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.39 percent to $1.2335
The prospect of higher U.S. interest rates was a burden for non-yielding gold, which slipped 0.8 percent last week. On the day, the metal XAU= was down at $1,311.20 per ounce.
Oil prices eased after ending last week with a solid bounce. U.S. crude CLcv1 fell 0.51 percent to $62.02 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $66.05, down 0.24 percent on the day.

He did not disappoint as Hasan Ali who has been impressive for Pakistan throughout the tournament picked up the wicket of Eoin Morgan who was caught behind by Sarfraz Ahmed for 33 runs.

A new study by researchers at the Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM) reveals that the opioid crisis has had a negative impact on patients suffering from chronic pain, an illness that affects one in five Canadians. The study found that restrictive measures and misconceptions have hindered patients.
“These patients are already stigmatized a lot that they don't want to work, that they're lazy, so you add on the stigma of taking opioids and it's really not fair for them,” CRCHUM researcher Manon Choinière said. “They are identified as drug addicts.”
A total of 1,404 chronic pain patients from Quebec and British Columbia took part in the online study between January and April 2018. More than 550 participants were actively taking opioids, 149 had stopped and 397 had never taken opioids as painkillers.
READ MORE: Opioids are starting to be found in mussels near Canadian waters
“I've been taking opioids for 13 years now and it works,” study participant Vincent Raymond told Global News. “But when people hear opioids, it scares them.”
The Quebec City resident has suffered from chronic pain ever since he fractured a vertebra and despite a successful surgery in 2009, he still struggles.
“The pain is still there but instead of being at 5 or 6 on a scale of 10, it will go down to 3 or 4,” the 62-year-old said.
The study found that family physicians are often reluctant to prescribe opioids. Participants also reported that in some cases, pharmacists refused to fill prescriptions and in other cases, insurance companies denied coverage of opioids.
“There is often confusion between the crisis of fentanyl and the crisis of opioid,” Choinière said. “But in reality, the prevalence of opioid abuse and addiction in patients who suffer from chronic pain is quite low.”
The study's leading researcher believes the best way to curb the stigma is to step up pain-control education and training for family physicians and to increase the number of pain-control clinics.
The health minister would not comment on the study and its findings but a spokesperson for Gaétan Barrette's office said: “We have nothing against pain clinics.”

Alberta men in need of urological services now have access to all the services and treatment they need under one roof.
The Northern Alberta Urology Centre and C.J. Woods Prostate Health Clinic celebrated its grand opening at Edmonton's Kaye Clinic on Wednesday morning.
The clinic offers a wide range of medical treatment, information and support for men across Alberta. It's expected about 55,000 people from central and northern Alberta will take advantage of the services, which include treatment for prostate disease and cancer.
“This facility will make life better for patients at this clinic by providing co-ordinated access to a multidisciplinary team of health-care providers, reducing wait and travel times for patients and their families,” Health Minister Sarah Hoffman said in statement.

Before the clinic opened, men seeking urological treatment were forced to visit several different clinics in locations across the city.
“This actually brings all the treatment together. So it's kind of a one-stop shop where everyone can get the full treatment and care,” said Dr. Verna Yiu, president and CEO of Alberta Health Services.
“It's truly a game changer for patients with urological disorders and men facing prostate disease, including cancer.”

The $40-million clinic is the product of a collaboration between the University Hospital Foundation, Royal Alexandra Hospital Foundation and the Cross Cancer Institute.
Nearly a decade ago, all three organizations were working separately in hopes of creating a facility like this. Irv Kipnes with the University Hospital Foundation said it quickly became evident they would need to work together if they were going to be successful.
“We were bumping into the same people to try to get gifts and they had been approached by the other campaigns and it took a sit down for us all to say, ‘Hey, we better work together or we're not going to get this done.'
“From that point on it really accelerated and went on beautifully.”

Kipnes knows the struggles of seeking out treatment. Eighteen years ago he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and found it difficult to find the information and services he needed.
“I really realized that we were wanting and needed to do things better,” he said.
He calls the new clinic a magnificent place for men to come for the services they need.
“I think it'll accelerate their knowledge and their treatment by, I'm going to call it one-stop shopping. Where before, you really had to go search for the information that wasn't really available,” he said.
“The way the clinic is set up, it's incredible. It's very, very full service.”
Alberta Infrastructure contributed $30 million to the project. The remaining $10 million was raised by the University Hospital Foundation and the Royal Alexandra Hospital Foundation.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's wholesale price inflation rate picked up in July after easing for four straight months, with food prices back on the rise.
The wholesale price index rose 1.88 percent in July from a year earlier, compared with an increase of 0.63 percent in July 2016, government data showed on Monday.
The rise compares with a 1.3 percent increase forecast by economists in a Reuters poll and a provisional 0.9 percent rise in June - the slowest pace since July 2016.
Wholesale food prices in July rose 2.12 percent on year, compared with a 1.25 percent fall a month earlier.

Easing price pressures gave the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) room to cut its main policy rate by 25 basis points to 6 percent earlier this month, the lowest since November 2010.
It was the first rate cut by an Asian central bank this year. But the RBI retained its "neutral stance" and warned inflation could pick up again.

Data later on Monday (1200 GMT) is expected to show consumer inflation also quickened in July, after easing for three straight months.
Economists expect the consumer price index, the main policy target of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), rose 1.87 percent on-year, compared with an increase of 1.54 percent in June.
The RBI expects retail inflation could accelerate to 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent in October-December.
BREITBART – JACK MONTGOMERY
The European Union has doubled down on its support for police brutality in Catalonia, with European Commission First Vice-president Frans Timmermans dubbing it “proportionate use of force”.
Speaking in the European Parliament on Wednesday, the top eurocrat condemned Catalonia's regional government for holding a vote on independence, saying it had “chosen to ignore the law in organising the referendum of last Sunday”, Politico reports.
“Violence does not solve anything in politics. It is never an answer, never a solution, and it can never be used as a weapon or instrument,” he added, before immediately contradicting himself in order to endorse Madrid's efforts to violently disrupt the vote: “However, it is a duty for any government to uphold the law, and this sometimes does require the proportionate use of force.”
76ers President Used Fake Twitter Accounts to Criticize His Own Players and Coach
Philadelphia 76ers president of basketball operations Bryan Colangelo was caught using five fake Twitter accounts to criticize players, leak sensitive information and share team strategy.
The accounts reportedly started posting back in April 2016 all the way up to last week and criticized players like former player Jahlil Okafor and current 1st round draft pick Markelle Fultz, coach Brett Brown and former general manager Sam Hinkie. The tweets also disclosed nonpublic medical information about Okafor and gossip about Joell Embiid and Fultz as well as defending Colangelo himself.
.After being asked about a link between all five accounts, the team released a statement from Colangelo:
“Like many of my colleagues in sports, I have used social media as a means to keep up with the news,” Colangelo said in the statement. “While I have never posted anything whatsoever on social media, I have used the @Phila1234567 Twitter account referenced in this story to monitor our industry and other current events. This storyline is disturbing to me on many levels, as I am not familiar with any of the other accounts that have been brought to my attention, nor do I know who is behind them or what their motives may be in using them.”

The University of British Columbia will exclude fossil fuel companies from its low-carbon investment fund, a move being applauded by a campus group that has been pushing for divestment.
The university has rejected calls to divest entirely from fossil fuels, but last year it established the $10-million Sustainable Future Fund to invest in companies with low carbon dioxide emissions.
On Tuesday, the school said in an emailed statement that its board of governors voted to approve a framework for the fund that would see it invested in a fossil fuel-free portfolio managed by investment firm Jarislowsky Fraser.
Donors can contribute over time and the university will increase the fund if it performs well in the coming years, with potential increases of $5 million in 2017, 2018 and 2019.

Investments tied to oil, gas and coal made up about 10 per cent of the school's $1.4-billion endowment as of February 2016.
No Canadian university has divested fully from fossil fuels, but the University of Ottawa has also established a clean investment fund while Concordia University in Montreal has partially divested.
Dawn spacecraft captures new images of Ceres' Occator Crater
Jason Rhian
NASA's Dawn spacecraft has entered into its final planned orbital position from which it will study the dwarf planet Ceres, the lowest the probe has descended to the tiny world since it arrived in orbit on March 6, 2015.
The probe is powered by three xenon ion thrusters and it enters into its new orbit around the dwarf planet on June 6, 2018. Since then, the spacecraft has begun beaming back to Earth stunning new and closer images of this tiny worldlet.
One of Dawn's targets is Occator Crater. While the name might not ring a bell even among space enthusiasts, the “bright spots” contained within the crater should. These deposits are thought to be salt from briny water that erupted from the dwarf planet's surface before sublimating. It was found that the bright regions were comprised of sodium carbonate. On Earth, these salts are left behind when water evaporates.
Dawn was instructed to fire its ion engine—for what could be the last time—last week. By carrying out this maneuver, the probe flew closer to the dwarf planet's Cerealia Facula. This is the region of Occator Crater that contains a large deposit of sodium carbonate.
“Acquiring these spectacular pictures has been one of the greatest challenges in Dawn's extraordinary extraterrestrial expedition, and the results are better than we had ever hoped,” said Marc Rayman, Dawn's chief engineer and project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in news release. “Dawn is like a master artist, adding rich details to the otherworldly beauty in its intimate portrait of Ceres.”
Dawn was directed into its last orbit, where it will arc over the tiny planetoid again and again, peering down from an estimated 22 miles (35 kilometers) above the dwarf planet's surface.
“The first views of Ceres obtained by Dawn beckoned us with a single, blinding bright spot,” said Carol Raymond of JPL, Dawn's principal investigator. “Unraveling the nature and history of this fascinating dwarf planet during the course of Dawn's extended stay at Ceres has been thrilling, and it is especially fitting that Dawn's last act will provide rich new data sets to test those theories.”
It is hoped that the spacecraft's closer position will bring its features into sharper focus. According to NASA, researchers will employ the spacecraft's visible and infrared mapping spectrometer as well as other instruments (which include a gamma ray and neutron detector as well as a visible and infrared mapping spectrometer) to study the dwarf planet's features in greater detail.
Before its recent descent, the closest Dawn had traveled to Ceres was 240 miles (385 kilometers). Now more than 200 miles closer in, the differences between the bright and dark regions in the Vinalia Faculae region of the dwarf planet are expected to be more obvious.
Dawn was constructed by Orbital Sciences and is operated by JPL, which is located in Pasadena, California. More of the vehicle's images can be seen here. Rayman is providing updates about the spacecraft's discoveries in orbit above the dwarf planet, which can be viewed here: Dawn Journal.
“My Name Is Myeisha,” “Tower. A Bright Day” and “White Tide” took the top honors at the fourth edition of the Mammoth Lakes Film Festival over the holiday weekend.
“Myeisha” won the narrative feature award, which included $1,000 cash prize, a $10,000 Panavison camera rental grant and a $10,000 Light Iron post-production package. “White Tide” won the doc prize and with it $1,000 in cash, while “Tower” drew the international trophy and $500 cash. “Shadow Animals” took the short film prize with $500 in cash and $1,000 VER rental grant. The filmmakers also received a handcrafted bear as trophies at a ceremony Sunday at Sierra Event Center in Mammoth Lakes.
Special mentions were given to Thomas Aske Berg, writer-director-star of “Vidar the Vampire”; “Buddha.mov”; “Babies,” and “In a Month.”
The festival screened more than 70 films, including 63 in competitive categories, May 24-28. Invitees attended panels, where members of the media discussed outreach for budding filmmakers, and another in which they got tips on financing, production and distribution. Melissa Leo received a tribute Saturday and sat down for a Q&A with festival director Shira Dubrovner after her 2008 film “Frozen River” unspooled.
“This year's festival exceeded our expectations in many levels,” Dubrovner said. “We welcomed more filmmakers, audience members and members of the media than in any of our three previous years.”

BEIJING - A Chinese firm has developed a laser gun designed for police use that can set fire to protesters' hair or banners from a range of almost one kilometre.
The general manager of the ZKZM fiber laser company, who asked to remain anonymous, said the weapon would "immediately" produce a "strong pain response" in the target but stressed it was designed to be "non-lethal".
"The weapon is designed to do things such as setting fire to illegal banners at a protest or setting fire to the hair or clothing of a protester," he told AFP.
"It is not designed explicitly for killing like a gun that uses bullets and cannot cause the 'instant carbonisation' of human skin and tissues," he added.
The 15-mm calibre weapon weighs three kilogrammes (6.6 pounds), has a range of 800 metres (2,600 feet) and can pass through glass and other transparent obstacles.
It can be mounted on cars, boats and planes, the firm said, adding that it was "seeking a partner that has a weapons production licence or a partner in the security or defence industry to start large-scale production".
It is "mainly expected to be for Chinese police use", the manager told AFP.
He said it would need to be upgraded to a "laser cannon" - with increased power - to become lethal and confirmed his firm was working on such a weapon.
But he noted there was an international agreement not to develop killer lasers and said any such weapons would be "inhumane... the pain would be unimaginable".
Some experts were sceptical of the unveiling, saying laser weaponry was still a matter of science fiction.
Specialist website Techcrunch noted that "laser weaponry capable of real harm has eluded the eager boffins of the world's militaries for several reasons".
"The power required to set a person aflame instantly from half a mile away is truly huge," the website stressed.
"The idea of one that weighs a handful of pounds and fires hundreds of instantly skin-searing shots is just infeasible today."
Development of such laser weapons is not limited to China, with all the big defence players in the US working on prototypes for the Pentagon.
Last year, Lockheed Martin announced a 60-kilowatt laser weapon that is invisible to the naked eye and will be deployed against mortars and small drones.
Who is the best bet to win the Rocket Richard Trophy for most goals?
The pack behind Sidney Crosby is closing in on him when it comes to goals. AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar
Pierre LeBrun: Can you imagine if Auston Matthews or Patrik Laine add the Rocket Richard Trophy to a Calder Trophy? My money's still on leader Sidney Crosby (30 goals) to win the goal derby, although Vladimir Tarasenko (26 goals) and Alex Ovechkin (26 goals) are good bets to finish strong. Jeff Carter (29 goals), Max Pacioretty (28 goals) and Cam Atkinson (27 goals) join Matthews (27 goals) and Laine (26) in a wide-open goal-scoring race. So much fun Tuesday night as Matthews (two goals) and Laine (hat trick) both once again shined on the same night. What impresses me so much about Matthews, 19, is how he has a knack for finding open ice around the net and using his quick hands to jump on loose pucks. He needs so little time or space to make something happen in tight. The best part of his second goal Tuesday night was how he stripped the puck from forward Casey Cizikas at the New York Islanders blue line, which began the whole sequence leading to scoring No. 27 on the season. He creates so much of his own offense.
Scott Burnside: I'm with Pierre on this one. How exciting is it to see so many young guns in the hunt for the goal-scoring crown? And while it's sure hard to bet against Crosby, the fact there are eight other players within four goals makes this race markedly different than in past years, when it was a two- or three-man show usually dominated by Ovechkin, who, not surprisingly, is in the hunt again. Logic suggests that the youngsters Matthews and Laine will fall off the pace, but, well, this crop of young talent seems to be pretty good at ignoring convention, so with that in mind I'm going to go out on a limb and call Laine as a kind of second coming of Teemu Selanne for the Winnipeg Jets to win the goal-scoring race. The weird part is, it might not be enough to earn him rookie of the year honors, not if Matthews can keep his Toronto Maple Leafs in a playoff spot. Regardless, it should be a grand finish.
Craig Custance: No reason to outthink ourselves here. It's Crosby. He leads the league in goals, and he's only played 49 games. He has 10 of those on the power play, which sets up an interesting question for me: Who will lead the league in even-strength goals? That's going to be a heck of a race with Michael Grabner of the New York Rangers your leader at 25. Matthews is second at 23, with three more than Crosby. It would be really impressive if Matthews arrived in the NHL and then went out and led the league in even-strength goals. He's my pick to do it too.

Joe McDonald: The way Crosby has played since December 2015, it's tough to bet against the Pittsburgh Penguins' captain. No. 87 became an even more dangerous player after Pittsburgh won the Stanley Cup in June. He's won two championships, and the pressure is off, which has made him relax a bit and just play. The results are evident, and he's showing zero signs of slowing down. If anything, he's only getting stronger and more productive. The goal-scoring race will remain within reach for those behind Crosby, but in the end he'll finish atop the list.
Corey Pronman: Alex Ovechkin. Because he's Alex Ovechkin, one of the, if not the, the greatest goal scorers of all time. While he's not as elite as we've been used to seeing in prior seasons, Ovie is still generating four shots per game, usually at least one or two of the high-quality variety, and he is still right in the pack in terms of the goal lead. And nobody who is in that discussion is as good as he is at getting high quantities of shots and scoring chances.
Even though, in the age of social media, it feels like it's easy to know where your friends are and what they're up to, your 20s are still a prime time to lose touch. With all the milestones and career changes and moving to different cities, it can creep up on you that someone who was once there every day hasn't texted you in over a year. Navigating how to reconnect with an old friend can be tricky, but it's incredibly rewarding when you're able to bring someone you love back into your life.
"There's nothing inherently wrong with losing touch, even though we often feel guilty about it and place judgments on ourselves about how we're 'bad friends' or something like that," life coach Desiree Wiercyski tells Bustle. "Because of this, it's hard for someone to reach out, so if they do, and if you have time and are willing to, then grab that cup of coffee. The only way you'll really know if you're really reconnecting in friendship is by getting together." Plus, who else will be able to gossip about that one time on the class trip with you, or embarrass you with things they remember about your Sophomore year?
"[So], if you find yourself thinking about an old friend and wanting to reconnect, then that's a sign to do it," Nicole Sbordone, licensed clinical social worker (LCSW), tells Bustle. Just make sure you do it right.
Here are seven tips for reconnecting with a friend after you've lost touch, according to experts.
1 Keep It Simple Ashley Batz/Bustle The goal is to make your old friend feel comfortable, and a big part of this will involve trying not to exaggerate what happened between the two of you. "Be simple, especially if you're strapped for time and haven't spoken in a while," Jenn DeWall, millennial life and career coach, tells Bustle. "Text or email a simple 'hi' or 'thinking of you note.' Remember it doesn't have to be long and detailed, people are just happy you have reached out!" Once the simple act of reaching out is done, you can get the ball rolling on making plans or doing a sentimental gesture.
2 Be Direct Andrew Zaeh for Bustle Most importantly, you have to be up-front. If it's been a while, there's going to be some awkwardness, but your friend deserves your openness and honesty. "If you and your friend had a strong relationship, then be direct," health and wellness coach Caleb Backe tells Bustle. "Don't be afraid to cut the crap and address the situation for exactly what it is. Try to communicate that you were thinking about them and want to see how they're holding up. This can convey true care and let them know that you want to reconnect as friends and not start fresh as strangers." In most cases, losing touch was a two-way street. Yes, you might not have heard from them in a while, but you didn't reach out to them either. "Own it," Wiercyski says. "Acknowledge that you haven't connected in a while and simply ask if they're interested in getting together ... Then, when you get together, if it's a bit awkward, ask them open ended questions. It'll keep the pressure off of you and make them feel good because they get to talk about themselves and the awesome stuff they've been doing." No one needs to be blamed for losing touch, but you shouldn't avoid the situation either. Honor the fact that life got ahead of you, and it will be easier to move on together.
3 Actually Set Plans Ashley Batz/Bustle No one likes to hear the words "let's grab coffee!" when they know it means, "let's not talk again for a year!" While it seems like the polite thing to say, it can be hurtful. But what do you do if you actually mean it? "A genuine 'let's grab coffee!' is immediately followed up by arranging the date, time and place," DeWall says. "If you're not setting a date you're not likely getting coffee together." These plans are the foundation for the next step of your friendship. Once the plans are in place, make sure you're keeping your friend comfortable as well. "Keep it casual," Wiercyski says. "This may mean simply grabbing coffee or going to happy hour. And definitely try to keep it at a 1:1 level. It's so easy for someone to feel intimated if you haven't connected for a while then you invite them to hang out with all your new friends ... If you're reconnecting with someone you haven't seen in years, then it may be best to invite them to a defined activity (i.e. the painting classes that are popular, bowling, or even a sporting event) because if things are a bit awkward, there's something else to focus on and possibly create a new bond over." And if you both have a good time hanging out again, make plans for your next hangout, too. Making brunch reservations a few weeks in advance is necessary these days, anyways.
4 Try Snail Mail Hannah Burton/Bustle Once you've gotten the initial reconnection over with, you can show your friend how much you care by putting time and effort in, in unexpected ways. "Send a card. Mail implies thoughtfulness. Handwritten notes are more meaningful than texts," DeWall says. In a card, you can write down any cheesy thoughts or memories in a way that feels real and genuine. Plus, it's way cheaper than getting a gift.
5 Make Them Laugh Ashley Batz/Bustle One of the best things about long-term friends is their unparalleled ability to make you laugh. So, if it's been a while, do them the favor right back. "Send them a light-hearted or funny text or meme," DeWall says. "Make them laugh! Who doesn't want to connect with the people that make us happy." If you've simply lost touch and there's no resentment, it will be good feelings all around. "The biggest difference [between losing touch and losing a friend] is how easy it is to pick up where you left off," DeWall says. "If you're still friends the conversation will flow easy and each of you will leave feeling happier after the exchange." So go a step beyond tagging them in the comments section, and actually make a conversation around whatever makes you laugh. It's a lot more personal, and it increases the chances of them sending you something back!
6 Address Any Serious Issues Andrew Zaeh for Bustle Another part of being being a good friend to someone you've lost touch with is being unafraid to have difficult conversations. As much as you two can share drinks and laugh, the friendship won't really get back to where it began unless you can discuss any serious issues the two of you may have. "It can go wrong if you've fell out of touch because of a fight or misunderstanding and the issue is still unresolved and one of you (or both) are still harboring resentment," DeWall says. "To avoid this, make sure that you address the issues and not sweep them under the rug." The conversation can be kind and loving, of course, but it should be direct. "Take away all judgments about what caused the lapse in contact. Life happens," Wiercyski says. You and your friend both deserve this.

A 19-year-old Penticton woman has been sentenced for a lighting a fire that destroyed four townhouses in Penticton on Oct. 13, 2016.
Earlier this year, Sydney Leer pleaded guilty to a charge of arson causing damaging to property for the fire at the Cascades Gardens townhouse complex on Penticton Ave.
Damage was estimated at more than $1 million.
No one was hurt in the blaze, but a cat and three birds perished in the flames.
A B.C. Provincial Court judge sentenced Leer Monday to 1,189 days in prison for her crime.
Leer has been in custody since the night of the blaze.
She had a fight with her mother that evening then lit their home on fire. The flames spread quickly to nearby units in the complex.
The young woman had earlier gave the courts no explanation for setting the blaze and had shown no remorse for her actions.
Leer was given enhanced credit for her time in custody. Despite spending less than a year in jail awaiting sentencing, that time has been credited at 459 days served.
Following her release, Leer will be on probation for three years.
ISLAMABAD - Chief of Army Staff Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, who has been invited by the Afghan leadership after he telephoned them at the beginning of the New Year, will discuss with them a host of issues including the growing foothold of the Islamic State (Daesh) in the war-ravaged country.
Gen Bajwa has been invited by the Afghan leaders to visit Kabul to find common grounds for sustained cooperation for peace in the region.
Although there is no official comment about the army chief's visit, analysts believe that the likely stopover would primarily focus on finding common grounds for future cooperation between the two countries.
Bilateral relations between Kabul and Islamabad have been in a downward spiral for the last more than a year after the Afghanistan government failed to fulfil its commitment to enter into an agreement with Pakistan on intelligence-sharing to tackle the menace of terrorism.
The bilateral relations further dipped owing to a lack of tangible progress to help restore peace through the agreed quadrilateral mechanism.
As a policy, Islamabad strongly believes that peace in Afghanistan was in the national interest of Pakistan and has been advocating that any initiative for peace and reconciliation has been to Afghan-led and Afghan-owned.
“I think Gen Bajwa's visit to Kabul would largely focus on border management,” Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad Director Research Najam Rafique told The Nation on Sunday.
Rafique was of the view that the growing presence of Daesh in Afghanistan would also figure high for the two countries to enhance cooperation about how to secure the Pak-Afghan border.
“The growing presence and activities of Daesh in Afghanistan pose a serious threat to the regional peace and stability,” he said.
At the secretary level trilateral meeting held in Moscow on December 27, Pakistan, Russia and China also expressed their concern over the growing influence of Daesh in Afghanistan.
Rafique said that the army chief may also take up the issue of the proscribed TTP leaders activities from Afghan soil to destabilise Pakistan.
Former army chief Gen Raheel Sharif had also visited Kabul shortly after his appointment in order to build sustained cooperation between the two countries.
But despite agreements on key issues to deepen bilateral cooperation with the Afghan government no progress could be achieved.
According to defence analysts, India played dirty game and spoiled the cooperative environment between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
NO PLAN FOR MEDIATION IN AFGHAN TALKS: RUSSIA
INP adds: Although Russia, China, and Pakistan recently held a session to assess the situation in Afghanistan, but a senior Russian diplomat states that the three countries have no programme for meditation in Afghan peace negotiations.
Zamir Kabulov, the special envoy of Russia in Afghanistan has said that Moscow, Beijing and Islamabad have no plan for peace negotiations, because they have received no request in that regard.
He made clear that Moscow session has been held to widen regional cooperation regarding improvement of situation in Afghanistan.
According the Russian special envoy, the three countries that participated in Moscow session believe there is a need for a more comprehensive regional formation in Afghanistan in cooperation with the country to set up new objectives.
One of the matters agreed upon in tripartite session was carrying efforts for removal the names of Taliban's leaders from the UN black list.
According to Afghan politicians, Moscow session is a clear message for Western countries, US, and the Gulf countries that indicates the participants of Moscow conference use Taliban against their objectives and interests in the region.
Meanwhile, the Afghan political experts have said that although Russia and China are the permanent members of UN Security Council, but other members of the Security Council such as US, France and UK stand against them and will not let Russia and China achieve their goals.
Therefore, the endeavours of Russia, China and Pakistan for removing the names of Taliban's leaders from UN black list would be in vain. On the other hand, other countries like India that considers security and stability in Afghanistan effective for ensuring security and stability in its own country is not pleased with Moscow session and the decisions made by the authorities of Russia, China and Pakistan, because, Taliban during their rule and during the last 14 years have attacked Indians interests in Afghanistan.
ISLAMABAD - Pakistan says that the United States did not share evidence of wrongdoing before placing recent sanctions against certain defence-related Pakistani entities, but that it has pledged to work with Washington to address all concerns.
A December 15 notification by the Department of Commerce named the entities and added them to the Export Administration Regulations list, saying "these government, parastatal and private entities in Pakistan are determined to be involved in activities that are contrary to the national security and/or foreign policy of the United States."
The facilities in question are thought to be associated with Pakistan's missile development programme, though officials in Islamabad have not acknowledged it. The US government has not revealed details of violations these entities are alleged to have committed.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Nafees Zakaria told Voice of America (VOA) that the government was aware of the sanctions. "This means that for any transfers of technology to these entities, US exporters will need a licence," he said, adding that Pakistani authorities were examining the case to ascertain the facts behind the listing.
Zakaria called the timing of the sanctions "intriguing". He told VOA that Pakistan was ready to work with the US at the level of experts to devise mutually agreed-upon procedures for end-use guarantees.
"This will help in assuring nondiversion of high-technology exports from the US without hampering our legitimate imports for socioeconomic development activities," the FO spokesman said.
Pakistan officials insist their missile and nuclear programmes are "completely indigenous", and that US sanctions will have "little bearing" on them.
"It means nothing for us," said a senior official associated with the projects. He requested not to be named because he was not authorised to speak to reporters.
The officials described the sanctions as a politically motivated move aimed at creating problems for the incoming Donald Trump administration's relations with Pakistan.Islamabad has developed and equipped its armed forces with a variety of short-, medium- and long-range missiles, capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear warheads.
The programme has raised concerns in Washington about the safety of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, though Islamabad dismisses such issues as misplaced.

Former NFL Network executive Eric Weinberger and former NFL Network analyst Donovan McNabb are also named in the lawsuit. McNabb currently works for ESPN as a radio host.
An ESPN spokesman had no comment, saying the company had just learned of the allegations.
Weinberger, now president of The Ringer, has been placed on indefinite leave by the company.
In her lawsuit, Cantor said she received inappropriate and sexually explicit texts from each of Evans, McNabb, Taylor and Weinberger on separate occasions. Faulk, according to the lawsuit, fondled and groped Cantor and asked Cantor "deeply personal and invasive questions" about her sex life.
Cantor originally filed a wrongful termination case in October and on Monday filed a more detailed complaint.
"The supervisors knew about it, the supervisors observed it," Cantor's lawyer, Laura Horton, told the New York Times on Monday. "It was insidious in this particular environment."
In continuation of efforts to stem the tide of corruption among the state traffic officials, the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) has arrested eight of its officials for collecting bribe from motorists and other corrupt practices.The officials, who are attached to the Agege-Pen Cinema Office of the Agency, were arrested last week. They are Adebeshin Adeola, Davies Idowu, Folashade Abolade, Shittu Lanre, Akinkotu Olusoga, Olowu Said, Olaoye Peter and Adebola Said.The duo of Adeshina and Davies had earlier arrested two Lagos painted commercial buses with registration numbers FKJ 770 XT and KRD 558 XM driven by one Olatunji Mayowa and Donatus Eze respectively at Abule Egba area of the State for seat belt violation.The actions of the drivers were in violations of the Lagos State Traffic laws, and the buses were subsequently apprehended and taken to the Agege-Pen Cinema Office of the Agency.However, the matter took a new twist at the Agege Office when the apprehending officials in conjunction with the General Duty Officer demanded for the sum of N7,200 from each of the bus drivers before the release of the buses.The drivers, knowing the position of LASTMA on corruption and having listened to various media programmes where official complaint numbers were given, alerted the Agency and marked currency were given to the complainants and collected by the officials in a successful sting operation organized and coordinated by the Provost Marshal of the Agency, Mr Femi Ajibosho.The Provost Marshal arrived when Abolade was about collecting N7,200 from Donatus Eze, while the collected marked money of N7,200 of Olatunji Mayowa was found on her after search.In the same vein and at the same location, the members of the patrol team of the Agency comprising of Shittu Lanre, Akinkotu Olusoga, Olowu Said, Olaoye Peter and Adebola Said also arrested a vehicle for traffic laws violation and asked Abolade to facilitate collection of bribes on their behalf from the alleged offender before the release of the vehicle.All the traffic officials involved in this shameful act have been released on bail, but are to face the full weight of the Lagos State Public Service Rules and Regulations.Speaking on the incident at Oshodi Office of the Agency, LASTMA General Manager, Mr Olawale Musa said the Agency has set a standard for itself to become one of the most disciplined, credible and efficient traffic management institution in the Sub-Saharan Africa.He said: “LASTMA under my watch will not tolerate any act of indiscipline and corruption capable of dragging the revered image of the Agency and that of the State Government to the mud.“To this end, all the officials involved in the shameful act will be made to appear before the Personnel Management Board (Discipline) to defend their action in accordance with the relevant sections of the Public Service Rules.”Speaking further, Musa said the action of the officials were disgraceful and did not represent the training and operational manual of the Agency, adding that it also did not justify the huge motivation and investment in them by the Agency to perform excellently on the road.He said the introduction of culture of civility and respect for motorists' rights was part of the bid to curb corruption in the agency, with more emphasis on reducing rash decisions, extortion of motorists and rather concentrating on efficient traffic management and control.However, the LASTMA boss said the new paradigm shift which is now responsible for sanity, orderliness and seamless traffic on Lagos roads does not preclude the Agency from sanctioning any motorist who runs foul of the law when occasion calls for it, in order to improve on the existing tempo and performance.It would be recalled that the Agency recently dismissed 20 officials for various corrupt practices and 15 others received letters of warning for various acts considered inimical to the Agency and service of the Lagos State Government.
KARACHI - The SBP Act 1956 mandates the State Bank of Pakistan to regulate the credit system of the country and empowers it through the Banking Companies Ordinance 1962 for this purpose.
Using its authority and powers, SBP decided to amalgamate KASB Bank into BankIslami in 2015 after a moratorium was imposed by the federal government on its request to safeguard the interests of depositors and to ensure safety and soundness of the banking system of the country. This step was taken due to poor financial condition of defunct KASB bank and its inability to meet regulatory requirements despite opportunities being provided for an extended period of time, said a press release issued on Friday.
Since then a smear campaign was run in some quarters of media to dub this action by SBP against the law and malign its staff for misuse of authority. Taking notice of these reports, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) initiated an inquiry into the matter and recently it has been learnt from its press release that an investigation has been authorised against the officials of SBP for alleged misuse of authority in terms of amalgamation of KASB Bank into BankIslami, the press release said.
SBP finds this decision of NAB to convert its inquiry into investigation disappointing since the inquiry report available in the media does not appear to have incorporated all the detailed input provided by SBP during the process and released through its communications to the general public. “Such one sided views lead to misjudgement about the authority of SBP as a guardian of the financial sector in general and the interest of depositors in particular. Further, it negatively impacts the motivation of SBP staff to discharge its duties without fear or favour,” it added.
British singer Rebecca Ferguson appears to be the latest performer to enter the saga of Donald Trump's inauguration plans.
The former “X Factor UK” contestant said in a statement on Monday that she had been asked to perform at the Jan. 20 event, and would accept on one condition: that she'll be able to sing famous protest song “Strange Fruit.”
“I've been asked and this is my answer,” Ferguson wrote on TwitLonger. “If you allow me to sing ‘strange fruit' a song that has huge historical importance, a song that was blacklisted in the United States for being too controversial. A song that speaks to all the disregarded and down trodden black people in the United States. A song that is a reminder of how love is the only thing that will conquer all the hatred in this world, then I will graciously accept your invitation and see you in Washington.”
Originally a poem by Abel Meeropol, “Strange Fruit” paints a picture of the lynchings of African-Americans in the early 20th century. Some of the lyrics include: “Southern trees bear strange fruit / Blood on the leaves and blood at the root / Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze.” “Strange Fruit” was first recorded by Billie Holiday, and later notably by Nina Simone.
The Trump camp has not yet responded to Ferguson's statement. So far, the only performers on the line-up for the inauguration are former “America's Got Talent” contestant Jackie Evancho, the Radio City Rockettes, and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

LAHORE - The Lahore High Court Wednesday sought personal appearance of any responsible officer from President House to explain as to why the pension was not given to PCO judge Syed Sajjad Hussain like other judges.
Chief Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah passed the order while hearing petition of Syed Sajjad Hussain Shah.
Arguing before the court, the petitioner's counsel said that since Shah was a PCO judge, he was not given the perks and privilege including the pension. But the President of Pakistan, while exercising his discretionary powers, allowed pension to five other PCO judges, he told the court. He said the petitioner had also made a representation to the president for release of pension but so far it was not decided. He requested the court to direct the authorities concerned to release his pension. The court adjourned hearing until June 20.
As the feud between B.C. and Alberta escalates over the latest round of regulations over the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, Premier John Horgan is standing firm and denying he's being provocative.
The new regulations have drawn the ire of Alberta premier Rachel Notley and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau threatening B.C. with sanctions or pulling programs if the province continues to obstruct the pipeline.

“I am not going to put aside my responsibilities to stand up to defend British Columbia,” said Horgan. “I'll continue to do that but I did not set out to be provocative.”
Horgan said his government's announcement that it would consult on new regulations should not set off a “trade war between good friends.”

Horgan also said he's not waiting out Kinder Morgan in the hopes that further delays would cause the company to drop the project altogether.
Horgan said his government has been clear about its belief that the Trans Mountain pipeline is not in the best interest of the province and continues to fight the project in Federal Court.

“We're addressing issues as they come forward, that's again what I believe the public expects of us,” said Horgan.
He said the province has obtained legal advice about the new proposals and the government is well within its rights to consult with citizens.

Islamabad - Completion of underconstruction motorways and highways including China-Pakistan Economic Corridor projects would open new vistas of opportunities for the people of the adjacent areas and end sense of deprivation among the people of far flung areas of the country.
National Highways Authority (NHA) General Manager Design Asim Amin on Sundaysaid that tens of thousands of job opportunities will be created directly and indirectly after the completion of new roads in the country and destiny of the poor people will be changed forever.
Asim said that most of the ongoing NHA projects are being executed in comparatively less developed areas of the country, especially Khyber-Pakhtunkhawa and Balochistan. He said that due to policies of the present government, in coming few years road infrastructure in the country would be transformed and Pakistan would become hub of regional trade.
Amin said that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had given the task of early completion of these projects to NHA, which also included alignment of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
He informed that presently either these projects were being executed or were in the planning stage. “Allah Almighty has bestowed Pakistan with such geography that about 40 per cent of world population lives in its vicinity and it can act as a gateway between the most populous countries of the world, India and China,” he elaborated.
The GM said that the main objectives of the NHA are to develop high speed north-south economic corridor, provide linkages with the Gwadar Port and enhance regional connectivity.
He said that presently the NHA portfolio has crossed Rs1,000 billion which used to be Rs50 to Rs60 billion a few years back.
To a question, he said that CPEC was the name of building roads from Khunjerab to Gwadar. “A number of sections of this mega project have been completed and the remaining are under construction,” he informed.
He said 335 km Khunjerb-Raikot section of the Karakoram Highway (N-35) has already been upgraded while for the upgradation of Raikot-Thakot section of the highway, damaged during 2010 floods, China had given $70 million grant. He said its 136km portion had been rehabilitated while for the remaining 140km section, talks for another grant worth $80 million were in progress.
Amin said that construction work of Havelian-Thakot Motorway section was in full swing and it was expected to be completed in three years
The stretch of motorway from Havelian passes through Abbottabad, Mansehra and Shinkiari, ending at Thakot.
He further said that work on the 59km Burhan-Havelian of Hazara Motorway was going on smoothly and would be completed next year.
He told that the western corridor was divided into six sections including Hakla-Dera Ismail Khan (288km), Dera Ismail Khan-Zhob (205km), Zhob-Quetta (331km), Quetta-Sohrab 211km, Sohrab-Hoshab 449km and Hoshab-Gwadar 193km.
He said that western route passed through less developed areas of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. “With development on this route, people living in these areas would get jobs,” he added.
About Hakla-Dera Ismail Khan Expressway, he said that construction of a 285km new road between Halka, an area near Islamabad, and Dera Ismail Khan had been divided into five parts to ensure that the work was completed in two years. He said Halka-Dera Ismail Khan road was the biggest missing link in the proposed western route, and it would be completed by August 2018.
“One of the major projects of CPEC is the widening of 533km long two-lane Dera Ismail Khan-Quetta Highway,” he said adding that, “Under the project, the road will be turned into a four-lane carriageway. Its feasibility study has been carried out by the National Engineering Services of Pakistan.”
He said that groundbreaking of the upgradation of Zhob-Mughalkot section had been performed by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in December 2015.
The NHA GM said that upgradation of Zhob-Quetta highway had also been realised while Sorab-Hoshab section had recently been inaugurated.
He further said that 193km Hoshab-Turbat-Gwadar portion had been completed.
Amin said that rehabilitation of Dera Ismail Khan-Mughalkot section of N-50 would be completed by 2018.
Moreover, he said that dualisation of 531km Dera Ismail Khan to Kuchlak section of N-50 would be operational by 2020.
About dualisation of 211km Quetta-Kalat-Surab section, he said it was planned to be completed by 2020.
He said the NHA would also strengthen the east-west connectivity through Balochistan and extend across all provinces including Gilgit-Baltistan.
He said that during past three years the NHA had completed 58km Multan-Khanewal Motorway which cost Rs14 billion, 150km Qila Saifullah-Zhob Highway which cost Rs8.3 billion, and 68km Sukkur-Jacababad which cost Rs8.5 billion.
Moreover, Amin said that the NHA also completed Rs10.3 billion Faisalabad-Gojra section of Motorway which had the total length of 58km, 384km Raikot-Khunjerab which cost Rs490 million, 64km Waighum Rud-Khjuri road at the cost of Rs13 billion, and 7.6km Peshawar Northern Bypass (package I) which cost Rs22 billion.
ST. LOUIS — Monday will see the St. Louis Blues host their first-ever outdoor NHL game. They'll face the Chicago Blackhawks for the 19th time since the start of 2016.
One of the most interesting notes about outdoor hockey during Sunday's practice day — a day full of players reminiscing about their history on outdoor sheets — was the revelation that Blues coach Ken Hitchcock has previously coached an outdoor game.
He dropped the anecdote casually during Sunday's press conference. “I've coached outdoor games before,” he said. “Some against inmates that were a lot scarier than the one is going to be tomorrow. Really scary, as a matter of fact. We were afraid to score a goal.”
He left the story to sit there until pressed to explain further.
“I had this bright idea,” he continued. “We were going to give back to the community. We were in Prince Albert, where [Blues assistant coach] Rick Wilson is from. So I organized a game against the inmates at the security prison. They were playing for real and we were trying to play for fun.
“They won.
“It was neat though, because the snow was on top of the boards and they were all lined up on top of the snow and it looked a little bit like the Colosseum in Rome.
“It was an interesting way of playing because it was 20 below. The way we played was one group of five on the ice, one on the bench and the other in the [warming] shack. You went from the ice to the shack and it was a neat way of playing. It ended up being a lot of fun, but it wasn't one of my brightest ideas.”
After Saturday's Winter Classic Alumni Game, Wayne Gretzky was asked to talk about the success Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews have had in Chicago. “I think that both of them are obviously superstars,” he said. “Both of them are Hall of Famers. I don't think there's any debate over that.”
Kane was told about that quote Sunday. “I didn't know that,” he said. “Well, I guess, hearing that, that's pretty special. You know, actually, I scored my 700th point the other night and some of the text messages I got were like ‘2,100 more points to catch Gretzky.' That kind of speaks volumes to how good of a player he was.”
Asked for some insight into what was surprising about getting out on the ice for the first time Sunday, Hitchcock focused on a detail that had little to do with the actual game.
“The first thing I thought is the dugout is really a dugout,” he said. “I was shocked by how low the dugout is. I thought it was close to the field level, but you could really hide in that dugout. That's the thing that shocked me. How do you see a baseball game?”
I asked Chicago's Ryan Hartman if any of the older players had given him any advice on playing on a big stage like the Winter Classic. “Don't look directly into the sun,” he said.
Linemate Vinnie Hinostroza got some different advice. “Just soak it all in. It's about the experience and it's about the game,” he said. “Just being here and experiencing all this is really cool. It's something I'll never forget.”
Most players addressed the Winter Classic as being just another game. But Chicago defenseman Michal Rozsival refreshingly honest take on the excitement of playing in one of the league's outdoor spectacles. “I think [the excitement] is starting to [trickle down] to the team. You can feel the vibe around the game,” he said. “Even after practice, it was higher than before. It's still going to escalate as we get close to the game tomorrow.
“The excitement is there. You can feel it. You can feel it in the room from the players and the coaches and everybody in the locker room and around the rink.
“I've played some games outdoor before. I try to approach it as just another game, but it is totally different, right? The ice is different. The wind is blowing in your face, slowing you down. Sometimes you feel like you're carrying another body on your back. It's a little different.”
A high school in Perry County closed Monday after an alleged threat was made on social media.
According to Perry County Superintendent John H. Heard III, Francis Marion School was closed Monday after someone posted an alleged threat to Facebook Sunday night. The post allegedly threatened to shoot up the school.
Authorities are investigating and there is a suspect but at this time it is unclear if it was a student.
Heard says a message was sent to all Francis Marion students and parents through the messaging system. The school plans to reopen Tuesday.

A six-hour 30 for 30 series on the Vegas Golden Knights' Stanley Cup run wouldn't even give us all the answers.
Really, could anything give us a full understanding of the Golden Knights' impossible season?
Now three wins away from the Stanley Cup, Vegas is poised to complete the most perplexing story in NHL history. It might even be the most compelling story in North American sports. There's no other team in the North American major leagues that has come close to achieving what Vegas has in their first year of existence.
It's a story even Hollywood would have trouble believing. But it's not done yet. #VegasBorn #StanleyCup pic.twitter.com/7DQuxpY4MH — NHL (@NHL) May 28, 2018
From the first drop of the puck in October, Vegas has bewildered everyone with a full and complete effort from every single player. When you watch Vegas, you become mesmerized by just how hard they work every shift. Nobody on that team quits, no matter what the score is.
This was a team that everyone expected to flop with a middling roster full of cast-offs. With the right mix of players and an up-tempo style of play, Vegas now looks near unbeatable.
The Vegas Buzz Word: Tenacious
With a team this tenacious, it's a surprise that they don't have Jack Black and Kyle Gass performing during the intermissions.
You could describe this Golden Knights team in a few different ways. What stands out with this group most though is their tenacious style of play. They're already one of the fastest teams in the NHL, and their forwards are always buzzing around the net.
Quantifying tenacity-per-60 may be out of the question, but it can be summed up as simply as this. Vegas shows no quit. No matter what the score is, no matter what the situation is, Vegas plays like it's their franchise's last game every time they're on the ice.
In the Conference Final, Vegas made a superior Winnipeg Jets team look overwhelmed. After losing Game 1 of that series, Vegas never trailed over the next four games. They came out flying against the Jets, making one of the most talented teams in the league look slow and mundane.
Even when Winnipeg pushed back, Vegas wouldn't budge an inch. They also got more consistent play top to bottom throughout the lineup. Out of the top 20 players in scoring chances for per-60 in the Conference Finals, seven were from Vegas. Only two players from Winnipeg cracked that list.
When the games mattered the most, more players from Vegas showed up. They were tenacious, hard on the forecheck, and imposed their will on a favoured Jets team. Even in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final, Vegas overcame every deficit and obstacle presented to them.
In short, nothing changed with this team between their first game in October and Game One of the Stanley Cup Final.
Golden Knights All Have Something to Prove
There's no concrete answer to explain Vegas's sheer tenacity and success, but there's one prevalent theory that makes sense.
The majority of Vegas's expansion draft selections were comprised of players who had something to prove. It's something that nearly every player on that roster had in common.
It starts with the top line of Reilly Smith, Jon Marchessault, and William Karlsson. All three of those players were underused and undervalued in their former organizations. Their play in Vegas was resemblant of players who had a fire lit underneath their feet.
How about castoff David Perron, who's on his fifth team in four seasons? Not only has he found a home, but he set a career-high in points.
Erik Haula is another great example. In Minnesota, his ceiling was a third-line player. He destroyed that notion by posting 55 points with the Golden Knights. There's also Game 1 hero Tomas Nosek, who was buried in the Detroit Red Wings organization. How does he look now after scoring a game-winning goal in the Stanley Cup Final?
Almost all of the team's defencemen and goaltenders share a similar story. Guess what? Almost every single player on the Golden Knights had a career year statistically.
It's all culminated to create the perfect storm in Vegas. Under the beating desert sun, this collection of misfits is now poised to create history in the unlikeliest of places. At the same time, everyone watching this team make history must have the same thought creeping into their mind.
Never underestimate the power of the misfits.

Buffered by three oceans and the United States to the south, Canada has for decades had the luxury of being able to pick and choose its newcomers. So few asylum seekers crossed the U.S. border illegally over the years that Canada didn't consistently track the numbers.
That has changed dramatically over the past 14 months.
According to reports from Reuters, U.S. President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration and his move to strip Haitians, Salvadorans and others of their temporary legal status have had a broad effect on Canada's refugee system.
More than 20,000 people, including thousands of Haitians and Nigerians and hundreds of Turks, Syrians and Eritreans, have crossed the border into Canada illegally over the past year in search of asylum, many fleeing in fear that Trump would deport them to their home countries.

This unexpected northward migration has overwhelmed the country's system for processing asylum claims, leading to the worst delays in years. Aid agencies are also struggling to house asylum-seekers because of a shortage of accommodation in the four cities most affected by the migration wave — Toronto, Montreal, Winnipeg and Vancouver.
While some of this has been reported, this story offers the most complete picture to date of the unintended effect of Trump's immigration policies on Canada.
The government was forced to set aside $173 million in its latest budget to pay for extra patrols at border crossings to cope with the influx, as well as security screening and processing of refugee applications.
The Trudeau government has discussed the situation with the Trump administration, but it has been careful not to publicly blame the U.S. president's policies for triggering the migration wave. Nevertheless, it is already making preparations for more people to cross the border once the weather warms.
“We will be ready,” Immigration and Refugee Minister Ahmed Hussen said in an interview.
Aid agencies who are at the forefront of dealing with the influx say they are struggling and need more funding, a comprehensive long-term plan and better coordination with Ottawa.
“It's going to get worse. The numbers keep climbing,” said Ilona Beiks, vice president of the Inland Refugee Society of British Columbia, which had to turn away refugees last year for the first time in its 35-year history because it did not have enough money to cope with the growing number of asylum seekers.
The influx shows no signs of abating. More than 1,500 asylum seekers walked across the border in January. Those working with refugee claimants say this is no blip: It's the new normal.
Since January 2017 Reuters has sought to obtain the numbers of asylum seekers who walked across the U.S. border into Canada in the years prior to Trump's election. The Canadian government has said no national historical data is available.

Trump's tougher immigration policies have had a major impact on Canada's Immigration and Refugee Board, which determines refugee claims. It has become so overwhelmed with cases it is ignoring legislated time limits for dealing with them.
All refugee claims are supposed to be processed within 60 days. Increasingly, the board has failed to meet those targets. In December 2017, 86 per cent of hearings did not happen within prescribed time frames, according to previously unpublished data reviewed by Reuters. That was up from 66 per cent in December 2016, a month after Trump was elected president, and 26 per cent in December 2015.
On Feb. 20, the board said it will effectively prioritize those applicants who have been waiting months or years. This will mean a longer wait for more recent arrivals than the current 20-month average estimated time for processing claims.
The government is “committed to an efficient and fair asylum system,” said a spokesman for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, the government department responsible for the Immigration and Refugee Board.
Canada's refugee tribunals have historically been leery of claims made by people who come through its wealthy southern neighbor. But of the more than 2,500 claims finalized last year, 53 per cent were granted refugee status.
Those working with refugee claimants say this is no blip: It's the new normal.
Rulings reviewed by Reuters indicate the tribunals are giving credence to claimants who say they feared deportation or racist attacks following Trump's election on a platform advocating more restrictions on immigration.

Asylum seekers are walking across the border into some of the tightest housing markets on the continent.
Last summer, thousands slept in Montreal's Olympic stadium.
In Toronto, 31 per cent of the people sleeping in city-run shelters in January were refugee claimants – up from nearly 19 per cent a year ago, according to city data.
In November, Toronto approved the booking of more hotel rooms for refugee claimants through the end of 2018, at a cost of about $20 million, according to city documents.
The city is working on a more comprehensive refugee plan but it needs more help from the federal government, said councilor Kristyn Wong-Tam. The status quo, renting thousands of hotel beds, “is absolutely unsustainable,” she said.
“We are not saying ‘No' to refugees. We are saying, ‘Absolutely: Come and live in Toronto. Build your life in Toronto.' But we cannot do this without the support of other orders of government,” she said.
Toronto's mayor “has raised this issue repeatedly with the federal government,” the mayor's spokesman, Don Peat, wrote in an email.
The federal government says it won't give cities more money for asylum seekers, who are barred from accessing a $762 million federal fund that is for permanent residents or people who have already been granted refugee status.
A spokesman for Hussen, the immigration minister, said asylum seekers can access provincial programs. Some agencies Reuters spoke with, however, said that isn't enough and that a national effort is needed.
Toronto is not alone in asking for help. Vancouver has asked the British Columbia provincial government for more money for refugee aid agencies, said city spokesman Jag Sandhu, and the province has promised $6 million a year over three years. Winnipeg is coordinating with the Manitoba government to find accommodation for refugee claimants, the city said.

Canada has no formal system for integrating refugee claimants and depends heavily on aid agencies that operate independently but are funded through a combination of government grants and private donations.
Dozens of agencies in Toronto, Winnipeg, Vancouver and Montreal are taking the lead in housing and feeding new arrivals and helping them find schools and employment.
Of 17 organizations Reuters spoke with, 11 said interviews with border crossers confirmed that many were fleeing because of Trump's immigration policies.
“We know the numbers have increased because of what's going on in the U.S.,” said Toronto-based doctor Meb Rashid, who runs the provincially funded Crossroads Clinic.
The number of patients at the clinic grew 40 per cent in a year and people now wait several weeks for an appointment, Rashid said.
“We're struggling, I have to be honest with you.”

Two aid groups said they have had to turn people away, one has had to intensify its fundraising, two have had to extend their operating hours to meet demand, while six who help to house new arrivals are struggling to find accommodation for them.
The Manitoba Interfaith Immigration Council in Winnipeg has seen its refugee claimant caseload increase fivefold in the past year, said executive director Rita Chahal.
“The impact has been huge,” she said, adding that the organization had to launch its first fundraising drive in years to meet the additional costs.
The government has dispatched lawmakers to diaspora communities in the United States to persuade people not to come. But it has said little about what conversations it has had with Washington on stemming the migration.
The spokesman for Hussen, the immigration minister, said the government has a “long-standing, solid working relationship” with the United States.
Meanwhile, the contingency plans being developed to deal with the expected surge in border crossers include redeploying police and border agents to overwhelmed areas and setting up accommodation such as tents and trailers at ports of entry, said a spokesman for the Canada Border Services Agency.
“There is an expectation the numbers will go up … as the weather gets better,” said a source familiar with the government's thinking. “And who knows what the next order coming from down south will be?”

ISLAMABAD, Jul 3 (APP):Caretaker Minister for Defence Lt. Gen (Retd) Naeem Khalid Lodhi Tuesday said holding fair and transparent general election was the responsibility of Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
The minister said more than 80,000 polling stations had been set up across the country and
every polling station would contain several polling booths and four to five personnel would be deputed
on such booths to maintain law and order situation to avert any untoward incident during the election
on July 25, he said talking to a private news channel.
To a query, he said Pakistan had fought successful war against terrorism and rendered unprecedented sacrifices in that regard.
He said Pakistan was enjoying good ties with Afghanistan and our peace was interlinked with Afghanistan's peace.
Lodhi said India was our biggest enemy and Pakistan's valiant armed forces were
always ready to give befitting response.
He said many people in India were claiming of its state failure in the occupied Kashmir.
Commenting on Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), he said practical steps should be taken
to make PIA profitable and all the appointments should be held on merit.
While many Canadians are contemplating how to capitalize on the upcoming legalization of marijuana, municipalities are worried about what the new legislation is going to cost.
That's because much of the burden of regulating the product will be the responsibility of local government.
“So that means by-law enforcement, law enforcement, it means zoning, and land regulations, all of the things that fall onto a municipal government's plate,” Colin Basran, Mayor of Kelowna, said.
WATCH: B.C. government unveils how cannabis will be sold once legalized
In December, the federal government announced that it would be keeping 25 per cent of the upcoming tax revenue while the provinces would receive 75 per cent.
Now it's up to the provinces to decide if they want to share the wealth with the municipalities.
Selina Robinson is B.C.'s Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. She says the province and the Union of B.C. Municipalities have been in discussions since September.
“While we might have to negotiate on some things, I think we have enough respect for them and the work that they do, the leadership they have in their communities, that we can find our way through this and make sure it works for communities,” Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipalities and Housing said.
Basran says municipalities are standing together, insisting the province split half of its cannabis tax revenue with them.
WHAT if we've been wrong about Mr Cruel all along?
The man who terrorised Victorians in the 1980s with a series of violent, disturbing attacks - often on children - has never been caught. Australians have always assumed he was a local who went underground or died when the attacks stopped in 1991.
But there's another theory that amateur crime buffs think holds weight and that police on the other side of the world were forced to investigate.
Police in Victoria and San Francisco compared notes on the notorious Golden State Killer, who shared a remarkable connection that made some wonder whether he and Mr Cruel were the same person, The Australian reported.
Before Mr Cruel attacked four girls under the age of 13 in Melbourne's outer suburbs between 1987 and 1991, culminating in the unsolved murder of Karmein Chan, the Golden State Killer was doing exactly the same thing on America's west coast.
He murdered 12 people and raped 45 women in a series of depraved attacks during the 1970s and early 1980s. He left blood everywhere but covered his tracks and was never caught.
Then suddenly, in 1986, the attacks stopped and the killer disappeared. A year later, Mr Cruel arrived on the scene in Melbourne.
Sketches of the Golden State Killer, courtesy of Sacramento County Sheriff's Department.
Mr Cruel terrorised Victoria during the 1980s.
The two lived by the same criminal code. The Australian reports that they both took breaks to eat meals, were both armed with a knife and a gun, both pretended to have conversations with people who weren't there and both used expert knots to tie up their victims - and in Mr Cruel's case - to tie up parents while he attacked their children.
The links between the two killers didn't end there.
Both wore dark-coloured balaclavas and had long hair protruding from underneath - and because of that the police sketches are almost identical. Both crept into homes holding large knives and waited to be found. Both would be aged between 60-75 years old if still alive and both were pathologically meticulous.
Both also came under the microscope of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, despite the crimes occurring on different sides of the planet.
In 1991, following the disappearance of Karmein Chan, the FBI sent a letter to Victoria Police. It detailed steps they should take to catch Mr Cruel, what his interests were, how his relationships likely played out and why he attacked where and when he did.
The FBI noted that "the offender has an intense interest in children … will have his own homemade pornography [and] would typically live in a single-family residence, one with a garage or carport". The letter, dated April 24, 1991, stated that if the killer were in a relationship, "the partner would be aware of sexual dysfunctions".

It wasn't the last time Mr Cruel's file would land on the desk of law enforcement in the United States.
In 2016, following a renewed appeal for information into the unsolved murders committed by the so-called Golden State Killer, retired Los Angeles Sheriff's Department detective David Gates reached out.
He suggested the GSK closely resembled a man wanted for burglaries in the mid-1980s who police later discovered had moved to Australia. When contacted by The Australian, Mr Gates said "the fair-haired college kid" he had investigated was "just a nasty piece of work".
On the other side of the world, Victoria Police were also watching the serial killer in California, but ruled out any suggestion the two were the same person.
The Golden State Killer's story resurfaced recently thanks to a documentary entitled Unmasking a Killer. The five-part documentary series claims to "take viewers inside the investigation, the case files and the mind of the Golden State Killer - a man believed to be the most prolific uncaught rapist and serial killer in the nation".
The project, 10 years in the making, includes interviews with investigators and those who survived.
The Golden State Killer first struck in 1978 with the double murder of Brian and Katie Maggiore in Sacramento. A year later he broke into the home of Robert Offerman and his girlfriend Debra Manning, tied them both up and shot them.
Over the next six years he would kill three more couples and two single women. A number of the murders were in Goleta and Irvine, suggesting the killer returned to neighbourhoods he was familiar with.
The FBI suggested Mr Cruel did exactly the same thing. In their letter to Victorian Police, they said they believed the offender "may reside in the vicinity of the first assault".
"This is further strengthened by the fact that the offender has returned to that same general area in the fourth assault," the bureau said.
The fourth assault they referred to followed the abduction and assaults of three young girls. One is described only as "an 11-year-old girl" and the other two were Nicola Lynas and Sharon Wills.
On the fourth occasion, Mr Cruel took Karmein Chan, 13, from her home while she was babysitting her two sisters, aged 9 and 7. The teen was confronted with the masked intruder during an ad break while the three girls were watching a movie in Karmein's bedroom.
Mr Cruel grabbed the two younger girls and forced them into a cupboard before abducting Karmein.
Her body was found nearly a year later at a landfill site in Edgars Creek, not far from the Chan family home.

Yet Another Milestone
This month Car India celebrates its 12th anniversary. I would like to thank all our readers and manufacturers for their support for the past 12 years. I would also like to thank the team at Car India for pulling out all the stops to bring out this magazine. You will always see my picture or the author's photo who writes the story, but you will not see the photos of the unsung heroes — the photographers, designers, and the copy desk editor — and the marketing team that works very hard to generate the revenue and make it possible to bring out this magazine month after month.
Enjoy this 12th anniversary issue and always drive with caution
Moving to electric cars in India is a distant prospect as we don't have sufficient power supply for our domestic and industrial needs. Take into account the pollution created by power plants while generating electricity since most of them are coal or oil fired, and this gives rise to more pollution than a Bharat IV car does. It is very easy to make statements and look good saying we are going green. Because of the multiple lanes at CNG filling stations you have traffic jams on the roads of Delhi. The need of the hour is more CNG filling stations and then we can think about electric cars.
We have an exclusive drive story of the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class and the Tata Nexon, besides a number of interesting stories for you to enjoy in this mega issue.
Enjoy this 12th anniversary issue and always drive with caution. Thank you one and all once again for your support.

Bans on pit bulls and other large dogs have had little effect on serious dog bites, communities around the world have seen.
Breed-specific bans follow a familiar cycle: there is a well-publicized incident involving pit bulls, followed by a breed-specific ban which then does little to affect the overall number of serious dog bites.
The community concerned either does or doesn't repeal the ban, depending on local political dynamics.
After local elections last month, Montreal moved last week to relax a controversial ban on pit bulls.
READ MORE: Montreal moves to reform controversial pit bull-type breed ban
At the core of the debate is a question: Are pit bulls so uniquely dangerous that they should all be banned, or can any large dog be dangerous, given a malicious or unskilled owner?
Toronto dog bite data, to take one example, tends to support the second argument.
WATCH BELOW: Montreal's pit bull ban
Ontario brought in a province-wide law in 2005 aimed at removing pit bulls completely from the province over time. Existing dogs were to be spayed or neutered, and it became illegal to bring them into the province.
“Over time, it will mean fewer pit bull attacks and, overall, fewer attacks by dangerous dogs,” then-attorney general Michael Bryant told the Ontario legislature at the time.
READ MORE: Toronto's pit bulls are almost gone. So why are there more dog bites than ever?
Ontario's ban certainly led to the disappearance of pit bulls. What it didn't do, at least in Toronto, was reduced the number of serious dog bites. (Bite data in Ontario is only collected by municipalities.)
Graphic: As pit bulls disappeared, dog bites rose in Toronto
The Toronto Humane Society wrote in a 2013 paper that breed-specific bans seemed to have no effect on the overall number of serious dog bites.
The THS cited Calgary's system as a model to emulate. Calgary, which has seen a five-fold reduction in its dog bite rate over a 20-year period, focuses on training and accountability for dog owners, not on the breed of a particular dog. Calgary also puts resources into dog safety for the general public, especially children.
Communities elsewhere in the world have seen similar results.
The Irish Republic imposed special restrictions on 11 types of large dogs, including pit bulls, in 1999. By 2013, the number of people in the Republic hospitalized for dog bites had risen by 50 per cent.
In Sioux City, Iowa, which banned pit bulls in 2008, dog bites stayed at about the same level, even rising slightly. (As in Toronto, the law did reduce bites by pit bulls, however.)
The Netherlands passed and later abandoned a breed-specific ban. New legislation requires owners of certain breeds, including pit bulls, to take a course in dog training.

Policy roundtable on Public Health Professionals held
Staff Reporter
A policy roundtable on ‘Finalization of Recommendations for Public Health Professionals in Punjab' was held at Punjab Public Health Agency on Wednesday.
Fourth under the Health Policy Roundtable Series, the dialogue was organized to seek policy directions to strengthen public health as priority profession in Punjab.
In Punjab post-graduate public health programmes are being offered only by a handful of institutions and the output to-date has been largely contributed by the Institute of Public Health (IPH), Lahore, producing Masters' in public health, maternal and child health, and hospital management. IPH also offers MPhil, membership and fellowship programs in community medicine.
University of Health Sciences (UHS) Lahore through its affiliated public and private medical colleges offers postgraduate fellowships in community medicine. King Edward Medical University is further offering MPhil in community medicine, and MD and PhD in Public Health. PhD and MPhil in Public Health are being offered by Punjab University, which recently awarded the first ever PhD in Public Health. Although the course for undergraduate public health program has been approved by HEC, at present it is only being offered in Karachi and Peshawar.
Dr Shakeela Zaman, Head of Public Health Department at UHS informed everyone that UHS is launching new public health programs this fall, including an MSc in Epidemiology. She strongly recommended the establishment of a university for public health to steer the public health workforce agenda for Punjab. It was suggested that a sub-committee be constituted to present an operational framework for the same. Currently PMDC only recognizes doctors and dentists qualifying in PH Programs.
It was a heartbreaking discovery with a happy ending after whale watching guides found a bear cub hanging around a dead female bear, believed to be its mother.
Whale watcher John Forde spotted the lonely animal in Ross Pass on Saturday.
The cub was trying to nurse off of its dead mother before Forde and his wife Jennifer Steven jumped into action to rescue it.
They took the bear under their wing, providing it with water before transporting it to the North Island Wildlife Recovery Centre in Errington.
Forde told Global News the cub was in pretty rough shape, but has since been stabilized.
Forde, an outdoor enthusiast, runs a whale-watching company with his wife, allowing him to see several bears in the wild.
In a write-up on the Tofino Whale Centre's website, Steven describes how the rescue played out.
“John looked for the cub and it was hiding in a hole beneath him,” Steven wrote.
“He tried to pick it up but it was spooked and climbed a tree.”
The group tried multiple times to get the bear cub but the scared animal continued to climb a tree and hide.
Losing light, the group made the decision to come back in the morning.
“Within minutes we could see the cub moving and laying on its dead mother,” Steven said.
The cub hid when it saw them, Steven said, but eventually came out from a hole to once again lay on its mother, which is when they were able to pick it up and carry it back to the boat.
“It was screaming,” Steven wrote.
“My heart was breaking listening to its screams but I knew this was its only chance to survive. The cub was distressed and looked thirsty.”
Steven wonders how the mother bear died, given the absence of any visible signs of trauma or frothing at the mouth.
He said he's hopeful this is the only bear cub to be orphaned, adding he hasn't seen a high number of mother bears die this season.
Forde and Steven say they hope to adopt the cub and help pay for her expenses while she's being cared for at the recovery centre.

The leaders of the BC NDP and Green Party say their alliance is strong regardless of what the Liberal party chooses to do with the Speaker should it be defeated in a confidence vote.
“Our message today is quite clear and categorical,” NDP Leader John Horgan said.
“We are prepared to work together for British Columbians. Christy Clark is prepared to hang on as long as possible.”
Horgan said it seems Clark also wants to sow the seeds of discontent between him and Green Leader Andrew Weaver but said it's not working.
“The Speaker will be elected on [June] 22nd and what happens after that I will deal with. I can't predict what that Speaker will do in the future.”
READ MORE: Saga over B.C. House Speaker continues
Horgan said there may be challenges but they will work hard to make the alliance work.
Meanwhile, Weaver said Clark is playing games by insinuating the Liberals would only keep a Speaker as long as they are in power.
“The Speaker is there for a four-year term. The premier is afraid to let go and she is distracting and creating mischief and noise.”
Both say regardless of what the Liberals do they are going to work hard to ensure the alliance and government work, but they will not say how they will handle the issue of Speaker until it comes up in the house.
But Senior Liberal Cabinet Minister Andrew Wilkinson said it's a complex situation.
“We had a situation where the count and recount in Courtenay-Comox took until May 24 to come up with the results, so that accounts for the first 15 days of the elapsed time.”
Wilkinson said also at play in B.C. is the fine line between the Liberals, NDP and Greens, and waiting to see how that would play out.

Three children were removed from a home and four adults were arrested after police raided a suspected drug house Thursday afternoon and said they found large quantities of heroin and marijuana.
Upon entering the home at 200 W. Main St. about 4 p.m., police found the two targets of their investigation: Tarrell T. Humphrey, 33, and Daurron Jamison, 22.
A search of Humphrey turned up 60 bags of “PANTHER” brand heroin, the same type the confidential informant bought from both men during the lead up to the raid, police said.
In the upstairs master bedroom, which belongs to Walter Daymon Humphrey, 43, and Sadiqa Imanihamd Caines, 41, police found a large amount of marijuana, drug packaging materials, cash and a digital scale, according to police.

It's impossible to predict how long consumers around the globe will cling to using plastic cards for payments, but not uncommon to hear predictions of the product's demise.
Entrust Datacard, which serves both sides of the physical and digital payments spectrum, sees the categories' fates as intertwined. The more momentum digital and mobile wallets have, the more opportunity they create for their plastic counterparts.
"Cards are here to stay, that's all we say about it," said Alyssa Arredondo, director of financial vertical marketing at Entrust Datacard.
Alyssa Arredondo, director of financial vertical marketing at Entrust Datacard.
It's an important mantra for Entrust Datacard, which is four years into identification card manufacturer Datacard Group's acquisition of digital identity and information provider Entrust. The deal was designed to bolster identity-based security solutions for mobile, but Datacard's core business of instant card issuing and transaction security plays a key role.
An ongoing trend of mobile channels also offering a plastic card as a payment option, such as the recently announced Venmo card, gives Entrust Datacard more reason to believe its core business with cards has a healthy future.
"It's interesting as to what types of vehicles are going to the card business," Arredondo said. "Many P2P apps, such as Venmo, mPesa, Square Cash and PayPal, all issue cards."
Another example is cryptocurrency cards, she added. "Everyone is mining cryptocurrency, but what value is it if you can't actually spend it to buy what you need?"
Cryptocurrency companies have been partnering with Visa to produce credit and debit cards on which bitcoin can be converted to a local currency and loaded, but Visa also shut down many bitcoin wallets this year after it determined issuer WaveCrest was not following Visa rules.
As the use of cards to complement mobile or crypto channels continues to shake out, Entrust Datacard points to other trends that indicate the physical card world is indeed bullish.
When speaking to the Entrust Datacard sales staff or making a presentation to card networks and other providers, Arredondo makes the point that the compound annual growth rate of cards shipped globally is a positive 3.3%, with debit cards and dual-interface cards driving that growth.
Entrust Datacard also predicts that contactless cards will become more popular than paying with mobile devices at the point of sale, because they are faster and easier to use. Part of that rests with the growing number of city transit networks turning to contactless cards as a key payment tool, while also introducing mobile ticketing apps.
In the mobile realm, the growth of QR codes, especially in China and India, will fuel growth in cards because the main goal is merchants seeking ways to accept non-cash payments, Arredondo said.
Online-only financial companies such as Transferwise, Kabbage and Hyperwallet (recently acquired by PayPal) also offer payment cards.
But a key aspect of the physical card doesn't get mentioned as often as how mobile and other digital technology will interact with it in the coming years.
"The card remains an important showcase for the bank and the card network," Arredondo said. "It's a brand tool and a marketing tool."
Because of this, many issuers have begun issuing metal cards or cards with colored cores to make their products stand out more prominently in a customer's wallet.
"Nothing can replace the 'clink' of putting that metal card down on the table to pay for a business dinner, or a consumer taking out a card and placing it on a counter at the POS," Arredondo added. "That would all be lost if it is digital and loaded onto a phone."

Almost 41 sites for the establishment of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) have been identified. This act has been made in consultation with the provincial and federal governments. According to the Board of Investment (BoI), seven other sites for the SEZs have already been approved and notified by the BoI. Moreover, no different incentives have been offered to foreign investors than the local investors for making investment in these or other SEZs under the CPEC.
Additional Secretary, Board of Investment (BOI), Tuesday, gave a detailed briefing to The National Assembly Standing Committee on Planning, Development and Reform on the Development and Management of Industrial Park under CPEC-Incentives given to local & foreigner investors in Special Economic Zones.
While giving briefing on the incentives given to local & foreign investors in this Special Economic Zones Additional Secretary informed the committee that there was no difference between incentives given to local & foreign investors in these zones.
The incentives offered include one-time exemption from duty and taxes on import of plant and machinery for developers and enterprises. 5-years tax holiday on income accruable in relation to the development and operation of the SEZ for the developer. 10 years' tax holiday for enterprises on income accruable in relation to the production / operations started by 30.06.2020 and thereafter 5 years' tax holiday for enterprises would be admissible.
After detailed briefing by the BOI, the committee recommended establishment of vocational and technical training centers in the Special Economic Zones for imparting technical training to the local workers in order to make them able to get jobs in the industries. The Committee was also briefed by the Additional Secretary, Ministry of Water & Power on the terms and conditions of financing of CPEC Energy Projects and tariff structure as well. The Committee urged the concerned quarters to take special care of the environmental implications whenever initiating any Energy Projects under the CPEC.
Moreover, committee also constituted a four member subcommittee under the convenership of Ch. Jaffar Iqbal to look into the the matter of unnecessary delay in completion of Northern Bypass Peshawar and the issue of Water Distribution Network for Rawalpindi Cantonment Board/Chaklala Cantonment Board (CCB) based on Khanpur Dam water source (phase-III), Rawalpindi.
“Waiheke needs the double-deckers like the dolphins need the jet skis”, says this week's bumper sticker on the island. It comes with a few variations and the concept is easy to expand on in idle moments. “Waiheke needs the double-deckers like polar bears need Trump” for example. Or “Waiheke needs the double-deckers like whales need Exxon”.
By now, the whole planet is catching on to the obvious truth that the 1980s concept of growth at all costs is overstated to the point of being plain wrong. And that GDP does not deliver a measure of anything, least of all social equity, fairness of distribution or measurable improvement in the pressing matters of real life – housing, poverty, jobs and a liveable and educated society.
The focus should be on prosperity and opportunity, not growth per se.
– Economist Shamubeel Eaqub
“Even in fiscal management, performance should be judged for the quality of decisions and how they align with our values, not merely aggregates of deficits and surpluses, or debt,” commentator and former principal economist at the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research, Shamubeel Eaqub said this week. He was critiquing Prime Minister Bill English's Key-esque summary of government policy as ‘growth'.
“The role of government is not to manage the economic and fiscal cycle. Government should be in the business of making long term investments, not spending, on social and physical capital.
“The focus should be on prosperity and opportunity, not growth per se,” said Eaqub.
After this (meteorologically disappointing) summer on Waiheke, the fallacies of “growth” are equally and vividly obvious.
Long before summer came, it was plain that city-side advertising for the island was going to create logistical problems over the holiday season.
Nose-to-tail cars on our arterial road to the shambolic ferries have highlighted the inappropriateness of two-storey buses domineering the grossly overcrowded Matiatia ‘keyhole' and lumbering around the island as if it is a theme park, tacky signwriting and all.
The supermarket's ill-considered traffic flows may have been the least of our problems. Getting out of any side road is now a matter of strategy and frustration.
One, if not the only, reason Waiheke has remained such a delightful destination is that it has carefully managed this sort of crass opportunism over decades.
One of the underlying generalisations of our now functionally obsolete and polarized political vocabulary is, as someone pointed out to me a few years ago, that the Left is right at all costs (and thereby easily wronged, but still holding the high moral ground). Those on the Right, by comparison, win at all costs.
Predictably, at the more extreme ends of capitalism through which we are passing, it hasn't gone well for the Left.
Proved right – and wronged again – American Democrats are being lumbered with blame for the rise and rise of Trump's demagogic rampage across the rust-belts.
Even though a few minutes of consideration would indicate that the GOP itself was, at the very least, materially negligent to endorse a candidate without so much as a check of his missing tax records. It also held its electoral college members to endorse (yet again) a candidate despite glaring holes in common decency that would have seen any previous president impeached with howls of derision.
Howzat for a win at any cost?
The Free World under US leadership gave us McCarthyism, more dictators in South America than you can shake a stick at and the Middle East in flames. Now civilization has to survive a president who almost certainly tweets his many displeasures from the john.
In this war, truth is the first casualty and damage to the moderating forces of the judiciary and surviving media is already hydra-headed.
However, the ground is unlikely to stay steady under anyone's feet as a vocal pushback also emerges – from the remaining neutral checks and balances, enlightened business and angry populaces. The drums of women marching up Queen Street in rejection of the mysogenist rantings of the soon-to-be-inaugurated president were repeated round the world.
Everything is ripe for a rethink, which is, in a way, a relief.
Locally or globally – and in the midst of paradise – it's been no fun to see us all being frogmarched towards a dystopia of impenetrable global financial hegemony and its unattractive beneficiaries.
Saskatoon police say the city's third homicide of 2017 occurred after Tyler Applegate, 27, confronted a man urinating on his fence.
Officers were initially called to a shooting in the 2300-block of 33rd Street West just before 10 a.m. CT on July 22, 2017.

ISLAMABAD - Opposition lawmakers are set to raise in the upcoming sitting of the National Assembly the issue of alleged attacks on media persons during the coverage of the rally of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.
The National Assembly session will be held on Thursday (17th August).
The PPP, the major opposition party, has asked the State Minister for Information to take notice of the repeated attacks on media persons covering the GT Road rally. PPP MNAs, in this regard, have submitted a call-attention notice in the National Assembly Secretariat condemning the incident.
“It is a serious matter which warrants prompt response from the minister on the floor of the House,” said Shahida Rehmani, Imran Zafar, Shazia Mari, Dr Nafisa Shah, Mir Aijaz Jakhrani, Ayaz Soomro, and Dr Shazia Soomro in their call-attention notice submitted under Rule 88 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in National Assembly 2007.
(Reuters) - Kuwaiti authorities on Saturday were working on containing and cleaning up a crude oil spill in the country's southern waters in the Gulf, Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) said in a statement.
KPC did not give the magnitude of the spill nor its cause but said different services were investigating the incident.
"Emergency oil teams are still working to put an oil spill near Kuwait's southern Ras al-Zour area under control," the statement said, citing Seikh Talal al-Khaled al-Sabah, Kuwait's oil sector spokesman.
"Nearby beaches will be cleaned once power and water plants are secured and the oil spill is put under full control," it added.
Ras al-Zour is where Kuwait National Petroleum Company (KNPC) is building the Middle East's largest oil refinery with a capacity of 615,000 per day and $11.5 billion worth of contracts.
On Friday, Kuwait's Environment Public Authority (EPA) said it was taking all appropriate measures in order to protect water outlets from the oil spill.
Jaimie-Lee Ball was admitted to the emergency room at Brampton Civic Hospital for internal bleeding and says she spent five days being bounced around, including staying on a stretcher in a hallway. Lama Nicolas reports.
PESHAWAR - Patients from far-flung areas suffered at Hayatabad Medical Complex Peshawar as young doctors continued their strike against police baton-charged protesting doctors on Wednesday.
The protesting doctors allegedly forced patients to get out of the hospital after boycotting from their duty while the police resorted to baton-charge when the doctors started disturbing the patients and internal environment of the hospital.
They (doctors) when reached the hospital started locking rooms of the hospital and warned the patients to get out of the hospital as there will be no service in the OPD and wards.
The situation abruptly deteriorated in the hospital when doctors forced the patients to quit the newly established OPD service.
The heavy contingent of the police deployed in the hospital crackdown against the protesting doctors and used teargas and baton charge against the doctors resulted injuring of 13 doctors. Three more doctors were arrested by the police from the hospital after a scuffle broke out with the police.
Talking to The Nation, Noorud Din, an attendant with a patient, said that they came from Shangla for the treatment of his brother, but due to the doctors protest they could not be availed the treatment facilities in the hospital.
He said that they spend Rs14, 000 on a rent car service to shift their patients from Shangla to Peshawar, but unfortunately the doctors are not cooperating with the patient.
Din further said that there was no facility available at the District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital Shangla where they could visit their patient.
He blamed Amir Muqam and Neghat Orakzi for igniting the doctors on the protest.
On the other hand, Young Doctors Association (YDA) Patron-in-Chief Dr Alamgir said that at least 13 doctors have been injured in the police baton-charge and their boycott would continue in all three major hospitals of the city.
He said that there was a complete boycott of OPD and emergency services in Hayatabad Medical Complex Peshawar.
He said that the hunger-strike camp of the doctor was also underway near the KP Assembly building and they would not end their strike until the government fulfills their demands.
The doctors' protest was started when they demanded compensation for three doctors who were killed in three separate incidents.
The deceased doctors, identified as Dr Murtaza and Dr Faisal, were killed in a gas leakage incident while another Dr Dawood was killed due to the firing of some unidentified persons.
The doctors also demanded the restoration of the old status of the Post Graduate Medical Institute Peshawar (PGMI) and introducing a uniform policy on health professional allowance.
They also demanded the restoration of the transferred doctors and enactment of laws for doctors' security.
It is pertinent to mention here that the government has recently increased the allowance and salaries of the doctors in all hospitals of the province and now Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa is on the top list in terms of salaries and allowances.
Due to the doctors' boycott, the patient care facilities in the tertiary care hospitals are badly suffering as patients came from the far-flung areas are still without a proper treatment to avail medical facilities. They (patients) are waiting for the doctors for the last two days in the hospital wards.

CURCHOREM: Out of the 499 bars and 10 wholesale liquor shops in Quepem taluka, 143 bars and a wholesale liquor shop face closure owing to the Supreme Court order on closure of bars within 500 metres of national and state highways.
Revealing this information, Excise inspector of Quepem Aleixo Andrade said that the order will be implemented and licences of bars and wholesaler liquor shops within 500 metres of the highways will not be renewed after March 31.
Anup Naik, owner of Loja Raghoba said, “Our bar is running from the time of Portuguese rule in Goa. It is the only source of income of our family. Many such bars are also running in Curchorem market. It will be unfair to close down the bars and the government should come out with a reasonable solution to the problem.”
One Devendra Vast who runs a bar on rent which is his only source of livelihood after the mining ban said, “I sold one out of two trucks at a cheap rate. If the bar is closed down, I do not know how I and my family will survive. The government should come out with an alternative and save us.”
Suhas Sanvordekar, owner of Santosh Bar said, “The government has to find out some solution to the problem. It is bound to implement the order of Supreme Court. But, it should give us alternate source of livelihood.”
Owner of a retail liquor shop in Curchorem informed that the entire Curchorem market will be affected if the bar licences are not renewed adding, “Bars near the state highways should be spared.”
Owner of Swiss Wine Store Domnic Silva said the bar owners will take a decision on future course of action at a meeting of All Goa Liquor Sellers Association slated to be held this week adding, “But the government should not force us to come on to the roads and should find an appropriate solution to the problem as Goa is a very small state and the majority of bars will have to be closed down if the Supreme Court order is implemented. The order should be implemented only in case of bars near national highways.”

MASON — Two days before graduation and commencement ceremonies, a reported threat canceled classes on Wednesday at Wahama Junior/Senior High School.
According to reports from Superintendent Jack Cullen and Lt. Jeff Fields of the Mason County Sheriff's Department, prior to school starting on Wednesday, a written threat was discovered by a custodian inside the building. Fields and Principal Kenny Bond were alerted to the discovery and, after consulting with Cullen, the decision was made to return buses to the school and dismiss students by 8:30 a.m., followed by staff.
Fields, who is also the school's resource officer, said he is conducting an investigation into the matter, along with conducting interviews, to determine the credibility of the reported threat. As of Wednesday afternoon, Fields said no one had been charged in the incident. Cullen said if the investigation results in a charge, it would likely be a felony.
Both Fields and Cullen said that every threat has to be taken seriously.
“There's been 23 shootings on school campuses in 2018…we don't want to be the next one,” Cullen said about the decision to err on the side of caution when sending students and staff home to evaluate a reported threat.
Cullen added, in addition to the sheriff's department, law enforcement personnel with the West Virginia State Police and Mason Police Department, as well as personnel with Mason County 911 were at the school Wednesday and swept the building, determining it was safe. After this sweep and consulting with law enforcement which will have an added presence in the building until the last day of school on June 11, classes will resume on Thursday (today) on a normal schedule, Cullen said.
Additional law enforcement will also be present during Wahama's graduation ceremony on Friday evening at the school.
No other schools were dismissed on Wednesday though other area schools were alerted of the situation and urged to be even more alert, in addition to following security measures already in place, Cullen said.
Wahama seniors are not in class this week, with their final day as students being last Friday.

After the inauguration of healthcare projects in DHQ Hospital Rajanpur, the Punjab Chief Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif went to Bahawalpur and inaugurated development projects completed with a cost of Rs. 6 billion. He inaugurated drug testing lab and inspected its various sections. Talking on the occasion, he said that drug testing labs will ensure provision of quality medicines adding that genuine medicines will be available in private and public sector hospitals. Those who are engaged with the business of spurious drugs are an enemy of the humanity and no one will be allowed to play with the lives of the people through fake and sub-standards medicines, he added.
He also inaugurated e-khidmat centre and said that services of different government departments are arranged under one roof in this centre. Provision of this facility will help to improve the standard of service delivery mechanism. The government has fulfilled the promise of facilitating the people at their doorsteps by establishing such centers, he added. The chief Minister asked the people about the quality of different facilities in e-khidmat centre besides enquiring the staff about process and time spent on the provision of services.
Afterwards, the Chief Minister inaugurated ICU, cardiology centre, kidney and regional blood centres in Bahawal Victoria Hospital. He also inspected different sections of the hospital and went to the wards where Shehbaz Sharif inquired after the health of the patients and prayed for their early recovery. Talking on the occasion, he said that inauguration of new sections is a welcome step and added that hospital will be further developed. He said that best machines have been procured and world-class operation theatre, along with quality treatment facility for the cardiac patients, has been arranged. It is sanguine that doctors have already conducted first cardiac operation here, he added.
Talking to the media, he said that development and prosperity of southern Punjab is very dear to him and special attention has been given for its progress. Similarly, solid steps have been taken for the development of agriculture sector along with grant of huge subsidy on fertilizers. It is for the first time that small farmers have been given interest-free loans. If an opportunity of public service is accorded by the voters in future, more mega health projects will be initiated for Bahawalpur, he said.
The Chief Minister also inaugurated university of veterinary and animal sciences which has been established with a cost of Rs. 2.94 billion. More than 1500 students have been given admissions in this university and it is hoped that local livestock sector will be the direct beneficiary of this new initiative. The purpose of this university, spanning over 1000 acres, is to promote livestock sector on modern lines, he added.
The Chief Minister inaugurated child protection & welfare bureau in Bahawalpur which has been established with a cost of Rs. 17.78 crore. Separate hostels have been constructed for girls and boys.
A bribery settlement and a crash in the pound have pushed engineering giant Rolls-Royce to a record loss. The jet engine maker reported a loss before tax of £4.6bn for 2016.
However, once one-off costs have been stripped out, the company's underlying profit was better than many experts had predicted.
Rolls-Royce agreed to pay £671m to settle corruption cases with UK and US authorities and it has written off £4.4bn from currency related contracts.
Like many international businesses, Rolls-Royce usually “hedges” its bets to protect itself from fluctuating currency markets.
Most international aerospace contracts are priced in dollars, but, as a UK company, much of Rolls-Royce's costs are in pounds.
Underlying profits, which ignore these factors, fell to £813m, down from £1.4bn the previous year, although the fall was much less than many analysts had forecast.
Rolls-Royce, which has been a completely separate company to the car-maker since 1971, said the outlook for this year was for a “modest performance improvement”, while chief executive Warren East said more needed to be done to improve profit margins.
Rolls-Royce has apologised “unreservedly” for the corruption cases, which spanned 25 years, and involved illegally using local middlemen and paying bribes to win deals in Indonesia, Thailand, China and Russia.
If the next elections are held without major electoral reforms, it will be as futile an exercise as the ten elections held after the 1970 free and fair election.
The 1973 constitution has failed to deliver an honest ballot.
Institutional domains are defined in the constitution for the will of the people to prevail.
Elections have to be held within 90 days of dissolution of the National Assembly.
ECP (Election Commission of Pakistan) is responsible for conducting the electoral exercise in an impartial manner.
As it is a nationwide exercise it has to draw staff from Provincial Governments for meeting the logistic requirements of the Election Day.
The local bureaucracy is usually influenced by the politicians, which results in vote tempering.
Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) is appointed jointly by the leader of the house and opposition.
He overseas the entire electoral process.
After signing the Charter of Democracy the two main political parties (PML-N, PPP) have softened their rivalry to maintain the status-quo as it suits them, which means Punjab for PML-N and Sindh for PPP while sharing power at the federal level.
The Khakis are called in for security purposes only as they have no constitutional role in the conduct of elections.
Judiciary steps in to oversee the performance of the Election Tribunals.
Constitutionally the bureaucracy is required to be neutral, which they are not.
The legislature represents the will of the people and should act as the custodian of the constitution to ensure its implementation.
The first election under the unanimous 1973 constitution took place in 1977.
ZAB was a clear favourite.
Overnight an opposition alliance emerged (Pakistan Nation Alliance), the establishment had cornered the Quaid-e-Awam both from inside and out.
Electables managed to get PPP tickets and were involved in their usual tricks, which provided an opportunity to the opposition to launch a movement.
Keeping ZAB's popularity in mind the party comrades advised immediate re-election while the electables opposed it.
There was a constitutional impasse.
The office of the Prime Minister (PM) could not be kept vacant.
In cases of his resignation the senior most minister was mandated to take over which was not acceptable to the opposition.
The legendary Shaukat Hayat Khan tried for an in house change to save the system but failed.
Finally Zia-ul-Haq took over and destroyed all democratic gains, he even disfigured the constitution.
In order to avoid the 1977 type impasse, the 8th amendment was introduced under which the PM could be dismissed by the President and elections held within ninety days under a neutral care taker set up.
Between 1988 and 1997 five governments were dismissed making a mockery of democracy.
This evil amendment was done away with first by Nawaz Sharif in 1977 and then again by Zardari in his last stint in power.
His was the first government to complete its term (2008 – 2013) followed by a smooth transition of power.
Unfortunately the will of the people has prevailed only once in 1970.
The 1973 constitution is a gift of this truly elected assembly of able legislators who served the nation.
Without a credible ballot there can be no democracy.
The leadership that emerges after farce elections are in front of us.
Zia-ul-Haq used the term ‘positive results' which meant rule of ‘rogues' and ‘thugs' elected through manipulated electoral processes.
Musharraf continued with the same approach.
After the enactment of the 1973 constitution, there have been two Khaki takeovers (1977, 1999).
Both these supra constitutional shocks were deadly for the nation.
Zia promised to hold elections within ninety days which never took place till he was blown up mid-year, probably due to his misdeeds eleven years and two months later.
Musharraf wanted to cleanse the system with his seven point agenda.
In the end he brought back all the ‘rogues' through his ill-advised National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO).
Both Zia and Musharraf were disasters for the nation.
Their political tailcoats continue to dominate and haunt the political arena of this deprived nation.
For Pakistan to move forward the will of the people has to prevail in which no institution of the state seems interested.
Khakis, Qazis, Baboos and Legislators cross constitutional limits when it suits their institutional interests but not for the nation.
Pakistan desperately needs another free and fair election to reset its course as a nation.
The constitution has defined the electoral process, which has been negated ten times with no corrective measures.
The Nasir-ul-Malk lead Judicial Commission pointed out serious irregularities in the conduct of 2013 electoral exercise yet not one of them has been corrected.
The Speaker of the house managed to get re-elected through the same twisted process.
Minister of Railways got relief from the Supreme Courts while Minister of Defence relied on NADRA.
Only the Lodhran seat was conceded by the ruling party.
The constitutional impasse in conducting a free and fair election has to be removed.
There should be a suo-moto notice for the implementation of the Nasir-ul-Mulk Commission report.
This approach of you rub my back and I will rub yours will get us nowhere.
It is time to wake up.
I believe in the democratic system which should not be derailed.
The constitution must be followed in letter and spirit.
In the original version the PM was allowed only two terms in office which has to be enforced in spirit of the sacred document.
Legislators who get elected through manipulated ballots will never favour a credible electoral exercise.
In the past the Khakis, Qazis and the Baboos have teamed up to propel third rate political leadership.
It is time for them to devise a constitutional mechanism to ensure rule of the ballot.
Pakistan was created through the ballot, and only it can sustain it.
Those who threaten the power of the people must learn to respect and live with it.

Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated islands in the Caribbean last September. Six months later, how are they recovering? To find out, writers for Travel spent time in Vieques, St. Martin, St. John, Dominica (below).
The hike to Middleham Falls took precisely 45 minutes, just as my guide, Dylan Williams, had predicted. In that time, Dylan, his girlfriend, Miriam Ormond, and I had marched a mile and a quarter up and down (and up and down) the hills of Dominica's Morne Trois Pitons National Park, starting on a well-cleared trail through rainforest brush — tree ferns, rubber trees, shaggy epiphytes — and finishing with moderate scrambles over damp rock and down slippery wooden stairs. But finally, we stood on a sturdy platform gazing at the island's highest waterfall as it thundered 200 or so feet down into a broad, inviting pool.
Between us and the pool, however, stood a field of water-slicked boulders. Suddenly, I felt every drop of my trekking confidence evaporate. I wanted nothing more than to bound over the rocks, as dreadlocked Dylan was doing in Converse low-tops, and dip my feet in the pristine water, but those feet, I was now irrationally sure, would fail me, and I'd slip, fall, dash my brains out below. Nature, until a moment ago so lovely and generous, had turned threatening and dark. Who was I to risk her wrath?

(Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur must replicate the form they displayed to outclass Manchester United in midweek if they are to get past an in-form Liverpool at Anfield in the Premier League on Sunday, striker Harry Kane said.
Tottenham produced a dominant display to beat United 2-0 at Wembley on Wednesday, scoring through midfielder Christian Eriksen on 11 seconds before United defender Phil Jones turned Kieran Trippier's cross into his own net on the hour mark.
Kane said the fifth-placed London club cannot let their guard down against Liverpool, after suffering a 2-0 defeat in the corresponding fixture last season.
“We have got to put in the same performance as we did against United,” Tottenham's top scorer Kane said.
”Liverpool are a strong team, especially at home when they are on the attack. They have some fast players and last season we didn't cope with that very well.
“We were poor throughout the whole team, but we can take confidence from the United game. This is the kind of performance we need to produce against the big teams both at home and away.”
Tottenham beat Juergen Klopp's side 4-1 when the two teams met earlier this season but third-placed Liverpool are a tougher prospect at home, where they are unbeaten in 14 league matches.
“We played well against Liverpool at Wembley so we have to go to Anfield full of confidence,” Kane added.
Midfielder Lucas Moura, Tottenham's new signing from French club Paris St Germain, watched on as the London club beat United and Kane said he was looking forward to seeing what the Brazilian brings to the table.
“Hopefully he can fit right in and when he gets an opportunity, he takes it,” Kane said. “There is no rush and it will keep everyone on their toes. He's done some amazing stuff for PSG so we are excited to see what can happen.”
Until his recent death, he was one of the most respected character actors in Hollywood. Now, the longtime assistant to Harry Dean Stanton is in Edmonton with what has turned out to be Stanton's final project. Todd James reports.

This week, the Supreme Court heard arguments in Gill v. Whitford, a case in which they will decide whether Wisconsin Republicans' redistricting plan is unconstitutional. Until now, the Court has hesitated to strike down partisan gerrymandering, primarily because there is no objective way of measuring the extent to which it has taken place or deciding how much is too much.
In considering the case, the Court will rely heavily upon the “efficiency gap,” a mathematical exercise based on how many votes each party “wastes.” The theory goes like this: The goal of gerrymandering is to win as many districts as possible with the voters your party has, and this is done by dividing those voters into districts where they are a majority but not a very big one — 51 percent of the vote wins an election just as much as 80 percent does, so those “extra” voters will do more good for the party elsewhere. And when an area is so dominated by the other party's voters that there's no way to win it, gerrymandering entails packing as many of the other party's voters as possible into that district to reduce their sway elsewhere. Thus votes are “wasted” when they are cast for a losing candidate, and when they are above and beyond what a winning candidate needed to win. The “efficiency gap” measures the partisan disparity in wasted votes — and in Wisconsin there is an efficiency gap that favors Republicans.
That might seem to be the objective standard that the Court has pined for in the past. But the efficiency gap is a deeply partisan model. As Guy Harrison and Jason Torchinsky have explained, it fails to take account of numerous factors, including that Democratic voters tend to cluster in big cities, which necessarily affects how they are spread out (or not) among districts. As a result, the Republican-drawn Wisconsin districts, which have relatively normal-looking and fair boundaries, appear unreasonably partisan through the lens of the efficiency gap, while clearly politicized Democrat-drawn districts look appropriate.
Republicans often take a larger share of blame for gerrymandering than their Democratic counterparts, and since Gill broke into the national media, that hasn't slowed down; indeed, the case has been called an attempt to solve the problem of “Republican” gerrymandering. But courts and journalists don't often use the efficiency-gap measure to illustrate the phenomenon. Instead, they rely on its more obvious manifestation: a bizarre shape, drawn without regard to traditional redistricting criteria in an attempt to include or exclude certain voters. And this isn't just because such districts make for amusing visualizations.
To cite an amicus curiae brief in Gill, “traditional criteria include promoting compactness of districts, ensuring their physical contiguity, following natural boundaries, preserving the integrity of political subdivisions, and protecting communities of interest.” In fact, the traditional-shape standard is where the word “gerrymander” originates: It's a portmanteau of Massachusetts governor Elbridge Gerry's name and his salamander-shaped district. Calling a regularly shaped district a gerrymander is therefore incorrect by definition.
Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of gerrymandering is that by this measure, the widely accepted one, Democrats are probably more at fault than Republicans in the war they say they're trying to win. Simply put, Democrats stand to gain far more from redrawing districts on weirdly shaped political lines than Republicans do.
Geography factors a great deal into why one party tends to win more congressional elections; as mentioned above, Democratic voters are packed densely into large cities, while Republicans are spread throughout the country more evenly. This “unintentional gerrymandering” leads to a national average bias of five points nationwide for the GOP. So while Gill may make politically motivated redistricting seem like a Republican problem, some of the most dramatic gerrymanders are actually the fault of Democrats, attempting to maximize their power in heavily blue states or hold on to seats when they swing toward the right.
California is one of the most gerrymandered states.
California is a good example. Today it is one of the most gerrymandered states, owing to redistricting after the 1980 census by Democrats led by then- and now-governor Jerry Brown. Fearing the loss of many seats due to Reagan's landslide victory, they proposed a plan that would keep five Democratic seats safe; Congressman Phillip Burton, the districts' architect, called the map “my contribution to modern art.” Despite a challenge by the state's Republicans to overthrow the redrawing for the upcoming election, the California supreme court ruled that it was impractical to attempt to redraw the districts again. That year, Republicans won the gubernatorial race and defeated Brown to flip a U.S. Senate seat, but Democrats won 60 percent of the House seats with only 49 percent of votes. Hours before he left office, Brown signed the controversial redistricting legislation into law.
Many district lines in Illinois — and particularly the Chicago area — have been drawn to minimize Republican influence, hold Democratic seats in the House, or protect or appeal to a particular class or race. One of the most notoriously preposterous lines is that of Illinois's fourth.
Called “the earmuffs,” the district was drawn by Democratic mayor Richard M. Daley in the early 1990s to achieve what he called a “Latino district.” The fourth wraps around the seventh district to include a large percentage of Puerto Rican voters in the northern part and Mexican-American voters in the southern part. The only geographical connection between them is a small section of Interstate 294. The district is 72 percent Hispanic, and since Daley redrew it for the 1992 election, incumbent Luis Gutiérrez has won each subsequent election by more than 75 percent of the vote.
But perhaps the most notorious gerrymandering is that of Maryland, whose third district has been described as a “broken-winged pterodactyl, lying prostrate across the center of the state.”
Of all the gerrymanders, this is probably the most bizarre. And it is the Democrats dominating Maryland's assembly who ensure the state stays carved up to keep Republicans in the minority. In fact, only one Republican, Andy Harris, represents Maryland in the House. His district, the first, is massive, and encompasses more than a third of Maryland's total area.
The fight over Florida's third and fifth districts, meanwhile, reveals a cynical racial aspect to gerrymandering, one in which Republicans happily agree to the creation of “black districts” because they pack Democratic voters together. In 1992, Corrine Brown became the first African American to win a congressional election in Florida since Reconstruction by winning the third district — which she'd played a role in drawing. As a member of the state house, she'd participated in a lawsuit urging the creation of majority-minority districts after the 1990 census.
Brown continued to fight for her district in 2012, protesting when the Supreme Court struck it down as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander (a topic it's proven less squeamish about than partisan gerrymandering). She argued that this and subsequent challenges were unfair to black voters, even calling attempts to redraw the district a “giant step backward to our state's Jim Crow days.” When the district was eventually redrawn, Brown was redistricted to Florida's fifth, and Ted Yoho, a Republican, won the third.
Speaking of the fifth, it now stretches 200 miles from the poorest parts of Jacksonville, along the state's northern border, and finally to include the poorest parts of Tallahassee. Brown won it by 50 points in the 2012 election.
Of course, Democrats aren't the only ones who carve up state strongholds to increase power. Texas is a good example, especially as evidenced by the state's 15th district. Drawn by Republicans, its representative is Democrat Vicente González, and the U.S. House considers Gonzalez to represent McAllen, Texas, a border town near Texas's southern tip. But while the district begins in McAllen, it stretches over 250 miles north, ending just south of San Marcos, Texas, which is outside San Antonio.
The district is 2.4 percent white, 2.1 percent black, and 80.6 percent Hispanic. Since its creation in 1920, it has voted for the Democrat in every election. The closest election in the district's history was in 2014, when Rubén Hinojosa won by 11 percentage points. And in August, a federal court forced Republicans in Texas to redraw two other districts for the 2018 elections, the 27th and the 35th, to eliminate race-based bias in line drawing.
But in most other Republican states, this kind of redrawing isn't necessary. Most states in the South and those west of the Mississippi River look relatively normal, although low population in the plains and Western states does make the process simpler than in states like Illinois.
Gill is a foolish case, because it uses a simple measure to judge a complex problem. But even if Gill succeeds and the Wisconsin GOP is forced to re-draw its lines, Democrats will win only a political victory. If they want to fix the so-called ideological problem of gerrymandering, the battle begins in Democratic strongholds.

Leader of the House, Kondwani Nankhumwa said this on Sunday saying that the Cabinet finalised the scrutiny of the proposed laws on Friday last week.
Nankhumwa, who is also Minister of Local Government and Rural Development denied rumours that the decision followed the pressure by the Public Affairs Committee (PAC).
“We are circulating the 50-plus-one Bill and the remaining Bills on Monday. However this is not because of the PAC or public pressure,” said Nankhumwa.
Minister of Justice Samuel Tembenu earlier told some reporters that the executive will not bring the bill to the Parliament as it is still under scrutiny.
He said as government, they will not work under PAC pressure and that they are not afraid of their plan to hold demonstration as that is part of exercising their constitutional rights.
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has been against the bill and it is alleged to have bought number of legislatures from opposition side to vote against it.
Leader of opposition Lazarus Chakwera reaffirmed his party's commitment to have the proposed electoral reforms bill deliberated upon and passed during the current sitting of Parliament.
He said the proposed bills if enacted predetermine a good future for the country which is currently faced with huge economic and social challenges.
Chakwera also called for an extension for the current sitting of Parliament so that members of Parliament truthfully serve their constituents through deliberation of the bills.
Minister of Civic Education, Culture and Community Development Grace Chiumia is on record saying President Peter Mutharika's administration is not in support of the proposed electoral reforms, especially the proposal to above the 50 percent threshold needed to avoid a rerun in the presidential election.
Meanwhile, different religious group, civil society organizations and two public Universities, Mzuni and Chanco have pledged to support the 13th December, 2017 PAC demonstration.
The demonstration is against Parliament failure to table the bill in the current sitting of Parliament.
Leaders in the northeast Iowa city of Clarksville have decided to rebuild the city hall building lost to arson in late July.
Clarksville Mayor Val Swinton says the age of the building was one of the reasons the city council chose to rebuild instead of renovating the existing structure.
“The structure actually was not damaged by the fire, and so the structure according to our structural engineer is sound, but it's also very old, it's a 100 year old building. The roof leaks and we've had some bricks falling off the back of the building. We felt that fixing that building and putting a new city hall inside would not be cost effective, Swinton says. “We're afraid staying inside of that structure it could nicker and dime us to death over the long hall with a lot of repairs here and there.” Costs for a new building are estimated at half-a-million dollars as opposed to the 450-thousand dollar price tag to renovate the existing fire ravaged building. No decision has been made on how to finance the building, which may include a bond issue.
“We talked about that a little bit, we had our city attorney there. Right now that's kind of up in the air. There are other options we can look at, we are going to look at that in the next few months. Right now we don't have a set program on how we are going to finance it,” according to Swinton. Clarksville City Hall was connected to the city's emergency services buildings prior to the fire. The city council is looking into rebuilding at a different location.
“The city also owns three old buildings on main street that we're in the process of tearing down. Some councilmen have suggested that maybe putting City Hall on Main Street would be an attractive alternative. That's an option we are looking at,” Swinton says. Twenty-year-old Nicolas Wessels (Wess-ulls) of Clarksville faces two felonies, including second degree arson in connection to the July 22nd fire. His trial date is scheduled for Tuesday, December 5th in Butler County.

A group of protesters unfurled a 17-metre wide “No Kinder Morgan” banner across Edmonton's High Level bridge Friday morning, to protest the Trans Mountain expansion project.
The group said they wanted to dispel the myth that all Albertans support the pipeline, saying the twinning is not in the best interest of Alberta “as it shifts away from fossil fuel dependence and aims to meet its climate promises to the international community.”

“It's reckless to expand major fossil fuel infrastructure at a time when we should be seeing all hands on deck for investing in a sustainable economic future,” protester Anna Gerrard said.

The federal government gave its approval for Kinder Morgan Canada's expansion of the pipeline late last year after the National Energy Board recommended it go ahead if 157 conditions are met.
The controversial $7.4-billion Trans Mountain expansion project, which would nearly triple the capacity of the pipeline system running from Alberta to B.C.'s southern coast, is facing significant scrutiny from the many environmentalists, Indigenous groups, and B.C. governments that oppose it.
The protest came one day after TransCanada announced it was not going ahead with the Energy East pipeline project.
“We're calling on Rachel Notley and Justin Trudeau to halt this project,” protester Hannah Gelderman said. “We've seen, for example, Energy East yesterday cancelled, so we know that they have the power to do that and we know Alberta and Canada is ready for a just transition and we want to see that renewable energy transition happen.”

After about an hour, protesters removed the banner and left peacefully. Police were not involved.

KARACHI - Two hardcore militants, affiliated with outlawed terrorist organisation, escaped from the Central Jail late Tuesday night.
Following the jailbreak, the jail high-ups suspended at least a dozen officials, including superintendent of jail and approached the district police to register a case against them.
Two hardcore militants of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ), Shaikh Muhammad Mumtaz and Muhammad Ahmed Khan alias Muna had escaped from the Central Jail, sources revealed.
The militants belonged to the Hafiz Qasim Rasheed and Sabir Munna group of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi.
These groups are considered the most dangerous groups, which have featured in various high profile cases of terrorism.
One of them Ahmed alias Muna had reportedly been awarded 14 years imprisonment.
The officials suspended include Superintendent Prison Ghulam Murtaza Shaikh, Deputy Superintendent Faheem Memon, Assistant Superintendent Abdur Rehman Shaikh, ASI Faroosh Muhammad, SPC Nawab Ali, constables Atta Muhammad, Muhammad Amir, Abdul Ghaffor, Saeed Ahmed, Muhammad Sajjad, Tagial Naseer and Nadir Ali.
DIG Prisons Ashraf Ali Nizamani has also written a letter to the Station House Officer of New Town police station, District East to register a case against the suspended officials over the jailbreak.
It is reminded here that these two militants had escaped from the Judicial Complex adjacent to Central Jail.
“You are requested to lodge FIR under relevant section of law against these prisoners and the following officials as their negligence resulted in the escape of UTPs,” reads a letter.
“The prisoners have escaped from the newly formed ATCs complex inside the premises of the Central Prison. The building is on the outer perimeter of the prison. Therefore, the security is not the same as it is inside the prison,” IG Prisons Nusrat Mangan told media.
“We have suspended some officers linked to the matter and have formed a committee to investigate into the matter. We have zero tolerance for such matters and if someone from within our ranks is found involved in this escape, he will be dealt with iron hands,” he added.
“As per my correspondence with the operations police, teams have been dispatched to nab the suspects and hopefully soon they will be behind bars,” he concluded.
‘Robber' dies in an ‘encounter'
A robber was killed during an exchange of fire with police in Defence Housing Authority (DHA) within the limits of Gizri police station on Wednesday.
Police said that gunmen riding a motorbike were attempting to snatch a car from a man, Imtiaz, in Phase VI, DHA when police intervened.
Resultantly an exchange of fire ensued due to which Imtiaz and a bandit sustained wounds and were shifted to a hospital where doctors pronounced the bandit dead while admitted Imtiaz with serious injuries.
The dead was identified as Ali Asghar, 30, while his accomplice managed to flee.
Police said that Imtiaz had put up resistance to the robbers and in the meantime the police also reached and responded promptly.
The robbers shot at Imtiaz when he offered resistance, and when police reached the scene, the robbers also opened fire at them. “Both the casualties occurred due to fire from the robbers,” police added.
“Police has started the hunt for the robber who is on the run,” a police official said, and hoped that soon the law enforcement agencies would trace him. The body of deceased bandit was moved to a morgue while later police registered the case.
On the other hand, Karachi police claimed to have arrested at least 15 outlaws in various raids and operations carried out in different parts of the city.
Those nabbed included street criminals, bandits, drug peddlers and others.
Police said it had also recovered weapons and narcotics from their possession.

SpaceX is launching a Dragon spacecraft using a Falcon 9 rocket on Monday, with a launch window set for 12:31 PM EDT (9:31 PM PDT). The mission is CRS-12, the twelfth commercial resupply mission conducted by SpaceX, which is set to deliver a payload of over 6,400 pounds of supplies and experimental support materials to the International Space Station.
The launch's payload includes a new supercomputer from Hewlett Packard Enterprises, which will test whether so-called ‘software hardening' can be used to make a stock supercomputer from Earth suitable for use in space during long durations – including over the course of a potential mission to Mars.
This Dragon capsule will carry more materials for science and experiments than have previous resupply missions from SpaceX, with 75 percent of the capsule's weight assigned to supplies for over 250 experiments including testing things like the genetic causes of Parkinson's disease, radiation's effect on roundworm and more, extending the shelf life of pharmaceuticals and more.
SpaceX will be launching from its LC-39A launch facility at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and today's launch will include attempting to land and recover the Falcon 9's fist stage at LZ-1 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The Dragon capsule used will return to earth after around one month in orbit, carrying 3,000 pounds of goods from the ISS for the return flight.
The live stream above should go live around 15 minutes prior to the opening of the launch window, so at around 12:16 PM EDT (9:16 AM PDT).
Two sets of utilities—the GNU Core Utilities and util-linux —comprise many of the Linux system administrator's most basic and regularly used tools. Their basic functions allow sysadmins to perform many of the tasks required to administer a Linux computer, including management and manipulation of text files, directories, data streams, storage media, process controls, filesystems, and much more.
These tools are indispensable because, without them, it is impossible to accomplish any useful work on a Unix or Linux computer. Given their importance, let's examine them.
GNU coreutils
To understand the origins of the GNU Core Utilities, we need to take a short trip in the Wayback machine to the early days of Unix at Bell Labs. Unix was written so Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Doug McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna could continue with something they had started while working on a large multi-tasking and multi-user computer project called Multics . That little something was a game called Space Travel. As remains true today, it always seems to be the gamers who drive forward the technology of computing. This new operating system was much more limited than Multics, as only two users could log in at a time, so it was called Unics. This name was later changed to Unix.
Over time, Unix turned out to be such a success that Bell Labs began essentially giving it away it to universities and later to companies for the cost of the media and shipping. Back in those days, system-level software was shared between organizations and programmers as they worked to achieve common goals within the context of system administration.
Eventually, the PHBs at AT&T decided they should make money on Unix and started using more restrictive—and expensive—licensing. This was taking place at a time when software was becoming more proprietary, restricted, and closed. It was becoming impossible to share software with other users and organizations.
Some people did not like this and fought it with free software. Richard M. Stallman, aka RMS, led a group of rebels who were trying to write an open and freely available operating system they called the GNU Operating System. This group created the GNU Utilities but didn't produce a viable kernel.
When Linus Torvalds first wrote and compiled the Linux kernel, he needed a set of very basic system utilities to even begin to perform marginally useful work. The kernel does not provide commands or any type of command shell such as Bash. It is useless by itself. So, Linus used the freely available GNU Core Utilities and recompiled them for Linux. This gave him a complete, if quite basic, operating system.
You can learn about all the individual programs that comprise the GNU Utilities by entering the command info coreutils at a terminal command line. The following list of the core utilities is part of that info page. The utilities are grouped by function to make specific ones easier to find; in the terminal, highlight the group you want more information on and press the Enter key.
* Output of entire files:: cat tac nl od base32 base64
* Formatting file contents:: fmt pr fold
* Output of parts of files:: head tail split csplit

There are 102 utilities on this list. It covers many of the functions necessary to perform basic tasks on a Unix or Linux host. However, many basic utilities are missing. For example, the mount and umount commands are not in this list. Those and many of the other commands that are not in the GNU coreutils can be found in the util-linux collection.
util-linux
The util-linix package of utilities contains many of the other common commands that sysadmins use. These utilities are distributed by the Linux Kernel Organization, and virtually every one of these 107 commands were originally three separate collections— fileutils , shellutils , and textutils —which were combined into the single package util-linux in 2003.

Some of these utilities have been deprecated and will likely fall out of the collection at some point in the future. You should check Wikipedia's util-linux page for information on many of the utilities, and the man pages also provide details on the commands.
Summary
These two collections of Linux utilities, the GNU Core Utilities and util-linux , together provide the basic utilities required to administer a Linux system. As I researched this article, I found several interesting utilities I never knew about. Many of these commands are seldom needed, but when you need them, they are indispensable.
Between these two collections, there are over 200 Linux utilities. While Linux has many more commands, these are the ones needed to manage the basic functions of a typical Linux host.
Any hopes of a boost to the economy through an improvement in external demand seem to be fizzling away.
The chart shows that after a brief flare-up between February and April this year, caused by a rebound in commodity prices, the year-on-year rate of growth in merchandise exports has waned equally rapidly. That is true for overall exports as well as non-petroleum products' exports. Note that July's tepid growth in exports comes on top of a negative rate of growth in the year-ago period.
That's not all. Data for India's services exports for the month of June were also released on Monday. They showed that services exports fell by 0.3% compared to a year ago.
With no signs of a turnaround in investment and with weak external demand, it is now up to consumption to support the Indian economy. And consumption will have to buck up in spite of the disruption caused by the introduction of the goods and services tax. No wonder the Economic Survey seemed desperate to revive growth.
LAHORE - With a view to denounce the Monday's terrorist attack at Lahore's Mall Road, all major wholesale and retail markets and shopping centers of the provincial capital remained closed on Tuesday to show solidarity with the martyrs of the blast.
City's wholesale markets including Shahalam Market, Circular road markets, Brandreth road markets, Mcloed road markets, Montgomery road markets, Hall road, Biden Road, Azam Market, Moti bazaar, Dabbi Bazar and Akbari mandi remain closed. In the same way, major retail markets of Anarkali, Urdu bazaar, Mall road, Ichra bazaar, yatim Khana bazaar, Township main bazaar, Gulberg main market and Hafiz centre also remained shut to condemn the deadly attack on police yesterday.
All Pakistan Anjuman-e-Tajiran President Khalid Pervaiz said that all factions of the traders in Lahore had unanimously decided to close their shops to condemn the heinous act of terrorism. He also demanded the government to take strict measures to control law and order situation in the country.
Saarc Chamber of Commerce and Industry Vice President Iftikhar Malik also condemned the ugly act of terrorism in Lahore, urging the government to make foolproof security arrangements for the public, as repeated terrorist attacks were badly tarnishing image of the country.
Malik termed this terrorist attack a cowardly act to destabilise the country, aimed at creating an impression of an unsafe place in the eyes of the international community. He said that terrorist attack is damaging the soft image of the city of Lahore which is the city of ‘Zinda Dilan' citizens and considered the city of parks.
GCCI former president and REAP Ex vice chairman Samee Ullah Ch denounced the act of terrorism and violence in the country and urged the government to provide complete medical support and generous compensation for the victims. The law-enforcement authorities must ensure stronger vigilance and security to bring an end to such atrocities in the country. He said that business community offers its sincere condolences to the families of the martyred and sympathises with the injured persons. “We denounce such acts of terrorism, seek more vigilance and demand an end to such atrocities in the country,” he added. He said that the business community was extremely upset with the existing scenario.
FPCCI former president Mian Idrees said that at a time when the government was striving for attracting foreign investment and encouraging local businesses, the deteriorating law and order situation is putting a reverse gear to all its efforts. While condemning the blast, he said the terror attack in the provincial capital and in front of Punjab Assembly Hall is a failure of the security agencies and an eye opener for those who are sitting at the helm of affairs.
The European single currency, euro bounced higher on Wednesday, May 30, but remained stuck near 10-month lows against the dollar as concerns about a deepening political crisis in Italy kept a lid on any rebound.
The failure to form a new government in the euro zone's third-largest economy has raised the likelihood of an early election that some market players fear will become a de facto referendum on the single currency and Italy's role in the European Union.
Sources close to some of Italy's main parties said there was now a chance that President Sergio Mattarella could dissolve parliament in the coming days and send Italians back to the polls as early as July 29.
After major moves on Tuesday, when a massive sell-off in Italian debt markets rippled into currency markets, the foreign exchanges began European hours on a quieter note, with the dollar edging back slightly from its 2018 highs.
Italian government bond yields IT10YT=RR IT2YT=TWEB settled below multi-month highs after Tuesday's market turmoil.
The euro, which plunged to a 10-month low of $1.1510 on Tuesday as Italian worries added to bearish sentiment around the single currency, rallied 0.3 percent to $1.1573 EUR= on Wednesday.
It has fallen more than 4 percent this month and most analysts remain cautious on its outlook.
“The risk to the euro is predominantly political in the near term,” said Alvin Tan, an FX strategist at Société Générale, adding that the bank is confident that the euro is capped at $1.15 or $1.16 until the Italian political crisis is resolved.
The euro had dropped 1 percent against the safe-haven Swiss franc on Tuesday, its biggest daily fall since September, but it recovered half a percent to 1.1493 francs EURCHF= as some calm returned to markets.
It is down more than 4 percent this month, the biggest monthly decline since January 2015, when the Swiss central bank suddenly scrapped its floor for the euro against the Swiss currency.
Against the yen, the euro rose to 126.03 yen EURJPY= after hitting an 11-month low of 124.62 yen overnight, from about 131 yen a little more than a week ago.
“‘Don't try to catch a falling knife' is the phrase I heard very often today,” said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo branch manager at State Street Bank. “For the time being, we will just have to see how things develop.”
In the aftermath of the sexual assault allegations against PWR BTTM's Ben Hopkins, the queer-punk duo's music was removed from streaming services. Now, in the first statement we've heard from PWR BTTM since they strongly contested the allegations last month, a representative of the band has announced that their debut album Ugly Cherries is returning to streaming platforms starting today.
Furthermore, they're working with veteran music executive Lisa Barbaris — who once worked for labels including Elektra, Asylum, and Nonesuch and currently manages Cyndi Lauper — as well as attorney Jeffrey Koenig in an attempt to reclaim the rights to sophomore album Pageant from Polyvinyl Records. The statement explains, “As a fan of PWR BTTM's music, Barbaris was appalled at the response of the band's labels in withdrawing music and support so hastily.” The statement also asserts, “As of now, Polyvinyl has not presented any viable plan to the band to make the music on Pageant available to their fans.” Read the full statement below.
PWR BTTM's LP Ugly Cherries will be made available digitally as of Tuesday, June 13. This LP, originally released by Father/Daughter Records, and the May 2017 release Pageant were pulled from stores and streaming services last month when the band's current and past record labels dropped them as a result of an anonymous allegation of sexual misconduct. This allegation followed rumors that began to circulate two days before the planned release of PWR BTTM's breakthrough album Pageant, which had garnered early acclaim from Rolling Stone, Pitchfork, Billboard, The FADER, and NPR Music and had been named one of the “most anticipated albums of 2017″ by The A.V. Club, Stereogum, and more. The band released a statement contesting the claims. Still, the band's 36-city tour remained canceled and their music remained unavailable on virtually every digital platform. Veteran label exec and music manager Lisa Barbaris is currently working with PWR BTTM. Barbaris was Director of Press and Artist Relations for Elektra/Asylum/Nonesuch Records before opening So What Management in 1994 and becoming manager for Cyndi Lauper, working with her on numerous tours and recordings plus her debut as a Broadway composer with Kinky Boots. As a fan of PWR BTTM's music, Barbaris was appalled at the response of the band's labels in withdrawing music and support so hastily. Attorney Jeffrey Koenig of Serling Rooks Hunter McKoy & Worob LLP has been working with PWR BTTM and Barbaris to reclaim the band's music following the label's unprecedented move. As of now, Polyvinyl has not presented any viable plan to the band to make the music on Pageant available to their fans.
In further comments to Billboard, Barbaris writes, “To see Polyvinyl derail and potentially destroy the band's career in such an impulsive manner is very troubling. I've never seen a label respond in such an irresponsible way in the 30-plus years I've been in the music business.”
A representative from Polyvinyl tells Billboard, “Polyvinyl has been in contact with PWR BTTM's team to work out a separation, and is waiting for details necessary to make that happen. Polyvinyl wishes to make the transition as easy as possible and has no desire to prevent the band from releasing Pageant once an agreement has been reached.”

RCMP in Cape Breton are expanding an underwater search in their efforts to find a missing man.
Colin Beaton was last seen at around 2 a.m. Saturday, when he left a cottage in Harbourview, N.S., near Port Hood. He was wearing black rubber boots, jeans, and a grey hoodie.
Allan MacMaster, the MLA for Inverness, is Beaton's cousin. He posted on Facebook to say the 31-year-old is “in a vulnerable state” and without his glasses. MacMaster says Beaton has difficulty seeing without his glasses and has not eaten in some time. He also says the grey hoodie Beaton was last seen wearing has been found.
Beaton's family is asking people in the area to search their properties, including cabins, uninhabited homes, and vehicles.
READ MORE: RCMP, emergency services continue search for missing Nova Scotia man
RCMP say ground search and rescue crews have exhausted their efforts to follow up on specific tips in the area where Beaton went missing, and are not actively searching Wednesday. They had been deployed since Sunday.
On Tuesday, the search included air support along with four ground search and rescue crews, RCMP police dog services, and the underwater recovery team.
RCMP are bringing in another boat Wednesday as they continue to follow up on tips.
Beaton is described as being five-feet-11-inches tall and about 160 pounds with red hair and a beard.
Anyone with information about his whereabouts is asked to contact RCMP at 902-258-2213 or call Crime Stoppers.
Okanagan communities are receiving thousands of dollars to bring local groups, the health authority and government officials to the table to address the overdose crisis.
The provincial government is giving Kelowna, Vernon and 16 other communities around B.C. up to $100,000 each to create a community action team.
“It's locally driven. It's boots on the ground. It's trying to figure out how is Kelowna unique, and what can we do to combat this situation,” Candice Berry, Living Positive Resource Centre's executive director, said.
“What we're seeing right now is predominantly males between the ages of 30 and 49 who are using alone in their homes,” Berry said, adding that it can be a struggle to reach that group.
“We do know that the supervised consumption site and the overdose prevention site are saving lives. It's how are we going to combat the ones that we aren't reaching,” she said.
READ MORE: Groups to tackle overdoses in ‘hardest hit' areas including Kelowna, Vernon
The Okanagan's overdose death rate, at 40.8 deaths per 100,000 people last year, was second only to Vancouver, at 52.8 deaths per 100,000.
In 2017, 75 people died in Kelowna, which is 28 more than in 2016.
Meanwhile, Kamloops saw the number of overdose deaths drop from 44 in 2016 to 39 last year.
Interior Health Authority's chief medical health officer, Dr. Karin Goodison, said Kamloops has already established some collaborative efforts and found some innovative solutions that other places will look at.
“They're addressing getting someone into treatment very quickly, so contacting people when they arrive in care,” she said.
“They have somebody in their emergency room to meet people who have overdosed, and help triage them into the care stream immediately, so it's a warm handoff,” she said, noting that it helps address substance abuse issues.
The provincial money could be spent filling service gaps in the community, she said.
“For example, if you felt that you needed another person to work at a harm reduction agency, you could consider funding a position there,” Goodison said.
The government will also be investing $6 million in innovative community-based solutions for 2018-19 and 2019-20 as part of its three-year $322-million plan.
Roaming fees between operators in EU member states have been abolished — but future for UK customers + visitors remains unclear.
European roaming fees, finally, are no more. The cost of roaming within Europe — using one EU country's SIM card in another — has been growing more affordable for the past three years. But now roaming charges have, for the most part, finally been abolished. "Roam Like at Home" applies to voice calls, texts and data for anyone subscribing to an EU operator and roaming in another member state.
The European Commission says:
Phone calls, SMS and going online with your mobile device from another EU country will be covered in the national bundle. The minutes of calls, SMS and megabytes of data that a person consumes abroad within the EU will be charged the same as at home. As long as a person periodically travels and spends more time in his home country than abroad over any 4-month period, they will fully benefit from Roam Like at Home.
A few caveats apply. For unlimited plans, carriers may set a fair use limit, after which they can charge €7.7 + VAT per gigabyte. (That'll fall to €2.50 by 2022.) Customers might also be asked to pay more if they stay in another country within the EU longer than the country to which the SIM belongs. And a small number of operators in some regions are exempt due to their "very low domestic prices."
It's also worth underscoring that this doesn't apply to roaming within Europe on a SIM card from outside the EU, such as the U.S.
On the whole, it's a win for consumers, particularly tourists, frequent business travelers, and those living in the EU's many border areas — just a few years ago, subscribers faced exorbitant fees when roaming across European borders. The operators themselves have been quick to cash in on an easy PR win — although, of course, under EU law they now have no choice in the matter.
Nobody knows how Brexit will affect UK-EU roaming rates after 2019.
One major wildcard, though, is Brexit — the UK's impending exit from the EU, which must be wrapped up by late March 2019. After Brexit is concluded, in theory, there would be nothing forcing UK operators to abide by EU laws on roaming. That could mean a return to the old days of roaming charges for Brits roaming in Europe, and visitors from EU countries using their SIMs in the UK.
But opinion is split on whether this would actually happen. It'd be unpopular, for sure, and Three UK has already said it won't raise prices post-Brexit. Vodafone CEO Vittorio Colao believes competitive forces will keep roaming fees in check even after the UK leaves. Others are less optimistic.
Nevertheless, cheaper roaming — even if it's short-lived for some — is sure to be welcomed by Europeans traveling within Europe this summer holiday season. In today's news release, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker described the elimination of roaming charges as "one of the greatest and most tangible successes of the EU."

New England Patriots fans have not gotten over Deflategate. Or so it seems.
A banner, hung from an airplane, flew over Roger Goodell's vacation home in Maine. It read: “GOODELL NFL CLOWN SCHOOL NOW OPEN.”
Admittedly, the banner could have been paid for by any handful of fanbases. But Patriots fans have done it before. They flew banners over Goodell's Maine home during the legal proceedings of the Deflategate scandal to express their frustration over the commissioner's treatment of the team and quarterback Tom Brady. Perhaps, they're behind this banner as well.
Jeff Goldblum is set to record his first jazz album after having signed up with Decca Records Label Group, Decca announced Wednesday. The actor's jazz piano skills caught the attention of Decca executives after he accompanied soul-jazz singer Gregory Porter on a rendition of Nat King Cole's “Mona Lisa” on BBC talk show “The Graham Norton Show” last October while promoting “Thor: Ragnarok.”
“I'm so happy to be in cahoots with the wonderful people at Decca, one of the coolest and most prestigious labels of all time,” Goldblum said.
The actor, known around the world for his iconic roles in films including “The Fly,” “Jurassic Park” and “Independence Day,” has played piano since childhood. He regularly plays with his jazz band, The Mildred Snitzer Orchestra, around L.A. and at the Café Carlyle in New York. Goldblum also hosts a weekly jazz variety show at L.A.'s Rockwell Table and Stage when not away on location.
Tom Lewis, director of A&R for Decca, said he believed bringing Goldblum's music to a wider audience would “be helping, in our own small way, to make the world a happier place.”

“We are delighted to welcome him to Decca,” Lewis said. “He's a fantastic jazz pianist, a great band leader and just about the loveliest man in the world. His love of jazz is infectious and whenever he plays he makes you feel very happy.”
Further details on the debut album are yet to be announced. Goldblum is currently promoting the upcoming “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom” around the world ahead of its international launch next week, including another appearance on “The Graham Norton Show” in Britain last Friday. Goldblum reprises his fan-favorite character Ian Malcolm in the blockbuster franchise, which he last played in 1997's “The Lost World: Jurassic Park.”
Goldblum recently voiced the character of Duke in regular collaborator Wes Anderson's stop-motion animation “Isle of Dogs,” which is continuing its global rollout. Other upcoming films include Drew Pearce's “Hotel Artemis,” which opens in the U.S. on June 8, and Rick Alverson's “The Mountain,” which is currently in post-production.

A Williams Lake man is facing two charges of animal cruelty in relation to 46 neglected dogs seized from his rural property.
The BC SPCA seized the animals from Terry Baker in February, which include American Eskimo, border collie, husky and Samoyed breeds.

The organization said the animals were highly unsocialized and fearful.
“The dogs were seized because of lack of shelter, poor sanitation and inadequate veterinary care but the biggest issue, once they were in our care, was that they were terrified of human contact,” said BC SPCA chief prevention and enforcement officer Marcie Moriarty.
She said BC SPCA veterinary and behavioural experts worked closely with the dogs to try and resocialize them.
Adding to the challenge facing BC SPCA staff, several of the dogs gave birth while in care — but were too afraid of humans to let them near the puppies.
Moriarty said patient and specially-skilled staff were eventually able to get through to the new mothers and ensure their puppies got care.

She said that while dealing with psychologically distressed animals can be a difficult and long-term undertaking, of the 46 seized animals, just eight remain in BC SPCA care.
“The fact that the majority of the dogs have responded to the behaviour modification to the point that we were able to adopt them into new homes is quite incredible, given the condition they were in when they were seized,” Moriarty said.
If convicted, Baker could face a maximum fine of $10,000, up to five years in prison and a lifetime ban on animal ownership.

LONDON (Reuters) - Blockchain is to be used for the first time to try to track cobalt's journey from artisanal mines in Democratic Republic of Congo through to products used in smartphones and electric cars.
(For a graphic on how blockchain works click tmsnrt.rs/2dVefUN)
Sources close to a pilot scheme expected to be launched this year say the aim is eventually to give manufacturers a way of ensuring the cobalt in lithium-ion batteries for products such as iPhones and Teslas has not been mined by children.
Tracking cobalt presents many challenges as scores of informal mine sites would have to be monitored, all players in the supply chain would need to buy into the scheme, and accurate, electronic data would need to be transmitted from remote areas - all in a vast country plagued by lawlessness.
But companies are under growing pressure from consumers and investors to show the cobalt they use has come through supply chains free of rights abuses, just as they have for minerals used in electronics such as tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold.
Businesses in China, the main destination for Congolese cobalt from artisanal mines, have set up a Responsible Cobalt Initiative, which has been joined by tech giants such as Apple and Samsung, to address child labor.
The problem they face is that there are few sure-fire ways of tracing cobalt from the informal mines that produce up to a fifth of the cobalt from Congo, the world's biggest producer.
“The demand to make cobalt more sustainable is going to continue growing, meaning there is a will to find a solution and blockchain will be part of that,” said a source with the project, who declined to be named because it is not yet public.
OPEN QUESTION
Blockchain technology is already used in the diamond industry. Gems are given a digital fingerprint that is then tracked by blockchain as gems are sold, giving a forgery-proof record of where the stones have come from.
The cobalt supply chain is far more complex but the developers of the pilot hope blockchain - a decentralized online database in the form of a distributed ledger - can at least track some of the stages that are a major worry for end users.
Sheila Warren, head of blockchain policy at the World Economic Forum, said it was an open question how well it could work in Congo given the prevalence of conflict, lawlessness and an opaque legal system.
“We are prototyping, iterating, testing, scaling,” said Warren, who is working with experts to see how blockchain can improve mineral supply chains. “The technology is not the hard part.”
Amnesty International, which detailed the extent of child labor in cobalt mining in Congo in a 2016 report, said it was looking at blockchain, especially with a view to tracing payments to middlemen.
“You have to be wary of technological solutions to problems that are also political and economic, but blockchain may help. We're not against it,” said Amnesty researcher Mark Dummett.
Congo holds half the world's cobalt reserves and demand for the main mineral component of lithium-ion batteries is set to surge as electric cars proliferate. In 2016, Congo mined 54 percent of the 123,000 tonnes of cobalt produced worldwide.
Carmakers such as Volkswagen are trying to secure long-term cobalt supplies to sustain electric car production, and they are asking suppliers to ensure no child labor was used in the supply chain.

BAGGED AND TAGGED
The plan for the Congo pilot scheme is to give each sealed bag of cobalt produced by a vetted artisanal miner a digital tag which is entered on blockchain using a mobile phone, along with details of the weight, date, time and perhaps a photo.
At the next stage, a trader buying the bag would record the details on blockchain, and the process would be repeated until the ore gets to the smelter - leaving an immutable record of the cobalt's journey for downstream buyers or third parties to view.
The pilot will involve organizations throughout the supply chain, from on-the-ground monitors checking that sites are not using child labor, through the refining process to end users, according to people helping to develop the scheme.
One potential risk in the supply chain is that cobalt mined by children gets mixed with “clean” cobalt before processing.
The industry is experimenting with options such as indelible marks that survive the refining process, a mass balance approach as used for Fairtrade certification of products such as cocoa, or bolting blockchain onto computer technology already used by refiners to monitor material as it moves through their plants.

“We are very bullish about the potential impact of blockchain in minerals and metals supply chains,” said Harrison Mitchell, director of RCS Global, which advises companies on responsible sourcing and audits supply chains.
“Blockchain-enabled supply chains will have the ability to deliver trust and transparency over the production of metals such as cobalt,” he said. “Ensuring that information from these mine sites is inputted correctly and transparently is difficult, but it is possible.”
INPUT DATA
Some institutional investors are also pushing mining companies and manufacturers to harness blockchain to help clean up mineral supply chains.
Christine Chow of Hermes Investment Management said tracking cobalt was far more complex than diamonds, typically involving 12 steps as opposed to five stages for gems.
“But the principle of recording key characteristics and then entering them into the blockchain, which is stored on the cloud, is the same,” said Chow, part of the Hermes EOS team that advises institutional shareholders on responsible investing.
“To make it work, the key players in the chain must agree a set of input data to define its features,” said Chow, whose team has $425 billion of assets under advice.
The International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) said its members, which include all major mining companies, were well-placed to draw on blockchain's potential to improve public trust in the industry.
“It does not solve the whole problem, but it solves a big part of the problem,” ICMM CEO Tom Butler said.
“Quality at entry to where the blockchain starts remains a challenge, but in that respect we're in a privileged position as ICMM members are mining responsibly.”
Glencore, the world's biggest producer of cobalt, declined to comment on the use of blockchain.
In its 2016 sustainability report, Glencore said when it sourced cobalt in Congo from outside its own production, it only dealt with third parties that did not use artisanal mines.
NEW DELHI-A leopard on the loose inside India's largest car factory was caught and tranquilised Friday after sparking a frantic 36-hour search by 200 police and wildlife officials.
The big cat was spotted on Thursday on CCTV by guards at Maruti Suzuki's manufacturing plant in the town of Manesar, just 24 miles from the capital New Delhi.
After workers were evacuated from the plant, which churns out nearly a million vehicles a year, police kicked off an hours-long operation to catch the animal, even using live goats and raw meat to lure it out of hiding.
But the leopard was unmoved and remained out of sight until it returned to the same location where it was first spotted. “The wildlife team was successful in tranquilising the leopard late afternoon,” said Ashok Bakshi, the police deputy commissioner of Manesar. “The animal has been removed from the factory and after medical examination will be released in the wild,” he told AFP. “No one was injured in the operation and area has been declared safe.” Deadly conflict between humans and animals has increased in recent years in India largely due to shrinking forest habitats and urban expansion.
India's environment ministry said in August that 1,144 people were killed between April 2014 and May 2017 by wild animals - an average of more than one a day.
There are an estimated 12,000-14,000 leopards in India, which are frequently killed when they stray into villages. Officials say one is killed on average every day.
In January a leopard was beaten to death by a mob outside Gurgaon, a satellite city outside Delhi, after it attacked and injured eight people.
Last year a leopard injured three children after wandering into a school in Bangalore in India's south. Local schools went into lockdown for days until the leopard was located and tranquilised.
Aside from a few select people, no one knows if the Montreal Canadiens' day on July 1 played out how it was supposed to. That list begins with Habs general manager Marc Bergevin.
Bergevin Dreams in Technicolor
It's nice to think it did, though… that Bergevin was able to properly assess his team's strengths and weaknesses and determine going after and overpaying a slew of mediocre free agents just wasn't best for the long-term health of the Habs. Just look at what the Habs didn't give up for now-St. Louis Blue Ryan O'Reilly, anyway. The Habs barely have one center, let alone three.
If that's how it played out in Bergevin's mind, he deserves some measure of kudos, as it's a game plan he's seemingly been able to stick to since owner Geoff Molson admitted all the Habs' unused cap space from this past year had been earmarked for Alexander Radulov and Andrei Markov; Once they jumped ship, the Habs weren't going to spend it just for the sake of being a cap team.
Take the NHL Entry Draft for example. That's when Bergevin opted to go off the board to draft center Jesperi Kotkaniemi, who likely won't be ready for NHL action for a few years. In so doing, he passed on winger Filip Zadina, who by many accounts would have been ready to jump in right away, especially on a team as woefully undermanned on the right side as the Habs.
Of course, Bergevin is telling a very different story, saying the Habs are still looking to make the playoffs next season, which would run counter to every logical impulse analysts might have, looking at a largely unchanged roster from the one that just finished fourth from last.
Plekanec Instead of Tavares
Sure, Max Domi is in and Alex Galchenyuk is out, but that's a downgrade on paper. And, yes, the acquisition and buy-out of Steve Mason ahead of July 1 was a sly way to use the cap space at Bergevin's disposal to acquire a serviceable middle-six winger in Joel Armia. But, the last time anyone checked, Armia was only a depth player on an actually good team in the Winnipeg Jets… and hardly anyone's idea of a savior.
Finally, in bringing back Tomas Plekanec and effectively making him their centerpiece free-agent acquisition on July 1, the Habs have almost guaranteed they'll more likely be in the running for last overall than eighth in the Eastern Conference. And there's little wrong with that at this stage of the game.
Of course, the move does make for what might be the worst-ever trade between the Habs and Maple Leafs, with the center that Toronto got instead being somewhat of an upgrade over the one they let hit free agency. And it's conveniently John Tavares who represents the one hiccup in the narrative this is all part of some master plan.
Seeing as there had been undeniable interest in Tavares from the Habs, who only found out it was unreciprocated after the draft, the earliest Bergevin and company could have opted to go ahead with their hypothetical rebuild was after they picked Kotkaniemi.
Habs found out they were out on Tavares when the free agency conversation window opened. "We were disappointed, but it's his decision." said GM Marc Bergevin in French. — Eric Engels (@EricEngels) July 1, 2018
Canadiens vs. Leafs
So, can Habs fans actually trust Bergevin when he says: “Je ne suis pas prêt à dire qu'on fait une reconstruction?” Hell, no. Why part with tradition, now? Especially when the re-acquisition of Plekanec says the Habs are still more focused on the past than the future? All it means is no one outside the Canadiens can be sure whether or not Bergevin's failure to secure a free agent of any consequence on July 1 was on purpose or part of on an ongoing trend of futility dating back several years.
Truth be told, if Habs fans are jealous of the Leafs, consider how the Canadiens' longtime division rivals had to finish last just a few years ago to give a jump-start to what had just recently been an organization that literally went 12 years with a single playoff appearance. And that one ended far from well.
In other words, the Habs need to suck for a while in order to get good again. And, as fate would have it, Bergevin has assembled the perfect team for such a mission impossible, even if it's been in spite of himself. Look at it this way: If you want someone at the helm of the team, responsible for making the Habs as bad as imaginable, wouldn't Bergevin be the right man for the job? His qualifications are astounding (in that one respect).
A True Rebuild Starts at the Top
Of course, for it to be a true rebuild, the Habs would have to trade Carey Price and Shea Weber, assuming there are takers for either of them. At the very least, because Price has a no-movement clause, Weber must go, but Bergevin can't realistically be expected to trade the guy he got back for P.K. Subban.
Doing so would be an admission of wrongdoing and incompetence, and, seeing as Bergevin can't so much as utter the word “rebuild” in the affirmative, it's time for him to go.
Even if you want to give him every benefit of the doubt and argue he's finally on track with a legitimate five-year plan, he's not special. Even if you believe he has to deny the Habs are tanking from here on out for the financial well-being of the team, he's still become the face of the organization… and therein lies part of the problem. He shouldn't be, in more ways than one. He's become a caricature of contradiction, to the point that one can't be sure if he's even believing most of what he says. Again, he shouldn't be.
As decent of a job as he's admittedly done this offseason, most every NHL executive can set their sights on a non-playoff finish next season and deliver. Bergevin's taken this team as far as he can, into the ground. You don't need to be a general manager to know being on the verge of losing three out of the last four seasons? People lose their jobs as a result. It should be someone else's turn, now.
MADRID - Cristiano Ronaldo was hit with a five-match ban by the Spanish football federation (RFEF) on Monday for pushing the referee after being sent-off in Real Madrid's 3-1 Spanish Super Cup, first leg win over Barcelona.
The World Player of the Year received an automatic one-match ban for his dismissal on Sunday and an extra four games for his reaction towards referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea. Ronaldo was also fined 3,805 euros ($4,500) and has 10 days to appeal the ban.
Should any appeal fail, Ronaldo will miss Wednesday's Super Cup, second leg and Madrid's first four La Liga games of the season against Deportivo la Coruna, Valencia, Levante and Real Sociedad.
Madrid had already signalled their intent to appeal Ronaldo's second yellow card shown for diving eight minutes from time when he went down inside the area under pressure from Samuel Umtiti. "Ronaldo's sending-off annoys me because even if it is not a penalty, the card is harsh," said Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane after the game.
"We will see if we can do something so that he is available on Wednesday."
“Strange Brigade,” a 1930s co-op adventure game from Rebellion Developments, comes to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on Aug. 28, the studio announced Tuesday.
It takes place in Egypt, where the Witch Queen Seteki has raised an army of mummified monsters. Up to four players can band together as the eponymous brigade to fight back against the evil hordes. Each brigade member has their own set of weapons, skills, and tactics. In between battles, they'll dodge traps and solve environmental puzzles. It basically looks like a cross between “Left 4 Dead” and “The Mummy” (Brendan Fraser version).
“Strange Brigade” is available for pre-order now. All pre-orders include the Secret Service Weapons Pack, which includes a Wilkers & White P19 pistol, a Stoudenmire 960 submachine gun, and a Gehrig-Delgane S1 rifle. The digital Deluxe Edition includes the season pass (because of course there's a season pass). Rebellion plans to support the game post-launch with new campaign missions, characters, weapons, items, and more. The Collector's Edition comes with a steelbook case, a 64-page art book, downloadable content, and more.
Rebellion Developments is an indie video game developer based in Oxford. It's mainly known for its work on the “Sniper Elite” and “Alien vs. Predator” franchises. It also released a story trailer Tuesday providing some background on the Strange Brigade, its mission, and the many dangers of 1930s Egypt. It looks hokey but fun, like any good Universal monster movie. Maybe it will even help erase the memory of that Tom Cruise debacle.
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Russia threw its weight behind China's massive Belt and Road plan to build trade and transport links across Asia and beyond, suggesting to India on Monday that it find a way to work with Beijing on the signature project.

India is strongly opposed to an economic corridor that China is building in Pakistan that runs through disputed Kashmir as part of the Belt and Road initiative.
India was the only country that stayed away from a May summit hosted by Chinese President Xi Jinping to promote the plan to build railways, ports and power grids in a modern-day recreation of the Silk Road.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said New Delhi should not let political problems deter it from joining the project, involving billions of dollars of investment, and benefiting from it.
Lavrov was speaking in the Indian capital after a three-way meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj at which, he said, India's reservations over the Chinese project were discussed.
“I know India has problems, we discussed it today, with the concept of One Belt and One Road, but the specific problem in this regard should not make everything else conditional to resolving political issues,” he said.
Russia, all the countries in central Asia, and European nations had signed up to the Chinese project to boost economic cooperation, he said.
“Those are the facts,” he said. “India, I am 100 percent convinced, has enough very smart diplomats and politicians to find a way which would allow you to benefit from this process.”
The comments by Russia, India's former Cold War ally, reflected the differences within the trilateral grouping formed 15 years ago to challenge U.S.-led dominance of global affairs.
But substantial differences between India and China, mainly over long-standing border disputes, have snuffed out prospects of any real cooperation among the three.
India, in addition, has drawn closer to the United States in recent years, buying weapons worth billions of dollars to replace its largely Soviet-origin military.
Swaraj said the three countries had very productive talks on economic issues and the fight against terrorism.
Jaisaan Lovett graduated from University Preparatory Charter School for Young Men as the valedictorian last month, with a full scholarship to Clark Atlanta University. He is the school's first black valedictorian and, as such, had some things to say in his speech.
There were thanks for his parents, siblings and teachers and encouragement for his classmates. For school leader Joseph Munno, though, Lovett had a different message:
"To Mr. Munno, my principal, there's a whole lot of things I've wanted to say to you for a long time. ... I'm here as the UPrep 2018 valedictorian to tell you that you couldn't break me. I'm still here, and I'm still here strong.
"And after all these years, all this anger I've had toward you and UPrep as a whole, I realized I had to let that go in order to better myself. And I forgive you for everything I held against you."
Lovett's comments about Munno would likely have gone unnoticed if he'd delivered it as planned at the small graduation ceremony.
Instead, the school refused to let him speak, the result of what Lovett believes is personal animosity on Munno's part. As it happens, though, he has a powerful friend: Mayor Lovely Warren, in whose office he works as an intern.
Warren invited him to City Hall to deliver the speech and posted it on the city's official YouTube channel.
"Unfortunately, Jaisaan's school did not allow him to give his valedictorian speech," Warren said in the video. "For some reason, his school — in a country where freedom of speech is a constitution right, and the city of Frederick Douglass — turned his moment of triumph into a time of sorrow and pain.
"Jaisaan will never graduate from high school again. He will never get that moment back. This is not the time to punish a child because you may not like what he has to say."
In a statement issued late Tuesday, the school said its board of trustees is aware of the matter.
"The Board will be reviewing the circumstances regarding what happened and looking into the related guidelines and school policies," the statement read. "For confidentiality reasons, the school isn't able to speak about the specifics of this situation.
"UPrep wishes Jaision (sic) Lovett, the first black Valedictorian in the school's four year graduation history, much success as he continues his education at Clark Atlanta University."
Munno did not respond to a request for comment.
UPrep, an all-male school serving grades 7-12, is one of Rochester's best regarded charter schools, with annual graduation rates well above 90 percent.
Lovett said he'd had numerous run-ins with Munno over his six years at U Prep. In one instance last year, he led a five-day student strike when he said the school wouldn't order needed safety equipment for a lab.
"There are a lot of wrong things that go on at that school, and when I notice it I speak out against it," he said. "(Munno) is a guy that doesn't like to be told 'no.'"
Lovett said he was never asked to deliver a valedictorian speech even though past students had done so. When he requested permission to speak anyway, he said Munno denied him.
"He didn't want to see the speech or what it said, nothing," Lovett said. "He just said no."
Warren also posted the YouTube video on her official mayoral Facebook page, crediting Lovett for "speaking truth to power" and saying he had been "silenced" by the school.
In a follow-up Facebook comment, she said: "He nor his parents were ever given a reason (why he wasn't allowed to give the speech). I called the principal but to my knowledge he never called me back. He and Jaisaan didn't have a great relationship and it was his last chance to show him who was boss. He worked hard for this opportunity and his mom and dad were in tears that there was nothing that they could do from the audience. They weren't going to ruin it for everyone else."
In it's statement, the school said it did try to connect with the Mayor's Office and the school's call "was not returned."
A spokesman for Warren said he did not know whether Warren was aware of the specifics of Lovett's complaints against Munno.
Lovett's brother, LaJason Lovett, was salutatorian at UPrep last year and received a full ride to Morehouse College. Jaisaan is using his own scholarship to study video game design.

In a oddly-worded tweet on Saturday morning, U.S. President Donald Trump said the Devin Nunes memo “totally vindicates “Trump”” from the Russia probe.
“This memo totally vindicates “Trump” in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on,” the president wrote on Saturday morning.

After much political hand-wringing, a four-page memo written by House Intelligence Committee chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes was released on Friday.
Trump gave final approval for releasing the memo despite an FBI warning that the document was misleading and inaccurate.

The memo states the FBI relied excessively on a former British spy whose research was funded by Democrats as the organization applied for a surveillance warrant on a former Trump campaign associate.

The memo contends the investigation into Trump campaign links had begun earlier.
While some Republicans are using the memo's contents to claim the Robert Mueller inquiry – which is investigating ties between Trump's campaign team and Russia – is tainted, others point to the fact Nunes did not provide a full accounting of events in his memo.

‘Opponents say he cherry-picked the information he used to support Trump's case, with some purporting the memo leaves the door open for the inquiry to continue.
“Having decided to cherry-pick, the Nunes team picked a bunch of the wrong cherries for its own narrative,” Matthew Waxman, a Columbia University professor and former Bush administration official, wrote to the Associated Press in an email.
The Mueller investigation is looking into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia as well as whether the president has obstructed the investigation itself.

It's been a busy week for the Ontario Hockey Association.
Junior hockey's provincial governing body pulled the plug on one team, and it also announced the rest of its teams would have to wear full facial protection beginning next season.
“I think it's a good idea,” Tavistock Braves general manager Bob Zehr said. “I think it's long overdue. The OHA should have done this five years ago.
“I still think why do you want kids flying around with mouths exposed? I don't get it.”
Safety concerns have been an issue since the OHA allowed GOJHL teams to wear half visors in 2005 and Junior C teams to do the same in 2007.
In a release, the OHA said its board of directors “categorize this as a serious risk management concern that must be addressed with the utmost regard for player safety and the teams involved.”
The organization alluded to an impact study done during the 2015-16 season. Data collected was “staggering” when looking at facial and dental injuries suffered while wearing half visors compared to full facial protection.
There have been several incidents over the last decade, including former Stratford Culliton Jeff McArdle suffering a broken jaw in October 2013.
Stratford Warriors alternate governor Jason Lott would have preferred the OHA let each league decide its own policy, but he's encouraged by the fact teams won't be at a disadvantage when recruiting based on facial protection.
“I think it's something our team believes strongly in and we don't want to see players get hurt,” he said. “You can do things to protect their safety, so I think it's a good move for our league.”
Warriors captain Jack Scanlan lost a front tooth when he was crosschecked in Kitchener this season. Insurance paid for the tooth to be capped, but Scanlan will have to pick up the bill down the road when he needs a root canal.
The 19-year-old last wore a cage with the Junior C Penetang Kings in 2013.
“From a player's perspective I'm not gonna tell you visors are lighter on your helmet and make you skate faster,” he said. “There's certainly a level of this is junior hockey now and I'm done with minor hockey (and wearing full facial protection). That was something that stood out for me and that'll be lost, but it's not the end of the world, especially for players looking to move on.
“It may take a little bit of getting used to but I don't think that's something too much to overcome.”
The number of players wearing half visors varies in Junior C.
More than half of the Braves wear cages, while most of the Paris Mounties – the team Tavistock faced in the first round of playoffs – wear half visors.
“I don't think our guys are out there trying to carve Paris guys up in the face,” Zehr said.
In the Pollock Division – formerly the Western Junior C league – teams voted to wear full facial protection from Day 1.
“It's really a tough thing for us to swallow,” Mitchell Hawks head coach Kory Dietz said. “The safety thing, along with getting away from mouth injuries, the teeth and everything else, the purpose of the whole thing never made sense to me in the first place.
“We don't need (teenage) kids getting teeth knocked out playing junior hockey.”
Dietz said the current situation creates an uneven playing field, since players on teams wearing cages can take four-minute penalties for high sticks that cut an opposing player, but there's virtually zero chance of a player wearing a cage getting cut by an inadvertent stick.
“It's always been more of a show thing, how it looks, how it appears than practicality of the rule,” he said. “I think it's a good thing for junior hockey and parents as well knowing a kid's mouth won't be out there.”

One Golden Horseshoe team was terminated this week, but not the one most expected.
The OHA pulled the plug on the Thorold Blackhawks after forfeiting three games.
Injuries, illness and suspensions were cited as the reasons why Thorold was unable to ice an adequate lineup, though the team raised eyebrows at the deadline when it traded some of its top players. The Blackhawks were seventh in the standings with a 13-29-1-2 record.
“While it is unfortunate Thorold is unable to finish this season the OHA believes this is a temporary setback to their program,” OHA president Karen Phibbs said in a release. “The OHA and GOJHL expect Thorold's successful return to league play for the 2017-18 season and will cooperatively support that endeavour.”
All remaining games scheduled against Thorold will be recorded as a 5-0 forfeit under Ontario Hockey Federation rules. The conference's top team, Caledonia, will now receive a first-round bye, while the second-place team will play the seventh-place team, which means the Buffalo Regals won't sneak into the playoffs and embarrass the league further.
First-round results in the Golden Horseshoe won't count toward the GOJHL's wildcard when it comes to the Sutherland Cup semifinals.

Cardiff - England's four decades of pain at major 50-over tournaments will continue for at least another two years after an enigmatic Pakistan side sensationally dumped them out of the ICC Champions Trophy on Wednesday.
Pakistan were given next-to-no chance of knocking off the tournament favourites in their semi-final in Cardiff but another superb bowling performance steered them to a crushing eight-wicket win and their first final at a major ODI event since the 1999 World Cup.
LBW fortunes favour England early in semi-final
Ten days after they were humiliated by India in Birmingham, Pakistan now face the prospect of taking on their fierce rivals again in the tournament decider at The Oval on Sunday. India will play Bangladesh in the second semi-final at Edgbaston on Thursday.
As he'd done in victories over South Africa and Sri Lanka in the group stage, paceman Hasan Ali (3-36 from 10 overs) led the way as Pakistan dismissed England's all-conquering batting line-up for just 211 on a worn surface at Sophia Gardens.
Left-armers Junaid Khan and Rumman Raees, the latter in his ODI debut, also picked up two wickets each as none of England's batsmen finished their innings with a strike-rate of more than 100.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's government is in favour of banning imports of petroleum coke on environmental grounds, according to a government affidavit filed with the country's top court, which could be a big blow to U.S. refiners who export heavily to the country.

The Supreme Court, which in October banned the use of petroleum coke in and around New Delhi in a bid to clean the air in one of the world's most polluted cities, is scheduled to hear a case on its use across the country later on Monday.
India is the world's biggest consumer of petroleum coke, better known as petcoke, which is a dark solid carbon material that emits 11 percent more greenhouse gases than coal, according to the Carnegie–Tsinghua Center for Global Policy.
Burning it also emits several times more sulphur dioxide, which causes lung diseases and acid rain.
Local producers include Indian Oil Corp, Reliance Industries and Bharat Petroleum Corp.
The oil ministry has also told the Supreme Court that petcoke should only be used as feedstock, like in the cement industry, and not as fuel.
A country-wide import ban would require replacing 14 million tonnes of petcoke a year with 24 million to 31 million tonnes of coal, according to industry calculations, most of which has to be imported.
HAFIZABAD - A young cultivator was gunned down over old enmity in village Sohawa here on Friday. The police have registered a case against Sarfraz, Muazzam, Fazal Abbas, Azhar Ali and two others Under Section 302 /34 PPC who managed to escape after committing the offence.
According to police source, there was longstanding enmity between the deceased Nasrullah S/o Noor Muhammad Bhatti and the accused. The accused Sarfraz along with his five accomplices stormed the house of the deceased and opened indiscriminate firing. As a result he died on the spot. The police shifted the dead body to the morgue for autopsy.
Two held with 5kg hashish
The Sukheke Police dramatically recovered five kg of hashish and two kg opium from a car near Motorway Interchange Kot Sarwar and arrested two drug paddlers. The police also impounded the vehicle.
According to police, on a tip-off, Sukheke Police SHO Ghulam Muhammad Warraich along with heavy police contingent intercepted a car coming from Peshawar. Upon search, the policemen recovered opium and charas hidden under seats.
The police arrested two drug peddlers and a registered a case under Anti-Narcotics Act against the accused.
WEST SPRINGFIELD - A shooting that occurred Thursday night on Memorial Avenue near the Dunkin' Donuts appears to be self-inflicted, police said.
Police Chief Ronald Campurciani told WWLP there was no danger to the public and no suspects are being sought.
The condition of the victim was not immediately available.
The incident began about 10:20 p.m., according to police radio reports.
This is a developing story. Additional information will be posted as soon as it is available.
The Lions were roaring again at Solstice Park, Bretton, this afternoon (December 9).
After two defeats in the Midlands Premiership, normal service was restored as they overcame Bournville from Birmingham 56-29 - a result that has lifted them back into second place in the standings. Newport were second but their game was postponed today.

“It was so important to get back to winning ways today,” said Lions chairman Andy Moore. “We were fired up and I suppose Bournville were too. But at the end of the day we were just too strong for them.
The Lions blasted out of the blocks and were 7-0 up after two minutes thanks to a Tom Gullands try converted by Nico Defeo.
Bournville quickly levelled it up at 7-7 but two more touchdowns for the Lions - the first a long-range interception try by Semisi Sitanislei Tei and the second a forwards' try by Conor Gracey - which were both converted by Defeo, gave them a 21-7 lead at the turnaround.
Second-half tries, again all converted by Defeo, were added by Dan Malem, Tom Lewis and Rory White to steer Lions to a comfortable 47-12 advantage with an hour gone.

They then took their foot off the gas and Bournville ran in three tries in quick succession.
But Lions had the last word as Kaz Henderson found a way over for try number eight and Defeo was once more successful with the conversion.
Sam Crooks picked up two yellow cards, which is technically a red, and will face RFU disciplinary action. Tom Lewis was also sin-binned.
Going back to work after the holidays can be tough.
On the one hand, all that shopping, gift wrapping, cooking and cleaning can really tire a person out. On the other, the late-night partying, afternoon wake-up calls and extra freedom can also take its toll on one's sleep cycle.
So once that wind down begins, some find it challenging to readjust to their old routines again.
It's become such a phenomenon that researchers call it “post holiday syndrome” – a term to describe that general feeling of discomfort people get when they're unable to adapt to work after the holidays, according to the University of Granada.
READ MORE: The holidays can make mental health problems worse. Here's how to manage
So what can you do to beat the post-holiday blues?
Global News spoke with life and career coach Maggie Distasi, and Arturo Gallo of Monster.ca, to talk life after the holidays and what you can do to make sure your transition back to work is a smooth one.
What to expect
For those lucky enough to have time off during the holidays, the whole idea is to disconnect from work, says Gallo. So when it comes to getting back to the grind, the transition can be a slow process.
“We're not at our peak after the holidays,” Gallo says. “Going back is really a psychological thing sometimes and just thinking of going back to the routine and responsibilities of work can make us really sluggish about it.”
And while the back-to-work transition may not have any effect on some, it could have a greater impact on others – even physically.
According to the University of Granada, tiredness, lack of appetite and concentration, drowsiness or sleeplessness, and muscular aches are just some of the physical effects people can experience. Psychological symptoms include irritability, anxiety, sadness, couldn't-care-less attitude, and feelings of emptiness.
“It's a disruption to both your physical and mental routine,” says Distasi. “More people tend to be tired at the end of the day after their first few days back. Their brains are on a different speed, they tend to process things more slowly and have gotten used to not thinking at lightning speed… It's jarring, overwhelming and it can be a little depressing even.”
A time to re-evaluate
The time it takes for a person to readjust after the holidays has a lot to do with how they view their work. If they enjoy it, the transition time will be shorter and less painful. However, if you dread your job, it could take you a lot longer.
“A lot of times with people who are in career transitions, one of the reasons they dread coming back is because they're not happy with the work that they're coming back to,” says Distasi. “That can cause a lot of anxiety and frustrations even long before the holiday is over.”
In fact, the post-holiday season is a time when many people reevaluate their jobs and careers, says Gallo.
READ MORE: Tips for keeping the peace with family over the holidays
“It's a time when we ask ourselves if we're on the right career path and job and if we're happy at work,” Gallo says. “The first week of January has always seen the highest peak for job searches [at Monster.ca]. It's people looking forward to the new year – like buying a house or car. It's their resolutions so it's pretty normal that people would feel the need for a change.”
But before you go making any permanent decisions, Gallo advises taking your time and really think your decisions through because it may just be the effects of the post-holiday season.
Back-to-work survival guide
To help you ease back into the swing of things, both Distasi and Gallo offer several tips that will make your transition a little smoother:

Cinephiles have waited decades to see Orson Welles final film, The Other Side of the Wind, which was left unfinished at the time of his death in 1985. But when streaming giant Netflix acquired the global rights to the film last year, it became a pressing reality that the film might never hit theaters at all. Fortunately, producer Frank Marshall has revealed that Netflix is planning a theatrical release for the film. Per Indiewire, The Other Side of the Wind will have numerous theatrical showings, but the details are still being worked out.
Marshall worked as a production manager during the original shoot, which spanned years and was famously plagued by financial troubles, and spearheaded the campaign to get the movie completed. After the streaming service rescued more than 1,000 reels of film negatives from a Paris vault, Marshall led a team of editors to complete and restore the film with with consultation from Peter Bogdanovich, who also co-stars in the picture.
The film that will bookend Orson's amazing body of work, THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIND, photographed by Gary Graver, will be coming soon! https://t.co/LABcMXrKj5 — Frank Marshall (@LeDoctor) May 27, 2018
YES!!! — Frank Marshall (@LeDoctor) May 27, 2018
A semi-autobiographical Hollywood satire starring John Huston as a legendary director struggling to forge his last great comeback in his final days,The Other Side of the Wind also stars Oja Kodar, Robert Random, Lilli Palmer, Edmond O'Brien, Cameron Mitchell, Mercedes McCambridge, Susan Strasberg, Norman Foster, Paul Stewart, and Dennis Hopper.
The film was one of five features Netflix pulled from consideration for the 2018 Cannes Film Festival after the fest's artistic director Thierry Frémaux and his executive board established a hard line on theatrical distribution. At the time, Welles' daughter Beatrice Welles spoke out against the decision. ““I saw how the big production companies destroyed his life, his work, and in so doing a little bit of the man I loved so much,” Beatrice wrote. “I would so hate to see Netflix be yet another one of these companies.”
While The Other Side of the Wind ultimately wasn't the “movie that “[bridged] the gap between Netflix and Cannes” as she hoped, the film will ultimately see a proper theatrical release. Netflix previously screened the film for a select few earlier this year, including Paul Thomas Anderson, Quentin Tarantino, and Rian Johnson.

Any player that makes the leap from juniors to the pros knows how difficult a task that is. For Islanders' forward Mathew Barzal, he's ready to prove he belongs not only in their lineup, but in their top-six.
Barzal and the Islanders open the season at Nationwide Arena Friday against the Columbus Blue Jackets. He skated as their second-line center this week in practice between Andrew Ladd and Josh Bailey. Not only will he see top-six minutes, he'll see time on the power play on the second unit. That's a lot of responsibility for a 20-year old playing in just his third-career NHL game.
Despite the lack of experience, Barzal and the team are confident in what they're capable of. Head coach Doug Weight addressed Barzal starting on the top-six this morning in his press conference. Of note, Weight said that Barzal is a confident and smart player who can make an impact while playing a 200-foot game. Speaking of impact, watch what he does to the New Jersey Devils in the preseason. This was on a power play.
Barzal Confident in Himself
The Islanders have needed a second center behind John Tavares for a while now. Barzal has the upside of a top-line player with high-end offensive skill. Although he's making the jump from WHL Seattle to the NHL, he says he's ready for the challenge. Not only is he ready for the challenge, he's ready to shine. I asked Barzal what the extra year in Seattle did for his development and how it helped him to get ready for tonight.
“We went on that good playoff run last year,” Barzal said. “(It was) kind of that grind of playing two games every 3-4 nights. It was a grind. Every game meant so much. Being able to play games with that kind of desperation will help me tonight and moving forward.”
Barzal's junior team Seattle won the WHL and advanced to the Memorial Cup. As the captain of the Thunderbirds, Barzal lead his team in scoring with a combined 104 points in just 57 games between the regular season and playoffs. His playoff performance of 7-18-25 in 16 games helped him win the MVP of the WHL playoffs. He also was an alternate captain for Team Canada at the World Junior Championships. He scored eight points in seven games helping Canada win a silver medal.
Barzal is ready for this moment. The Islanders fell just short of the playoffs in 2016-17. Barzal's emergence coupled with Jordan Eberle's arrival gives the Islanders a new look on offense. Can this translate to wins? Is it enough to push them over the top?
The team is quietly confident despite many overlooking them in the Metropolitan division. Don't overlook these Islanders. The playoffs are well within the realm of possibility for this team.
Last week in training camp, the Edmonton Eskimos practised in sweltering conditions on The Brick Field at Commonwealth Stadium. Wednesday brought wet, windy and cold conditions but the Eskimos stayed outdoors for their two-and-a-half-hour session.
Head coach Jason Maas says he wants his team to handle all conditions.
“You want to see who's a mudder, who can do it in all conditions and mentally who's tough enough to have a ball slip through their hands or a ball not be perfect, or a slip here or a slip there and be able to recover and not let it get to them,” Maas said.
“Our guys have to learn how to practice in it and it's also about having fun.
“It makes practice a little different, makes you think about some other stuff. At the end of the day, we're all kids at heart and to be out in the elements is sometimes fun.”

The Eskimos will finish up their pre-season schedule on Friday in Winnipeg against the Blue Bombers where there's a 60 per cent chance of rain.
Maas confirmed on Wednesday that neither Mike Reilly nor Kevin Glenn will play on Friday, giving way to Eli Jenkins, Danny O'Brien, and Zach Kline to handle the quarterback duties.

Kline has made the most out of his opportunities. There has not been many of them but he has capitalized.
With limited playing time through two pre-season games last year and one this season, he has engineered five touchdowns and a field goal with the Eskimos offence in just seven series.
Kline joined training camp late last year, signing a few days in and in his first pre-season game, was given one series to play on offence against the Calgary Stampeders. He had one series but he only needed one play. The first time he touched the ball in a CFL game, he threw a 90-yard touchdown pass to Duke Williams.

A week later, Kline engineered three touchdown drives in the fourth quarter as the Eskimos came back to earn a tie with Winnipeg. Fast forward to 2018 where Kline guided the Eskimos to a touchdown on one of the two series he got to work Sunday against Saskatchewan.
After a lot of success in a very limited time, the head coach knows it's time to take a longer look at the 24-year-old Californian.
“He is going to get a long look in this game. We are not playing Kevin. We are not playing Mike.
“Those three: Eli, Danny and Zack will play the whole game. It will be about production and staying on the field. If they aren't effective and efficient on offence, they won't be out there. They have to make the most of it, particularly Zack.”
Kline's enthusiastic celebrations and his obvious love for football has won over the fans at Commonwealth Stadium, and now his goal is to take it to the next level.
“You got to go out and do it again. As a quarterback, you have to have a short memory for the good and the bad.”
There's no word yet on who will start the final pre-season game in Winnipeg but Kline has as good a shot as anyone to be QB1 on Friday night. Whatever playing time he does get, he will be ready to give it everything he has.
“I'm thankful to be here. This is not a forever job; it's a job where you have to work your heart out and work your tail off in order to play for a while and that's what I'm trying to do.”
Roster notes
Receiver Juron Criner and linebacker Christophe Mulumba-Tshimanga joined the group of injured players on Wednesday. Receivers Bryant Mitchell and Nate Behar, along with offensive lineman Matt O'Donnell and J-S Roy, all remain out of practice sessions.
The Eskimos will hold a walk-through on Thursday morning at 9:45 a.m. and head to Winnipeg on Friday to play the Blue Bombers.
630 CHED will have live coverage of Friday's game starting with Countdown to Kick-off at 5 p.m, the opening kick-off is at 6:30 p.m. from Investors Group Field.

LOS ANGELES-Penelope Cruz hates being asked about ageing. The 43-year-old actress - who has son Leo, six, and daughter Luna, four, with her husband Javier Bardem - has said she is sick and tired of being asked questions about ageing in Hollywood, and admits she no longer answers questions on the topic, as she thinks its ‘'crazy''.
She said: ‘'Journalists have been asking me, since I was, like, 22, ‘Are you afraid of aging?' That is such a crazy question for a 22-year-old girl or, for that matter, for a 42 year old. I combat that craziness by refusing to answer the question.
‘'When it comes to talking about ageing as an actress, I am not going to give you even two minutes to honour your question. It doesn't deserve that.'''
And the ‘Volver' star claims her opinion on the topic changed after she gave birth to her daughter, as she can no longer understand why women are still asked about their age in interviews.
She added: ‘'Something changed when I gave birth to my daughter. I started thinking, ‘Come on, it's 2017.
Why do women still have to be talking about this? It's crazy.' That sense only got bigger when I had children.''
It isn't just her opinion on ageing that changed after she became a mother, as the ‘Zoolander 2' actress also admits her ‘'ego has gotten smaller'' in recent years.
Speaking to Gwyneth Paltrow for Interview magazine, she said: ‘'I'm happy to say, that my ego has gotten smaller over time. I used to be so afraid about what people were going to think of me, if I was going to be accepted, if I was going to be loved. I put a lot of energy into the perception of myself.
‘'When I became a mother - almost seven years ago - something very deep changed in me, where I really don't care about a lot of the stuff I used to care about before. That's part of growing up, and now I have to go through other tests that life will put in front of me. I have new fears now.''

Andalusia quarterback Ethan Wilson is a force to be reckoned with on the football field, but to this teen, diamonds are a guy's best friend.
"I'd like to play baseball in college," said Wilson. "Football is a great game. I love playing it in high school, but for my health, I just love baseball."
The two sport star has made a life out of balancing time between the pigskin and our national pastime.
"First off, it just kind of takes my mind off baseball," said Wilson. "Football is just an awesome game to play. Football definitely helps me to just relax and take some tension off me."
Wilson was selected as one of the 120 players to participate in the Alabama Baseball Coaches Association All-Star Event at Troy University, and he hopes this will help him during his senior year at Andalusia.
"It would just help me with my skills, just to help me become a better baseball player and a better person," said Wilson.
The 2016-2017 season was kind to Wilson. Not only did he lead the Bulldogs to the semifinals of the AHSAA state football playoffs, but he also helped lead Andalusia to the first round of the baseball playoffs. However, after failing to reach the state title game in either sport, he has high hopes for both teams his senior year.
"Playing for a state title, I've never done it before, but it's got to be the best feeling in the world," said Wilson. "That's what I'm going to strive for in every sport I play no matter what happens."
Wilson will be back on the field for the Bulldogs looking to start a state title run on August 25 when they take on Shades Valley.

A 19-year-old Charleston woman is being held without bond accused of tricking a man she was dating into getting shot and robbed.
Neslyn Berroa went in front of a bond judge Monday afternoon for a shooting that happened Friday night in Hampton Park near Cleveland Street. The victim identified as KeJuan Mills remains hospitalized after suffering a gunshot wound to his neck in the incident.
Mills told detectives that he believed he was setup by Berroa.
According to the victim's father, Anthony Mills, the two met on Tinder about 11 months ago.
The father says Berroa texted his son Friday night, said she was leaving town and wanted to see him one more time before she left town.
Police say they met at the gazebo, and that she brought along two men wearing ski masks. Police say one of the men had a gun, yelled where's the stuff and shot the victim in the neck.
They then dragged him to a pond.
Cops say the victim played dead, and after the robbers took his car and personal items he ran to The Citadel for help.
Investigators say the victim identified Berroa as being involved in the attack.
The victim is still in the hospital.
Police are still searching for the two accomplices.
If you have any information you are asked to call police or Crime Stoppers at 843-554-1111.
Court documents released in Friday night assault
According to newly released court documents, Berroa messaged the victim asking him to meet her in Hampton Park Friday night.
Authorities say the victim and Berroa then walked to the gazebo, and after 10 minutes two male subjects wearing face masks approached them.
One of the male subjects then pointed a gun at the victim and asked the victim,"Where's the ****?"
The male subject then looked at Berroa and said,"Ima shoot him in the head." The male subject then fired one shot striking the victim in the neck.
Court documents state that once the victim fell to the ground the male subject went into the victim's pockets and removed the victim's wallet, cell phone and car keys.
During this time, authorities say Berroa asked the male subject ,"Did you get the stuff?"
According to investigators, Berroa also asked him,"Did you kill him?"
Authorities say the male subject then dragged the victim several feet before dropping his legs and fleeing the park with Berroa and the other male subject.
The victim said he heard his car start and drive away.
Police say the victim's vehicle was located the following day at the intersection of Roger's Alley and St. Philip Street.
The victim told investigators that he pretended to be dead after he was shot. After Berroa and the two male subjects fled, the victim said he got to his feet and ran for help at The Citadel campus.
The victim told authorities at The Citadel he believed he was set up by Berroa. He was then transported to MUSC.
According to court records, Berroa and the victim have "known each other for approximately 11 months due to casually dating."

The hats were flying on the first two nights of the NHL season.
Connor McDavid, Alex Ovechkin, Wayne Simmonds and Brandon Saad each recorded a hat trick in his team's season opener. It's the first time four different players scored at least three goals in his season opener in 100 years, since the NHL's first two games back in 1917.
Ovechkin's hat trick that led the Washington Capitals to a 5-4 shootout victory at Ottawa was the 18th of his career, most among active players and tied for 20th-most all time. Reigning MVP McDavid picked up his second already at age 20.
The hat tricks by McDavid and Simmonds were the first, respectively, in franchise history for the Edmonton Oilers and Philadelphia Flyers in a season opener. Saad's hat trick in a 10-1 drubbing of the Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins was the first by a Chicago Blackhawks player in a season opener since Hockey Hall of Famer Bobby Hull in 1965.
The four players who scored three-plus goals in the league's first-ever games -- Joe Malone of the Montreal Canadiens, Harry Hyland of the Montreal Wanderers, Cy Denneny of the Ottawa Senators and Reg Noble of the Toronto Arenas -- were all alive more than 100 years before McDavid was born.

WATERLOO — The history and future of quilting is on display at the upcoming Waterloo County Quilters' Guild exhibit.
"There's a trend toward modern and art quilting," said guild member Ilene Atkins. "And the show reflects that."
The quilt exhibit is being held on Friday, Oct. 13, and Saturday, Oct. 14, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at RIM Park in Waterloo. Admission is $5.
The guild holds an exhibit every two years to showcase quilts made by its more than 200 members, making it one of the largest quilting guilds in the country.
"We've got a history of quilting here and we do have a large guild," Atkins said.
While the guild has been going strong for more than three decades, the style of quilting has evolved in recent years beyond traditional techniques and fabrics.
That will make for an interesting show of more than 200 quilts, ranging from traditional patterns to more modern designs and artistic creations using fabric.
"There's quite a large variety of quilts and styles and techniques," Atkins said.
Along with the quilts on display, there will be vendors selling quilt-making supplies, door prizes, small quilt draw, tearoom and a charity raffle quilt.
The last show, also held during the last weekend of Oktoberfest, attracted about 1,600 people, many who weren't quilters but came to appreciate the artistry.
Tesla has a new way to demonstrate the possibilities of its home solar products to potential customers – using a ‘tiny house' on wheels, which it can tow on a rolling tour with a Tesla Model X. The Tesla Tiny House made its official debut in Australia (via Electrek), where it will welcome visitors at Melbourne's Federation Square, before taking off for a cross-country Australian tour.
The towable Tiny House is reminiscent of the mobile design studio it introduced last September, which was a reconfigured Airstream that let people build their own Tesla vehicle as a kind of mobile virtual studio. These solar-focused demonstration trailers also feature mobile design studios and configurators within, but for Tesla's solar products, including solar panels and its Powerball energy storage battery for the home.
The Tiny House has actual siding this time around, which is made up of sustainable timber with not artificial chemical treatments. It weighs 2 tonnes (around 4,400 pounds) and has 2kW solar generation capacity using 6 panels, which can feed the single Powerwall battery mounted on the side.
Tesla's touring the country with destinations at ever major Australian city, but residents can also request it swing by and pay a visit to smaller towns along the way, too. Tesla doesn't yet offer solar installations in Australia, but it clearly wants to prime the pump, and it does sell Powerwall batteries for use with solar installations from other providers.
This model seems likely to be applied to other markets, too, should the Tiny House prove effective in swaying Australian customers. On the commercial side, Tesla is also building a huge renewable power storage facility using its Powerpack batteries, which will be the largest such facility in the world once it's complete.

TIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - Dozens of Central American migrants from about 600 travelling in a “caravan” through Mexico arrived at the border city of Tijuana late on Tuesday despite warnings it would be futile to try to cross to claim asylum in the United States.

By evening, two busloads of men, women and children arrived in Tijuana, a city that grazes southern California.
U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered officials to repel them.
The arrivals spilled into the streets and gazed toward San Diego, visible at spots through a rusty barrier or across a pedestrian bridge, exhausted after their trek that began a month ago near Mexico's southern border with Guatemala.
Another four busloads were making their way north from Hermosillo, a city 432 miles south of the border, where the migrants had been stalled for days.
Many who fled their homes in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras because of what they described as lethal threats or political persecution have clung to the hope of receiving asylum in the United States. But their prospects dimmed after U.S. authorities released statements on Monday saying they would have driven back.

Rodrigo Abeja, a coordinator from immigrant rights group Pueblo Sin Fronteras that has been organising similar caravans for several years, said the caravan planned to regroup before making any decisions.
“They will wait for all those seeking asylum to be together,” Abeja said.
A third group, resigned to staying in Mexico, awaited processing for year-long visas by immigration authorities in Hermosillo.
Travelling as a group for safety, their numbers were down from a peak of about 1,500 people, dwindling under the twin pressures of waiting for transportation and attacks by Trump, who began lashing out at the caravan on Twitter in early April.

Washington
Democratic lawmakers in Congress, as well as a few Republicans, have blasted the release of a disputed GOP intelligence memo that alleges the US Department of Justice and FBI abused their surveillance authority in their probe of Donald Trump's presidential election campaign.
Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, slammed the release of the memo, saying it was “reckless and demonstrates an astonishing disregard for the truth.”
“This will make it far more difficult for the Intelligence Committees to conduct meaningful, bipartisan oversight of intelligence activities in the future,” he said in a statement. Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, said “the intelligence community opposes this. Even many Republicans oppose this.”
“This is dangerous territory, it disrespects law enforcement, and it's an alarming partisan attack on efforts to investigate hostile foreign interference in our democracy,” he wrote in a Twitter message.
Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democratic form New Hampshire, also criticized the release of the memo, echoing that it's “dangerous.”

A free new “Pokémon” game hit the Nintendo Switch Tuesday night, Nintendo revealed in a Tokyo press conference. A mobile version of the game will hit next month.
The game is called “Pokémon Quest” and it takes place on a brand-new, mysterious location called Tumblecube Island, where Pokémon have turned into cubes, according to the official Pokémon Twitter.

Nintendo said the creatures in “Pokémon Quest” were originally discovered in the Kanto region, but they now have a boxy, cube-like appearance reminiscent of “Minecraft.” Players will get to decide which characteristics their Pokémon have via special items called Power Stones. The players can also decorate their in-game homes with collectibles that not only spruce up the place and provide in-game benefits.
“This new Pokémon title, developed by Game Freak, lets players explore the island of Tumblecube with their team of cute, cube-shaped characters known as Pokéxel,” said Shigeru Ohmori, director at Game Freak. “Players will be able to personalize their Pokémon and develop a strong bond with their Pokémon friends while battling their way through the adventure. With the simple touch-screen controls, Pokémon Quest is a game that Pokémon fans of all ages can pick up and play.”
The game uses simple tapping and touch controls, according to the developer. Players will use items collected throughout expeditions to befriend a wide array of Pokémon. They can also partner with three of their Pokémon to battle through diverse environments.

METHUEN, Mass. – Authorities in Massachusetts say a 10-month-old baby had to be revived twice after she was exposed to fentanyl.
Police arrived at the Methuen residence early Saturday afternoon after receiving a report of a child not breathing.

First responders took the child to Lawrence General Hospital, where police say she stopped breathing twice and had to be resuscitated. She was later airlifted to Tufts Medical Center in Boston, where she's in stable condition.
Authorities say hospital tests indicate the baby had the potent synthetic opioid fentanyl in her system.
The Department of Children and Families says it has taken custody of the baby. The incident remains under investigation.
Mayor Stephen Zanni says, “The opioid epidemic knows no boundaries.”

DENVER (Reuters) - Lawyers for U.S. pop star Taylor Swift and the Colorado DJ she accuses of groping her were due to deliver closing arguments on Monday before the federal court jury weighing her sexual assault claims against his assertion that he was wrongfully fired.
The trial stemming from Swift's allegations against radio personality David Mueller headed into its final phase after the 27-year-old singer-songwriter won an important ruling on Friday, which dismissed the DJ's accusation that she wrongfully got him to lose his job.
The ruling by U.S. District Judge William Martinez left standing Swift's assault and battery countersuit against Mueller, who insisted during the trial that he was falsely accused.
The judge also left intact a single claim by Mueller accusing Swift's mother and another member of her management circle of interfering with his contract, bringing about his ouster from his $150,000-a-year job at radio station KYGO-FM.
The judge previously tossed out Mueller's defamation-of-character claim against Swift, ruling before the trial that the DJ had waiting too long to file a lawsuit on those grounds.
The weeklong trial stems from allegations by the Grammy-winning artist known for such hits as "Fearless" and "I Knew You Were Trouble," that Mueller clutched her bare buttocks during a pre-concert fan reception while they posed together for pictures.
Mueller, 55, initiated the litigation, suing Swift, her mother and her radio station liaison Frank Bell for his termination.
The elder Swift said she wanted Mueller fired, and Bell reported the allegation to KYGO management, who sacked Mueller two days after the incident.

Swift then countersued, saying in her lawsuit that raising the issue of sexual assault “will serve as an example to other women who may resist publicly reliving similar outrageous and humiliating acts.”
During his trial testimony, Mueller denied having touched Swift inappropriately and said the false allegation cost him his career.
“It's a humiliating experience to be accused of something that despicable,” he said.

When Swift took the stand, she testified that Mueller put his hand under her skirt and “latched onto my bare ass cheek,” causing her to lurch away from him.
A photograph of the incident, shown repeatedly during the trial, depicts Swift flanked by Mueller and his then-girlfriend Shannon Melcher. Mueller's right hand is concealed behind Swift's backside, and she appears to be leaning away.
Melcher testified that she did not see anything untoward during the encounter, but added, “I don't have eyes in the back of my head.”
Swift is asking for a symbolic $1 in damages, but that does not limit what the eight-member jury could award her should she prevail.
“For this reason, any recovery obtained by Ms. Swift will be donated to charitable organizations dedicated to protecting women from similar acts of sexual assault and personal disregard,” the countersuit said.
If Mueller prevails on his claim against Andrea Swift and Bell, any damages would be limited to his two-year contract with the radio station, the judge has ruled.

Update: After nearly a day of livestreaming general goofiness, Bethesda Wednesday morning unveiled a teaser for a new Fallout game: “Fallout 76.“
Bethesda Game Studios tweeted an image of the series's iconic test-pattern startup screen at 11 a.m. ET on Tuesday, along with the hashtag #PleaseStandBy. The developer's publisher, Bethesda, then took to a live Twitch stream featuring a static Pip-Boy bobblehead, blue and yellow balloons, and a hand puppet to build anticipation while their audience grew to upwards of 148,000 viewers. The stream remains live, with its viewership holding around 145,000, as of the publication of this story.
Possible news of for a new “Fallout” comes almost three years after the announcement of “Fallout 4” at E3 2015. The game was released on Nov. 10, 2015, just months after being unveiled. “Fallout 4” sold 12 million units at launch, surpassing 2011's “Skyrim” as the fastest-selling title in Bethesda history. Several major expansions were subsequently made available as individual DLC purchases and as part of a substantial “season pass.”
In January 2012, Bethesda gained the rights to an abandoned “Fallout Online” MMO project in an out-of-court settlement, but no further developments about the IP have been made public.
This year's E3 will take place from June 12 to June 14, while Bethesda's showcase is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. PT on June 10.
CHICAGO -- The Laver Cup was a hit last year, and now Roger Federer is hoping it proves popular on U.S. soil.
The 20-time Grand Slam champion made his first visit to Chicago on Monday to promote the second Laver Cup, a team competition that debuted last year in Prague.
Federer, shaking off a three-set loss to Juan Martin del Potro on Sunday in the final at Indian Wells that ended his 17-match winning streak, was joined by tennis legends Rod Laver and John McEnroe, along with young Australian star Nick Kyrgios.
Federer's management team was instrumental in launching the Laver Cup, which pits Team Europe against Team World. After its third year, he said he'll entertain possible changes to the format.
"Down the road I'm totally open to anything," Federer said. "I've heard already from women players. They would love to do it as well."
Four of the six players on each team are chosen on rankings after Wimbledon. The other two are captain's picks, and captain McEnroe didn't wait Monday -- he announced the talented Kyrgios was already on the World Team.
Kyrgios lost a tight final singles match to Federer in Prague last season, which clinched the cup for Team Europe.
What impact the Laver Cup has on the future of Davis Cup, the long-standing competition between nations, is still debatable. But there is a proposal from the International Tennis Federation to play the top level of Davis Cup in a single-week, 18-nation format. It must be approved by a vote of the membership.
"It just takes so much out of the players to be available four weekends during the year every single year," Federer said. "I played a lot of Davis Cup when I was younger and happy I did. I was happy it existed, but eventually it was just too much."
Federer added: "I do believe that the Laver Cup has sparked some change, some inspiration to other cups that maybe we'll see in tennis. But that's a good thing. We'll take that as a sign of flattery."
McEnroe, once a staple for the U.S. Davis Cup team, said changes in that competition are overdue and certainly the success of the Laver Cup has not gone unnoticed.
"For me, I say, `When's the last time anyone's asked me about how many Davis Cup teams I was part of winning?" McEnroe said.
"In the last 10 years, how many people have asked me that? You know how many people? None. Which is sad, 'cause I played a lot of Davis Cup and I loved it."
The 2018 Laver Cup will be played Sept. 21-23 at United Center before returning to Europe the following year.
Earlier this year, German thrash kings Kreator came back with Gods Of Violence, their mighty new LP, and it's one of our favorite albums of the year thus far. As a sort of victory lap, Kreator are also planning to reissue four of their classic-era albums: Endless Pain, Pleasure To Kill, Terrible Certainty, and Extreme Aggression. And now they've made a brand-new video for “Pleasure To Kill,” the near-feral title track from their 1986 album. For the video, directors Dariusz and Rafal Szermanowicz have essentially restaged an '80s-style slasher movie, as a madman with a chainsaw and a hockey mask stalks a young woman. The plot twist is that there is no plot twist. Check it out below, via Noisey.
Gods Of Violence is out now on Nuclear Blast. You can pre-order those four reissues here.
WINNIPEG – A massive overhaul to Winnipeg's emergency room system will first require a cash injection of $19.9 million.
The Winnipeg Regional Health authority said renovations, to take place over the next 27 months, are needed at several hospitals to accommodate changes announced earlier this year.
In April the province said it would be closing the emergency room at Concordia Hospital and converting ER's at Victoria Hospital and Seven Oaks into Urgent Care facilities.
Misericordia Urgent Care Centre is also closing down.
To help, additional capacity is being created at St. Boniface, Grace and HSC to handle higher patient intake.
On Monday the WRHA announced the first phase would include expansion at the Health Sciences Centre as well as minor renovations at St. Boniface.
Deer Lodge Centre will also be getting additional rooms.
After being nabbed by the FBI while leaving DefCon, the security researcher who singlehandedly neutralized the WannaCry malware attack earlier this year is back online. Marcus Hutchins, a.k.a. @malwaretech, appeared for his arraignment at a federal court in Wisconsin on Monday where he entered a not guilty plea and successfully argued that he should be allowed internet access. Hutchins faces six charges related to his alleged involvement in the Kronos banking malware in 2014.
Initially, Hutchins was prevented from going online after his arrest. In court today, Hutchins was granted nearly unfettered access to the internet, with the only stipulation being that he not access the “sinkhole” he created that stopped WannaCry. Naturally, he tweeted for the first time since his arrest, addressing his case and thanking his many supporters.
i'm still on trial, still not allowed to go home, still on house arrest; but now i am allowed online. Will get my computers back soon. — MalwareTech (@MalwareTechBlog) August 14, 2017
Things to do during defcon:
Attend parties
Visit red rock canyon
Go shooting
Be indicted by the FBI
Rent supercars — MalwareTech (@MalwareTechBlog) August 14, 2017
Notably, as the International Business Times reports, the government appeared to acknowledge that the case against Hutchins was “historical” in nature, suggesting that it no longer considers Hutchins a threat in a seeming acknowledgement of his role preventing the spread of more recent malware. That kind of language could bode well for his case.
Hutchins, a British citizen, will now be allowed to move around the U.S. freely and relocate to Los Angeles as he awaits his trial, which is set to begin on October 23.

BERLIN (Reuters) – North Korea has been using its embassy in Berlin to procure parts for its missile program, the head of Germany's BfV domestic intelligence agency told a German broadcaster.
No one at the North Korean embassy in Berlin was immediately available to comment on the allegation.
In a program to be aired on NDR television on Monday, BfV head Hans-Georg Maassen said: “We determined that procurement activities have been carried out from there that are, in our view, done with a view to the missile program and sometimes also for the nuclear program.”

He said it was often so-called dual use goods, which can be used for both civil and military purposes.
Comments released by NDR ahead of the broadcast showed Maassen said German authorities prevented such activities when they found them but he added: “We can't guarantee that we can detect and prevent this in all cases.”
READ MORE: How did North Korea get nuclear weapons?
He said it was necessary to presume that parts for North Korea's launch program “were acquired via other markets or underground buyers had acquired them in Germany”.
North Korea has defied years of multilateral and bilateral sanctions with a weapons program aimed at developing nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States.
Peterborough police are launching a campaign targeting those who are using accessible parking permits illegally.
“We've had individuals who are using permits from deceased relatives who passed away years ago, and they have no mobility issues themselves,” said Sgt. Peter Sejrup.
On-street accessible parking infractions are enforced by Peterborough bylaw officers. Illegally parking in an on-street accessible spot carries a $300 set fine.
READ MORE: Peterborough council temporarily parks new front lawn parking bylaw By Jesse Thomas Global News
But illegally using the permit itself is a different matter, Sejrup explains, and falls under the Highway Traffic Act.
Permits are assigned to individuals, he says, and not vehicles. A person with an accessible parking permit can transfer that permit to whatever car he or she may be driving.
Sejrup says using a permit that's not assigned to you can result in a summons to court. If convicted, violators face fines ranging from $300 to $5,000.
Police prefer to educate rather than enforce, Sejrup says, and those with permits seem happy to see officers checking on them.

“They're all thankful when we do check, because they feel that frustration. They're the ones who experience first-hand needing that parking spot and it's not available to them,” he says.
Jason King works for the Peterborough branch of the Ontario Council for Persons with Disabilities, and says parking infractions happen in Peterborough on a daily basis.
“This is an ongoing issue with a lot of drivers,” King says, “it's a matter of entitlement instead of consideration.”
He's optimistic about the police campaign, but worries that it won't do enough to curb the problem.
ISLAMABAD, Dec 11 (APP):The concluding ceremony of the “Human Rights through Cinematography” film festival held here at Lok Virsa, co-organized by European Union, the United Nations and the Embassy of Switzerland.

NORTHAMPTON -- A city policeman who allegedly ran a red light then smashed his personal vehicle while driving intoxicated was arraigned Monday morning at Northampton District Court.
Officer Michael Cronin denied charges of leaving the scene, failing to stop at a red light and operating under the influence of liquor.
Mayor David Narkewicz' office said Cronin has been placed on paid administrative leave.
The crash occurred Saturday. The officer was not on duty at the time.
A pretrial conference is scheduled for May 9. Cronin is represented by attorney Joseph Bernard.
Northampton Police Chief Jody Kasper confirmed that Cronin remains a city employee. She said she cannot comment on personnel matters.
According to police department policy, when an officer is on administrative leave, there is typically an internal investigation commenced to ascertain whether rules may have been violated that could warrant disciplinary action.

2017 Michigan II: NASCAR Monster Energy Race Results - Daredevil restart gives Larson third consecutive Michigan win
Posted by: ASkyler on Aug 13, 2017 - 08:50 PM 2017 Michigan II: NASCAR Monster Energy Race Results - Daredevil restart gives Larson third consecutive Michigan win
Matt Crossman, NASCAR Wire Service
BROOKLYN, Mich. - Sitting in his racecar during a red flag delay near the end of the Pure Michigan 400 at Michigan International Speedway, Kyle Larson pondered the possible routes to an overtime victory. He was in fourth-place and would restart for the final two-lap shootout behind leader Martin Truex Jr.
Larson hadnt had a fast racecar all day at Michigan International Speedway, but he thought with a gutsy move on the restart, he could steal a win in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race. Ahead of him, Truex, the race leader, was in the opposite positon. He had had a fast racecar all day, and he figured he needed a strong restart to repel whatever move Larson or somebody else would throw at him. Like Larson, he was trying to figure out which scenario would be most likely to take him to Victory Lane.
As it turned out, Larson and Truex both drew up the same planthey both wanted Larson to hit Truex on the restart. They just had different ideas about what would happen after that.
Truex hoped the contact would push him forward and to the victory, and for a very brief second, that seemed possible. But Truex spun his tires, which played right into Larsons strategy.
I wanted to time it and get to his bumper and act like I was pushing him out to the lead and duck underneath him and get to his left-rear quarter and pull him back, Larson said. Its crazy how when you get to someones left rear quarter how much it slows them down. It did just that.
Larson bounced off of Truex as he passed him, and for a split second the race fanned out four wide. That never ends wellespecially not on the penultimate lap when all four drivers are going for the win. But somehow they all stayed off each other, and afterward, rookie Erik Jones, one of those drivers, was at a loss to explain how. I was pointed at the infield for half of (Turns) one and two, said Jones, who finished third.
After the pass, Larsons car was loose for the rest of the restart lap and the white flag lap. But he put enough distance between him and Truex that Truex couldnt catch him and had to settle for second. Those were the only two laps Larson led all day. The thrilling win in a car that had no business doing so looked like a career defining move for Larson, the young driver from California.
The win was an exclamation point on an already great week of racing for Larson. He finished second late Saturday night in the Knoxville Nationals, one of the biggest dirt races in the world. His contract forbids him from running on dirt the night before he has to be on track for NASCAR, be it practice, qualifying or a race. But on Thursday, he talked team owner Chip Ganassi into making an exception.
Ganassi harbored misgivings about the decisionhe thought Larson, who didnt get back to Michigan from Knoxville, Iowa until 2:30 a.m. Sunday might be too worn out for the 400 mile race, and those doubts grew bigger in the middle of the race as Larson languished in the middle of the pack. But after the win, Ganassi joyously shook team members on the pit box and planted a kiss on Larson.
It was Larsons third consecutive win at Michigan. The only other drivers to accomplish that are David Pearson and Bill Elliott, both of whom are in the NASCAR Hall of Fame. The race was slowed by five cautions for 28 laps.
Michigan native Brad Keselowski won the first stage. He dominated the first half of the race, leading five times for 105 laps. But he faded to 17th. Truex led three times for 57 laps and won the second stage. Truex kept his position atop the points race, but finished runner-up.

US sanctions, baffled Russians, hot air and history by The Saker
So, finally, the suspense is over. Kind of. The US Treasury has finally released the list of Russian entities and individuals which could (conditional!) be sanctioned by the US Treasury in compliance with the H.R.3364 – Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. These two short excerpt from the report show why I say “could”:
and
Now let's translate all this in plain English: the US took a copy of the Kremlin telephone book, then a copy of Forbes and created a new list combining both. Then the US proclaimed that these entities and individuals are not under any sanctions yet, but are candidates for such sanctions.
Does that make *any* sense to you *at all*?!
Well, if it does, stop reading and enjoy your unique gifts. If it does not, then don't feel bad as this makes no sense whatsoever for anybody in Russia either. Oh how I wish modern technologies would make it possible for me to post here all the recent interviews, articles, talk-shows and public statements made in Russia for the past 24 hours! To say that the Russians are baffled is, really, an understatement.
Two things are noteworthy: first, this list completely ignores one of the most important realities of Russian politics: that the real, dangerous, opposition to Putin is not from the people (who support him at anywhere between 60% to 80%+) or from the Russian media (which, while often critical, does not represent a real threat to him) or even the Duma (whose opposition parties are critical of the Kremlin, but who are very careful about criticizing Putin himself lest they lose support from the people) . For years now I have been explaining that the real opposition to Putin is a) inside the ruling elites, including the Presidential Administration and the Government and b) big money: banks, oligarchs, etc. I call this (informal) opposition the “Atlantic Integrationists” because what these pro-western globalists want is for the AngloZionist Empire to accept Russia as an equal partner and to have Russia fully integrate the US-controlled international financial and security structures: WTO, NATO, EU, G7/8, etc. Very roughly speaking you could think of them as the “Medvedev people” (but you could also say that the Ministers in charge of the Russian economy all fall into this category, as do almost all the heads of Russian banks). I call the (informal) group supporting Putin the “Eurasian Sovereignists“. These are the folks who see the future of Russia in the South, East and even North, who want to pull Russia out of the AngloZionist international financial and security structures and who want a truly sovereign Russia to contribute to a new truly multi-polar world in collaboration with countries like China or the other BRICS countries. Very roughly you could call these people the “Putin people” (but you could also say that figures such as Ivanov, Rogozin, Shoigu and a few others are key personalities).
This is important because the list of (potentially sanctioned) people makes absolutely no distinctions between these two groups. Check out this article on RT entitled “Major Russian bank will no longer service defense industry over US sanctions fears“. It quotes the Alfa Bank CEO Mikhail Fridman whose net worth is estimated at $16.2 billion by Forbes, as saying that the magazine that Alfa-Bank was cutting ties with the Russia's defense industry, adding, “What can we do?”. Now look at the list, Appendix II, entry #23. Do you see who is there? Yup, the very same Mikhail Fridman!
Sharing is caring!
Kelly Whetter waters the tree planted in her son's honour in Bickford Park where he used to walk his dog.
“He was feisty, he had lots of personality, he knew a lot of people and it was telltale with the funeral, sadly. I couldn't believe how many people were there,” she told Global News on Wednesday. “I can't even believe I can say that 26 months later without crying.”
Her son, 18-year-old Gabriel Nikov, was gunned down near Yonge and Bloor streets in April 2016.
READ MORE: Mayor Tory speaks with public safety minister Goodale over Toronto gun violence
“There was a 10-second altercation and my son punched this guy,” she described calmly. “There were words, he punched him and there were words and he left.”
“But this 22-year-old man had a fully loaded semi-automatic gun in his pocket and shot my son in his back six times.”
Nikov was a student at Central Toronto Academy with hopes of attending business school.
“He was very handsome; he could have done anything,” she said.
As Whetter reminisced about her son, she cringed, thinking about all the other families who have lost loved ones during this recent spate of shootings in Toronto.

“I actually feel sick to my stomach, it makes me nauseous,” she said. “I stay at home a lot where it's safe.”
So far in 2018 there have been 52 murders in Toronto, and nearly half have been shooting deaths that have spanned across the city.
“It's a combination of a whole bunch of things involving guns and drugs and gang activities, turf wars, retaliation and stuff we have to take off the streets,” Toronto Mayor John Tory said this week.
Whetter said “it's [about] early intervention for sure — these people were not born with guns in their hands.”
She said she worries a lot these days and admitted she is a different person since losing her son.
“It stays with you forever. There's no such thing as closure or things get[ting] better. Sure, you have days where you might laugh, but it's intermittent with your sadness.”
“I think about all the people devastated. The parents, if there are siblings, the community,” she said.

And each time she hears about yet another incident of gun violence, she remembers her own son, who was robbed of the chance to realize his dreams.
“He loved music,” Whetter recalled. “A lot of young guys like the hip-hop and rap but he was very good and he did some stuff in the recording studio already. A lot of people liked his stuff. He was an artist, an animal lover.”

It's no secret that older people are prone to breaking their bones, but what isn't widely known is that women are more likely to experience broken bones than men.
Along with bringing awareness to mental health, the month of May is also dedicated to bringing awareness to Osteoporosis.
Osteoporosis is a condition when the bones become weak and brittle, and nearly eight million women in the U.S. over the age of 50 are affected by it, according to www.BoneNews.com.
Even if you're young and you fall, and experience pain Dr. Robert Blank, Professor of Medicine and Chief of the Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Clinical Nutrition, said you may be having issues with your bones. He recommends going to get checked out because it could affect you in the future.
“If you just fall down and break something that's a problem,” said Dr. Blank. “That means there's a weakness in your bones.”
Although May focuses on Osteoporosis in both sexes, Dr. Robert Blank used the month of May to bring awareness to Postmenopausal Osteoporosis, which solely focuses on women.
“Men can get it (osteoporosis), they just don't get it a lot,” said Dr. Blank.
Postmenopausal Osteoporosis refers to women who no longer menstruates. Estrogen helps women's bodies regulate the bone remodeling process, however after menopause the levels of estrogen in the female body declines. Due to this decline, women tend to lose bones quicker than men, according to Dr. Blank.
He says there is a list of things women, and men can do to decrease their chances of getting Osteoporosis.
Exercise to strengthen the bones just in case of a fall. Make sure you have good vision so you're less likely to run into things and fall. Learn the art of balance so it's not so easy for you to fall. And, diet because a healthy body is always a good thing.
Many people think falling it isn't a big deal, but with big falls come big injuries. For example, Dr. Blank said one out of four people who fall and break their hip is likely to die at least a year later from complications.
Although, there are treatments available such as physical therapy. There are also two common medications that help with Osteoporosis: antiresorptive drugs and anabolic drugs.
Antiresorptive helps to “restore skeletal balance by reducing bone turnover, primarily at the tissue level,” according to Webster dictionary. And, anabolic drugs have been shown to build new bones and is a preferred method to use, but insurance affects which medications patients receive, according to Dr. Blank.
But, no matter what age you are, it's best to get your bones checked after a serious fall.

UNITED NATIONS, Dec 11 (APP):One in three internet users in the world is a child and too little is done to protect them from the perils of the digital world, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said in a new report Monday.
Governments and private sectors have not kept up with the pace of change, exposing children to new risks and harms and leaving millions of the most disadvantaged children behind, according to the UN agency in its State of the World's Children 2017: Children in a Digital World report, which highlights digital divides and explores current debates about the impact of the Internet and social media on children's safety and well-being.
“For better and for worse, digital technology is now an irreversible fact of our lives,” UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake said in a statement. “In a digital world, our dual challenge is how to mitigate the harms while maximizing the benefits of the internet for every child.”
The report presents UNICEF's first comprehensive look at the various ways in which digital technology is affecting children's lives and life chances – identifying dangers as well as opportunities.
It argues that governments and the private sector have not kept up with the pace of change, leaving children exposed to new risks and harms, and leaving behind millions of the most disadvantaged children.
The report explores the benefits that digital technology can offer the most disadvantaged children, including by increasing their access to information; building skills for the digital workplace; and giving them a platform to connect and communicate their views.
However, the report shows that millions of children are missing out. Around one third of the world's youth, or 346 million young people, are not online – exacerbating inequities and reducing children's ability to participate in an increasingly digital economy.”The Internet was designed for adults, but it is increasingly used by children and young people and digital technology increasingly affects their lives and futures,” maintained Mr. Lake.
The report also examines how the internet increases children's vulnerability to risks and harms, including by misusing their private information, accessing harmful content, and cyberbullying.
The report notes that the ubiquitous presence of mobile devices has made online access for many children less supervised and potentially more dangerous.
Moreover, digital networks, like the ‘Dark Web' and cryptocurrencies, are enabling the worst forms of exploitation and abuse, such as trafficking and ‘made to order' online child sexual abuse.
The report presents current data and analysis about: children's online usage; the impact of digital technology on their wellbeing; digital ‘addiction' and the possible effect of screen time on brain development.
According to the report, young people are the most connected age group. Worldwide, they have a 71 per cent presence online compared with 48 per cent of the total population.
However, African youth are the least connected, with around three out of five not online, compared to just one in 25 in Europe.
Approximately 56 per cent of all websites are in English and many children cannot find content they understand or that is culturally relevant.
It also reveals that more than nine in 10 child sexual abuse URLs are hosted in Canada, France, the Netherlands, the Russian Federation and the United States.
The report says that only collective action by governments, the private sector, families and children themselves can help level the digital playing field and make the internet safer and more accessible for children.
Practical recommendations include safeguarding children's privacy and identities online and putting children at the centre of digital policy.
“Digital policies, practices, and products should better reflect children's needs, children's perspectives and children's voices,” Lake concluded.
KHAIRPUR : Two youth committed suicide in separate incidents near here on Monday. According to details, a youth, Ghulam Muhammad Shar, shot himself dead with a pistol in his house in village Izat Khan Shar in the jurisdiction of Faiz Gunj police station.
The cause of suicide is stated to be some petty issue.
Meanwhile another youth Mujeebur Rahman Katper committed suicide by drinking pesticide at village Jiskani.
He was brought to Kotdiji hospital where doctors confirmed his death. The cause of suicide is stated to be poverty.
HONOLULU (AP)  Lawyers representing Hawaii in the state's long-running fight against Trump administration travel bans have filed a motion asking a judge to let them challenge the latest version of the policy.
Hawaii filed the motion Friday asking a federal judge for permission to file an amended lawsuit targeting the third travel ban.
The latest travel ban removes Sudan from the list of affected countries and adds Chad and North Korea, along with several officials from the government of Venezuela. It's scheduled to take effect Oct. 18.
State Attorney General Doug Chin said the new ban still discriminates on the basis of nationality, exceeds the president's legal authority and seeks to implement his Muslim ban.

Chin has been challenging President Donald Trump on travel bans since February, after Trump sought to bar new visas for people from seven mostly Muslim countries.
COLUMBUS, Ga. — The Columbus Blue Devils boys soccer team is #7 in the state in class 4A. And they are tied for first in region 1 with Shaw and Northside.
A year ago, the Blue Devils only lost four games all season, but bowed out in the first round of the playoffs against Stars Mill. This year's team won their rematch with Stars Mill and team captain AJ Yerkes says this year's seniors are determined to make a deep run in the playoffs.
“Our seniors are getting really intense. we just played our previous game against east coweta and we won 3-0. and we lost to them last year so it's getting ramped up. we're getting ready for the postseason. it's a different mood around the team with the seniors,” says Yerkes.
Columbus will be at Brookstone on 4/18 and have senior night on 4/20 at home to wrap up their regular season.

Kory said the material for the new poetry collection came from Cohen's vast collection of notebooks that he had started transcribing digitally many years ago.
"For a poetry book, it's going to be a long book," said Kory. "It's going to be a significant work. People will really be able to enjoy it."
Cohen wrote the poems "as recent as days before he passed away and as early as probably the 1970s," said Kory, noting the multi-faceted artist was always returning to his older poems to rework them.
"His passing was unexpected. It's not like his mind ever weakened. He was crystal clear, at the top of his game, to the very last moments of his life."
The illustrations that will be in the book come from a collection of self-portraits Cohen did.
"The comic side of Leonard Cohen," said Kory.
"There's this marvellous collection of self-portraits and he says, 'You should publish these as a comic book.' They are absolutely so funny."
McClelland and Stewart publisher Jared Bland said "The Flame" is "full of Leonard Cohen's signature combination of grace, humour, wisdom, and heartbreaking insight into the fragility and beauty of this world we all share."
"It will endure as a testament to his humanity and genius, and delight his millions of fans around the world," said Bland.
Asked if this is absolutely Cohen's final book, Kory quipped: "Well, what does the word 'final' mean?"
"It's his final book insofar as it's a book where he selected all the elements, he worked on all the pages and had their order and so forth," he said. "Anything else, we would have an editor who would have to take existing work from his archives."

PanARMENIAN.Net - The lack of proper international reaction to Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev's territorial claims against Armenia propel more such declarations by the Azeri leader, Armenian foreign ministry spokesman Tigran Balayan said in a tweet.
Balayan's comments came after Aliyev on Monday, March 19 once again made territorial claims against Armenia.
"As expected: Lack of proper international reaction to @presidentaz territorial claims towards #Armenia, inspired him to claim larger territories," Balayan tweeted.
Addressing the Azerbaijanis on the beginning of Novruz, Aliyev said a big part of the territory of present-day Armenia “is the historical Azerbaijani land.”
According to him, numerous books, maps confirm the aforesaid, while historical books allegedly reveal that at the beginning of the 19th century, the absolute majority of the Yerevan Khanate's population, 80% in particular, were Azerbaijanis.
Wikipedia's Italian and Spanish language versions have temporarily shut off access to their respective versions of the free online encyclopedia in Europe to protest against controversial components of a copyright reform package ahead of a key vote in the EU parliament tomorrow.
The protest follows a vote by the EU parliament's legal affairs committee last month which backed the reforms — including the two most controversial elements: Article 13, which makes platforms directly liable for copyright infringements by their users — pushing them towards pre-filtering all content uploads, with all the associated potential chilling effects for free expression; and Article 11, which targets news aggregator business models by creating a neighboring right for snippets of journalistic content — aka ‘the link tax', as critics dub it.
Visitors to Wikipedia in many parts of the EU (and further afield) are met with a banner which urges them to defend the open Internet against the controversial proposal by calling their MEP to voice their opposition to a measure critics describe as ‘censorship machines', warning it will “weaken the values, culture and ecosystem on which Wikipedia is based”.
Clicking on a button to ‘call your MEP' links through to anti-Article 13 campaign websites, saveyourinternet.eu, where users can search for the phone number of their MEP and/or send an email to protest against the measure. The initiative is backed by a large coalition of digital and civil rights groups — including the EFF, the Open Rights Group, and the Center for Democracy & Technology.
In a longer letter to visitors explaining its action, the Spanish Wikipedia community writes that: “If the proposal were approved in its current version, actions such as sharing a news item on social networks or accessing it through a search engine would become more complicated on the Internet; Wikipedia itself would be at risk.”
The Spanish language version of Wikipedia will remain dark throughout the EU parliament vote — which is due to take place at 10 o'clock (UTC) on July 5.
“We want to continue offering an open, free, collaborative and free work with verifiable content. We call on all members of the European Parliament to vote against the current text, to open it up for discussion and to consider the numerous proposals of the Wikimedia movement to protect access to knowledge; among them, the elimination of articles 11 and 13, the extension of the freedom of panorama to the whole EU and the preservation of the public domain,” it adds.
The Italian language version of Wikipedia went dark yesterday.
While the protest banners about the reform are appearing widely across Wikipedia, the decisions to block out encyclopedia content are less widespread — and are being taken by each local community of editors.
We are community driven and so each community makes their own decision. I think we should get more organized in the future so that we could vote more quickly or earlier! — Jimmy Wales (@jimmy_wales) July 3, 2018
We had only a very short time from the largely unexpected (by me anyway!) JURI committee vote to have a community discussion. We move slowly sometimes, and woke up too late. https://t.co/fVjIZ4aZPr — Jimmy Wales (@jimmy_wales) July 3, 2018
As you'd expect, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales has been a very vocal critic of Article 13 — including lashing out at whoever was in control of the European Commission's Twitter feed yesterday when they tried to suggest that online encyclopedias will not be affected by the proposal — by suggesting they would not be “considered” to be giving access to “large amounts of unauthorised protected content” by claiming most of their content would fall outside the scope of the law because it's covered by Creative Commons licenses. (An interpretation of the proposed rules that anti-Article 13 campaigners dispute.)
And the commissioners drafting this portion of the directive do appear to have been mostly intending to regulate YouTube — which has been a target for record industry ire in recent years, over the relatively small royalties paid to artists vs streaming music services.
But critics argue this is a wrongheaded, sledgehammer-to-crack a nut approach to lawmaking — which will have the unintended consequence of damaging free expression and access to information online.
Wales shot back at the EC's tweet — saying it's “deeply inappropriate for the European Commission to be lobbying publicly and misleading the public in this way”.
Deeply inappropriate for the European Commission to be lobbying publicly *and* misleading the public in this way. — Jimmy Wales (@jimmy_wales) July 3, 2018
A little later in the same Twitter thread, as more users had joined the argument, he added: “The Wikipedia community is not so narrow minded as to let the rest of the Internet suffer just because we are big enough that they try to throw us a bone. Justice matters.”
The EU parliament will vote as a whole tomorrow — when we'll find out whether or not MEPs have been swayed by this latest #SaveYourInternet campaign.
GUCA, Serbia (Reuters) - The 57h Guca Brass Band Festival, Serbia's liveliest traditional music event, has attracted tens of thousands of people crowding the streets and savoring the trumpet beat.
Guca, a normally sleepy town with only 3,700 people in the rolling hills of southwestern Serbia, is hosting the country's biggest party, with 50 brass bands competing for the coveted Golden Trumpet.
Launched in 1961 with just four bands and only 2,500 visitors, Guca has since received more than 15 million people.
The “Dragacevo Trumpeters Assembly,” as the festival is officially called, now lures not only Serbians but tourists from around the world.

"One Serbian girl in Germany told me about it ... and now I'm here, it's great, I love it," said Maria, a Bulgarian tourist in her 20s.
The music has a long tradition in Serbia - it goes back to a royal decree establishing a military brass band in 1831.

The bands, those competing for the prize and those weaving through dozens of tents teeming with guests eating, drinking and partying, make good money from tips.
Most visitors drink beer and plum brandy and eat barbecued meat or a local delicacy, seasoned spicy cabbage with three kinds of meat which simmers for hours in large clay pots.
In an attempt to avoid the serious road accidents which have marred the festival in the past, police have ordered all drivers along the two roads leading in and out of Guca to take a breathalyzer test.
Ray Rice will contribute to the NFL's annual social responsibility presentation to players and staff this year. The former running back for the Ravens, whose career came to an end after video emerged of him punching his fiancée in an elevator in 2014, will discuss the impact his behavior had on his life.
"We shot a video that just highlights everything that I've been talking about decision-making, how things happened in my life, how things unfolded," Rice said. The guys get to hear it from me, how it unraveled."
This is the first time Rice has formally worked with the NFL since the elevator video became public in September 2014. The segment he worked on with the NFL will be a short component of what is generally an hourlong program for all its employees.
"I've been building relationships with [the NFL front office], and it's a mutual thing," Rice told ESPN. "The NFL has a great platform, they reach a lot of people. It's part of our responsibility to reach out for not the on field opportunity but off field too."

This is the fourth year that the NFL has put together a video and educational program related specifically to conduct issues. Last year the emphasis was on DUI, sexual assault and gun safety. In past years, the NFL asked former wide receiver Donte Stallworth to participate in a video on driving under the influence. Stallworth was suspended from the NFL for a year in 2009 after pleading guilty to DUI manslaughter.
This year the NFL is hoping to focus on healthy choices and healthy masculinity for the video, which will ultimately be released for schools and other programs to use in educating athletes and students.
"We started bouncing the idea around where what if Ray could share the journey he'd been on and the choices that led him to his series of bad decisions that led him to where he is now," said Anna Isaacson, the NFL's senior vice president of social responsibility. "And that wasn't an easy decision to make."
Rice has spent the last three years with his now-wife Janay and their two children, Rayven and Jaylen, and the family has moved back to the area where he grew up. In the time since his act of violence became a symbol of the NFL's failings to deal with this issue, Rice has been to therapy and tried to learn about the issue. He has also spoken to high school and college teams about the importance of decision-making.
Rice's video was the catalyst the NFL used to revamp its personal conduct policies and educational program, including issues such as domestic violence and information about issues like consent in the context of sexual assault.
"I think that the league now, when my situation happened we knew that the policy wasn't strong enough," Rice said. "The one thing I know the league is doing they're continuing to educate these players and the severity of this issue. You look at a guy like Joe Mixon, and I don't know him personally, but you'd hope before the draft anyone who has an opportunity to mentor him, make him understand the real issues."
Like Rice's video, a video of Oklahoma prospect Joe Mixon has sparked discussion about how much has changed in terms of what the NFL will tolerate from players. In that video, Mixon punches a woman. Although it is technically not domestic violence since he wasn't in a relationship with the woman in the video, Mixon's assault will not prevent him from being drafted.
"I really hope the kid has exhausted all his resources to really, to really understand what this issue is," Rice said. "I would not be opposed to telling him my story, but he'll get a chance to see it."
At age 30, Rice would still like to play professional football, although no NFL team has signed him since he became the face of a massive perception problem for the league. His biggest contribution now may be to try to prevent other players from making the same mistake.
"I think that my résumé on the field and off the field, the way things unraveled, they will hear a true message and hopefully it changes the way you think," Rice said.
ISLAMABAD, Aug 14 (APP): The Independence Day of Pakistan was observed
with great zeal and fervour in Denmark on Monday.
The main event of the celebrations was the flag hoisting ceremony held
at the Embassy of Pakistan in Copenhagen, said a press release received here.
The flag hoisting was performed by Ambassador Syed Zulfiqar Gardezi.

Kelowna RCMP are asking for the public's help in identifying a man suspected of robbing a Kelowna bank on Tuesday afternoon.
According to police, the robbery took place at the Royal Bank on Cooper Road, just before 3 p.m. Police say the suspect calmly entered the bank, approached a wicket and produced a note to an employee, which demanded money. The suspect ran from the building towards Harvey Avenue with an undisclosed amount of cash.

Video surveillance captured the man just as he entered the bank.
The suspect is described as a non-white male, possibly Fijian, standing approximately 5-foot-6. He has a medium build, medium-length messy black hair and a short beard. He was last seen wearing a pair of black sweat pants, a black baseball hat with a white emblem, a light grey jacket and carrying a green re-usable bag.

“We are turning to the general public for their help identifying our robbery suspect,” said RCMP Cpl. Jesse O'Donaghey. “We're urging anyone who may recognize this man to come forward immediately to speak with our investigators.”
If you recognize the suspect, or you have any information that may assist police, you are asked to contact the Kelowna RCMP at 250-762-3300 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.
Advertisers who chose to sit on the Super Bowl sidelines while PepsiCo, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola bought ads in the event may still have a chance to get in the game.
With less than 48 hours to go before NBC's pre-game coverage of Super Bowl LII kicks off Sunday, the network has yet to announce its high-priced inventory is sold out.
Toyota on Friday announced it made a late decision to expand its Super Bowl buy to three ads from two. And while the two spots already planned for use were created specifically for the event, Toyota is taking its third commercial from its current ad campaign. “Toyota was thrilled NBC could accommodate an additional spot,” said a spokeswoman for Saatchi & Saatchi, the automaker's longtime ad agency. Wix.com, a web-services company that has advertised in the past three Super Bowls said Friday that it, too, had decided to purchase a 30-second spot – even though it had in recent days worked to get publicity for a decision not to get into the game this year. “Yesterday, we got a great offer to run a spot in the Super Bowl, and although we had less than 24 hours to decide and deliver, we made the decision to go for it,” said Omer Shai, the company's chief marketing officer, in a statement.
A spokesman for NBC Sports declined to comment on the network's ad-sales process. NBC has been seeking more than $5 million for ad packages related to the broadcast.
In mid-January, NBC indicated it had fewer than ten 30-second spots left to sell in the February 4 broadcast of the event. Dan Lovinger, the executive who oversees sports ad sales for NBCUniversal, indicated the company expected the Super Bowl to generate around $500 million in national TV advertising associated with its broadcast, pre- and post-game shows, and a special post-event broadcast of “This Is Us.” That's essentially what the first two hours of NBC's “Today” generates over the course of a year. NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke indicated during a late-January conference call with Comcast investors that the game was “essentially sold out” – but to people in the industry, such a phrase means there's still some business left to be done.
TV networks for years used to sell out a Super Bowl broadcast by the preceding fall, but ad buyers say a new plethora of football events – Thursday-night football games, streaming video of those games and the occasional YouTube broadcast – have slowed momentum behind the gridiron classic. Indeed, the last time a network announced sell-out weeks in advance took place when Fox managed to close out inventory for Super Bowl XLVIII – broadcast in 2014 – in December of the previous year. In 2017, Fox never said whether or not it had sold out its broadcast of Super Bowl LI. CBS made no sell-out announcement for its 2016 broadcast of Super Bowl 50. NBCU announced sell-out of its last Super Bowl broadcast – Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 – just days before kickoff.
Sometimes, networks don't announce a final sell-out because executives are working behind the scenes to enlist sponsors to take over inventory from other clients who decide they no longer have a good reason to advertise in the game. The costs are high, and no one wants to run a commercial that won't gain attention. In other instances, the network may try to get the most money it can from an advertiser late to the sales process that suddenly finds impetus to be part of the event.
Meanwhile, NBCUniversal is releasing details about the properties it will promote during the Super Bowl. Viewers who watch the entire thing will see two promos for “Today,” one highlighting the fact that the morning show will broadcast from the PyeongChang Winter Olympics in just a few days' time. The other uses the slogan, “Welcome to ‘Today.'” The audience will also see a promo for “NBC Nightly News” centered on its anchor, Lester Holt. NBCU will air a ten-second promo for its Spanish-language broadcaster, Telemundo Deportes, highlighting its coming broadcast of the FIFA World Cup. Announcer Andres Cantor will give his signature goal call.
And NBC Sports will make sure viewers know about the company's coming Winter Olympics broadcast. The unit has produced five 60-second commercials to run throughout Super Bowl Sunday. One featuring Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn is scheduled to run during halftime of Super Bowl LII this Sunday on NBC. The promo is set to the Alycia Keys song “Girl on Fire” and offers a dramatization of her life from childhood through injuries and rehab to what may be her final Olympic Games. Many purists don't consider halftime spots and promos to be part of the overall Super Bowl ad roster, but most viewers may not make such a distinction.

He told the judge the crown plans to file a dangerous offender designation if Pritchard is convicted, and he felt he doesn't have enough experience to proceed in the matters.
It is expected lawyer Tonii Roulston will take him on as a client.
Two separate trial dates have already been set – the first from April 9 – 13, 2018 and the second from Nov. 13-30 2018.
He was originally arrested by Coaldale RCMP in January, with additional charges being laid in May.

In Defense of Ethiopia: New PM is Fixing the Broken System
Lawfare
Fixing Ethiopia Requires More Than a New Prime Minister
Ethiopia's current State of Emergency, implemented on February 16 after Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalign stepped down from power, is the second time since October 2016 that the government has declared martial law. According to Human Rights Watch, “some of Ethiopia's staunch Western allies, fearful of what a destabilized Ethiopia would mean for their interests, have spoken openly of their concerns and urged a change in tactics.” What these allies fail to appreciate is that these tactics are not a bug in the system of governance in Ethiopia—they are a feature. The Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), the hegemonic party that's been in power since 1991, has tightly controlled the country's political system, stifling civil society and criminalizing dissent. The selection of Abiy Ahmed as prime minister—marking the first time in 27 years that the EPRDF has had an Oromo has occupied the office, despite the fact that the Oromo is the country's largest ethnic group—is insufficient to stabilize the country.
Michael O'Hanlon, the co-director of the Brookings Institution's Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence, has described the country as “one of the most important countries on the continent by almost any measure.” The measure most pressing for U.S. interests, however, is the country's role as a strategic regional counterterrorism partner. Ethiopia's contributions to AMISOM, in particular, have endeared it to the U.S. national security community. Terrence Lyons, a professor at the School of Conflict Analysis and Resolution at George Mason University, considers the country an “irreplaceable center of gravity” for the Horn of Africa. As a long-standing U.S. partner in counterterrorism operations in the Horn of Africa, the effects of Ethiopia's stability extends well beyond the country's borders. Without legislative overhauls that promote democratic accountability, the country will continue to be beset by instability. Unfortunately, the country's history suggests that the party will respond to the current crisis with more repression…

Tue, Feb 14: In an effort to build bridges with the city's homeless community, Montreal police officers are serving dinner at the Old Brewery Mission. Global's Elysia Bryan-Baynes reports.
The holidays are over and it seems Mother Nature is back to business as freezing rain is expected to wash over southern Quebec starting Tuesday.
“A Colorado low (a low pressure that forms typically in the winter) will reach the Great Lakes,” explained officials with Environment Canada.
“As this system approaches, freezing rain could affect southern Quebec beginning Tuesday, making for a difficult morning or afternoon rush hour.”
The special weather statement is in effect for:
Châteauguay – La Prairie
Laval
Longueuil – Varennes
Montreal island
Commuters are being asked to be careful as roads, highways, sidewalks and parking lots could become icy, slippery and even treacherous.
Freezing rain warnings are issued when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces.
Here are a few tips to stay safe:
SHIKARPUR - Family members of a four-year-old-boy, Muhammad Umar, son of Sadam Hussain Kakepoto, registered their protest against police's raid in their village in front of Garhi Yasin Press Club on Wednesday and alleged that their boy had died due to police's fear.
It is reminded here that a heavy contingent of police raided village Maroon Kakepota in the limits of Garhi Yasin Police Station, some 15 kilometers from here on Wednesday morning.
According to the family members, Hassina, Mansoor Khatoon, Ameer Khatoon and others police raided their village and picked up a boy, Muneer Kakepoto and also took away his cattle.
They demanded the high-ups to take notice of the incident and play their role in providing justice to them as per law.
On the other hand, Deputy Superintendent Police [DSP] Garhi Yasin Ghulam Hussain Gadhi, , in a conversation with this scribe, said that the boy had died when police reached there. “The deceased was suffering from Thalassemia and he had been admitted to a local clinic several times,” he said, and added, “Police had conducted raid in the village to arrest the persons, who had murdered number of people and committed other heinous crimes as well.”
An FIR was not registered till this story was filed.

Score a victory for common sense.
It was announced Monday that beginning in 2018, golf's major professional tours will no longer allow viewer call-ins to dictate potential rules violations captured on television broadcasts.
Editor's Picks Golf fans no longer able to call in violations Golf fans will no longer be able to call in or email possible rules violations they witness while watching broadcasts of tournaments on television.
This is a triumph for the purists, for fans of the game who never believed the intricacies of the rule book should be enforced and litigated in the aftermath of such activity -- and certainly not from a couch potato with a remote control in one hand and a phone dialing some clandestine number in the other.
This is a win for those who witnessed Tiger Woods' post-round "witch hunt" at the 2013 Masters or Lexi Thompson's called-in penalty at this year's ANA Inspiration and felt queasy about the eventual result. After all, try calling in an NFL pass interference penalty or an NBA traveling violation from the comforts of home. Your opinion will be treated to nothing more than a lusty dial tone.

Ostensibly, golf will now feature a similar lack of democracy, with on-site video officials charged with serving as the last line of defense in protecting the rules.
The worst part of the previous system wasn't even the fact that random fans could adversely impact the very proceedings taking place inside a box mounted to their living room walls. It was that this was never a level playing field. Until the time when every golfer's entire round was beamed live to spectators around the globe, this was always going to affect those being shown on camera more than their less visible counterparts.
Or perhaps more importantly: It was always going to impact a Sunday afternoon contender more than a Thursday morning competitor.
Just eight months ago, Thompson was nabbed by the gotcha-police when she was found to have improperly marked her ball on the green. She lost two strokes due to the violation, another two for signing an incorrect scorecard and wound up losing that major championship.
On Monday, she took to Twitter to address the revised rule: "I applaud the USGA and the R&A for their willingness to revise the Rules of Golf to address certain unfortunate situations that have arisen several times in the game of golf. In my case, I am thankful no one else will have to deal with an outcome such as mine in the future."
It's safe to say that Thompson's result wasn't the sole rationale for this decision, but golf's powers-that-be should be commended for realizing that it was a perilous final straw.
"All involved with administering the game are concerned with the impact that these types of rulings were continuing to have," explained Thomas Pagel, the USGA's senior director for rules of golf and amateur status. "[The] new set of video-review protocols are not a direct result of the Lexi Thompson ruling, but it is safe to say that it was the last of several similar rulings that highlighted the need to act quickly on the matter."
The genesis of viewer call-ins dates to the 1987 Andy Williams Open, in the landmark case of Craig Stadler vs. Building A Stance. In contention during the third round at Torrey Pines, the man known as the Walrus was forced to play a shot on his knees from under a tree. He placed a towel on the ground, later explaining, "I didn't want to finish the round looking like a gardener." One day later, a viewer called in from Iowa to point out the transgression. Since he'd already signed the card, a share of second place was deemed a disqualification.
Since then, golf's caretakers have endured three decades of allowing unaffected observers to affect potential outcomes. All of which is why Monday's announcement is being hailed as a celebration of the game's long-awaited realization that self-enforcement beats citizen arrests.
Of course, like any unanimous call to action, the notable pros instantly outweigh the inscrutable cons. They do exist, though. Just wait until the first time a professional golfer unknowingly commits a violation that isn't captured by the on-site video official, either. It won't take long before the social-media masses raise their figurative pitchforks, wondering why their voices can no longer be heard.
That day might come, but for now, the celebration continues.
Too often, golf tournaments have been decided on something less than rational thinking. Common sense has prevailed in this match, even if it was long overdue.
Okay, there have surely been worse bestsellers in the 48 years since, but probably none that were deliberately bad. Producer Sam Kim has assembled the first-hand story of the newspaper writers who pulled of one of the great “literary” (if that's the word) hoaxes of the 20th century. (audio)
GABORONE (Reuters) - Exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama has cancelled a planned visit to Botswana because of exhaustion, his office said, a move that is likely to be welcomed by China, a major investor in the African country.
The Dalai Lama had been expected to address a human rights conference in the capital Gaborone on Aug. 17-19 and meet Botswana's president during the trip.
Visits by the Dalai Lama to foreign countries infuriate China, and it stepped up warnings to Botswana last month, with its Foreign Ministry spokesman demanding "the relevant country earnestly respect China's core interests and make the correct political decision on this matter".
Botswana reacted by saying that as a sovereign state, it retained the right to permit anyone to enter the country.
The Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in India, has long been at loggerheads over Tibet with China, which brands him a reactionary and separatist. The Dalai Lama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, says he seeks greater rights, including religious freedom, and true autonomy for Tibetans.
In a statement late on Friday the Dalai Lama's office said his doctors had advised him to avoid undertaking long journeys for the next few weeks.
"During the past few weeks, His Holiness has found that carrying out his activities has left him unusually tired," it said.
"Although he had been eagerly looking forward to visiting Gaborone ... His Holiness has reluctantly had to concede that his 82-year old body was telling him to rest."
China's fast-growing demand for raw materials has made it one of the biggest investors in Africa and its largest trade partner. Chinese state-owned companies have been awarded contracts to build roads, dams, power stations and airports in Botswana.
Kevin Plank, the founder and chief executive of Under Armour, is the latest high profile leader of a major American company to leave President Donald Trump's American Manufacturing Council.
In a statement tweeted out late on Monday, Plank wrote in his statement, “Under Armour engages in innovation and sports, not politics.”
Plank's full statement is below. In it, he tweets “I love our country & company. I am stepping down from the council to focus on inspiring & uniting through power of sport.”

He joins Merck Pharma's chief executive Kenneth Frazier, who announced his departure from the President's council in a statement earlier today.
Both departures come as a rebuke to what many have called the President's inadequate response to the violence over the weekend. One person, Heather Heyer, was killed on Saturday and another 19 people were injured during a counterprotest against a rally by neo-Nazis and members of the Ku Klux Klan and its various splinter groups in Charlottesville, Va.
Saturday's violence was sparked by the planned nazi rally to protest the removal of a statue of confederate general Robert E. Lee from a park near the city's downtown.
There's been response yet from the President to the latest departure. When Frazier announced his withdrawal, the President immediately responded on his social network of choice.
Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2017
While Plank and Frazier are gone, several executives still remain involved with the Council, they include Andy Liveris from Dow Chemical, Michael Dell of Dell Technologies, Jeff Immelt of General Electric, Denise Morrison of Campbell's Soup Co., and Denis Muilenberg of Boeing.
An earlier decision from the President to reject the Paris Accords and its global compact to address climate change prompted the departure of tech's favorite chief executive, Elon Musk.
At the time Musk tweeted, “Am I departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.”

Footage shows officer standing up, turning off his siren and talking clearly to the suspect

Experts say the powerful video of Alek Minassian's arrest reveals a textbook case of an officer defusing danger through a series of life-and-death choices based on training and a calm mind.
The footage shows an officer who police sources identified as Const. Ken Lam standing up, turning off his siren and talking clearly to the suspect, even as the dead and injured lay along Yonge Street after being struck down by a white rental van.
“This is exactly the type of de-escalation … and response to these types of confrontations that we hope to see,” said Ontario ombudsman Paul Dube.
Lam calmly holstered his service weapon, held up his baton and handcuffed Minassian as he lay on the sidewalk.
“He gave himself the space and time. He assessed the threat and realized he had options other than firing his weapon.”
Dube published a June 2016 report calling for increased police training on defusing dangerous situations after several high-profile deaths of people with mental illnesses who confronted officers.
He said the constable's actions are a sign that police are gaining from training that includes simulations of tense standoffs with people who are emotionally unstable.
Sammy Yatim's death in July 2013 in Toronto — where the mentally ill man was shot multiple times as officers surrounded an empty streetcar he was on — helped prompt reforms.
RELATED: Toronto van attack suspect faces 10 counts of first-degree murder
In recent years at least one day has been added to Toronto police in-service training on de-escalation and “dealing with people in crisis,” said Mike McCormack, president of the police union in Toronto.
The program is part of a mandatory three-day training for all officers that incorporates crisis communication, de-escalation and containment measures.
“A major component of this training includes a variety of scenarios that are designed to evaluate officer's skills in effectively communicating with people in crisis and those who are suffering from a possible mental disorder,” said an email from the union.
Meanwhile, recruits at the Ontario Police College are now receiving more training, as are a number of police forces around the province, though it's yet to be a provincewide standard, said Dube.
Christian Leuprecht, a professor at Royal Military College in Kingston, Ont., who studies policing and security issues, said Lam's actions were “textbook” examples of the latest approaches.
The result is a suspect who is now in custody and who may be able to shed light on why the devastating incident occurred, he said.
RELATED: Officer's actions ‘one shining moment' in wake of attack
“That particular situation yesterday, the way in which it went down was nothing short of remarkable,” Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders told a news conference Tuesday.
Saunders said he spoke to Lam, and the officer is doing well and thankful for the public's support. Lam told him ”he defaulted to his training,” the chief said.
Police say Minassian, 25, of Richmond Hill, Ont., is the lone suspect in the attack. He was charged Tuesday with 10 counts of first-degree murder and 13 counts of attempted murder.
Leuprecht noted how Lam only stood up after carefully observing the suspect and determining he didn't have a gun.
Lam spoke loudly and calmly, even as the suspect encouraged the officer to shoot him. When he claimed to have a gun in his pocket, Lam replied, “I don't care,” and repeatedly instructed him to “Get down.”
Leuprecht said Lam seemed to go further than some others might have when he decided to approach and arrest the suspect, rather than wait for backup.
“There's an impressive moment when he takes his firearm, puts it in his holster, he goes over with his baton, and he handcuffs the individual,” he said.
“I think that goes above and beyond the call of duty. He could have had a knife. He could have had a suicide belt.”
However, the university professor, who is currently teaching in Australia, says if the constable had waited for backup, the situation might have escalated and had a different outcome.
“The opportunity to ensure the individual could no longer pose a chance of harm to himself or to others is what that officer jumped at,” said Leuprecht.
McCormack said while additional training is a factor, he knows Lam well enough to say his personality factored in.
He described him as an intelligent, relatively young officer who is highly skilled and trained.
McCormack says the constable — who is in his 30s — positioned himself well so that he could see precisely what was unfolding before him.
“By his actions he did not perceive the threat to escalate and that is why he did not use his firearm,” he said.

The City of Vancouver has opened a temporary support centre for families and survivors affected by the national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls (MMIWG).
The inquiry will be coming to the Vancouver-area in April to hold community hearings, and the city says it is opening the Saa-ust centre at 44 East Cordova in order to create a safe space for participants.
Vancouver managing director of social policy Mary Clare Zak says she expects hundreds of people to use the facility.

“Because we're talking about families, we're talking about survivors, and families of the heart,” she said. “So people who have friends and acquaintances, all kinds of relatives. So we expect it to be well-used.”
Saa-ust means “to lift up” in Coast Salish, and the city says it will provide services there intended to help with the healing process.
Those include trauma-informed counselling services, a ceremony space and access to elders and knowledge keepers and a variety of arts and cultural activities from First Nations across Canada.

“We're thankful to see this process underway and coming to the West Coast. We know it's critically important to many people, all of Canada across the land in dealing with a great tragedy that we've been living with for far too many years,” said Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson.
The centre will be open daily form 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. until late April.

The newly minted Ontario government's decision to withdraw from the cap-and-trade carbon pricing scheme may have put the province's slice of a $1.4-billion green fund in jeopardy.
Environment Minister Catherine McKenna said in a statement on Wednesday that the government is currently evaluating what Premier Doug Ford‘s plans will mean for the portion of federal funds that went towards a now-axed provincial renovation rebate program, along with Ontario's funding under the Low-Carbon Economy Leadership Fund as a whole.
READ MORE: Ottawa to unveil details of $2B carbon fund to most, not all, provinces
The program provides funding to provinces that adopt the federal climate-change plan, which requires a price be put on carbon emissions.
“By cancelling Ontario's cap-and-trade plan, the Ontario government is making it clear that it is not taking climate action, and is effectively withdrawing from Canada's national climate-change plan without a plan of their own,” McKenna stated.

Ontario was slated to receive nearly $420 million towards fulfilling greenhouse-gas emissions-reduction targets. This spring, as part of that commitment, the federal government announced up to $100 million for GreenON, which provides rebates for residential and commercial energy-efficiency retrofits.
No funds have been delivered to Ontario so far under the program, a spokesperson for the minister said.
Ford's government, which was elected to a 76-seat majority last month, has announced the program is being discontinued.
WATCH: Trudeau reflects on Doug Ford's decision to not bring in a carbon tax
Premier Ford campaigned on a plan to withdraw from the cap-and-trade market with Quebec and California as part of his promise to lower the price of gasoline by 10 cents per litre.
The cap-and-trade plan, implemented by the Liberals last year to tackle climate change, limits the amount of pollution companies in certain industries can emit, but allows them to purchase more from the government or other companies.
WATCH: Doug Ford says his first act as Premier will be to scrap the ‘carbon tax'
Cap-and-trade auctions in Ontario have generated close to $3 billion already, some of which went towards funding programs such as GreenON.
Ford has called cap and trade a government “cash grab” that does nothing for the environment and makes fuel and other products more expensive for consumers.

PanARMENIAN.Net - Foreign minister Edward Nalbandian and the OSCE Minsk Group co-chairs on Friday, October 6 discussed issues concerning an upcoming meeting of Armenian and Azerbaijani presidents.
Co-chairs Igor Popov of Russia, Stéphane Visconti of France and Andrew Schofer of the United States are currently on an official visit in Yerevan.
At the meeting, the sides weighed in on the current situation on the Nagorno Karabakh contact line, as well as Armenia and the co-chairs' joint efforts in the peace process.
The OSCE Minsk Group co-chairs said in a statement earlier that they are organizing a meeting between the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan.
Under its current planning the government would not be able to implement the new IT systems needed to cope with changed border behaviours, the PAC warns
Parliament's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has warned that government departments will not have the IT systems in place to deal with radically changed border controls when Britain leaves the European Union (EU) in March 2019, creating a potentially “risky” situation when the shift takes place.
In a report on the issue, the PAC said that departments say they are planning for a scenario in which the UK leaves the EU without a transition period in place – a so-called “hard Brexit” – but are not making the necessary preparations for the IT systems or physical infrastructure that would be necessary to deal with such an eventuality.
“We are very concerned that their assumptions are risky and do not allow for changes in behaviours by companies trading across the border or people crossing it,” the PAC said in its study. “Officials are relying too much on there being a transitional period in order to have the time to develop the new systems and infrastructure that may be required.”
The PAC urged the government's Border Planning Group and departments to accelerate detailed planning for a “no-deal” Brexit and to present a report on the matter by June of next year.
Border planning
It was “worrying” that the group said it could not make plans for the Irish border and the 300 border crossing points because it “needed the political process to go further before it could fully understand the issue”, the PAC said.
The number of decisions needing to be made about permitting people or goods to cross the border could increase by 230 percent and 360 percent respectively, depending on the result of current negotiations, according to the committee's estimates.
The government bodies that may need to make radical changes in how they approach border issues includes the Home Office's Border Force, HMRC and Defra, the PAC said.
Previous border IT snarls, including the abandonment of the e-Borders programme, mean many border processes rely on ageing IT systems or are paper-based.
PAC chair Meg Hillier MP said government's assumption of no additional border risks emerging from EU exit was inappropriate with the exit deadline approaching.
‘Wishful thinking'
“Against the hard deadline of Brexit it is borderline reckless—an over-reliance on wishful thinking that risks immediately exposing the UK to an array of damaging scenarios,” she said in a statement.
Last month the PAC warned of border chaos if HMRC's new customs system is not running by the time Brexit occurs, and Hillier said the government's lack of preparedness now seems to be more widespread than previously thought.
“It is now alarming to note such weak contingency planning extends across government departments,” she said.

On Saturday night, Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme kicked photographer Chelsea Lauren while “in a state of being lost in performance.”
On Sunday, Homme apologized on QOTSA's social media accounts.
“I don't have any excuse or reason … I was a total d**k … I'm truly sorry, and I hope you're okay.” He continues, “I've made a lot of mistakes in my life, and last night was definitely one of them.”
View the full apology below.
Prior to Homme's apology, Lauren posted the following:
The Hawaii High School Athletic Association tipped off the 2017 Snapple Boys Basketball State Championships Monday, February 13, with a new format in the Division I bracket. League runner-ups have the benefit of home-court advantage for the first round in a do-or-die situation. The winners move on to the remaining three-day tournament on ‘Oahu, while the losers end their bid for the state title. Three of the four home teams won in the opening round with Leilehua posting the only upset, having beaten Kapolei in overtime.
Top seeded Kahuku(14-0) is making its 28th Division-I appearance in the HHSAA Boy's Basketball Championship Tournament, but its first ever as the No. 1 seed. The Red Raiders have never claimed a state title, and have finished second on three occasions (2005,'09,'12). But Kahuku has its eye on the prize behind a trio of players averaging double digits per game and a stifling defense. No. 2 seeded Punahou (11-3) is making its 42nd state tournament appearance and has played more games than any other team (137) and a 71% win percentage (90-47). The Buffanblu have the second most state titles (10) and the most runner-up finishes (10).
No. 3 and MIL champ Lahainaluna is making its 22nd appearance, coming into the tournament with an unblemished 14-0 record. While the Lunas traditionally have not done well in the Division I tournament (0.191), this season they went 6-0 in non-league play outscoring OIA, ILH and BIIF opponents, 338-217. BIIF champion and No. 4 seed

An innovative housing project in North Glenora has become home for dozens of immigrant families, while also helping to sustain a local church and elementary school in the area.
“We have never dreamed of living in this kind of house. It's easy to clean, no carpet and large enough,” Hsar Keelar said. She and her husband, along with their five kids and grandparents, moved into one of the five-bedroom suites on Dec. 22.
The family is from Myanmar and were sponsored to come to Canada in 2013 after spending time in a refugee camp in Thailand.
“It wasn't safe for us [at home] — that's why we moved into a refugee camp,” Keelar said.
“Now we are safe and we are happy with our life.”
The North Glenora affordable housing project, built on the site of what used to be an aging church, is home to 16 families, including more than 35 elementary-school-aged children.

The Westmount Presbyterian Church began planning the project about four years ago. It partnered with the Right at Home Housing Society to tear down the old building and make way for a smaller church, daycare and 16 affordable townhomes.
The project is also a boost for Coronation Elementary School, which was in jeopardy of closing in 2014 due to low enrolment.
“North Glenora has been so gracious, and they've coined the phrase ‘YIMBY' — Yes In My Backyard,” said Lori Sigurdson, minister for Seniors and Housing, at the official opening on Friday. “They're really working to support the new families coming into this community.”
The new church and the townhomes also feature net-zero energy consumption.
“It's part of what makes this affordable,” Peter Amerongen, director of project builder Habitat Studio, said.
“They'll essentially have almost zero energy costs going into this.”
“We're using grid electricity right now, but in the summer we'll be producing way more [solar power] than the buildings are using, so the electricity that we're producing will get used in the neighbourhood,” Amerongen said.

In addition to the solar panels on the roof, the townhomes were also built with a geothermal heating system.
Bernie Schaloske, site manager for the project, explained that there are no gas lines to either the church or the townhomes.
“Out here in the parking lot, there are 33 holes, 265 feet deep. We're pumping glycol down into the earth. It's getting to about 7 C,” Schaloske said.
“In each of those suites is a refrigerator built in reverse. What we're trying to do is, we're cooling that glycol down to about zero degrees Celsius. In the process of cooling it, it has some waste energy, which is heat,” he added.
“We're basically using that heat to heat the space that these families are enjoying.”
Mayor Don Iveson said the project is an example of what neighbourhoods need more of in Edmonton. About 5,000 families are currently on the waitlist for social housing, Iveson said.
“We're just at the very beginning of a boom in affordable housing, thanks to the new federal and provincial commitments,” Iveson said.
“[It's a] huge, huge mountain to climb still. But this is a really good base camp to look at and say, ‘We can do more of this.'”
Schaloske said the North Glenora project is the first net-zero affordable housing project of its type in Canada.

KARACHI - Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan Chief Farooq Sattar said on Wednesday if his party's reservations were not resolved then they will boycott upcoming elections.
Talking to media in Karachi, Farooq Sattar said that the victory for a voter is that he receives a symbol and all MQM supporters have the election symbol of kite.
He said that the people want Rabita Committee to hold a rally but the other group was not interested in elections.
Sattar said that the MQM's mandate is being given to others. “We are not being minus, we have been minused,” he said.
The MQM-P chief said that the upcoming elections cannot ensure stability and whatever bad things happened to them has been in front of everyone.
The MQM leader said that his party will continue the demand for a separate province, and there should not be two but 100 administrative units. He said that the MQM's every leader is wishful for a separate province and everyone wants to fight for their rights. Sattar lamented that census was not carried out in the right manner and his party faced discrimination even before the elections.

KARACHI - The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) Karachi on Tuesday claimed to have apprehended three suspects including a former military officer for their alleged involvement in land scam.
NAB spokesperson stated that the arrests were made during a series of raids conducted in Karachi and Rawalpindi over the period of previous two days. He added that the arrested three accused persons are wanted in a land scam, adding that brigadier (retd) Iftikhar Haider the then Managing Director Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) was arrested from Rawalpindi whereas Syed Omar Ahmed and Shahid Rasool from Karachi.
The accused were wanted in an investigation on the charges of illegal allotment of 25 acres government land of Evacuee Property Trust located at Deh Okewari, which is claimed by KWSB, said the spokesperson, added that the said land was illegally allotted by accused Gul Hassan Channa the then Secretary RS&EB, Board of Revenue government of Sindh.
Accused Brigadier (retd) Iftikhar Haider was charged of giving possession of land to the illegal allottees despite knowing that the land belonged to KWSB. Whereas, accused Syed Omar Ahmed and Shahid Rasool were charged for being the illegal beneficiaries of the land which is worth Rs25 billion.
The spokesperson said that the accused Syed Omar Ahmed and Shahid Rasool will be produced before the Accountability Court today at Karachi for physical remand, whereas accused brigadier (retd) Iftikhar Haider will be produced after the transit remand.
Land was illegally allotted in year 1995 whereas subsequent transactions of illegal sale purchase by illegal beneficiaries continued till 2008, the spokesperson added.
AUSTIN, Texas (AP)  Undeterred by a U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down sweeping abortion restrictions that were sold as protecting women's health, Texas Republicans are pushing new measures pitched as protecting fetuses, with a hopeful eye toward Washington.
New anti-abortion measures are moving through the Legislature  where Democrats are virtually powerless to stop them  and opponents see a shift in GOP strategy after last year's 5-3 Supreme Court ruling that rejected the state's claims of trying to safeguard women and dismantled a 2013 law that prompted many of the state's abortion clinics to close.
A state Senate committee on Wednesday will begin hearing three anti-abortion measures, none of which claim to be aimed at protecting women's health. And with the Supreme Court apparently set to become more socially conservative under President Donald Trump, Republicans say there is a new opportunity.
"You would be almost remiss and neglectful, in my opinion, not to push that envelope going forward knowing what's coming up," Republican state Sen. Charles Perry said.

The newest Texas proposals would toughen regulations on what happens to a fetus both before and after an abortion. Perry's proposal would mostly ban a commonly used second-trimester abortion procedure, known as dilation and evacuation, and is similar to laws that courts have blocked in Alabama, Oklahoma, Kansas and Louisiana.
Another bill would require fetal remains to be buried or cremated. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has already ordered that change, but it is on hold pending a federal trial.
A third proposal would ban, among other things, the donation of fetal tissue under a measure Republicans have sought since the release of heavily edited, secretly recorded videos shot inside Planned Parenthood clinics by an anti-abortion group in 2015.
Perry said his bill has nothing to do with protecting women's health  a departure from how Republicans defended the former law known as HB2, which imposed building upgrades on abortion clinics and required doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges. More than 20 abortion clinics in Texas closed after the law passed.
Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in the majority opinion striking down that law that it failed to offer "medical benefits" sufficient to justify the burdens placed on women.
"The Supreme Court called them out on that," said Blake Rocap, legislative counsel for the abortion-rights group NARAL Pro-Choice Texas. "Because the avenue of lying about what is good women's health and safety is now foreclosed to them, they're now having to turn to other methods to make operating a practice difficult if not almost impossible."
Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed in to a law a bill similar to Perry's proposal last month The ban is among a push by abortion opponents nationally and at statehouses around the country with Republicans in control of the White House and Congress. Trump's first nominee to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, has a conservative legal philosophy seen as similar to the late Justice Antonin Scalia's.

'Unkindness Of Ghosts' Transposes The Plantation's Cruelty To The Stars
Rivers Solomon's An Unkindness of Ghosts is the kind of novel I need to describe in terms of what it did to me. Reading it, I felt it carving out a vastness inside me, pouring itself into me like so many stars, and the more I read the bigger I felt, falling down a rabbit-hole of sky and wanting only to go deeper and farther with every page.
Aster lives on a generation ship called Matilda, organized much like an antebellum plantation in space: The black and brown people on the lower decks, tightly policed by vicious guards and overseers, do the hard labor that enables the white people in the upper decks to hoard wealth, heat, and comfort. The upperdeckers also hoard religion; their Sovereignty, a sort of limited constitutional monarchy, claims that every sin committed by lowdeckers widens the gulf between Matilda and the Promised Land they've been in search of for 325 years.
Orphaned as an infant by her mother's suicide, neuroatypical, and ambiguously gendered among those who hold to rigid binaries, Aster is an outsider to most of her social groups: Her bunkmates mock her and her fellow lowdeckers are confused by her. In spite of her differences, she's respected for the extensive medical knowledge she's gleaned from her dead mother's journals, and for her curious friendship with an upperdecker who's almost as much of an anomaly as she is: Theo, the Surgeon General, a light-skinned bastard son of the former Sovereign. With his support, and using the resources of a secret greenhouse she calls her botanarium, Aster navigates Matilda's horrors to bring succour and healing where she can.
But there's something wrong with Matilda's power source — something connected to the current ailing Sovereign, and more importantly, to Aster's lost mother, Lune. With her sometimes-friend, sometimes-antagonist Giselle's help, Aster begins decoding Lune's journals to trace the mystery of her mother's death and the secrets at Matilda's heart.
To name a thing Solomon does in this book is to praise it. I loved the way each deck had its own dialect, how lowdeckers explored those differences with each other and learned each other's languages. I loved the attention to gender variance, to queerness, and the rooting of rigidity around gender in the ruling class' obsession with policing black bodies. I loved the exploration, in several heartbreaking scenes, of how enslavement breeds cruelty along an intersecting circuitry of lines among lowdeckers, as everyone tries their best to survive. I loved the clarity and precision of the prose, which felt like drinking cool water on an empty stomach, like being limned in light on the inside. Most of all, though, I loved Aster's voice, Aster's perspective on the world, Aster's anger and her fierce, unrelenting kindness to those she loves, no matter how they hurt her.
It is not a happy book. I love it like I love food, I love it for what it did to me, I love it for having made me feel stronger and more sure in a nightmare world, but it is not a happy book.
When I finished An Unkindness of Ghosts and put it down, I almost immediately picked it up again to re-read from the beginning, to admire how early certain seeds were sown, how thoroughly integrated were its plantation roots into space-faring soil. This book is not an allegory for life on plantations: it's a transposition, and through it an interrogation, an investigation, of the falsehoods and broken memories of a nightmare past. It drags up pervasive stereotypes of happy mammies and consenting love between slaver and enslaved and vivisects them, the dextrous voices of characters like Aint Melusine and Giselle deployed like scalpels to part the inflamed skin of bad history.
I sometimes hated an overseer so much that I had to put the book down to imagine all the ways in which I wanted him to die. I picked it up again to see Aster and Giselle imagining the same things.
What Solomon achieves with this debut — the sharpness, the depth, the precision — puts me in mind of a syringe full of stars. I want to say about this book, its only imperfection is that it ended. But that might give the wrong impression: that it is a happy book, a book that makes a body feel good. It is not a happy book. I love it like I love food, I love it for what it did to me, I love it for having made me feel stronger and more sure in a nightmare world, but it is not a happy book. It is an antidote to poison. It is inoculation against pervasive, enduring disease. Like a vaccine, it is briefly painful, leaves a lingering soreness, but armors you from the inside out.

South Korea's top court on Wednesday ordered the government to compensate 19 leprosy patients for forced vasectomies and abortions performed decades ago, the latest in a series of their legal victories.
Upholding a lower court's decision, the Supreme Court ordered the government to pay 30 million won ($26,200) to nine male victims and 40 million won to 10 women each for violating their human rights.
This file photo taken on June 20, 2016, shows a court hearing under way on Sorok Island in South Korea's southwest for the judges to hear the testimonies on the abuse against lepers that were carried out by the state, including castrations and forced abortions. (Yonhap)
It was the top court's first ruling after lepers began their legal fight against the government that has been denying compensations.South Korea began to carry out forced abortions and vasectomies on leprosy patients in the 1930s during Japan's occupation of the Korean Peninsula from 1910-45. The practice, based on the false belief that the disease was hereditary, is known to have lasted until the 1990s."In order to carry out the operations there should have been a legal basis and prior informed consent from the plaintiffs," the court said. "The state failed to meet such conditions in practicing its authority."Even if the plaintiffs gave a prior consent, they were forced to make such a decision based on prejudice, discrimination and poor social, educational and economic conditions without being fully informed of whether the disease was hereditary or if it can be cured," it added.Five other similar cases filed by some 500 plaintiffs are pending in local courts.

LONDON (Reuters) - Kevin Mayer's lead in the World Athletics Championships decathlon was slashed by Rico Freimuth after the discus on Saturday, leaving the Frenchman 24 points ahead after seven of the 10 events.
Mayer, the overnight leader, recorded the third fastest time of 13.75 seconds in the 110 metres hurdles but could manage only seventh place with a throw of 47.14 in the discus.
Freimuth, bronze medallist at the Beijing World Championships two years ago, threw 51.17 metres, the longest of the competition, to leave him on 6,272 points with Olympic silver medallist Mayer on 6,296.
Ukraine's Oleksiy Kasyanov climbed to third with 6,095 after finishing fourth in the hurdles and second in the discus.
Twice former world champion Trey Hardee had a miserable morning, failing to pick up any points, as he clattered into his third hurdle in the first event and then produced three foul throws in the discus.
Canadian Damian Warner, bronze medallist in Rio, was fastest in the hurdles with 13.63 seconds but a poor effort in the discus meant he dropped back down to fifth overall.
The event has been left open by the retirement earlier this year of American Ashton Eaton, who had dominated recently, winning the last two Olympic and world titles.
Warner was often seen as the man most likely to break Eaton's dominance and London his best chance yet of winning a first world title.
(Reuters) - Outgoing Federal Reserve Bank Chair Janet Yellen said on Friday that solid economic growth, faster wage increases, and a tightening labour market mean the U.S. central bank is likely to need to continue to raise interest rates gradually, as it has signalled it will.
“The economy is growing at a healthy, solid pace,” Yellen said in an interview with PBS NewsHour on the last day of her four-year term. “The job market is strong and inflation is low ... The Federal Reserve has been on a path of gradual rate increases, and if conditions continue as they have been, that process is likely to continue, and as it do we would expect long rates to move up.”
On Saturday she hands the reins to President Donald Trump's pick to replace her, Governor Jerome Powell. She will stay in Washington as a fellow at the Brookings Institution, the think tank where former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke also works.
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)  The Latest on a court hearing to decide whether to grant initial approval to a settlement deal for roughly 78,000 polluting Volkswagens (all times local):
10:45 a.m.
A federal judge in San Francisco has granted initial approval to a deal worth at least $1.2 billion that aims to compensate the owners of roughly 78,000 Volkswagens that were rigged to cheat on emissions tests.
U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer during a court hearing Tuesday congratulated attorneys for Volkswagen and car owners on reaching what he called a complicated deal for Volkswagens, Audis and Porsches with 3-liter diesel engines.

The company previously agreed to spend up to $10 billion buying back or repairing about 475,000 Volkswagens and Audi vehicles with 2-liter diesel engines and paying their owners an additional $5,100 to $10,000 each.
The 475,000 cars represent the bulk of the vehicles caught up in Volkswagen's emissions cheating scandal.
The deal involving 3-liter engines that Breyer approved also offers thousands of dollars in compensation on top of buybacks or repairs.

Michelle Watts comes from a military family and works at Veterans Affairs, so she is tuned in to the issues that may keep African-American veterans from seeking VA services. “Misinformation and a history of mistrust may be factors,” said Watts, veterans justice outreach coordinator for Milwaukee's Clement J. Zablocki Veterans Affairs Medical Center.
The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and the VA want to help vets overcome such factors and learn what services are available. So, they're collaborating on the Sixth Annual VA Mental Health Summit, set for Saturday, June 23, at the UWM Student Union, 2200 E. Kenwood Blvd.
This year's summit puts a special focus on helping African-American veterans. Guest speakers include Delphine Metcalf Foster, the first woman and first African-American to serve as national commander for the Disabled American Veterans, and Reggie Jackson, head griot for America's Black Holocaust Museum.
UWM's Military and Veterans Resource Center often partners with the VA on important projects like this, said Jayne Holland, MAVRC's interim director. The VA's mobile vet center regularly visits campus, and many UWM graduates have gone on to jobs at the VA.
“They're just an outstanding community partner,” Holland said.
The summit is one of several outreach efforts toward groups of veterans who may not know about the services available to them. “Any veteran is welcome,” said William Johnson, minority veterans program coordinator at the Zablocki VA, “but we are trying to reach out particularly to historically underrepresented groups.”
Johnson estimates there are about 11,500 African-American veterans in the five-county Milwaukee metropolitan area. However, because the VA does not track patients by race, it's difficult to know whether all eligible vets know what services are available to them.
Johnson said this year's summit, which runs from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., was developed with input from church, community and mental health organizations and focus groups. Breakout sessions will focus on eligibility for VA health care and benefits; racial trauma and inequality; chronic pain management; Afro-centered approaches to healing; disparities in African-American health care; and gun violence as a public health issue.
Many veterans return home from service and thrive, Johnson said. But some may need help with physical and mental health issues or substance abuse, and the VA can provide that. Last year, the VA graduated 300 Milwaukee-area veterans from substance abuse recovery programs.
Many African-American veterans have traditionally relied on family and the church for mental health support. Often, they feel there's a stigma attached to seeking counseling through organizations such as the VA, which is a main reason the VA is reaching out.
The VA also helps veterans who are at risk of losing housing, unstably housed or actually homeless. Last year, the VA found housing for 300 Milwaukee-area veterans.
Watts' office works with veterans on justice system issues, too. “We know in communities of color, the incarceration rates are higher than they would be for the general population,” Watts said. This is particularly critical for African-American males, who have had historically higher rates of incarceration, she added.
Previous summits have focused on Afghan-Iraqi war veterans, female veterans, veterans who are disabled and LGBT veterans. Johnson said the plan for next year's summit is to focus on Latino veterans.

SIALKOT
Established by the local philanthropists, the Cardiology Department of Govt Allama Iqbal Memorial Teaching Hospital is providing round-the-clock healthcare at the local level.
The department works under the direct supervision of Khawaja Muhammad Safdar Medical College (KMSMC). KMSMC Principal Zafar Ali Chaudhary told newsmen at his office that the Cardiology Department was a great blessing for the people of Sialkot. The local people are getting the international standard cardiac health and medical treatment at local level, he said.
He added that the capacity of the 45-bed department would soon be increased to 65 beds. He said that there was a well equipped Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with advanced angiography unit and advanced cardiac surgery theatre.
KMSMC Principal Dr Zafar Chaudhry added that 100 cardiac outdoor patients were being treated in teh cardiology department of Govt Allama Iqbal Memorial Teaching Hospital.
He said that the ratio of the admissions of the cardiac patients was 250 patients per month one year ago at Govt Allama Iqbal Memorial Teaching Hospital Sialkot.
Now, it has reached to 450 patients per month at the well-established cardiology department. He said that there was 1,000 times increase in the short-term and long-term admission of the cardiac patients at the cardiology department. He said that more than 4,000 cardiac patients were being checked in a month.
The KMSMC principal added that the cardiology department has been established by the donations of the local philanthropists. He said that all the cardiac patients were getting 24/7 advanced cardiac medical treatment equally without any discrimination under the supervision of senior cardiac expert Dr Zeeshan Butt.
The principal added that there was no referral of any cardiac patient from here to Punjab Institute of Cardiology (PIC) Lahore for the last one year, since the establishment of the Cardiology Department.
Exporters stress boost
in Pak-Japan ties
The businessmen of Japan and Pakistan have stressed a need for promoting business-to-business contacts for further strengthening the bilateral trade.
They stated this during a meeting held at Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TCCI) with a trade delegation of Sialkot Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI).
Led by SCCI's Departmental Committee on Trade Delegations, Exhibitions and Fairs Chairman Khawar Sapal, a 12-member SCCI trade delegation had reached Tokyo under the direct supervision of Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP).
According to the SCCI officials, the SCCI trade delegation also participated in the awareness seminars arranged by the Embassy of Pakistan in Japan and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). They held meetings with potential businessmen in Tokyo and Osaka cities.
The SCCI officials added that their visit to Japan would help the Sialkot exporters explore, capture and tap the international trade markets of Japan. Japan is an important trading partner of Pakistan. However, the trade volume between Pakistan and Japan is below the potential. In 2015, the exports from Pakistan to Japan were US$ 176 million while imports from Japan to Pakistan were $1.82 billion.
Khawar Sapal talking to the leading Japanese businessmen at Tokyo and Osaka said that it was the high time for both Pakistan and Japan to focus on broadening the scope of mutual trade cooperation by extending it to the other areas of mutual trade, investment and infrastructure development including all other sectors of interest.
He suggested active engagements of Japan and Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry, which could act as resources base for exchanging mutual trade information. He said that the mutual exchange of the trade delegations from both countries and holding of joint trade exhibitions would also help promote bilateral trade.
He said that there was a huge scope for establishing joint venture in different trade fields including sports goods, surgical instruments, sportswear, leather products and information technology between the businessmen of Tokyo, Osaka and Sialkot.
He termed SCCI trade delegation's visit to Japan as a step forward to bring the business communities of Japan and Pakistan closer for better understanding and chalking out new avenues of mutual collaboration in various fields.
Sapal also urged the Japanese government to relax duties on Pakistani products in order to provide the better and easy access to the international Japanese markets.
ERIN, Wis. - The United States Golf Association has taken several steps to avoid the rules controversy that marred last year's U.S. Open at Oakmont won by Dustin Johnson, including setting up four on-course video locations to assist in speeding up rulings.
Also, for the first time, the U.S. Open that begins Thursday at Erin Hills will have a chief referee, Thomas Pagel, who is "empowered to make instantaneous decisions,'' according to John Bodenhamer, the USGA's managing director of rules, competitions and equipment standards.
Pagel is part of a five-person rules committee and is the USGA's senior director of rules and amateur status.

"Through our work over the last 12 months, we have learned a great deal,'' Bodenhamer said. "And our focus over those months has primarily been three things. First, to expedite our ruling process in insure that we're more timely in our rulings. To be decisive in our decision making. And to more effectively community communicate to the players and all of you."
The enhanced use of technology entails four video review locations along with various rules officials having the use of tablets, helping rules officials move more quickly to make decisions.
The USGA has also transitioned to a stationary referee model instead of assigning walking referees to each group. There will be two referees stationed at each of the non-par 3 holes.
The USGA's Mike Davis also addressed criticism that came from players Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth in response to officials cutting back the fescue rough on several holes.
McIlroy, especially, was surprised that the USGA would do that, given the unusually wide fairways at Erin Hills.
"We make a decision to modify a golf course, whether it's green speeds, rough, directions we're mowing, how much water we're applying or not applying .. . it's not as if we don't listen to feedback from players,'' said Davis, the executive director of the USGA. "But I will tell you in this case, it had absolutely zero to do with what the players were saying. We looked at some spots and we said this is simply not going to play properly.''

DALLAS — Residents of a coastal area southwest of Houston are cleaning up debris after severe storms, including at least six tornadoes, swept through the area Tuesday.
At least six people were injured in Van Vleck, about 70 miles southwest of Houston, by a weak tornado rated by a federal survey team as an EF1, with winds of 86 to 110 mph.
A preliminary review of the damage in Van Vleck indicates up to four homes were destroyed and several others damaged, said Doug Matthes, emergency management coordinator for Matagorda County. Seven people were transported by ambulance for medical care and it's not clear how many more may have been taken to hospitals by private vehicle, he said. The seven people taken by ambulance didn't appear to have serious injuries, he said.
One of those injured in Van Vleck, a town of about 1,800 residents, was Harry Hobbs.
“I was going into the room and the center blew off, then I got popped upside the head” by debris, Hobbs told KTRK-TV of Houston. “I looked back and said, ‘I can't take another one of them,' so I went to block it and that's how I hurt my hand.”
Said Sally Farley, Hobbs' girlfriend, “We have nothing. We might be able to salvage some clothes and stuff out of the house, but everything's gone. I just keep telling myself that at least everybody's OK.”

The path of the tornado was close to a junior high school where students sheltered in place, Matthes said. Crews were working Tuesday afternoon and evening to restore power and the Red Cross was offering assistance.
“It's a rural community so these folks take care of themselves,” he said.
An EF2 tornado with winds of 111 to 135 mph caused extensive damage to subdivisions 27 miles southwest of Houston. A weak tornado also was confirmed in Wharton, about 55 miles southwest of Houston.
The weather service had issued tornado warnings for dozens of counties extending from the San Antonio area to Southeast Texas.
Elsewhere, more than 3 inches of rain fell in some areas west of Austin, and rain was mixing with snow in the Texas Panhandle, resulting in slick roads and delays in school openings.

ATTOCK - The 2018 general elections will witness a tough contest between PTI's Maj Tahir Sadiq and PML-N candidate Sheikh Aftab Ahmed in NA-55, Attock. As many as eight candidates are in the race for NA-55 of Attock. Prominent among them are former district Nazim Major Tahir Sadiq and former federal minister for parliamentary affairs Sheikh Aftab Ahmad.
The NA-55 constituency consists of tehsil Attock, Hazro and Hassanabdal where there are 571,804 registered voters.
The other six candidates are Zulfiqar Hayat Khan of PPP, Asif Iqbal of Allah-o-Akbar Tehreek, Taimoor Aslam of PTI-Nazriati, Hafiz Saeed Ahmad of MMA, Muhammad Hafeez Ullah Jan of Tehreek Labbaik Pakistan and Malik Mir Afzal of Pakistan Human Rights Party.
Maj (r) Tahir Sadiq, who joined PTI last year was previously associated with PM-Q and remained Attock district nazim twice during Pervez Musharaf's regime, seems to be a strong candidate from the constituency. He is considered to have contacts at the grassroots level, having strong teams at union council level. He also claims to have carried out a lot of development work and provided jobs to the youth in education, police and other departments. He is also accessible to everyone anytime.
Maj (r) Tahir Sadiq told this scribe that he travelled hundreds of miles daily to have close contacts with his people. Apparently, his position seems to be strong in this constituency.
On the other hand, Sheikh Aftab Ahmad who is in good books of Sharif brothers also did a lot of development work in this locality. He claims that he provided gas facility to all the villages of tehsils Attock and Hazro, established an agriculture university in the district, started master-level classes in Government Boys College, Attock, and recruited thousands of teachers purely on merit, which was a record.
Although both the leaders have contributed to the constituency's development, they will have to work hard to garner the support of the voters to clinch the seat.
Malik Amin Aslam, a local PTI leader, withdrew his nomination papers in favour of Maj Tahir Sadiq. He was so close to Imran Khan that he tasked him to look after one billion-tree project in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Khan acknowledged his services at every forum, but did not give him ticket for NA-55. Since the PTI chief considered Major Tahir Sadiq a strong candidate and electable, he pacified Aslam by saying that he would be elevated to the ministry of environment after coming to power.
Malik Aslam had filed his nomination papers for NA-55, so his supporters forced him to contest as an independent candidate after PTI denied him ticket despite his 10 years of association with the party. But Aslam withdrew his nomination papers and told his supporters that he could not betray his party leadership. He, however, told journalists that he would not take part in the election campaign of Major Tahir Sadiq. After the withdrawal of papers by Aslam, the position of Major Tahir has become stronger.
Sheikh Aftab, who has been in power for the last 10 years, has thousands of supporters and is running his election campaign with high hopes. However, some of his party office-bearers at the tehsil level have joined other parties or are supporting other candidates. This factor has certainly created problems for the former federal minister. Talking to The Nation, Sheikh Aftab said he believes in the performance that will help him win the polls.

Montreal Masters: Rohan Bopanna and Ivan Dodig go down fighting in final
Bopanna and Dodig will play the Cincinnati Masters together next week
@Sudsports by Sudeshna Banerjee News 14 Aug 2017, 09:22 IST
Bopanna and Dodig went down fighting to Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut in the finals
Seventh seeds Rohan Bopanna and Ivan Dodig went down fighting to the fifth seeds Nicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues Herbert in the final of the Coupe Rogers in Montreal, Canada on Sunday. The Indo-Croatian pair forced a deciding tie-break after dropping the first set but could not continue their momentum, ending up with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-10 loss in 1 hour 22 minutes.
Bopanna and Dodig thundered 7 aces and converted one out of their three break point opportunities in this match.
It was the Indian who was on song throughout the match while Dodig struggled with his groundstrokes. Even though they did manage to make amends for their missed chances, they fell short in the end.
The two teams stayed on serve till 3-3 in the first set. The first sign of nerves from Dodig came in the seventh game where he double faulted and promptly handed over the advantage to the Frenchmen, who secured the only break of the set.
In the second set, the seventh seeds were the first ones to earn a break point when the Indian found a blistering backhand in the fourth game.
But they squandered it after Dodig missed yet another return.
The Indo-Croatian duo, was, however, quick to push aside that setback. They got their very next opportunity in the eighth game where Herbert looked slightly off on serve. Forcing the French to send the ball long, they grabbed the vital break to inch ahead to 5-3 before successfully serving out the set after saving a break point.
But they lost the momentum soon after as the Frenchmen raised their level. The initial stages of the match tie-break were completely one-way traffic and the seventh seeds were on the board only at 1-4.
The two-time Grand Slam champions continued their relentless attack to surge to 9-3 soon with six match points in hand.
Even though Bopanna and Dodig saved three of them, they ultimately conceded defeat after Dodig sent a forehand flying out of the court on the Herbert serve.
Bopanna can be happy with the fact that it is a very promising performance ahead of the US Open, beginning on August 28.
His next tournament is the Cincinnati Masters in Ohio next week, where he is once again paired with Dodig.

RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles said on Friday that Brazil's economy is well on the road to recovery and that he will decide in April whether to run for president in the October general election.
Speaking at a business conference in Rio, Meirelles said the need to overhaul Brazil's costly pension system will become a big campaign issue if Congress does not approve the government's pension reform bill, which is due to face a first vote in the lower house in the week of February 19. He said he sees signs of growing support for the bill that has failed to muster the needed two-thirds majority so far. (Reporting by Camila Moreira Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
Democratic lawmakers are calling for a subpoena to force the U.S. Census Bureau and Commerce Department to release internal documents about the decision to add a controversial citizenship question to forms for the upcoming national headcount.
The request comes two weeks before a congressional oversight hearing on the 2020 census.
"We believe these documents are critical for our Committee," write all 18 Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in a letter to its chairman, Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, "to understand the concerns raised internally by career experts at the Census Bureau itself about the dangers of adding this untested new citizenship question to the census — as well as why the Trump Administration disregarded these concerns."
The U.S. Census Bureau is part of the Commerce Department.
A Commerce Department spokesperson has previously told NPR the documents will not be released until after the May 8 hearing. The agency is preparing to release them publicly after its attorneys file them later next month at the federal courts that are hearing the lawsuits against the citizenship question.
Sen. Kamala Harris of California and other Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which has oversight of the U.S. Census Bureau, have previously made requests for these documents. NPR has filed Freedom of Information Act requests for them as well.
Gowdy's communications director, Amanda Gonzalez told NPR Tuesday morning that she is "not aware" of the Democrats' letter. "I don't believe the committee has received it yet," she said, referring to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.
Previously, Gonzalez has declined to comment on whether a subpoena would be issued for the documents to be released in time for the hearing.
The Democrats' letter notes that regardless of the legal fight over the citizenship question, members of Congress have "an independent responsibility under the Constitution to conduct oversight of the census."
Democratic lawmakers — including the House oversight committee's top Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland — have been raising concerns about the citizenship question since it was first announced by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in late March.
Ross approved a last-minute request to add a citizenship question from the Justice Department. The DOJ says the question is needed to get a better count of voting-age citizens in order to enforce the Voting Rights Act's provisions against voting discrimination of racial and language minority groups. Since the civil rights law was enacted in 1965, the DOJ has relied on estimates of U.S. citizens rather than official counts by the census. Those who have criticized the addition of the citizenship question say those estimates are adequate.
The data are used for reapportioning seats in Congress, drawing legislative districts and distributing an estimated $800 billion a year in federal funding.
Cummings and other Democrats have cited research by the Census Bureau suggesting that asking about citizenship could discourage immigrants and communities of color from participating in the census — a national headcount of every person living in the U.S. required by the Constitution every 10 years.
BERLIN (Reuters) - Borussia Dortmund have extended the suspension of talented forward Ousmane Dembele indefinitely after the 20-year-old France international skipped training last week amid speculation of a possible move to Barcelona.
The Bundesliga club said on Sunday it would keep Dembele's ban for missing training in place after the player was told he was initially suspended until after Saturday's first round German Cup tie against amateurs Rielasingen-Arlen.
"Our focus now is to have a concentrated preparation for the start of the Bundesliga (next week)," Dortmund sports director Michael Zorc said in a statement.
"Obviously Ousmane Dembele has the opportunity to do individual training separate from the team."
Dembele is seen as a potential successor to Neymar at Barcelona, after the Brazilian's record 222 million euro ($262.32 million) move to Paris St Germain earlier this month.
An initial Barça offer was rejected by Dortmund with club bosses saying it was too low.
German media have estimated the price of a move at more than 100 million euros.
Dembele joined Dortmund, who will compete in the Champions League group stage, from French side Rennes on a five-year deal in 2016.

Charlottesville, Va
U.S. authorities on Sunday are investigating the outbreak of violence in Virginia following a white nationalist rally that killed one person and injured more than 30, presenting U.S. President Donald Trump with a major domestic challenge. The violence in the Southern college town of Charlottesville on Saturday was widely condemned, with many politicians and activists on both the left and right also criticizing Trump, a Republican, for waiting too long to address it and when he did so, failing to explicitly condemn the white-supremacist marchers who ignited the melee. On Sunday, however, the White House said in a statement that Trump's remarks on Saturday condemned all forms of violence and bigotry, including neo-Nazi groups and the Ku Klux Klan. “The president said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred, and of course that includes white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi, and all extremist groups,” the White House said. “He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together.” The violence has put fresh pressure on the Trump administration to take an unequivocal stand against that segment of his political base. Some rightists have claimed allegiance to him. Trump said on Saturday that there was more than one side to the Charlottesville incidents. “We condemn, in the strongest possible terms, this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides,” he told reporters at his New Jersey golf course, without specifically mentioning or faulting the role of white nationalists. Virginia police have not yet provided a motive for a man plowing a car into a crowd of people objecting to the white nationalists, but U.S. attorneys and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have opened a civil rights investigation into the crash, an FBI field office said. Four people have been arrested, including James Fields, a 20-year-old white man from Ohio who is being held in jail on suspicion of crashing the car. —Reuters

With the playoffs quickly approaching, it's clear that the Tampa Bay Lightning will be buyers at this year's trade deadline. While the Lightning have been one of the league leaders all season long, they could use some defensive insurance before the playoff gauntlet begins. Despite featuring a fairly deep defensive unit that can provide scoring and suppress opponents, there is a noticeable hole in their top pairing. For the majority of this season, Jake Dotchin has appeared in over his head on the top line with Victor Hedman.
This sort of noticeable issue can be covered up during the regular season when you only see an opponent a few times, but it is exploitable over a seven-game series. While the Lightning could move Anton Stralman back on the top pairing with Hedman, this would leave rookie Mikhail Sergachev exposed on the second line – another less than ideal scenario for the Lightning. With this in mind, the Lightning need to find a defenseman who can play top-pairing minutes with Hedman or act as a mentor for Sergachev throughout his first playoff experience.
All-Star Mike Green Fits the Lightning's Needs
Of the defensemen likely available at the deadline, Mike Green is the perfect player for the Lightning. While playing with a rebuilding Red Wing's franchise, Green averaged 35 points each season in route to an All-Star nomination in 2018. Along with these solid offensive numbers, he consistently plays 20 or more minutes each night, giving the Lightning a needed minute-eating defenseman. Besides, he is a right-handed defenseman who slots in beautifully next to lefty Victor Hedman.
Even if Green doesn't work on the top pairing, having another All-Star defenseman on the roster would allow for Anton Stralman to move back onto the top line with Green taking over next to Sergachev. With over 750 regular season games and an additional 76 games of playoff experience, Green would be the perfect mentor for the 19-year-old Sergachev.
Green Is a Worthy Investment for the Lightning
Cost-wise, Green would be an expensive deadline acquisition for the Lightning. With relatively few defensemen available, the Red Wings will be demanding top dollar for their premier blueliner. Looking at rental defensemen trades over recent seasons, he will garner at least a first-round draft pick, a roster player and a conditional pick in the second to fourth round range. This price could be even higher if teams on the outside of the tight Metropolitan division decide to make a run at the playoffs instead of selling.
While this cost is far from cheap, it would be a smart investment by Lightning general manager Steve Yzerman. With the Lightning considered a contender for the Stanley Cup this season, they need a roster that can keep up with the multi-month grind of the playoffs. Without adding a player of Green's caliber, the Lightning are one blocked shot away from having to heavily rely on Dotchin and Andrej Sustr to carry the right side. With their less than consistent play, this could spell disaster for Tampa's Stanley Cup dreams.
Lightning Giving Green a Trial Run
This offseason, Green will be an unrestricted free agent. For the Lightning, bringing him into the franchise for a playoff run would be the perfect time to introduce him to Tampa. If he fits well with the team, Yzerman could work to re-sign him on a two or three-year contract to stabilize the Lightning's defense while prospects gain a few more years of needed experience.
At 32 years old, Green will be looking for a multi-year contract that brings him both job security and a consistent chance to win a Stanley Cup. In their current form, the Lightning will be a championship contender for the next few seasons, lining up with Green's ambitions. Given Yzerman's ability to re-sign players to favorable contracts, it wouldn't be surprising to see Green retained for more than just one playoff run.
Looking for Greener Pastures
Even if Green were brought in for just one playoff run, he is the right choice for the Lightning right now. He not only fixes the Lightning's largest issues on defense, he also provides an experienced locker room presence for a Stanley Cup push. Even with a team as strong as the Lightning, you can never have enough talented, high-character players on your roster.
Rawalpindi-The two cops, convicted in Benazir Bhutto (BB) assassination case, have been released from Adiala Jail here on Friday, sources said.

However, the court acquitted five suspects, Sher Zaman, Husnain Gull, Aitzaz Shah, Rasheed Ahmed and Rafaqat Hussain allegedly linked with the banned outfit TTP for the lack of evidence and faulty investigation conducted by the prosecution. PPP and FIA have challenged the LHC Rawalpindi Bench on the conviction of cops and acquittal of five suspects in BB assassination case.

Nosaj Thing has announced a new album dubbed, Parallels. Due September 8th from Innovative Leisure, the LP follows Los Angeles-based producer Jason Chung's 2015 LP, Fated.
Parallels isn't actually the album Chung intended to release. During a tour stop in Houston two years ago, all of his equipment was stolen. Amongst the gear were hard drives with three years worth of work, none of which were backed up. “I lost everything,” Chung said in a press release. “I was definitely shaken, but I'm glad it happened. It was the slap in the face I needed to get me to up my work ethic and quality control.” The shake up allowed him to explore new creative paths as he found himself happier and healthier than ever before. He explained,
“My previous records reflected the anxiety of living inside my own imagination. For Parallels, I went outside of that: It's all about trying new things, creating new worlds. In the past year, I faced up to my own internal struggles and became more social. This allowed me to jump styles and genres — exploring different emotions and sounds beyond what I'd done before. I'd make something ambient and cinematic, and then create a dancefloor beat, along with a broken hip-hop groove — and then try to make them work together.”
As a first listen to the 10-track effort, Nosaj Thing has shared lead single, “All Points Back to U”. The track is a low bubbling haunter filled with paranoia and condemnation. Steve Spacek of English electronica act Spacek provides the sinister yet restrained vocals, singing, “Everyone I ask, it's the same, so there's only one conclusion/ Look at it from my point of view and there's really no confusion/ It all points back to you.” Take a listen below.

Harry Hillaker , Iowa's state climatologist for the past three decades, is stepping down this week.
“March 22 will be my last day in the office and basically it's been, gosh, almost 37 years I've been working in this office,” Hillaker said. The state climatologist monitors weather activity to compile monthly and annual reports about precipitation totals, shifts in temperatures, and other climate-related data. Iowa's only other state climatologist, Paul Waite, hired Hillaker.
“He hired me to do a little, three-month long research grant,” Hillaker said. “It's almost 37 years later and I'm still here. That research grant led to one thing and then another, and then another, and I've been here all that time.” Waite was Iowa's state climatologist from 1976 to 1988, when Hillaker took the job. Hillaker plans to do some traveling, but will keep Iowa as his home in retirement. He's looking forward to digging deeper into the state's historical weather data.
“There is still a lot of work to be done with that,” Hillaker said. “There's a lot of stuff I'd like to do that I never had time to do with the regular job, so I'm hoping to do some of that with retirement.” The state climatologist's office is part of the Iowa Department of Agriculture.
Steven Spielberg is planning to start shooting the untitled fifth Indiana Jones movie for Disney in the U.K. in a little more than a year.
He made the disclosure Sunday night at the Rakuten TV Empire Awards, where he was on stage to receive a Legend of Our Lifetime award and spoke about his collaborators from the British film industry. The event was held at the Roundhouse in London.
“It's always worth the trip when I get to work with this deep bench of talent coming out of the UK. The actors, and the crew, the chippies, the sparks, the drivers — everybody who has helped me make my movies here, and will continue helping me make my movies here when I come back in April 2019 to make the fifth Indiana Jones movie right here,” Spielberg said while on stage.
During his speech, Spielberg also saluted the Time's Up initiative.
“Thank you Time's Up,” he said. “We were very much on board from the very beginning, my wife Kate and me. This is more important than any of us can ever really realize. I think in 10 years we'll look back and realize what a watershed moment we are all experiencing together, 2017 to 2018. It's extraordinary what's happening right now. The fact that women who have had no representation and have not been able to find the support or the courage to step forward, now they will have representation and they will have the support. Time's Up means it's time up. This is it. This is the end of the way things were, it will never be that way again hopefully.”

Disney announced in 2016 that Spielberg would be returning to direct the next installment with Harrison Ford on board to reprise his role of the adventure-seeking archaeologist. No other cast members have been announced. The film has been set to bow on July 10, 2020.
David Koepp was hired in 2016 to write “Indiana Jones 5.” Koepp wrote the last Installment in the series, 2008's “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” and has previously worked with Spielberg on “Jurassic Park” and “Jurassic Park: the Lost World.”
The four Indiana Jones films have grossed nearly $2 billion in worldwide box office. Spielberg's “Ready Player One” will open on March 28.

West Shore RCMP say they are investigating an alleged stabbing outside the Langford Lanes bowling alley.
Mounties say a verbal confrontation between two men early Saturday morning (March 17) left one man with several stab wounds to his upper body.
When authorities were called, the suspect had already left the scene.
“We continue to follow up on leads and interview potential witnesses. Although we have identified a suspect and are actively looking for him, the investigation is ongoing and are looking for the public's assistance with any information they have,” says Cst. Matt Baker of the West Shore RCMP in a release.
The victim was taken to hospital with serious injuries but is in stable condition according to RCMP.
The CEO of Merck & Co has resigned from a business council set up by Donald Trump after the US president failed to condemn violence by white supremacists.
Merck & Co chief executive Kenneth Frazier has resigned from US President Donald Trump's American Manufacturing Council, saying he was taking a stand against intolerance and extremism.
Frazier, who is African-American, is the only CEO so far to leave one of Trump's advisory councils because of his reaction to the violence in Virginia. Prominent Democrats and Republicans criticised Trump's response to the violence over the weekend.
A gathering of hundreds of white nationalists in Virginia took a deadly turn on Saturday when a car ploughed into a group of counter-protesters and killed at least one person.
Trump had said "many sides" were involved, drawing fire from across the political spectrum for not specifically denouncing the far right.
"America's leaders must honour our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal," Frazier said in a statement announcing his resignation.
Trump responded in a tweet, saying now that "Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!"
Merck shares rose 0.8 per cent in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, in line with the wider market.
Other top business leaders also spoke out in reaction to the violence in Charlottesville.
"Lincoln: 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.' Isolate those who try to separate us. No equivalence w/ those who bring us together," Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein tweeted on Monday morning.
Several executives from top US companies have stepped down from a number of presidential advisory councils in protest over Trump policies.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Walt Disney CEO Robert Iger left the president's Strategic and Policy Forum, a business advisory group, in June, after Trump said he would withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Musk also left the manufacturing council.
Former Uber Technologies CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council in February amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administration's immigration policies.
The White House said on Sunday that Trump's remarks condemning violence at a white nationalist rally were meant to include the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups.
Democrats and Republicans criticised Trump for waiting too long to address the violence - his first major domestic crisis as president - and for failing when he did speak out to explicitly condemn white supremacist marchers who ignited the melee.

Jens von Bergmann of Vancouver said the province bungled the rollout

A Vancouver mathematician is feeling a little confused, and a lot snarky, about why British Columbians can't seem to understand how the increased school tax works.
“I kept reading these stories about the people affected… and I thought maybe this [calculator] was needed,” Jens von Bergmann told Black Press Media.
“I think the fact that it is a wealth based tax means it's new and it's different.”
The school tax, announced by Finance Minister Carol James in February, would apply a tax rate of 0.2 per cent to the portion of a home's assessed residential value that is between $3 million and $4 million, excluding stratified rentals. A tax rate of 0.4 per cent would apply to all home value over $4 million.
“It just really drives home this divide we're facing in Vancouver,” said Von Bergmann.
“People that have bought quite a while ago and have seen their house value go up but don't perceive that necessarily as liquid wealth and other people that are really struggling to pay rent in the city. I think the tax is trying to strike some sort of balance between the two.”
READ MORE: David Eby cancels town hall due to ‘safety concerns' after school tax protest planned
The tax is due to start in 2019 but has already raised outrage, especially in Attorney General David Eby's Point Grey riding.
Eby cancelled a town hall on the tax in early May, claiming that the opposition was encouraging non-registered attendees to crash the ticket-only event and making it unsafe.
MaryAnn Cummings, a Point Grey senior who's against the tax, called it “predatory” and said that the tax “ignores an owners ability to pay it.”
But Von Bergmann says he doesn't have much sympathy.
“I find it hard to relate to how this could constitute any form of cruel hardship,” he wrote in a blog post.
“And I am comfortably housed, I don't want to imagine how someone struggling to pay rent in this city is supposed to by sympathetic to this.”
An owner of a $4 million house would pay $2,000 in school tax, according to the province. While Von Bergmann blames people's poor math skills for not being able to grasp how little they'll really pay in extra taxes, he also thinks the province bungled the rollout.
He brought up the example of David Tha, 72, who told the Vancouver Courier that he was cutting cable and eating less meat to afford the tax.
But although Von Bergmann called Tha “principled,” he noted that he could either sell, or just defer the taxes on his $6.75-million home, which had gone up from the $370,000 Tha bought it for in 1987.
“We have to conclude that he is very principled, but I am still not convinced that the single mom trying to make ends meet renting an East Van basement suite will be terribly sympathetic to Tha's self-imposed budget constraints,” Von Bergmann wrote.
“Vancouver is indeed expensive, but with $6.7M in equity, almost all of which is untaxed capital gains, it is very hard to see how they could find a reasonable place to live to fit their middle class lifestyle.”

The Miami Dolphins (10-6) and Pittsburgh (11-5) will be familiar playoff foes when they meet on Sunday. Miami beat Pittsburgh, 30-15, during Week 6 of the regular season.
A lot has changed since then. The Dolphins finished 8-2 since that game to get the sixth seed in the AFC, and the Steelers have won seven straight on their way to the AFC North title.
But here are several takeaways from Miami's regular-season victory that could help in Sunday's wild-card matchup:
No. 1: Miami's offense matches up well with Pittsburgh's defense
The Steelers' defense is a long ways from their "Steel Curtain" heyday. This year's team is mostly built around its offense. Miami has the right balance of running and passing to give Pittsburgh problems defensively. The Dolphins amassed 474 total yards of offense in their regular-season win and will look to build on that success. Granted, there has been a quarterback change for Miami since Week 6. But backup Matt Moore brings different strengths and hasn't been much of a drop-off thus far from Ryan Tannehill.
No. 2: Miami frustrated WR Antonio Brown
Not many teams teams held Brown under wraps this season. Miami was one of the few to accomplish that feat. The Dolphins double-teamed Brown and kept plenty of bodies around him the entire game, daring someone else to beat them. The strategy worked to perfection as Brown was held to just four receptions and 39 yards and vented some frustration afterwards. He was targeted eight times and many were forced throws into coverage. The Dolphins would be wise not to stray far from their initial strategy and force the Steelers to make changes offensively a second time around.
No. 3: Pittsburgh must find an answer for Jay Ajayi
This week marks a "full-circle" moment for Ajayi. His 204 rushing yards against Pittsburgh in October provided the spring boarded for his breakout season. The Steelers simply had no answer for Ajayi, who surpassed 200 rushing yards three times on his way to 1,213 yards this season. He wore down Pittsburgh's defense in the hot Miami weather. The Dolphins will give him the ball early and often, and it will be interesting to see if Ajayi has the same effectiveness in the Pittsburgh's bitter cold.
Expect plenty of adjustments and counters in the rematch, especially on Pittsburgh's end. The strategic chess match between these teams and coaching staffs will be fun to watch.
New Delhi: Narendra Modi is pretty much ready to address the nation on the occasion of 71st Independence Day of India tomorrow.
PM Modi will hoist the National Flag from the Red Fort ramparts for the fourth time.
In an attempt to make his address to the nation as special, he had invited suggestions from the public regarding issues he should cover in his speech.
He has already announced that he would give his 100 percent in minimizing the total time of his speech too.
So many people have come up with interesting recommendations for the Narendra Modi to talk about.
On mygov.in website, more than 12,000 people have reacted to PM Modi's request.
Below are few interesting suggestions shared by the citizens:
1. Vidhya Peddireddy: We are working in IT industry and we do not have any other income other than Salary. It will be great if we get an option of including expenses of the family instead of individual tax filing.
2. Paresh Desai: The amount of benefits and facilities given to Ministers should be stopped. They don't deserve it.
3. Aezun Ram Bose: Girls don't need reservation, give us safety, freedom.
4. Sanjeev Krishnan: We can have a student parliament in Bharath. As said by our beloved former President Abdul Kalam ji, students and youngsters are the only force who have the potential to make Bharath a developed nation by 2020.
5. Dr. V. S. Mishra: I would like you to clarify your comments on “Gau Rakshaks”. After your comment, corrupt police personnel are using your comments to harass and book false cases against genuine animal lovers and AWBI officers who inform/complain to them about illegal trafficking and slaughter of cattle.

Picture this, you're a scientist at the National Weather Service, and you see the image above – a 110 kilometre (70 mile) blob flying across Colorado – on your weather radar.
Is it birds? Aliens after some Colorado craft beer?
"Look at what's flying into Denver!" tweeted the NWS Boulder office. "Radar from last hour showing what we believe to be birds. Any bird experts know what kind?"

"We hadn't seen a signature like that in a while," said NWS meteorologist Paul Schlatter, who first spotted the radar blip, to CBS News.
"We detect migrating birds all the time, but they were flying north to south."
This direction of travel would be very unusual for migratory birds for the time of year.
Turns out they weren't birds at all, as eyewitness accounts soon confirmed. Instead, this crazy mass was actually migrating painted lady butterflies.

Giant migrations, and good conditions, lead to the insects showing up on radar – and apparently the people in Colorado have been pulling out all the stops to make the state butterfly friendly.
Mary Ann Colley with the Butterfly Pavilion in Westminster, Colorado, said there are a number of factors contributing to the large numbers.
"We've been planting the right types of plants, and with the fantastic weather we've been having, it's the right combination of success for these butterflies," she told KUSA.
Seriously, nature is amazing.
Selma Mayor Darrio Melton held a news conference Saturday to speak out about the violence in the city. (Source: WSFA 12 News)
A homicide investigation is underway in Selma, according to Dallas County District Attorney Michael Jackson.
Jackson said a Selma resident in his 20s was found dead Saturday morning with a gunshot wound to the head.
According to Selma police, the victim was found in a vehicle in the 100 block of Lamar Avenue after officers were called to the area on a report of a suspicious vehicle.
Police haven't released the identity of the victim.
According to the district attorney, no arrests have been made.
New Selma Mayor Darrio Melton said he couldn't comment on an ongoing investigation, but held a news conference Saturday to speak out about violence in the city.
"We are the city that gave the world hope. We are the city that allowed people to dream. And that is what we will be working on as we move forward...to make sure that we are instilling that hope in our young people that has been lost," Melton said. "There is an epidemic in our city with violence. I'm saying to the citizens of the city: this is not just city hall's fight. This is all of our fight. From the school house, to your personal house, from our churches, from the government, from every citizen in the city, this is all of our fight."

ISLAMABAD - The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday declared delimitation of four districts by the Election Commission of Pakistan as null and void.
IHC judge Justice Aamer Farooq conducted the hearing of the petitions and nullified the delimitations of four districts including three from Punjab and one from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa after finding that they had been delimited in violation of the law.
The IHC announced the decision after conducting the hearing of over 40 petitions and directed the ECP to conduct the delimitation of four districts including Jhang, Jhelum, Toba Tek Singh and Lower Dir afresh in accordance with the law.
The court reserved verdict on the delimitation of Rahim Yar Khan, Bahawalpur, Chakwal, Battagaram and Haripur.
The petitioners had contended that the standard procedure had not been followed in the delimitation of the constituencies.
Justice Farooq ruled that the rules for the proportion of the population that have been followed in the delimitation of other constituencies should be kept in view while delimiting constituencies in these eight districts as well.
The ECP's delimitations have faced severe criticism from political circles and a total of 108 petitions had been filed with the IHC alone against the exercise many of that still remain pending.
At the same time, Justice Aamer Farooq disposed of petitions challenging the delimitation of the federal capital after ECP representatives assured the court that the anomalies are already being rectified.
The IHC will now take up another 37 petitions related to 20 other constituencies on Wednesday (today).
According to the Delimitation of Constituencies Act, 1974, the constituencies for elections to the National and Provincial Assemblies have to be redrawn after every census.
Separately, the Islamabad High Court turned down a petition challenging a government decision to abolish the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council and amendments to AJK Interim Act 1974.
IHC judge Justice Aamer Farooq took up the petition moved by members of Kashmir Council and dismissed it after hearing arguments of both the sides.
The bench held that the government could take measures about the Kashmir Council keeping in view the laws and the Constitution.
Deputy Attorney General Raja Khalid appeared before the court on behalf of the federation and adopted that approval from the cabinet would be sought for the abolition of administrative and financial powers of the Kashmir Council.
Raja Khalid assured the court that no step would be taken against the law and the Constitution.
Member of Kashmir Council Siddique Battali and others had moved the court against the government's decision and nominated the federation and others as respondents.
During the hearing, the petitioners' counsel adopted that the Kashmir Council was the only legal and constitutional bridge between Pakistan and AJK. He contended that in every democracy of the world, every Parliament has two houses and the Kashmir Council was the ‘Senate' of AJK.
He had contended that the stakeholders were not taken into confidence before formulation of the constitutional draft and it was only prepared by the secretary and adviser to the prime minister. He also argued that the political leadership of Pakistan and Kashmir were also not taken into confidence.
The counsel maintained that Parliament as well as the institutions responsible for the security were also not taken into confidence. He had argued that the amendments could cause serious implications regarding the security and defencee of Pakistan and AJK.
He had adopted that AJK was very sensitive issue and change, on the desire of anyone, could not be brought there. He had said that the current government was going to complete its tenure and the new caretaker setup was being installed and in such a scenario, the present government had no powers to bring drafted changes in AJK.
The petitioners had prayed to the court to bar the government from abolishing the Kashmir Council and amendments to AJK Interim Constitution 1974.
Police are warning Londoners to stay alert and keep their doors locked after five Old North homes were broken into on Tuesday and Wednesday.
In all of the cases, the homes were occupied and the suspect or suspects were scared off, police say. A release from the London Police Service said every break and enter “involved entry through unlocked rear doors of the home, or through garages.”
The incidents were all reported between 10:00 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. on Tuesday and Wednesday, during which times other crimes such as thefts from cars were also reported.
“The London Police Service wants to take this opportunity to remind the public to keep doors and windows of your residence locked at all times, and to remain vigilant of your surroundings,” said Cst.

There is much debate on how Justin Trudeau should address Donald Trump's radical policies. Photo: CC, Alex Guibord.
Should PM push Canadian ideals or be wary of economic consequences?
Justin Trudeau was elected in Canada on the promise of embracing diversity and inclusion. On this point, and several others, Trudeau's viewpoint stands in stark contrast to the newly elected United States president Donald Trump and his tendency towards isolationism.
So, in the wake of his first official meeting with Trump on Monday, Feb. 13, how should Trudeau tackle this diplomatic minefield going forward?
Trudeau needs to push back harder against Trump
When Donald Trump won the U.S. election in November, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a statement that said he looked “forward to working very closely with President Trump.” But after Trump's first month in office, during which he introduced legislation to carry out many of his shocking election promises, Trudeau should no longer turn a blind eye.
During his time in office, Trudeau has demonstrated over and over again that he can be eloquent. But offering an infinite amount of praise to Canada for not being like the U.S. does not take the place of real action.
Trump's recent executive order barring U.S. travel for people from seven Muslim majority countries, as well as temporarily blocking refugee resettlement, is one of the most impactful and unexpected actions so far.
Trudeau responded to this order with a tweet: “To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength”.
This message sounds nice and was retweeted over 428,000 times, but it has not leaded to any policy changes to date.
When asked by Thomas Mulcair during Question Period on Jan. 31 why he would not denounce the travel ban, Trudeau hid behind his concern for the economy: “We need to make sure that we are protecting Canadian jobs by having a constructive working relationship with our most important trade partner and ally.”
Of course the economy is important, but is it worth sacrificing our values in order to pander to our southern neighbour's erratic leader?
According to the U.K. and Germany, the answer is no. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the travel ban “in no way justified” and British Prime Minister Theresa May publicly expressed disagreement with the ban as well.
The massacre at a Quebec City mosque last month, as well as numerous reports of hate crimes happening across the country, has forced Canadians to face the fact that hatred exists here too. And when we have a prime minister who has not publicly denounced the discriminatory rhetoric growing south of the border, it contributes to the normalization of xenophobia and racism in the Great White North.
There's a lot of opportunity for the government to act. The New Democratic Party has proposed that the government offer a home to refugees bound for the U.S., raise its 2017 cap on privately sponsored refugees, and suspend the Safe Third Country Agreement.
Canadians are known as a people who are overly polite and don't like to offend others, but Trudeau needs to gather his courage and speak out against this bully.
The drive to define the our country's patchwork culture is a constant challenge, but it's arguably our diversity that unites us. We don't have much that ties us together, and if we lose these values there won't be much left.
As Mulcair told Trudeau during Question Period last month, “it is always the role of the Canadian Prime Minister to stand up to racism and hatred.”
Trudeau needs to fulfil this role.

Doing more to fight Trump would be a mistake
Soon after Donald Trump was elected President, Trudeau issued an invitation for him to visit Canada.
For many Canadians, Trump's election alone has been enough to make them gag, and the idea of him visiting our country is nauseating. Some even feel that this goes against the principles and Canadian values that Trudeau has espoused.
Additionally, the recent shooting in Quebec has many Canadians nervous that Trump's rhetoric may be seeping into the national consciousness. Many believe he should have been officially uninvited.
So what is the best way for Trudeau to address these concerns going forward?
Well, firstly, it's important to note that Trudeau is dealing with approximately $541 billion in American trade, a number has been rising 4.5 per cent annually between 1993 and 2016. As cited by Global Affairs Canada, there are 3.3 million Canadian jobs tied with American trade, comparable to nine million American jobs tied with Canadian trade. There are literally millions affected by Canada's relationship with the U.S.
The United States and Canada have an intensely interwoven relationship that far predates Trump and there is no quick fix to extricate ourselves from American ties. It's unfortunate, but Trudeau can't just close the door on the States altogether.
Secondly, Trudeau doesn't get a say in American policy. Clearly, the greater issue for many isn't the economy—it's a clear question of human rights. Some Canadians want Trudeau to issue a strong stance that Trump's divisive rhetoric will not be tolerated. Fair enough. After all there are legitimate reasons to fear Trump, and we need a leader who will stand up against a potential fascist.
But let's review what's already happened. On Jan. 28 Trudeau tweeted “To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength. #WelcomeToCanada.” The tweet is diplomatically worded but is unmistakably a response to Trump's Muslim travel ban.
After Fox News falsely reported that the Quebec shooting was done by a Moroccan, they publicly apologized and deleted the report after Trudeau's office issued an overtly furious letter.
“These tweets dishonour … the memory of the six victims by spreading misinformation, playing identity politics, and perpetuating fear and division within our communities.”
Through actions like this, Trudeau has not been silent in the face of recent events. He has made Canada's position globally known and in direct opposition to Trump's fear-mongering politics.
The unfortunate truth is that as long as Trump has a passport, he can visit Canada. In the meantime, Trudeau can only manage Canadian interests. It is his responsibility to maintain our values through his own actions, not Trump's. It's also his responsibility to ensure we remain strong as a country economically.
The prime minister may be dreading the idea of shaking Trump's short-fingered hand, but you'd have to be a fool to swat at a nesting eagle without an end game.

WASHINGTON - Senior Taliban officials have been secretly negotiating with Afghan officials on a possible ceasefire, the commander of US and NATO forces in Afghanistan disclosed Wednesday.
“A lot of the diplomatic activity and dialogue is occurring off the stage, and it's occurring at multiple levels,” General John Nicholson said in a teleconference with reporters at the Pentagon. He would not identify the figures involved in the negotiations, except to say that they included mid- and senior-level Taliban officials.
“I should point out they met in secret. This is how they were able to advance the talks,” he said, adding that the success of the effort depends in part on the “confidentiality of the process.”
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in late February proposed peace talks with the Taliban, saying they could be recognised as a political party if they accepted a ceasefire and recognized the country's 2004 constitution.
The Taliban have not officially responded, but deadly attacks have proliferated since then, particularly in Kabul, which has become the most dangerous place in the country for civilians.
But Nicholson, who has sought to drive the Taliban to the negotiating table by bringing to bear increased US military pressure, maintained that violence and progress can coexist. He likened the situation in Afghanistan to that of Colombia where the fighting continued up until the FARC guerrilla group and the government signed a peace accord in 2016.
On Wednesday, militants launched a gun and bomb attack on the Interior Ministry in Kabul, killing a policeman in another demonstration of their ability to strike at the heart of the Afghan capital.
Five people were injured in the attack, which was claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group.
Special forces rushed to the scene after the attackers detonated what police said was a car bomb at the first checkpoint leading to the ministry, then tried to battle their way inside.
“The fighting is over, the attackers have all been killed by security forces between the first and second security perimeter,” said Kabul police chief Daud Amin.
A security source told AFP a clearing operation was continuing. “The attackers used two vehicles to reach near interior ministry compound. There were eight attackers involved, one detonated his explosives, seven others were killed,” interior ministry spokesman Najib Danish told reporters.
Danish said one police officer had been killed and five civilians wounded. Policeman Mujibullah Nabizada was injured in the first blast.
“I dragged myself to the road and a car picked up and brought me to the hospital,” he told AFP from his hospital bed, where he was being treated for broken bones.
Seweeta Saberi, 17, was also wounded in the blast and taken to hospital. “Everyone is sitting in their loved ones' blood these days,” her brother Sameer told AFP. “We request you [government leaders], for God's sake, if you can't manage this country please resign.”
A security source told AFP there had been multiple blasts but could not confirm how many.
“I was in my office when I heard a blast followed by gunfire. We were told to stay inside our offices as the compound was attacked,” said one ministry employee.
IS, which is trying to make inroads in Afghanistan, claimed responsibility for the attack via its Amaq propaganda service.
Police also said they had found a car stuffed with explosives and guns at Kabul's international airport near the interior ministry on Wednesday.
Earlier on Wednesday, Taliban attackers including a suicide bomber stormed a police station in southern Afghanistan and killed six police officers. The bomber detonated an explosive-laden vehicle at the entrance of the police station in Puli Alam, the capital of Logar province, said provincial police spokesman Shapoor Ahmadzai.
Three other attackers then rushed into the police station compound, triggering a half-hour gunbattle with security forces, he said.
“In half an hour security forces killed all the attackers. Unfortunately, three national police and three traffic police were also killed. Eight civilians have also been wounded,” he told AFP.
Scouting report on Jose Ramirez from the 2013 Baseball America Prospect Handbook, after he had hit .354 in 70 games at Class A: "Ramirez has little power and minimal physical projection, so some scouts worry that more advanced pitches will eat him up. ... He endears himself to managers with how hard he plays. Ramirez lacks a high ceiling, but he's a well-rounded player who may continue to surprise as he moves through the system."
Editor's Picks Yes, he's amazing -- but Mookie Betts still isn't Mike Trout The Boston outfielder has the gaudier numbers. But there's a reason Trout is on pace to make baseball history -- and Betts is not.
Real or not? Bad days for Mets are worse than bad days for others There are bad days, and there are days like the Mets had on Tuesday, with more injuries, a shortened roster and a walk-off loss to Atlanta. 1 Related
Baseball America rated Ramirez as Cleveland's No. 23 prospect that year. The next year, he skipped past high-A and hit .272/.325/.349 at Double-A Akron, with three home runs in 113 games, and earned a September call-up. Baseball America bumped him up to the No. 9 Cleveland prospect in its 2014 scouting annual, although still behind a couple of other middle infielders named Dorssys Paulino and Ronny Rodriguez.
The scouting report on Ramirez from that year: "He has a smooth swing from both sides of the plate and sprays line drives to all fields. He does have some pull-side power, more so as a right-handed batter, but home runs aren't part of his game. Ramirez excels at working counts and rarely chases. ... The game never speeds up on Ramirez, and the major league staff raved about his energy."
In Wednesday's 9-1 victory for the Indians over the White Sox, Ramirez showed that home runs have most definitely become part of his game. He slugged his 17th, joining Albert Belle as the only players in Indians history with 17 home runs by the end of May:
Hosey hit his 17th HR on July 9th last season.
Today is May 30th. Here is his 17th ...#RallyTogether pic.twitter.com/wkTzwKICEi — Cleveland Indians (@Indians) May 30, 2018
Only J.D. Martinez, Mike Trout and Bryce Harper have more home runs, and while Ramirez's season has kind of been lost in the dust of the all-around brilliance of Trout and Mookie Betts, not to mention teammate Francisco Lindor, he's hit three home runs in his past four games, raising his season line to .300/.393/.628. The minor leaguer without much power is on pace for 51 doubles and 51 home runs. The only player in MLB history to hit the 50/50 mark: Belle, in the strike-shortened 1995 season.
So how did this happen? How did Ramirez develop from a player rated similarly to Ronny Rodriguez into one of the brilliant stars of the game? Let's start with a quick comparison to Rodriguez. The two infielders, just five months apart in age, were teammates at Akron in 2013:
Ramirez: .272/.325/.349, 533 PA, 3 HR, 39 BB, 41 SO
Rodriguez: .265/.291/.376, 498 PA, 5 HR, 16 BB, 76 SO
Ramirez didn't have a super-high walk rate, but he also rarely struck out. As the scouting report alluded to, he already had excellent plate discipline, and the strikeout rate shows he had excellent bat control. Rodriguez (who is now in Triple-A with the Tigers) lacked that kind of control of the strike zone. Given that Ramirez was young for Double-A, there were a lot of positive statistical indicators aside from the lack of power.

Ramirez split the 2014 and 2015 seasons between Triple-A and the majors, hitting .237/.295/.342 over 621 plate appearances with the Indians. At that point, he profiled as a classic utility infielder, but it's worth noting: (A) He was still very young, just 22 in 2015; (B) He had nearly as many walks as strikeouts that year (32 walks, 39 K's); (C) He hit .280/.341/.547 in September. His 2016 breakout actually had begun the previous season. Perhaps not coincidentally, Ramirez's power numbers started to grow after the new, livelier baseball was introduced around the 2015 All-Star break.
Those early reports mentioned Ramirez's energy and work ethic. No doubt that has helped in his development, although there are a lot 5-foot-9 guys in the minors who have energy and work hard yet never make the majors. Ramirez had the skills all along.
Earlier this week, Ramirez had to deny a report out of the Dominican Republic that he was about to be suspended for a positive PED test. The Indians contacted MLB, which confirmed that there was no truth to the rumor. Ramirez himself laughed it off and tweeted, "FAKE NEWS."
Still, there are all those home runs he's been hitting. The simple explanation: launch angle. According to Statcast data, Ramirez isn't hitting the ball much harder than he did in 2016, when he hit 11 home runs. He is, however, hitting more balls at an optimal launch angle.
2016: 88.0 mph average exit velocity, 12.9 degrees average launch angle
2017: 88.0 mph average exit velocity, 14.8 degrees average launch angle
2018: 88.7 mph average exit velocity, 16.8 degrees average launch angle
Oh, and his chase rate has continued to improve and his walk rate is higher than ever (he has more walks than strikeouts). It's a beautiful thing.
Alex Reyes back with Cardinals, but Brewers pull out the win: Good news for the Cardinals: Alex Reyes returned for his first major league start since Tommy John surgery and pitched four scoreless innings, averaging 95.0 mph with his fastball. Bad news for the Cardinals: The Brewers scored twice in the bottom of the seventh to come away with a 3-2 victory. Here's Christian Yelich tying the game with a 441-foot blast to dead center off Tyler Lyons:

As the Brewers continue to roll with the National League's best record, it will be interesting to see how the Cardinals sort out their pitching staff. Carlos Martinez is scheduled to make one rehab start later this week, then rejoin the rotation next week. That likely will push Luke Weaver or Jack Flaherty to the bullpen. Weaver's peripherals are solid, but he has a 4.63 ERA while Flaherty has a 2.15 ERA over his five starts, so it seems Weaver is most likely to go the pen. He could be used as a multi-inning backup for Reyes, who obviously will be monitored closely, and otherwise give the Cards some much-needed help in front of closer Bud Norris.
Of course, there's another way Flaherty or Weaver could be used: as trade bait for Manny Machado. The Cardinals' offense is still scuffling a bit as it waits for Marcell Ozuna and Dexter Fowler to start hitting. If they don't, the need for an impact bat will become more acute. Would St. Louis trade six seasons of team control of a young pitcher for half a season of Machado? I don't know if I would, but the Cardinals might have to make a big move in a tough division.
The tumbling Twins: I had liked what I'd seen from Fernando Romero in his few major league starts, but then this happened against a weak-hitting Royals lineup: 1⅔ IP, 9 H, 8 R, 1 BB, 1 SO, 1 HR. Ouch.
Maybe the Twins just wanted to make sure tonight wasn't another walk-off loss. — Aaron Gleeman (@AaronGleeman) May 31, 2018
The Twins failed to take advantage of Cleveland's slow start, but now the Indians have won five in a row to quickly give them some separation from the Tigers and Twins in the American League Central. The Twins can hold out hope for a surge -- Brian Dozier hasn't hit much, Miguel Sano hasn't done much and missed some time, Logan Morrison is still below .200 and Byron Buxton was a big zero when he was in the lineup (and is now out six weeks with a broken toe). But it feels like an opportunity lost. On the other hand, they still have 17 games remaining against Cleveland. They're going to have to win a lot of those.
Luis Severino, ace: The Yankees and Astros played a fun series, with some playoff-like electricity at Yankee Stadium. Justin Verlander won the opener, but the Yankees took the next two games, with Severino dominating in Wednesday's 5-3 victory, striking out 11 in seven innings and serving up only Max Stassi's two-run homer in the fifth.
I love how Severino has really learned to mix his pitches. He'll throw Alex Bregman seven straight four-seamers, like he did in the first inning, then follow up with a bunch of sliders to strike out Jose Altuve. He threw a bunch of changeups to Carlos Correa, and you don't see many right-on-right changeups, but Severino struck him out with one in the fourth, then got Correa to pop up in the sixth when he went after him with a fastball.
Severino improved to 8-1 with a 2.31 ERA and has been much better in two starts against the Astros than he was last season:
2018: 16 IP, 2 ER, 21 SO
2017 (including postseason): 16⅓ IP, 13 ER, 12 SO
More than 67 percent of a home's cost comes from regulatory costs levied by the government, according to the Manatee-Sarasota Building Industry Association's CEO.
And in Manatee County, those costs will increase Tuesday as the county government's impact fees will increase to 90 percent of the amount recommended by a consultant.
“It's rising again,” CEO Jon Mast said. “We don't like it. ... It makes it even harder to have affordable housing every time impact fees or regulatory fees increase.”
For the past year, the county has increased impact fees, which were 80 percent of the amount recommended by the consultant, and reinstated school impact fees have been in effect. Mast said while they don't like the increased fees, they are used to the 80 percent level.
“It's part of business now,” he said.
Impact fees are collected on newly constructed residential, retail and commercial development and can be used to help pay for new schools, roads, parks, public safety, law enforcement and libraries.
For new construction, the county determines how much in impact fees will be paid when the building application is submitted, but the impact fees are not collected until a certificate of occupancy is issued, according to John Barnott, the county's building and development services director.
“Permits applied for prior to April 18, 2017, will be assessed under the April 18, 2016, impact fee schedule,” the county's website states.
Ahead of Tuesday's impact fee increase, the county on Friday and Monday saw a 20 percent increase in residential building permit applications, according to Nick Azzara, county spokesman.
For a single-family detached home between 1,301 and 1,700 square feet in the northeast district, the total fee assessed for permits applied for on or after Tuesday will be $12,359, which is an increase of $2,454 over the fee for permits applied for prior to Tuesday.
“Every time a fee increases, it further creates a distance between affordable, attainable housing for the middle class,” Mast said.
Pat Neal, chairman of Neal Communities, echoed Mast.
“We've known about it for a year, so we've planned for the increase cost and it's expected and it's figured into our cost of doing business, which is always going up,” Neal said. “Everything is a cost, and ultimately all costs are passed onto the consumer. And it makes it harder to provide housing for families.”
The new rates are based on an impact fee study completed by TischlerBise. In December 2015, county commissioners voted to raise fees by 80 percent of the amount recommended by the consultant, and then increase that to 90 percent in the second year and to 100 percent in the third year.
During a work session scheduled for May 1, commissioners will discuss keeping the county impact fees at 90 percent of the fees recommended rather than increasing them to 100 percent in 2018.
Should the county impact fees increase to 100 percent next April, Neal said they would like to caution the county.
“If they go to 100 percent and the methodology is wrong, they give all the money back,” Neal said. “They risk giving all the money back.”
While Neal Communities supports the idea of impact fees as a way to maintain “our good quality of life in Manatee County,” Neal said the fees only fall on new homes.
“It would be more fair if this tax on homes applies to all homes,” he said. “It would be broader and generate more money.”
Both of Auli'i Cravalho's first two professional credits — the Disney animated feature “Moana” and NBC's high school theater drama “Rise” — have allowed her to showcase her love of performing as a singer, as well as an actor. It is not a fact she takes lightly. “I'm extremely blessed to have been able to go from one project to another that have both used my singing abilities,” Cravalho says.
But whereas “Moana” allowed her to tap into emotions solely in her voice, “Rise” required her to use her body, too, for a more full performance.
“I experienced a lot of firsts on the show,” she says. “The first time seeing my face on screen, the first time playing a character coming into her own, the first time having a love interest and creating a vulnerability within myself to be able to fall in love with an individual. It was very new and scary.”
Soon she'll reprise her role as Moana in Disney's first Hawaiian-dubbed film.
When did you first say to yourself and your family that you wanted to pursue a career in entertainment?
I don't think I ever really had that turning point — I don't believe I ever said that, even at a young age. I always loved singing and dancing and acting, and I think I was always a flamboyant and vocal person, but I also realized my own circumstance of growing up on a small island, in a small town and knowing that as much as I would love to do this, the chances are so slim. There's no way anyone is going to choose a girl from Hawaii who doesn't have any acting experience or singing experience who just loves to put on plays in her living room for her parents but otherwise has never seen the light of day on a stage. I never had the experience of saying this is what I want to do for the rest of my life because I honest to God didn't think it was a possibility.

So what was the turning point that made you go for it, even if you didn't think it was a possibility?
I was a freshman in high school when my friend and I put together an audition for a school project, and a casting director for Disney actually saw that and asked if I wanted to audition for “Moana.” I wasn't actively auditioning for things. I didn't know how to do a slate, so when I went in I messed up on the slate like three or four times. I didn't understand why I had to say my height. I was like, “That's a little invasive, does everyone have to go through that?” It was a fun and funny experience.
Was there any part of you that wondered if the casting director was legit when you got that email, or did you just feel like you just wanted to trust the process and see where it took you?
My mom and I, for sure, thought it was a scam — absolutely! We got the email, and it was on my school email because I had submitted the audition and was hoping for the best for my friends and I. And I got an email back saying, “Hey, I have another project that I'm hoping that you'll audition for if you'll just come into the ‘Hawaii Five-0' casting studio.” I remember showing it to my mom and saying, “OK, first of all I think she used the wrong ‘your' and I don't know how I feel about this.” My mom said she'd come with me and make sure everything was legit and shake hands and be professional and if anything, at least we'd know where the “Hawaii Five-0” casting studio is. She said we'd just put on a nice dress, and it would just be what it is, and that was already bigger than anything I thought was possible. I was just a freshman in high school trying to figure out life.
What was the process of “Moana” like, given that it's voiceover work, and presumably a more flexible schedule than many projects?
I was a sophomore at the time, and I would fly out once or twice a month, usually on the weekends. I still had to get in all of my assignments [for school] when I was flying out to Los Angeles for the sessions there, and I would also have tutoring and have to complete homework assignments, emailing back and forth. Sometimes I'd have to say, “I'm in a different time zone, and I'm going to make you proud being a Polynesian heroine. Can I please work with you on this [deadline]?” I worked so hard to be the student that I wanted to be, as well as to take on the new challenges and new career of acting. I really was trying to figure out how to balance both.
What has been the biggest adjustment?
I'm still in high school — I'm a senior now, taking economics and Spanish and Hawaiian — and I think it's been interesting being in that in-between of feeling like you're kind of an adult, maybe not being able to vote but still having very passionate thoughts about how you want to change the world. And having a career that praises you and kind of puts you on a pedestal — but still being late on so many of my homework assignments and getting in trouble with my mom for not cleaning my room. My mom is keeping me normal and keeping me grounded, and I appreciate that because I don't want to get caught up in this industry, but it's finding that fine line and that balance between whoever Auli'i is and whoever Auli'i wants to be.
How have you felt about going from Hawaii to New York to film “Rise”?
I experienced the coldest winter of my life — and apparently the coldest winter New York has experienced in about 100 years. I thought I was just going to go and be super cute in my scarves and my hats and my coats and get fingerless gloves, but I was just trying to survive! I was wearing all black, layers upon layers. The food is different there from what I'm used to. But my mom is basically my rock and my little bit of home. No matter what's different about the city, she's what gives me that little bit of peace because wherever she is, it's home for me.
What was it about the character of Lilette in “Rise” that made it feel like the perfect first live-action project for you?
Lilette is a beautiful, strong, young woman who's figuring out what she wants to do. She's growing up in a small town, like I did, and a lot of times when you come from a small town, there's a small mindset and a box that people put you [in] — and oftentimes a family has been there for a few generations so not only are you put into a box of “Well, you grew up in a small town” but [also] “You're from this family with this last name, and you're a girl so you must be going into this particular field like your mother and your grandmother.” And I related to that so deeply, and I thought this was beautiful. Who would think of creating a story like this — and who would think of putting a girl's heartache and heartbreak into a story like this?
Do you see any of yourself in Lilette?
She grows up in a single parent household, like I have, and the feeling of a mother and daughter against the world resonated so deep within me. Both of them want the best for each other — and not really knowing what that means but knowing they're going to fight for each other no matter what was going on. They're going to get through this together.
How did the high school theater troupe within the show compare to real life theater troupes you may have been a part of in your own high school?
Well, I was in high school theater in that I auditioned for things and it was a requirement in my school, but I didn't actually get to perform. So through Lilette I have been able to have the experience. This troupe has just been amazing, really on and off screen. I've never had such an experience where everyone that I'm working with that I get to call my friends have the same passion that I do and want the best for the show we're putting on — and want the best for each other.
Did it mean more than your first on-screen role allows you to exhibit your musical talents in addition to acting?
I was really surprised that I could go from one film — “Moana” — where I had kind of just jumped in and knew how to make my voice sad or that a tiny lilt at the end of a phrase could add emotion, and then to transition into “Rise” where you're now going to see my face on screen for the first time and also have to have control over my body and facial expressions. I'm much more used to controlling my emotion through my voice — I know what that's supposed to sound like and I know what that's supposed to feel like — and it was interesting to translate that into a physical aspect. So I was lucky to have a project where I could work on something that I was used to but also on something that I could have the challenge of figuring out what to do with my body. I worked with my castmates to develop my own kind of style.
Where did the directors come in? Was there anyone in particular that helped you shape who Lilette would be?
I talked to a lot of the writers, quite honestly, and I talked with Rosemary Rodriguez who was one of the directors — a fantastic woman. We had a new director every episode or every two episodes, and even that allowed me to not get comfortable with my performance, and that was so important for me because that made me want to be better. Each of them had their own flares and their own little things that they're looking for. And each of those very different styles of directing pushed me to just kind of do it. No matter how scared I was — I had my first kiss on screen with Damon Gillespie, and I did not know what to do with my face! And the director I had then, Patrick Norris, said, “For these first ones, you just make it whatever you want it to be. Don't overthink it.” So when you're in the moment and you're in your character, it becomes more freeing. And as the season went on, I was so much more comfortable with myself that my character seems more comfortable with relationships. It became real to me, like it would have to Lilette.
LaForge said he's slowing down and instead of so many ‘stings' wants to focus on law reform to keep pedophiles in jail longer
Surrey Creep Catchers' president Ryan LaForge said he's “done with citizens arrests” and “done getting the police involved” after pleading guilty to two counts of assault this week.
“It has nothing to do with police themselves, every cop I've dealt with has been good,” LaForge told the Now-Leader Tuesday, the day after he pleads guilty to two counts of assault in Surrey Provincial Court which stemmed from “stings” his group did in Whalley on April 3 and 19, 2017.
“I have no hard feelings or whatever, but they're up against the same battle we are, as a community…. I don't know what it's going to take for everyone to wake up at the same time and say enough's enough,” he added.
In the April 3 incident, LaForge said he performed a “citizens arrest” on a man he alleged came to pay for sex with a six-year-old outside the Tim Horton's at Central City Shopping Centre, in the 10100-block of King George Boulevard.
While the convictions have led to LaForge discontinuing such “citizens arrests,” they don't deter him from continuing to conduct “stings,” which involve Creep Catchers representatives posing as children online, arranging to meet adults who think they've been communicating with a child and confronting them, while filming them.
LaForge said Tuesday he is still live streaming videos of “stings” on Facebook, which he then removes from Facebook and posts on his website.
While the group was doing about “five catches a day” in their early days in 2016, LaForge said he aims for one a week now.
“I've slowed down for a couple of reasons,” he said Tuesday. “One is just for my mental well-being. I'm just taking it a lot slower, to just take care of myself mentally, have more time for my family and stuff. I work more, I kind of ran out of my savings after a good year, so I'm back to work.”
LaForge said he's changing gears, to a degree, and instead of so many “stings,” wants to focus his time on changes to legislation to keep convicted pedophiles in prison longer.
“I knew I had to attack this epidemic from another position,” LaForge said. “I'm sitting here catching guys all the time and yes, it's exposing them, people are seeing it, it's creating awareness, but I feel like a dog chasing my own tail. I want to see the laws change so if and when these guys are caught by police there's a mandatory minimum sentence.”
Long sentences are “too rare,” he added.
“It's not fair, they leave a trail of broken children,” LaForge said, noting he's also become frustrated with other aspects of the system.
“People say ‘it's not even a real child,'” when referencing Surrey Creep Catcher stings, he said, “but that's what's wrong with the justice system. They wait for a victim before they can do anything. Unfortunately, I get parents messaging me all the time…. Our laws are a joke. That's the sad, sad thing. India just adopted a death penalty for sexual assault under the age of 12. We have third and second world countries taking stands against this and here we are, protecting them.”
Further, LaForge said the group is also pushing for a public registry of sex offenders.
But, he acknowledged, those would be “huge, huge steps” and said he's working with “not a lot of resources.”

In court on Monday, LaForge plead guilty to two counts of assault. While he had also faced charges of uttering threats and breach of undertaking, those were stayed.
LaForge will not serve any jail time, but was handed 12 months probation and was given a conditional sentence.
His conditions include keeping the peace, notifying the court and probation office of any change in employment or occupation, to not possess anything resembling a weapon, and to not publish or make publicly available on the internet any information about individuals targeted by the group.
A former member of the group, Lance Loy, on May 22 also plead guilty to assault in connection to the April 19, 2017 incident.
Also facing charges after the April 3 incident is Burnaby resident Kuljinder Singh Bhatti, 35. Bhatti is accused of trying to lure a minor for a sexual purpose and making an arrangement with a person for a sexual offence involving a person under age 18.
Bhatti's next appearance in Vancouver Provincial Court is set for Aug. 27.
Since Surrey Creep Catchers' inception, Surrey RCMP have cautioned the public against such work.
“Police want to remind the public that vigilantism, no matter how well meaning, poses significant risks to the safety of all those involved,” Surrey RCMP Corporal Scotty Schumann said last year. “Using our highly trained investigators in a controlled environment is the best way to get dangerous offenders off our streets and ensure they are held accountable.”
He said police advise the public to go to www. cybertip.ca to report incidents of online sexual exploitation of children.
Meantime, Surrey Creep Catchers made national headlines September of 2016 after a woman working with the group posed as a 15-year-old girl and allegedly communicated with an off-duty Surrey Mountie online after posting an ad on Craigslist.
A meeting was set up outside the Boston Pizza at Surrey Central Shopping Mall in Whalley and LaForge and his crew live-streamed the sting on the Internet.
Constable Dario Devic was arrested on Sept. 9, 2016 and suspended from police duty. Devic was then charged in October, 2016 and currently faces one charge of child luring. He is due in Surrey Provincial Court on June 4.

WASHINGTON — Mayor Muriel Bowser last week announced the site of a new Short-Term Family Housing program, on 14th Street in Ward 1.
The Columbia Heights site is the final location selected in the District's plan to close and replace the aging and isolated D.C. General Family Shelter. There have been numerous calls for the current family shelter to close, especially after 8-year-old Relisha Rudd disappeared from there in 2014.
The 14th Street project includes 35 short-term family housing apartment-style units and 15 permanent units for low-income seniors. The property is on the site of the Rita Bright Community Center, which Mayor Bowser said will get new life as part of the development.
“Ending homelessness is a citywide challenge that requires a citywide solution,” Bowser said in a statement.
Work at the site is slated to begin in January 2019 and be completed by the spring of 2020.
Construction is already underway for projects in Wards 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The Ward 2 shelter, the Patricia Handy Place for Women, opened last year.

There are many – political leaders, public officials, private sector instances – whose reputations were shredded through their close proximity to the Gupta family. Some of those implicated will never recover. Global auditing giant KPMG suffered a massive body blow as Guptas' auditors and consultants, as well as for the role the firm played in the SARS “rogue unit” narrative. In its latest progress update on the day SARS commissioner Tom Moyane was suspended, KPMG has made a firm commitment to absolute transparency and has highlighted significant changes to governance, quality control and risk management. It will also, in future, be more selective about the clients it takes on. By MARIANNE THAMM.
The association of KPMG SA with the Gupta family as well as the South African Revenue Service (SARS) under the leadership of Tom Moyane was almost the kiss of death for the auditing giant, as well as many other private sector entities drawn into the deep web of corruption and illegality.
The fallout, once the #GuptaLeaks made evident the extent of the Gupta family's stealthy capture of the state – aided and abetted by the private sector, public officials and high-ranking ANC politicians – was swift and brutal.
There was metaphorical blood on the KPMG boardroom floor as senior staff including KPMG SA CEO, Trevor Hoole, chief operating officer and country risk management partner, Steven Louw, and chairperson Ahmed Jaffer, exited stage left in September 2017.
Six months after the announcement of sweeping reforms, Professor Wiseman Nkuhlu (who took up his position as Non-executive Chairman Elect of the KPMG SA board on 1 March) and CEO Nhlamu Dlomu have reported back to staff, setting out the course the firm has already charted and will continue to chart post the Gupta and SARS scandals in a concerted effort to claw back credibility.
One of the key decisions is that there will be a centralised system for “client acceptance” as well as a tightening of client engagements. Client acceptance is now done by a centrally located team of “risk management professionals”.
Prospective KPMG clients can also expect to undergo detailed background checks that will include “related parties of individual entities that comprise the client, including group companies, shareholders and directors”.
The firm also terminated its relationship with some clients after reviewing its entire client portfolio. Over and above this, KPMG SA has completed an assessment of the services it offers “to ensure that the risks associated with the various services provided across the audit, tax and advisory functions remain acceptable, bearing in mind the economic and political environment in which the firm operates.”
Meanwhile, KPMG had returned, on 29 January, the R23-million it had been paid to conduct the forensic report for SARS.
In his message to KPMG staff, Professor Nkuhlu pointed out that this was a critical time for the country and the auditing profession.
“Across the nation, we have seen institutions weakened, and too often leaders in the private and public sectors have failed to stand up for the values our democracy was built on,” said Professor Nkhulu.
The role of a professional services firm such as KPMG, he said, “is ultimately to serve the public interest” and to stand for “ethical conduct, transparency and respected values”.
Dlomu told staff that the firm had taken “full responsibility for the mistakes that were made and have apologised unreservedly for the impact of our actions”.
Dlomu also undertook to produce an interim baseline Integrated Report by the end of April which will be published by the end of December 2018.
“This report, amongst other initiatives, will track progress against our key projects, support our commitment to transparency and demonstrate that our words and intent are backed up by action,” said Dlomu.
Among significant governance changes made is the separation of the exco from the board. Whereas previously the board had consisted of 16 members, including the exco, it now consists of two executive directors (as recommended by the King IV Report), two independent non-executive directors, with the remainder being elected partners. The changes, said Dlomu, would not only provide more diversity but also increased oversight of the executive.
The new board has also been downsized “to improve decision-making and efficiency”.
Apart from Professor Nkuhlu, the appointment of lawyer and authority on corporate governance, Ansi Ramalho, marks the first of the “South African Big Four” audit firms to introduce an independent non-executive chair and director to the board.
Over and above these changes to the exco and board structure, the role of the Risk Management Partner – responsible for the firm's overall system of quality control – is now a full-time position. The roles of Head of Audit and Head of Audit Risk Management have been separated “to ensure that the Head of Audit Risk Management can focus sufficiently on risk management matters within the audit practice”.
The firm had strengthened its audit practice with a committee of senior partners meeting on a monthly basis to oversee this aspect. All audit partners and staff had received training with regard to “the need for professional scepticism” as well as the auditing of significant unusual transactions and arrangements.
With regard to its relationship with SARS and the “rogue unit” report, KPMG said it had identified issues that “cannot happen again”. In so doing it had, with regard to its forensic practice, made new rules for client engagement and continuance, instituted annual training for partners and established additional controls before finalising reports.
“Particular attention will be paid to ensuring the scope and agreed procedures result in robust and comprehensive investigation of the subject matter.”
With regard to non-compliance, KPMG had put in place “more punitive sanctions” for non-compliance with internal policies and poor quality performance ratings.
KPMG staff will, in future, not be attending clients' weddings, as permitted levels for “hospitality and gifts” had been “reduced significantly”.
With regard to two inquiries into KPMG's conduct – the IRBA and the Ntsebeza Independent Inquiries – Dlomu said that the investigation into the audit of Linkway and the attendance at the Gupta wedding by four KPMG partners would be completed at the end of March.
KPMG had been invited by the Ntsebeza Inquiry to provide testimony at a later stage. Meanwhile, KPMG had been informed that the inquiry would not meet its scheduled completion date of 30 April.
KPMG would, said Dlomu, co-operate fully with any enquiries with regard to a complaint made by the Companies and Intellectual Properties Commission (CIPC) to SAPS regarding an alleged contravention of the Companies Act by KPMG. The same applied to the firm's appearance at parliamentary hearings where it will be asked to explain its work carried out for the Guptas and SARS.
With regard to “engagement partner” Johan van der Walt, author of the KPMG report, Dlomu said that evidence collated by Van der Walt in connection with the Shaik corruption charges had been based largely on the same facts as the Jacob Zuma case and had been accepted by the courts in the Shaik trial and appeal.
“We have no reason to doubt the accuracy of that evidence or any further work performed in connection with it.”
The firm was in the process of setting up a fund with the R40-million in fees earned from work done for Gupta-related entities since 2002 to consider grants and donations to not-for-profit organisations.
“Applications will shortly be open for organisations who wish to apply for funding. KPMG will disburse funds to projects that demonstrate impact and which embody the highest levels of accountability, transparency and responsibility. In order to meet this objective, a strong governance structure is being established to thoroughly evaluate all proposals.”
Over and above the reforms since the September 2017 statement, an advisory council would be established to provide “advice, expertise and guidance to the CEO and the KPMG South Africa Board on socio-economic issues and broader stakeholder expectations”.
The Advisory Council's mandate, said Dlomu, would focus on issues of public trust, the perception of the profession and effective stakeholder engagement and communications. Members of the Advisory Council would not be directors or officers of KPMG South Africa.
With regard to a stronger public interest mandate, the KPMG board's social and ethics committee would have its mandate “expanded to include public interest matters and will include an independent non-executive director in its membership”.
Finally, the firm would be undertaking a comprehensive “culture and ethics assessment” that would be followed by an appropriate “change programme”.
Professor Nkuhlu reminded KPMG staff that “deep and meaningful reforms will take time” but was confident that “a reformed KPMG has its part to play in strengthening the profession's standing, training our country's current and future business leaders and in the fight against corruption”. DM

Physical therapist Karena Wu couldn't help notice a trend in patients visiting her New York City office this year. Many were under age 35, enjoyed strenuous workouts and were suffering immense hip pain.The millennials had pushed themselves in endurance races such as the Tough Mudder or weekly CrossFit and metabolic conditioning classes that placed wear and tear on their bodies, she said. And with little downtime between routines or adherence to proper form, they were putting the long-term health of their hips at risk.“A lot of millennials are doing all of these high-intensity exercises that are great for the mental and physical components of health, but if you're not as conditioned as you think, you're going to put excessive stress on the soft tissue and the joint,” said Wu, owner of ActiveCare Physical Therapy.It's not uncommon for active young adults to experience some joint pain, but orthopedic specialists worry that regimens that rely on heavy weightlifting or intense aerobic exercises are causing more hip injuries. There are no definitive studies that correlate the two, but research in the Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy says high-intensity activities appear to increase the risk of hip osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease.Article Continued BelowWhat's more, specialists at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center have reported a rise in cases of young adults with femoral acetabular impingement, a condition that occurs when the ball of the femur fails to fit securely into the hip socket. High levels of activity, they say, can cause the plate to fuse in an abnormal shape and result in a hip impingement.Shane Nho, an orthopedic surgeon at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, recalls a spike in hip, shoulder and knee injuries as CrossFit gyms sprung up several years ago. These days, he said, patients are coming in with hip ailments from high-intensity interval training, even some barre classes.“We probably see at least a couple patients a week with injuries related to those types of intensive classes,” Nho said. “The types of workouts these guys are doing … they're doing it at all costs, despite poor form, mechanics, fatigue or their actual baseline level of conditioning.”

Julie Densham has big plans for her Hamilton backyard.
As she rooted around there, tossing out old twigs and weeds, she told Global News she planned to fill in a rectangular dirt patch there with a garden.
When she moved in, that patch housed an old, unused tin shed. She was not prepared for the surprise she found when she tore it down: A grave marker attributed to a 92-year-old woman.
“In loving memory of Annie Barton 1866-1958,” the marker said.
Densham said when she found it, it was upside down.
“It was a really, really heavy rock. It must weigh 200 pounds. So I flipped it over and the first thing I saw was ‘mother,' and I'm a mom, so I liked it,” Densham said with a smile.
“And I noticed the ‘Annie Barton' on there … And I was just really curious as to how did this marker get here and who was Annie Barton?”
While there is no indication of an association, the Barton name goes back a long way in Hamilton — which was once known as Barton Township.
Barton Street has long been one of the main routes in the lower city and there is a business district named Barton Village.
Densham said she was slightly worried about what she'd stumbled upon, but more intrigued.
“I love it,” she told Global News.
“I literally was going to come out with my Ouija board at midnight just for something fun to do.”
After putting a picture of the tombstone on a local Facebook group, fellow residents and City of Hamilton staff were able to provide Densham with a little more information and assure her that there was not a body buried in her backyard. It turns out the stone was a spare marker left over by Annie Barton's family, who used to own the property.
“Annie Barton's marker was changed. They had to alter it (after Barton's daughter died and was buried beside her) … And so because you pay for that marker, (her family) were given the option of bringing that marker home, which they did,” she explained.
“The great-great-grandson of Annie Barton emailed me and told me that he remembers that marker being there and upside down. He remembers playing in that sort of area. So they all have memories, they all knew it was there, it wasn't creepy to them. But we didn't know this … Annie is buried at Woodland Cemetery with her fresh marker.”

Jim Boyko, Barton's great-great-grandson, said he plans to pick the marker up from Julie on Friday. He said it was left in that spot for years and that he simply forgot to take it with him when he moved out in 2010.
After having, in a way, shared a space with Annie Barton for the last year-and-a-half, Densham said her curiousity is piqued. She said she still plans to learn a little bit more about exactly who Barton was.
Meanwhile, a couple amateur genealogists have reached out to her over social media pledging to help her look into it.
Her name is Naiara Defelippe and her family says they're sorry.
They're sorry the 24 year-old migrant worker from Brazil, with no clothing, attacked a West Kelowna woman in her home more than a week ago in a fit of unprovoked rage.
Defelippe's uncle contacted Global News. He said the attack was completely out of character for his niece and suspects drugs played a role.
Brante Farell runs the farm where Defelippe was staying on the day of the attack. He's learned from her doctor that it's highly probable that drugs that were fuelling her behaviour — possibly magic mushrooms.
“Some type of bad drug mix — either slipped into her food or drug or something she took herself which caused a complete break,” he said.
Collin Crabbe is Daniell Ball's husband — the woman who was attacked. He too has heard about the mushroom story. He believes the problem is deeper than a bad batch of street drugs.
“Crime stemming from migrant workers in the area isn't an isolated incident. How are going to improve the resources and support for these workers to make sure they're not left in these isolated situations that cause and breed crime?,” Crabbe said.
Ball said that after dragging its feet, the City of West Kelowna is finally beginning to take action to address their concerns about neighbourhood safety and living conditions for the migrant workers.
Meantime, it appears Defelippe is slowly making a recovery.
“As far as I know she's going to fully recover. I was told that she's coherent and making calls to family and friends,” Brante Farell said.
But before she returns home to Brazil, Defelippe will have to face the music in Canada where she's facing several charges including assault.
She was released from custody Monday.
Imgur, the hugely popular photo and GIF sharing site with over 250 million users, is the latest to board the ephemeral storytelling train.
Like the ‘stories' feature inside Snapchat and Facebook/Instagram, which has cloned the heck of Snapchat, Imgur has moved into lean-back content with the arrival of ‘Snacks', a new feature that sits at the top of its mobile app.
With Snacks, Imgur is letting users watched an ongoing array of GIFs in one sitting. When one GIF is done, another replaces it immediately to keep the experience continuous. Unlike Snap, the content is actually standalone as it appears to be pulled from Imgur's vast library of content.
The result is something that is similar to Vine.
All in all, the feature seems ideal for Imgur users who are looking to fill a little free time, perhaps on the train or bus to work, without the hassle of having to manually find content. You can also follow GIF creators, too, making it a neat vehicle for discovery.
Snacks can be found under the ‘search' tab inside the Imgur app where they are matched to the day's feature tag — which happens to be Ocean today. Bad news for Android users, it looks like this feature is only on iOS at this point.
Imgur started out as the de facto photo service for Reddit but over the past year it has pushed to become a solution platform in its own right. It added chat features and the ability to follow other users last year, and last month it added a favorites folder which, while minor on the surface, finally allows users to stash their favorite media in a single place.
While it is smart to build a base that isn't reliant on third parties, Imgur's hand was rather forced by Reddit when it added image uploads in May 2016 to end its reliance in Imgur. Reddit has since added more social features like location tagging and its own video platform, to continue the separation.
It hasn't all been plain sailing for Imgur, though. More than 1.7 million emails and passwords were affected by a 2014 hack which was disclosed last month by Imgur.
The hack wasn't anything like the size of Yahoo — which is owned by TechCrunch parents AOL and Verizon and had most of its three billions users affected by a series of attacks — or Uber, which recently disclosed that 57 million accounts were compromised.
Imgur was also recognized for the speed of its disclosure. It said it only became aware of the hack on November 23, and by the morning of November 24 it had begun notifying impacted users (via their registered email address) and forcing password resets. It also released a blog post that same day.

Ruby Skye and Slide Bar closed earlier in the year and a new concert hall and restaurant/bar are almost ready to open in the space.
Located near Union Square at 420 Mason Street, the building will house the 1000-capacity concert venue named August Hall, a restaurant and bar named Fifth Arrow, and even a multi-lane bowling alley.
August Hall, named after August Headman who built the building in the 1890s, will be promoted and tickets through Live Nation Northern California.
“The room was beaten, tired and almost destroyed after 15 years, but the bones of the building were spectacular,” Jodi Goodman, president at Live Nation Northern California, told Billboard. “I felt like how Bill Graham probably felt when he first went into the Fillmore back in the day.”
Both August Hall and Fifth Arrow should open in early 2018.

Sinclair Broadcast Group has been forced to significantly revise its plan for station divestitures if its $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media is approved.
Sinclair's deal with Tribune promises to make the company by far the largest owner of TV stations in the country, which has drawn criticism from media watchdog groups and scrutiny from regulators.
Sinclair in February unveiled a plan to sell two top market Tribune stations — WPIX-TV New York and WGN-TV Chicago — in order to comply with federal ownership rules, but with the caveat that the friendly buyers would allow Sinclair to continue to operate the stations. That plan reportedly drew major pushback from the Justice Department and FCC, both of which are reviewing the deal.
On Tuesday, Sinclair identified 23 stations that would be sold to secure federal approval of the deal. The revised plan still calls for Sinclair to sell WGN-TV but continue to operate the station. The sale of WPIX, however, is off the table. Critics said Sinclair's deal were a brazen end run around the federal station ownership cap, right down to the shockingly low pricetags of $15 million for WPIX and $60 million for WGN. It's unclear if the sale price for WGN-TV has changed.
Sinclair has buyers lined up for all but seven of the stations. The company said it expects the deal to close near the end of the current quarter.
“After a very robust divestiture process, with strong interest from many parties, we have achieved healthy multiples on the stations we are divesting,” said Chris Ripley, Sinclair president-CEO. “While we continue to believe that we had a strong and supportable rationale for not having to divest stations, we are happy to announce this significant step forward in our plan to create a leading broadcast platform with local focus and national reach. The combined company will continue to advance industry technology, including the Next Generation Broadcast Platform, and to benefit from significant revenue and expense synergies.”
The new plan calls for the sale of mix of Sinclair and Tribune outlets. Large markets that will see turnover include Dallas and Houston, where Sinclair will part with Tribune-owned CW affiliates KDAF and KIAH, respectively. After the divestitures, Sinclair will own or operate some 215 stations serving 102 markets.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A senior North Korean official made a rare visit to the United States on Wednesday for talks about a possible summit between the leaders of the two countries but the sides appeared far apart on the central issue of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons.

Kim Yong Chol, a close aide of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and vice chairman of the ruling Workers' Party's Central Committee, arrived at New York's John F. Kennedy airport on a flight from Beijing. He was later seen entering a hotel in midtown Manhattan.
Kim Yong Chol is due to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday and Thursday to discuss whether to go ahead with an unprecedented meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim.
The summit, originally planned for June 12 in Singapore, has been cast in doubt as the two countries - which have technically been at war since the 1950s - test each other's diplomatic mettle.
Trump last week called off the summit after North Korea expressed anger at comments by senior U.S. officials. But Trump later said he was reconsidering his position and U.S., North Korean and South Korean officials have gone ahead with summit preparations anyway.
The White House said on Wednesday that negotiations at the demilitarized zone along the border between North and South Korea for the summit were going well and that it expects the historic meeting to take place on June 12.
Separately on Wednesday at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, Admiral Harry Harris, the outgoing head of U.S. Pacific Command who is Trump's pick to be the ambassador to South Korea, said North Korea remained the United States' most imminent threat. “And a nuclear-capable North Korea with missiles that can reach the United States is unacceptable,” Harris said.
A U.S. official said negotiations about the summit's agenda have so far been slow going, and the two fundamental issues, the definition of North Korean denuclearisation and whether both sides would take actions at the same time or separately, remained unsettled.
‘DENUCLEARISATION'
Trump has sworn not to allow North Korea to develop nuclear missiles that could hit the United States and wants North Korea to “denuclearize,” or get rid of its nuclear arms.
But the leadership in Pyongyang is believed to regard nuclear weapons as crucial to its survival and has rejected unilaterally disarming.
The U.S. official said the U.S. position remained that North Korea must agree to complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearisation before it can receive any financial assistance, such as relaxation of some economic sanctions, new food or other aid, or new investment, and that the degree of assistance would depend on the pace and extent of Pyongyang's actions.
North Korea's position going into the meetings with Pompeo in New York, meanwhile, was that a pledge of denuclearisation alone should open the way to economic relief, said the official, who is familiar with the talks and spoke on condition of anonymity.
South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted Seoul's Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon as saying in a speech on Wednesday that the differences between North Korea and the United States on the denuclearisation issue remained “quite significant” and it would not be easy to narrow the gap.
However, Cho added that the engagement of the leaders of the two countries meant “chances are high that common ground can be found.”
Kim Yong Chol is the most senior North Korean official to meet top officials for talks in the United States since Jo Myong Rok, a vice marshal, met then-President Bill Clinton at the White House in 2000.
A former military spy chief, he has played a central role in the thaw in relations over the past six months between North Korea and South Korea, as well as the United States.
During his tenure as a senior intelligence official, Kim was accused by South Korea of masterminding deadly attacks on a South Korean navy ship and an island in 2010. He was linked by U.S intelligence to a cyberattack on Sony Pictures in 2014.
North Korea denied any involvement in the attack on the ship and on Sony Pictures.
North Korea defends its nuclear and missile programs as a deterrent against what it sees as U.S. ambitions to overthrow its leadership and unite the Korean Peninsula. The United States stations 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War.

China will not allow anyone to use Hong Kong as a base for subversion against mainland China or to damage its political stability, Beijing's top official in the territory told state television.
Chinese leaders are increasingly concerned about a fledgling independence movement in Hong Kong, which returned to mainland rule in 1997 with a promise of autonomy known as "one country, two systems", and recent protests in the city.
In an interview with state television broadcast late on Sunday, Zhang Xiaoming, the head of China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, said Beijing will not interfere in matters that purely affect Hong Kong's autonomy.
"As far as Hong Kong is concerned, nobody is permitted do anything in any form that damage the country's sovereignty and security, they are not allowed to challenge the central government's authority or that of Hong Kong's Basic Law, they are not allowed to use Hong Kong for infiltration subversion activities against the mainland to damage its social and political stability," Zhang said.
China's parliament last month staged a rare interpretation of the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution, to effectively bar pro-independence city lawmakers from taking office there.
Chinese President Xi Jinping told outgoing Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying last month that China's central government strongly supports efforts by the Hong Kong government to curb moves by some promoting independence for the global financial hub.
The former British colony returned to China under the "one country, two systems" agreement that ensured its freedoms and wide-ranging autonomy, including a separate legal system.
But Communist Party rulers in Beijing have ultimate control, and some Hong Kong people are concerned they are increasingly interfering to head off dissent.
10 Milestones of Jeri-KO: A Eulogy to WWE's greatest friendship
You know what happened to Jericho and Owens greatest moments? They just made the list!
@ZacJones_SK by Zac Jones Top 5 / Top 10 15 Feb 2017, 19:28 IST
The bromance is over
The WWE Universe is in mourning this week after the tragic demise of everyone's favourite bromance, as Kevin Owens turned against his former best friend, Chris Jericho.
Although the implosion of Jeri-KO had been expected by many fans, not many were expecting it to occur prior to the Fastlane pay-per-view, and certainly didn't see it transpiring the way that it did.
There have been many entertaining friendships in WWE over the years, but there's never been one quite like Owens and Jericho. The chemistry between them was evident every time they performed together and both men have great comedic timing, which led to some of the most entertaining segments that WWE has produced in recent memory.
So with that being said, let's take a retrospective look at how Jeri-KO became one of WWE's most beloved acts.
#1 Owens & Jericho vs. Sami Zayn & Dean Ambrose
Where it all began
On a recent edition of Chris Jericho's podcast, ‘Talk Is Jericho', his guest was none other than his best friend, Kevin Owens. In this episode, both men told the story of how their budding bromance began. According to Kevin & Chris, it began way back in April of 2016 when they would team together on an episode of Smackdown to face their respective rivals at the time in Dean Ambrose and Sami Zayn.
After picking up the victory for his team, Kevin Owens was told to celebrate like he'd just won the Stanley Cup by Vince McMahon and did just that with an over the top celebration, where he ran and jumped into Jericho's arms.
Vince reportedly loved this and was howling with laughter when Chris & Kevin returned backstage and all three men agreed then and there that they had something they could work with in regards to Owens & Jericho.
Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock may have had other people in his suite between checking into the Mandalay Bay Resort on Sept. 28 and killing at least 58 people and taking his own life on Oct. 1, NBC News reports. Authorities are trying to understand why Paddock had a phone charger in his room that did not match any of the phones he owned and are additionally puzzled by a period when garage records show Paddock's car left the hotel but one of his keys was used to access his room.
"There are several possible explanations for these anomalies, the investigators say, but they want to get to the bottom of it," NBC News writes.
Investigators have yet to find a motive for the attack, although Paddock may have explored other targets before landing on Las Vegas, including the Lollapalooza music festival in Chicago and Fenway Park in Boston. Jeva Lange
WASHINGTON – The Pentagon official tells The Associated Press that transgender people can enlist in the military beginning Jan. 1, despite President Donald Trump‘s opposition.
The new policy reflects growing legal pressure on the issue and the difficult hurdles the federal government would have to cross to enforce Trump's demand to ban transgender individuals from the military. Two federal courts already have ruled against the ban.

Potential transgender recruits will have to overcome a lengthy and strict set of physical, medical and mental conditions that make it possible, though difficult, for them to join the armed services.
Maj. David Eastburn says the enlistment of transgender recruits will start Jan. 1 and go on amid the legal battles. The Department of Defence also is studying the issue.
AUSTIN, Texas -- Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed go from being teammates to opponents in match play.
Spieth and Reed have a 7-2-2 record as partners in two Ryder Cups and last year's Presidents Cup. They were drawn in the same four-man group for the Dell Technologies Match Play, which starts Wednesday at Austin Country Club. Spieth knows the course well from his days playing for the Texas Longhorns.
The format at this World Golf Championship is round-robin play through Friday, with the winners of each 16 groups advancing to a weekend of single elimination.
Dustin Johnson is the No. 1 seed. Also in his group is Kevin Kisner, one of his best friends from junior golf in South Carolina.
Tommy Fleetwood faces an all-England match Wednesday against Ian Poulter.
NEW YORK — This year's flu season is off to a quick start and so far it seems to be dominated by a nasty bug.
Health officials say the flu vaccine seems well matched to the viruses making people sick, but it's too early to tell how bad this season will be. The main flu bug this season tends to cause more deaths and hospitalizations and vaccines tend not to work as well against this type.
Flu began picking up last month. By the end of last week, seven states reported widespread flu activity: Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Virginia.
Most flu seasons don't really get going until around Christ-mas. That's how last year's flu season played out.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the latest data Friday.
NC lawmaker proposes bill that wouldn't require gun owners to obtain conceal permit
RALEIGH, N.C. (WFXB) – A new bill introduced in North Carolina is sparking a lot of controversy. It would allow people to carry guns without a permit.
State Rep. Larry Pittman introduced House Bill 69 last week in Raleigh. North Carolina's concealed carry law requires that an applicant first take a safety course. In making the permits optional, gun owners would no longer have to take the class.
If the bill passed, people would still need to do a background check. Eleven other states have constitutional carry and the bill would make it easier for permit-holders to travel to other states that have reciprocity with North Carolina.
SARASOTA, FL (October 5, 2017) — AquaNew, manufacturer of the Polarized Water, Watt-Ahh®, recently unveiled the new “Diamond Energy” label for its one-liter size bottle.
“The label design comes from a crystalline moment,” said AquaNew's COO, Dana Gourley. “When Inventor Rob Gourley and others first described a tetrahedral structure of Polarized Water (co-covalent bonding of dual oxygen with four hydrogen), I envisioned beautiful diamonds cascading through clear pure water. Of course, diamonds have a perfect carbon structure, while Polarized Water is 100% pure water. It is also well known that sparkling diamonds have a crystalline-like energy similar to that of Polarized Water enriched with electrons.”
Three diamonds falling through water can be seen through the new transparent front label with its motto “Healing Requires Energy.” If you look closely, there is a well-intentioned Emoto-like word of “Energy” near the cascading diamonds, which was an inspirational thought offered by one of AquaNew's customers.
“We appreciate the designers at Advanced Labels NW for their artistry and technical knowledge in capturing our crystalline moment on this new label,” said Gourley.
“Polarized Water hydrates the brain like no other water,” said CEO and inventor, Rob Gourley.
The introduction of the new energy labels happens to be timed while millions of individuals are recovering from the impacts of the 2017 landfall hurricanes. So many people experienced weeks of power outages that hampered recovery … Energized brains that are fully hydrated have a major role in recovery to get back to a more normal life.”
AquaNew is located in Sarasota, FL, an area that was recently impacted by Hurricane Irma. As soon as the freight line was restored between Sarasota, FL to Beaumont, TX (which had been severely impacted by Hurricane Harvey), AquaNew donated over 1,400 bottles of Watt-Ahh® to Basic Foods for distribution to those in need of therapeutic bottled water. For the remainder of the 2017 hurricane season, AquaNew is either providing a case of Watt-Ahh®, or a discount, to its customers on their next order when they complete a brief survey and share their hurricane recovery story.
About AquaNew
AquaNew, LLC is located in Sarasota, FL and holds the worldwide exclusive license on the WIT Technology to manufacture Polarized Water. The first bottled water product, Watt-Ahh®, was launched in the commercial market in November of 2007. Two sizes (one-liter and 16.9 oz.) are available. AquaNew's Water is also a key ingredient in a variety of consumable products manufactured by other companies.
Sioux City is the first city in the state to install a wheelchair charging station. Angela Drent of Siouxland District Health says the station to power up electric motor wheelchairs in the city's downtown, at the Martin Luther King Ground Transportation Center.
“This wheelchair charging station is equipped with a standard power outlet and a 24-volt, 5-amp charger,” she says, “that really allows people who use wheelchairs or scooters an opportunity to get a full charge at a location other than their home.”
Alex Watters, a member of the city council in Sioux City, is wheelchair bound. Watters says he's proud his city is one of the first in the country to have a public charging station.
“For me, it's really a testament to our city for the desire to be more inclusive and encourage those that use power wheelchairs or scooters to get out and about and not be afraid to lose charge,” Watter says. “I know that it's happened to me before. I've been out and about on the trail system, driving across town and worried about wheelchair dying or not being able to get home.”
Watters says it takes about 30 minutes for a motorized scooter or wheelchair to get fully-charged at the new station. The Centers for Disease Control provided a grant to Sioux City and nine other communities across the country for the project.

Khloe Kardashian will probably be ecstatic at the prospect of putting 2016 behind her. It was probably one of the worst years of her life.
Her relationship with Tristan Thompson was probably one of the only bright spots of that year.
Wait… we can probably also throw her finalizing her divorce to Lamar Odom into one of the highlights.
Ever since Khloe and Tristan have been a thing, it's been clear the pair are totally in love. They've been very vocal about it over social media.
People have even been speculating that Khloe has a little Kardashian bun in her oven, but we still have no idea whether that's a fact, or some more Kardashian family fiction.
Khloe took to Instagram to ring in the new year with a cute picture of Tristan kissing the side of her head, accompanied with a very hopeful caption.
“Happy New Year!!! May you always be surrounded by the love you are deserving of! May Gods blessings continue to rain on us all!”
There's no denying that the picture was very cute, and it solidified the fact that the pair are really in love.

ISLAMABAD - Like some other constituencies in the country, the NA-158 of Punjab is set to witness neck-and-neck contest as former prime minister Yousaf Raza Gilani after his eligibility to contest the July's polls will challenge PML-N's Javed Ali Shah and PTI's Muhammad Ibrahim Khan.
Both the rival candidates of the area - former minister Javed Ali Shah and Muhammad Ibrahim Khan - are being considered strong candidates to give tough time to PPP stalwart in this constituency (Multan-V).
The NA-158 seat in the 2013 general elections was grabbed by Syed Javed Ali Shah of PML-N with a big margin and PTI candidate Muhammad Ibrahim Khan and PPP's Asad Murtaza Gilani were runner-up respectively.
The major chunk of votes in the Shujabaad Tehsil (NA-158) is distributed in different areas of this constituency, including ‘Matotli', ‘Raja Ram', ‘Hamid Pur', ‘Makhdoom Pur' and in ‘Shujabad city', wherein the political campaign is fast getting momentum. Gilani, the former prime minister of Pakistan, in his campaign with other convincing tools is also mentioning the road project ‘Shujabad expressway' executed by him during his rule.
While Javed Ali Shah, having an edge of his native town (Shujabaad), is running his political campaign mostly on ‘Motorway road project'. Ibrahim Khan from PTI is said to be focusing on his social work for this constituency to secure maximum votes. Interestingly, PPP's Yousaf Raza Gilani and PML-N's Javed Ali from PML-N had been in the same panel to contest in general elections in 90s.
Political observers believed that the delimitation of the constituency could prove fruitful for former prime minister Gilani as many people of the area in new the distribution are supporting him. The wings (provincial candidates from PPP) of the PPP's candidate are still not being considered as much effective. Gilani had also won election from this area against former prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 1988. Sharif had contested from four seats and lost two seats including this constituency.
Whereas Ibrahim Khan from PTI is believed to be having strong wings in the shape of strong provincial candidates of his party and this can ensure his win in the election. They said that the delimitation of constituency might not prove favourable for PML-N's Javed Ali Shah but his political campaign is gaining momentum.
In this battle, they believed, the actual match could be between PTI's candidate and PPP's candidate.
On the provincial seats of the area (PP-203, PP-204), the major parties have almost confirmed their candidates.
The provincial assembly seats in this area will also witness close contests, as from PTI Mian Tariq Abdullah and Rana Sohail Noon, PML-N's Aijaz Noon and Rana Tahir Shabir (still ticket unconfirmed) and PPP's Mian Kamran Mural and khurram Fareed Khakwani are the main contestants.
LAHORE - Two words-overworked and overstretched-can describe the present state of bureaucracy struggling to cope with the ‘Punjab speed' working non-stop to achieve the set targets.
Not only this, Punjab's civil bureaucracy is also highly understaffed facing shortage of both junior and senior officers.
Since they have to work almost 12 hours at a stretch under a demanding Chief Minister, their job stretches them a lot. And still they have to work and deliver.
This is the essence of what the Punjab Chief Secretary Captain (Retd) Zahid Saeed shared with the journalists in Punjab Assembly yesterday.
He now also sits in the Assembly to be accessible to the legislators.
On Wednesday, the Chief Secretary also chaired a meeting on Health Department in his newly established camp office there.
But his team may be overworked and sick, in some cases, but they are not overwrought in any way moving ahead to meet the development goals.
A big gun in the bureaucracy, the Punjab Chief Secretary was under media spotlight on Wednesday as he stepped out of his camp office.
In his rare interaction with the media persons outside the Assembly, he gave interviews to different news channels separately answering questions on the new budget allocations and the development goals the government wanted to achieve before the elections.
Saeed admitted that civil officers in Punjab were overworked due to long working hours which stretched them a lot.
He said that a written request has been made to the Federal government seeking the services of senior officers.
“We are even facing shortage of officers in grade 18 and 19, but the situation will improve after a Promotion Board meeting this month.”, he said, adding, that Punjab had become the centre of development activity as the country was heading towards fresh elections.
Asked about the reasons behind setting up of camp offices in Punjab Assembly for the Chief Secretary, Administrative Secretaries and the IGP, he said that this arrangement has been made under instructions from the Punjab Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif especially for the budget session.
Previously, he said, the legislators would leave the Assembly to visit the Civil Secretariat to get their works done. But they would not be able to meet the officers who would be busy attending important meetings, he added.
Senior bureaucrats usually avoid the media and never give interviews until their retirement.
But Captain (Retd) Saeed has surely become the first Punjab Chief Secretary to be interviewed by many news channels in one stretch.
He faced the journalists for well over half an hour braving the scorching heat under a small tent.

NEW DELHI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious plan to provide health insurance to 100 million poor families would require a funding of 110 billion rupees ($1.71 billion) in federal and state funding each year, a government official told Reuters.
The new health scheme, dubbed “Modicare” and announced in Thursday's federal budget, would provide 100 million families, or about 500 million poor people, with a health cover of 500,000 rupees ($7,850) for free treatment of serious ailments.
The government has estimated the premium for insuring each family would be about 1,100 rupees ($17.15), said the government official with direct knowledge of the matter. ($1 = 64.1575 Indian rupees) (Reporting by Aditya Kalra; Editing by Malini Menon)

Across the pond, excitement about the forthcoming solar eclipse is reaching fever pitch.
It will be the first total solar eclipse to cross the United States from coast-to-coast in 99 years, and the first to pass through any part of the lower 48 states in 38 years.
But here in the UK, many people are wondering whether they will get to witness the rare celestial event.
The answer is that you will be able to see a partial solar eclipse from the UK on August 21, but it may be a little underwhelming.
From our perspective, only 4% of the sun will be covered by the moon - and that's when the eclipse is at its maximum.
It will also occur very close to sunset in the UK, so those in the north have the best chance of seeing it, as it will be lighter for longer.
The eclipse will start shortly after 19:30 BST, and reach its maximum at about 20:00 BST.
Solar Eclipse map
If you're lucky enough to be in the United States on August 21, you should get a great view of the solar eclipse.
The so-called "path of totality", which describes the areas where a total solar eclipse is visible, passes through 11 US states - Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.
The eclipse will begin over the Pacific Ocean at 15:46 GMT on August 21.
It will reach the coast of Oregon at Lincoln City, just west of Salem, at 16:04 GMT (09:04 local time). The eclipse will reach its maximum point here at 17:17 GMT (10:17 local time).
From here, the Moon's central shadow will move inland, reaching the town of Charleston, South Carolina at 17.16 GMT (13:16 local time).
It will reach its maximum point at 18:47 GMT (14:47 local time), before moving out into the Atlantic Ocean.
The rest of the United States will witness a partial solar eclipse. The amount that the moon covers the sun will vary depending on where the viewer is standing.
NASA has produced an interactive map to show the path of the eclipse and give information on the best times to see it.
To find out exactly when the eclipse will be visible in the location where you plan to observe it, just click on a spot on the map, and an informational box will appear with specific times.
A very small partial eclipse will take place in the UK on 11 August 2018, but it will be only be visible on the northern coast of Scotland, Orkney and Shetland, and the moon will only cover about 2% of the sun.
The next really good eclipse will be on 12 August 2026, when there will be a very large partial eclipse across Britain, ranging from around 96% in Cornwall to 91% in Aberdeen.
The next total eclipse visible in the UK is not until 23 September 2090.
TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — A Kansas official who is vice chairman of President Donald Trump's commission on election fraud drafted a proposal for Trump to change federal voter registration laws.
A federal court document unsealed Thursday shows the proposal was part of a strategic homeland security plan prepared by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach.
Kobach was photographed taking the document into a meeting with Trump in November when Trump was president-elect. The portion dealing with federal voter registration laws was not fully visible.
U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson also unsealed a second document prepared by Kobach and shared inside his office. It contained the text of the proposed changes to federal law.
Kobach was forced to turn over the documents as part of a voting-rights lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union.
Say hello to the Vancouver Airport's new assistance pups
What's better than a golden retriever puppy?
The Vancouver International Airport has three brand-new golden retriever puppies ready to be trained in partnership with Pacific Assistance Dog Society.
“We support programs and organizations that focus on advancements in inclusivity, universal access and access to opportunity,” said YVR community relations manager Kim Halowski. “That's why we are proud to support Pacific Assistance Dogs Society and the work they do to remove barriers and give persons living with disabilities independence.”
But first, the trio needs to be named. There are one female and two males, and YVR wants your help.
Tweet your best YVR-themed puppy names using #YVRPADSPUPS and the airport will put the best names to a vote next week.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States could tighten a global economic noose on North Korea by pushing for further United Nations sanctions likely targeting Pyongyang's textile exports and supplies of oil to the government, diplomats say.
The U.N. Security Council unanimously strengthened sanctions on North Korea on Aug. 5 for the eighth time since 2006. But diplomats say about $2 billion more in exports could be blacklisted to cut off funding for Pyongyang's ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs.
The latest U.N. resolution aimed to slash a third from North Korea's $3 billion annual exports by banning Pyongyang's trade in coal, iron, iron ore, lead and seafood.
As U.S. and North Korean tensions have escalated since then, some diplomats predict the 15-member Security Council could soon negotiate on a ninth resolution. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Monday vowed to leave "no North Korean source of revenue untouched."
"In particular, the U.S. will continue to request Chinese and Russian commitments not to provide the regime with economic lifelines and to persuade it to abandon its dangerous path," they wrote in the Wall Street Journal.
China and Russia typically view only a long-range missile launch or nuclear weapon test as a trigger for possible further U.N. sanctions. A resolution needs nine votes in favour and no vetoes by China, Russia, the United States, France or Britain.
"There probably will be another resolution at some point, sadly," said a senior Security Council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. "We can divide up that $2 billion into other sectors and take another third off by cutting out the textile sector or something else."
Textiles were North Korea's second-biggest export after coal and other minerals in 2016, totalling $752 million, according to data from the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA). Nearly 80 percent of the textile exports went to China, according to Chinese customs data.
AIRLINE, NORTH KOREAN WORKERS
Other measures could include a ban on North Korea's national airline, cutting off oil for the government and military, high seas interdiction of ships and adding top Pyongyang officials to a blacklist to subject them to a global asset freeze and travel ban, diplomats said.
The military-controlled airline, Air Koryo, flies to Beijing and a few other cities in China, including Dandong, the main transit point for trade between the two countries. It also flies to Vladivostok in Russia, but flights to Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Kuwait have ended.
New sanctions would build on eight previous resolutions ratcheting up action against Pyongyang in response to five nuclear tests, four long-range ballistic missile tests and dozens of medium-range rocket launches.
A second council diplomat said there are likely to be few surprises for Pyongyang ally China - and Russia - "because this has been done so often" and Washington has foreshadowed possible sanctions targets.
A November resolution aimed to cut North Korea's annual export revenue by a quarter - or $800 million - by slashing coal exports by 60 percent and banning the export of copper, nickel, silver, zinc and statues.
The Aug. 5 resolution also prohibits countries from increasing the number of North Koreans working abroad. Some diplomats suggested there could be a push for a complete ban on the use of North Korean workers abroad in a future sanctions resolution.
The United States and China typically agree on new sanctions before formally involving other council members, though Washington keeps Britain and France in the loop during the process and China talks with Russia.
Washington and Beijing agreed on the latest U.N. sanctions in a third of the time it took to negotiate the November resolution. The second council diplomat said the measures adopted this month were straightforward, which likely helped accelerate the talks.
Saskatoon police say the 41-year-old driver of a van who attempted to evade them early Tuesday morning was tracked down by the Air Support Unit (ASU).
An officer initially observed the grey van speeding at the intersection of Avenue W and 22nd Street West just after 3 a.m. CT.

When the officer activated their emergency equipment in an attempt to conduct a traffic stop, the van accelerated to a high rate of speed.
Police said due to speed and location in a residential neighbourhood, the officer did not make further attempts to stop the vehicle.
ASU members located the van a short time later and followed it until it stopped in the 800-block of Avenue R North, where the driver was arrested by officers.

SEATTLE (AP)  California coach Justin Wilcox is on his own little reunion tour through the Pac-12 Conference.
Seeing old faces is the least of Wilcox's concerns at this point, with California having lost two straight and facing another major challenge on Saturday at No. 6 Washington.
Last week, Wilcox returned to his alma mater Oregon and watched the Ducks hand the Golden Bears a 45-24 setback. Now it's a trip north to Seattle and a matchup with his former employer  in multiple ways. Wilcox served as the defensive coordinator for Washington coach Chris Petersen for four seasons at Boise State. Wilcox was also the defensive coordinator at Washington for two years when Steve Sarkisian was the head coach.
"I just think he's a good football coach," Petersen said of Wilcox. "I've known that for a long time, whether he's running the defense or a whole team. He knows how to coach the guys, get them going."

Petersen and Wilcox were brief in their comments about each other this week. They're dealing with their own team issues.
Washington (5-0, 2-0 Pac-12) would like to end a string of sluggish starts. A year ago, Washington dominated most of its opponents early and cruised to victories. This year has been more of a struggle in the first half, highlighted by holding just a 7-0 lead at halftime last week at lowly Oregon State. The Huskies erupted for 35-point second half against the Beavers, but the slow starts are a concern for Petersen.
"We're going to address it. We'll talk to our guys," Petersen said. "How do you fix the turnover situation when it's not going in your favor? It's the same thing  you practice on it, move things up in practice and get it going a little bit more. It's not because they are not trying, so you're always trying to be creative as coaches to fix every single problem that you have."
California (3-2, 0-2) opened with three straight wins, but the Bears have since lost to Southern California and Oregon.
"We've got to execute more consistently. We've played well in spurts," Wilcox said. "We just have to play better. It's a matter of doing the same thing over and over and over and executing at a high level more than sometimes."
Here's what else to watch as the Bears and Huskies meet for the 98th time:
RUNNING DOWN A DREAM: Washington discovered its run game, which lagged through the first three weeks of the season.
Myles Gaskin is coming off consecutive 100-yard games after rushing for 113 yards on 15 carries last week against the Beavers. Lavon Coleman returned after missing the win over Colorado to add 70 yards against the Beavers. The Huskies are averaging nearly 5.9 yards per carry the past two weeks. Stopping the run remains a weakness for California. The Bears are giving up nearly 175 yards per game on the ground.
HOMECOMING: It will be a major homecoming for two of Cal's most important players. Quarterback Ross Bowers is from nearby Bothell, Washington, and linebacker Devante Downs is from Mountlake Terrace, Washington. Bowers had a great start to the season but has been prone to mistakes the last couple of weeks as the competition improved. Bowers threw four interceptions against USC and was sacked against Oregon seven times.
Downs leads the Pac-12 in tackles, averaging 10.8 per game.
"It's cool to see my family and friends, but it's just another week," Downs said.
TURN IT OVER: California forced nine turnovers in the first three games and won the turnover battle in each game. Not surprisingly, the Bears started 3-0. During the two-game losing streak, the Bears have committed eight turnovers in the two losses.
FULL MOON FEVER: Washington is getting a little tired of late kickoffs, but there's not much relief soon. The Huskies will play consecutive games that kickoff at 7:45 p.m. PT. They've yet to play a game that started earlier than 5 p.m. local time. Petersen complained this week that the late starts are impacting the Huskies exposure.
Wilcox, too, wasn't a fan of the late start. The Bears already have a late kickoff scheduled for next Friday when they host Washington State.
"They tell us when the games are. If it was up to us, we wouldn't choose 7:45 p.m. But it's not up to us," he said.

As published in the Guardian in a piece by Ian Cobain on August 28, 2016, Churchill came to power on May 10 1940 and got the The Treachery Act passed from parliament on May 23 during WW2, outlawing conduct “designed or likely to give assistance to the naval, military or air operations of the enemy” had passed through parliament and received royal assent.
It carried only one sentence: death.
The initial German spies to be prosecuted were the gang of four including Carl Meier, 23, a Dutch-born Nazi party member who had spent a little time in Birmingham before the war; Charles van den Kieboom, 25, a Dutch-Japanese dual national; Sjoerd Pons, 28, a Dutchman; and a 25-year-old who described himself as German and called himself Jose Waldberg.
The trial lasted four days, the jury took less than 90 minutes to convict Meier and Kieboom, who were sentenced to death, along with Waldberg.
The gang of four was part of Operation Lena, the codename for the Abwehr's contribution to Hitler's invasion plan.
Unofficially, their spymasters considered their mission to be so hazardous that they called it the Himmelfahrt, the ascension to heaven.
Why has Kulbhushan suddenly been declared as a son of the soil by the Indian head honchos?
The heated debate on the death sentence to Commander Kulbhushan Yadav (the Butcher of Balochistan) may have surprised many in the international media; however, they are missing the forest for a tree.
Just to remind them about the Kulsbhushan enterprise and its cost extracted from Pakistan soil by Indian state sponsored terrorism would be a good start point.
The data gleaned from our research on cost of Kulbhushan Enterprise is mind boggling.
This Indian Blue Bird was a top gun of RAW, funded to a tune of 500 million USDs with a strategic mission to achieve defined RAW objectives within Pakistan.
The timing of Indira Doctrine coincided with the implosion of civil war within Sri Lanka which changed this tourist paradise into a hell-hole for next three decades.
RAW's next big game opened against arch-rival Pakistan after the fall of the Taliban regime, as Afghanistan became the centre of the power game led by the US with approximately 40 intelligence agencies actively pursuing their agenda.
RAW exploited the swathes of ungovernable areas of Afghanistan for setting the bases across the Durand Line and even within some of Indian Consulates in Iran, with objectives such as befriending anti-Pakistan terrorist organisations and support selective but ruthless terrorist organisations like BLA, BRA, MQM (militant wings), TTP, LeJ, TTP, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Daish etc; penetrate the area west of River Indus including Balochistan to support proxy war against Pakistan; support dissident leadership of BLA etc, and supply them arms and ammunitions to sabotage lifeline of Balochistan, especially the communication networks; provide diplomatic support to dissident leaders and organise seminars and conferences in major capitals of the western world to highlight the cause of liberation of Balochistan.
The extent of RAW's involvement in Karachi, Balochistan, KPK and even urban centres of Punjab and Sindh may not be fully known; however, the intelligence gathered from Commander Kulbhushan has uncovered some of the strategic directives given to him by South block and Mr Ajit Kumar Doval.
Pakistan's defensive attitude to RAW's blatant involvement within Pakistan in kinetic and non-kinetic domains is one reason this agency has operated so freely and ruthlessly on Pakistani soil.
Despite the handing over of dossiers to Indian leadership in Sharm al Sheikh, the cosying of top political leadership to Indian overtures has probably convinced the Indian establishment that Pakistan was a soft state and its leadership could be taken for a ride behind the smoke screen of Bollywood and smiling Modi.
The Indian track record of dealing with her neighbours is not very bright, Pakistan had its share of four wars right from 1948 including dismemberment in 1971, Sikkim was absorbed, China was engaged in a war across the Himalayas in 1962, Sri Lanka was invaded and subjected to RAW's proxy war for three decades, Maldives was coerced, even the Kingdom of Nepal has been isolated through trade embargos and arm-twisting.
China has also been subjected to RAW's proxy war within Chinese Tibet, so who is left? What could be Pakistan's strategy to deal with RAW's blatant involvement as this agency has been badly exposed to the entire world? This is the million-dollar question.
Pakistan has built up her case with complete preparation through the trove of intelligence gathered from Commander Kulbhushan and is presenting it bluntly to India.
Pakistan also needs to share the information with Iran and Afghanistan with a request to uncover the Indian agenda to use the soil of friendly countries against Pakistan.
For the international community and our western allies, Pakistan needs to build its case on the lines of post-Mumbai India; especially exposing the Indian state's active involvement in unleashing a reign of terror within Pakistan.
The Kulbhushan enterprise was directly responsible for 1345 killings of innocent Pakistanis and injury to 7500, the financial cost to Pakistan has been approximately 3 billion USDs mainly in lost business and bad perception affecting tourism, sports (cricket), exports and imports; indirect cost may not be ever known.
What about the kith and kin of Pakistanis, who perished due to the Kulbhushan Enterprise and the trauma suffered by loved ones? ‘Spy' is a benign name and Kulbhushan was a mass murderer with the blood of 1345 Pakistanis dripping through his fingers; the Pakistani ‘liberrati' and champions of human rights may comment on the plight of families whose bread earners perished in the heinous enterprise called Kulbhushan Yadav.
Indian frustration is also apparent as they find Indian-held Kashmir slipping away at a very fast pace, in order to hide their anxiety, the frenzied media, fed by RAW's omnipresent hand is almost ‘barking at a high pitch'.
Kashmir could also spell disaster for India as the adjoining state of Khalistan may be the next to demand autonomy and independence, Sikh diaspora is already gearing up for a global referendum called Khalistan 2020.
India has her hands full and would do better to look inwards rather than blaming Pakistan and her intelligence agencies for every pot broken in the potter's house.
Indian response by possible abduction of a retired Pak army officer from Nepal is boomeranging on India's face; the concocted story prepared by RAW's propaganda machine and being churned by Indian hostile media besides, it raises some important questions in the conduct of state craft.
Is India initiating a new game by abducting Pakistani nationals from foreign lands; especially in the Indian periphery, and, where do we go from here? India must realise that she has more assets in the neighbourhood including Afghanistan and the dangerous precedent of abducting nationals from SAARC countries could trigger a strategic response by other states, where RAW surrogates and spies will be forced to either quit their missions or hide like jackals.

BUSINESSES need a call to arms when it comes to infrastructure in the North. We can do better. We must do better. With the ink on the Brexit divorce papers set to dry in a short 10 months, the UK as a whole needs to up its game, and embrace what the North has to offer.
As my company, ArchformByte, is based in Sheffield, I have noticed a number of improvements that could be made to turn our city into the UK's hub for manufacturing, exports and business excellence.
After all, Sheffield is geographically central, and at the moment, it finds itself losing out to its close friends Leeds, Manchester and Liverpool as the place to be, and most of the North is entirely eclipsed by the South-East. This is a real shame, as where we are is ideally placed. Sheffield, you need to enhance your brand.
Improvements must be made to rail and road to make commutes and the transport of goods easier. We heard last year that the long-awaited HS2 will run through Sheffield, as well as many other cities in the North that do not have adequate transport links.
However will it be too little, too late? The earliest the route will be completed is 2026, with the Manchester and Leeds sections possibly due for completion by 2032 or 2033. By this time, we could find ourselves so far on the back foot we could struggle to catch up.
The motorways, too, should be better maintained and wider to make it a more convenient and desirable route from the South or from Scotland. No one wants to make an uncomfortable journey over potholes and being unable to overtake efficiently, they want a smooth trip with little delay.
A significant investment in the quality of our roads could ‘pave' the way for more business parks, premium offices and big corporation headquarters. If Amazon was looking to build its headquarters in the UK, would its ‘head honchos' instantly head for Sheffield, Rotherham, or Hull? I don't think so.
We also need to establish ourselves as world leaders when it comes to technology. It's 2018, so I don't think it's unreasonable to expect every town and city in the North to have access to superfast broadband.
As businesses, we need to open our virtual borders, and connect with our cousins across the globe to export our goods. It is almost impossible to do this if our connection speed is slow or, God forbid, the network goes down completely. Yet, like the dial-up days of the late 90s, there are still some firms that frequently find themselves without internet access, and it is not good enough. It is a business essential, and companies should be able to trust that it is ready and available for them, so they can focus on their product.
Similarly all areas, particularly office buildings and towns where there is a high business population, should expect a decent mobile phone reception, regardless of the network.
Many firms, particularly fledgling start-ups or one-man, or woman, bands have done away with clunky old landlines altogether, and conduct all their telephonic activity using a mobile.
Again, in this day and age, no one should find themselves renting an office space and finding that they have to balance on one leg in the westerly-most corner of the room in order to have a conversation. A clear line while sitting at your desk should be standard. You bet your iPhone X it is in London.
So I'm laying down a challenge to us all – to the businesses in the North, to the decision-makers, to Jake Berry and every single influencer in the Northern Powerhouse – let's raise our profile.
Let's show the rest of the country, and the rest of the world, our grit and our spirit. We are a region of state-of-the-art, progressive, innovative and dynamic industry. We are manufacturers, entrepreneurs, tech wizards and creatives. In Sheffield, we made and exported Sean Bean, which just goes to show what we can achieve when we put our minds to it.
The UK is a small island, but the North is a big part of it. Why don't we show what a huge impact we can have?

Civil rights groups are demanding an emergency meeting with Boston Mayor Marty Walsh to discuss safety plans for the "Boston Free Speech Rally" planned for Saturday, Aug. 19.
Following a violent clash between "Unite the Right" white nationalists and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Va. over the weekend, several federal and Massachusetts civil rights organizations are voicing concern over a free speech rally planned on Boston Common this Saturday.
Boston Free Speech rally organizers say they aren't connected to group behind Charlottesville 'pro-white' rally
In a Facebook post on Saturday, "Boston Free Speech," the group behind the upcoming rally, said they were in no way associated with organizers in Charlottesville.
A letter signed by seven civil rights organizations, including the Anti-Defamation League, the Mass. Association of Minority Law Enforcement Officers and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice, asked the Boston free speech rally not move forward "until the City has enough time to develop a comprehensive public safety and emergency response plan."
The letter, sent to Walsh as well as Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey and the Boston City Council, requests Walsh holds an emergency meeting with public safety officials and the civil rights organizations to discuss a safety plan.

In a tweet posted on Sunday, Mayor Marty Walsh said "Boston is an inclusive place for all. Hate will not be tolerated in our City."
Boston is an inclusive place for all. Hate will not be tolerated in our City. https://t.co/vSTWDDTHfZ -- Mayor Marty Walsh (@marty_walsh) August 13, 2017
In June, the Boston Free Speech group posted they had postponed the August rally because the "Unite the Right rally" would be taking place the same weekend, and they did not want to share media attention with the Virginia event.
But despite the attempt to dodge ties to the Virginia "pro-white" rally that ended with three deaths (one counter-protestor killed when a car plowed into a crowd, and two Virginia State Troopers killed in a helicopter crash), the rally has now moved into the spotlight for civil rights groups and Mayor Walsh.
ISLAMABAD, Dec 11 (APP):A five-member French Parliamentary delegation headed by Jean-Bernard Sempastous, President of France-Pakistan Friendship Group in the French parliament met the members of Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs here at the Parliament House on Monday.

LAHORE, April 17 (APP): Chief Minister Punjab, Muhammad
Shehbaz Sharif Monday ordered best arrangements to
facilitate people and stability of prices of edible items
during Ramazan-ul-Mubarak.
Provision of quality essential items on fixed price was
responsibility of the government and he would personally
supervise steps taken for relief of the people in
Ramazan, he added.
He was presiding over a high level meeting to review
arrangements regarding Ramazan Package, Ramazan Bazaars, Fair
Price Shops and Seheri and Aftar Dastarkhawans during holy month.
The Chief Minister said the government was evolving a
comprehensive programme for providing relief to the people in
Ramazan during current year under which more than 300 Ramazan
Bazaars would be set up while 27 model bazaars would also work
as Ramazan Bazaars throughout the province.
The CM said provision of edible items to the people at affordable rates
was responsibility of concerned departments and no effort should
be spared in this regard.
He said indiscriminate action would also be taken against the hoarders
and profiteers and on complaints, concerned Commissioners, RPOs, Deputy
Commissioners and DPOs would be responsible.
He said Dasterkhawans at Sehri and Aftar timings would
be set up during the holy month.
“There should be no shortage of fruits, vegetables and pulses during
Ramazan and the concerned departments should evolve a comprehensive
mechanism through early steps,” the CM asserted.
He said fair price shops would also be set up by Agriculture
Department in Ramazan bazaars and the items at these shops
would be available to the people at cheaper rates as compared
to the market.
The Chief Minister said special attention should be paid
to quality as well as prices of essential items and no
compromise would be made on standard of daily use commodities.
He directed the prices of edible items in Ramazan Bazaars
should be displayed through digital boards and their provision
should be ensured for the citizens visiting the Bazaars.
He also directed to constitute price control committees at
district level.
Lord Mayor Lahore and Commissioner Lahore Division would
jointly preside Lahore Price Control Committee while Mayor or
Chairmen District Councils would preside the meetings of price
control committees along with Deputy Commissioners in other
districts.

"We have a strong defence and they support me and we're all super close, so it's not like I'm back there and bored and stuff," she said.
"Playing out, you get to run at the ball, you get to score, you get to defend, you get to make that big slide tackle ... but it's also nice to make that big save."
If the Eagles are to beat the Renegades, they'll need to do so without the majority of their Grade 12 players. It's prom night at St. Mary's High School and most of the seniors will be taking the day off to prepare for the big event.
Not to worry, said Johnson, the younger players have them covered.
"We have a lot of good young players that have chemistry and we all love each other, so it's going to be fine," she said.
Grand River advanced to the semifinal with a 1-0 win over John F. Ross and a 10-0 win over the Owen Sound Wolves.

Canada and the U.S. share the largest and most comprehensive bilateral trade relationship on earth, according to the U.S. State Department. Both the U.S. and Canadian government claim that trade between the two countries generates over $1 trillion worth of commerce and investment annually, and is responsible for millions of jobs on both sides of the border.
But the trade relationship is far from equal. Publicly available data from the U.S. and Canadian governments, along with trade statistics from the UN, show just how critical business with the U.S. is to Canada's economy. The U.S., on the other hand, is both less reliant on international trade than Canada and far less reliant on Canada as a trade partner than we are on the U.S.
The interactive map above lets you see how your home province depends on the U.S. for trade. If you click on the province, you will see the province's exports to the U.S. represented by the blue dots, and the province's imports represented by the red dots. Each dot represents $1 billion in traded goods.
By exploring the map, you will see that every province exports proportionally more to the U.S. than it imports. What's more, each U.S. state exports less to Canada, as a proportion of total U.S. exports, than it imports from Canada.

To show you how closely Canada is intertwined with the United States, we gathered publicly available trade data from both the U.S. and Canadian government, along with the UN, and visualized this data in a series of animated maps.
Canada relies overwhelmingly on the US for trade
The map above shows the flow of exports from Canada to its 10 largest trade partners. Each circle represents one billion U.S. dollars in exported goods.
Over two-thirds of Canada's exported goods were sold to the U.S. in 2017, according to data obtained from the UN Comtrade Database. In fact, Canada sold more than five times as much merchandise to the U.S. last year than it sold to its other top nine trading partners combined.
This singular reliance on the U.S. for exports can be seen in the animation above. Each dot represents $1 billion worth of Canadian exports. You can see that while Canadian international trade spans the globe from Germany to China, European and Asian exports are merely a drop in the bucket when compared to the stream of goods flowing south of the border.
Economists refer to this as export market concentration. According to University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe, “Canada is the second least diversified country in terms of its export operations.” The least diversified export economy is Mexico.
“We stand out as being highly reliant on the United States,” he said.
The U.S. does not rely exclusively on Canada for trade
The map above shows the flow of exports from the U.S. to its 10 largest trade partners. Each circle represents one billion U.S. dollars in exported goods.
In contrast, the U.S. export market is much more diverse. Only 18 per cent of U.S. goods exported in 2017 were sold to Canada.
“The United States is not as reliant on us as we are on them,” Tombe says.
If this imbalance wasn't stark enough, the U.S. economy also relies much less on international trade in general. According to the World Bank, international trade accounted for 64 per cent of Canada's GDP in 2016 and only 27 per cent of America's.
“There are only two or three states,” adds Tombe, “that have trade volumes with Canada more than 10 per cent of their economy.”
All of this is bad news for Canada in a trade war, Tombe explains, as it means the U.S. can negatively impact our economy much more easily than we can impact its economy.
Canada can fight back, if it targets products the U.S. sells almost exclusively to Canadians
This map depicts the flow of U.S. coffee exports to America's top 10 trading partners in 2017. Each circle represents US$10 million in coffee products. Most coffee exported from the U.S. goes to Canada.
Even though the U.S. sends less than one-fifth of its exported goods to Canada, there are some specific products the U.S. sells almost exclusively to Canadians. According to Tombe, these products present Canada with an opportunity.
“The goal of retaliation is to impose costs on the United States, not Canadian consumers,” Tombe says. “Of course, Canadian consumers will bear some of the burden, but the trick is to put a tariff on something that will force a U.S. producer to lower its price. And that happens when we are an important market for that producer.”
READ MORE: Boycotting U.S. products? Here's how to buy Canadian during a trade war
For example, 66 per cent of the roasted coffee exported by the U.S. makes its way to Canada. This flow of joe from U.S. producers to Canadian cups can be seen in the animation above.
Canadians also purchase 63 per cent of U.S. ketchup exports, 86 per cent of U.S. cucumbers and gherkin exports, and 88 per cent of U.S. toilet paper exports. We even consume more than half of the maple syrup exported by the U.S., despite Canada's ample supply.
Canada's retaliatory tariffs went into effect July 1 and target all the products listed above, along with many others. The full list of affected products can be found on the Department of Finance website.
“At first glance it might look a little funny, why we're targeting certain goods,” Tombe says. “But the reasoning is, we're trying to pick goods that we could actually influence the price of through the tariff.”
But while Canada can fight back, some experts are questioning if this is really a good move. According to McGill University political scientist Krzysztof Pelc, “The risk is misperception, thinking you can get the other side to back down. But of course, it does not back down and they escalate.”
Pelc's concern is that each will continue to escalate until “both sides find themselves in a situation that no side really wanted to get into and there's no way to draw back.”
It's a concern made sharper by the tight grip the U.S. has on our export markets.
But the U.S. also has the ability to wreak havoc on Canada's economy with geographic precision
In addition to being heavily reliant on the U.S. for trade, Canadian exports are also heavily concentrated in specific industries.
“Our exports are dominated by two large categories,” Tombe says. One is energy, the other is motor vehicles and car parts. “Those two things combined are the majority of our exports.”
The vast majority of auto exports originate in Ontario, with production occurring to a much lesser extent in Quebec and Manitoba:
U.S. President Trump has recently threatened to impose a 25 per cent tariff on all final auto exports from Canada, a move which Tombe believes would significantly disrupt Ontario's economy.
READ MORE: Chances that Trump will impose auto tariffs ‘reasonably good:' U.S. trade expert
“With autos,” Tombe explains, “you have this very tightly integrated supply chain between us and the United States, where even small frictions can have dramatic effects on productions here.”
Tombe claims that “even small tariffs on autos might specifically reduce production in Canada on the order of 40 per cent or so.” And 25 per cent is no small tariff.
Of course, while these animations illustrate some of the basic economic facts underlying this trade war, predicting the outcome is a different matter. “All I'm sure of is this administration seems uniquely dismissive of careful analysis of the pros and cons of their policy decisions,” Tombe says. “And to predict the behaviour of a seemingly irrational actor is difficult.”
Political scientist Krzysztof Pelc suggests the outcome will come down to a simple test of wills. “Which side will be most patient?” Pelc asks. “The side that can put up with the most pain is likely to win.”
Note on the data: Trade statistics were drawn from the UN Comtrade Database, the U.S. Census Bureau, and the Government of Canada website. Value amounts are represented in U.S. dollars unless otherwise specified. All animations depict trade statistics from 2017. We attempt to limit our analysis to domestic exports, excluding re-exports where possible.

PanARMENIAN.Net - Luxury automaker Jaguar Land Rover has partnered with Shell to make fueling up a touch more convenient. That's because everyone who owns a vehicle equipped with the company's InControl Apps will be able to pay for gas without ever leaving the driver's seat. All you need is the Shell mobile app, either a PayPal or Apple Pay account and at least $40,000 for one of the supported cars and you too can take advantage of the new feature, Engadget said.
All you need to do is connect your iPhone (Android support arrives sometimes later this year) to your Jag's infotainment system via USB. From there, everything is handled via the car's touchscreen. How this differs from other mobile payment tech, Jaguar says, is that this one uses geolocation in concert with PayPal or Apple Pay for transactions.
The functionality launches Wednesday, February 15 in the UK and additional availability will roll out over the course of this year. Jaguar says that additional applications of the tech could include drive-through restaurants and parking services.
* FTSE 100 down 0.6 pct
* BT results weigh
* Capita rebounds slightly on upgrade
* Vodafone jumps on Liberty Global talks
* The Worst week for FTSE in more than 9 months (Updates prices)
By Kit Rees
LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Britain's top share index sealed its worst week in nine months on Friday after results from BT were met with disappointment and commodities stocks tumbled amid a global equity market sell-off.
The blue-chip FTSE 100 index closed down 0.6 percent at 7,443.43 points, its fourth day of straight losses, and suffered its worst weekly decline since late April last year. It mirrored a downturn across equities as investors grew doubtful the year-to-date rally could keep up its recent pace.
“There's a global flight to safety out of risk assets, so it's not just a UK phenomenon,” Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said.
“We have had some soft earnings with some quite dramatic falls for individual shares (which) have dented a bit of appetite for UK stocks, then we have had the pound which has been generally pretty resilient, pretty strong,” Lawler added.
Disappointing earnings updates were to blame for the bulk of declines on the day.
BT Group shares hit a five-year low before paring losses slightly to close down 2.2 percent, after the telecoms firm reported third quarter earnings.
While BT broadly met expectations, analysts flagged a lack of growth and concerns around its pension scheme.
“The performance in the Wholesale and Global Services divisions remains stagnant, whilst the pension situation is a concern. Key metrics such as revenues and earnings per share remain patchy and slightly light of expectations,” Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said.
AstraZeneca shares bounced back from an initial slide to lead the FTSE, up 3.1 percent at the close, as analysts focused on stronger earnings despite 2018 guidance that came in below estimates.
Vodafone was a late gainer, ending the session up 2.4 percent after it confirmed talks with Liberty Global about potential asset swaps in Europe.
Commodities stocks, which had supported the index early in the session, were the biggest weight by the close, sent down by falling metals prices after strong jobs data boosted the U.S. dollar.
Shares in miners Glencore, Evraz, Antofagasta and Anglo American fell 2.3 to 4.3 percent, taking 15 points off the index.
Oil majors were also a drag.
BP shares fell 2.4 percent after Norway's Aker BP , in which BP holds a 30 percent stake, reported fourth-quarter earnings missed forecasts.
BP will report results next week.
Among mid-cap stocks, Provident Financial gained 7 percent after the sub-prime lender appointed its acting chairman as CEO.
Aerospace and defence electronics group Cobham sank 6.4 percent to the bottom of the FTSE 250, having started the day with a 3 percent gain after it sold its communications unit to Viavi Solutions for $455 million.
Analysts said the sale could hurt Cobham's margins.
Troubled outsourcer Capita gained 3.6 percent after Morgan Stanley upgraded it to “equal-weight” from “underweight”.
Capita's shares have tumbled this week following a big profit warning and dividend suspension.
“We continue to view Capita as a traditional BPO provider that is competitively challenged, which justifies a discount to its wider peers,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note, referring to business process outsourcing.
“But with the shares now up with events, we move to Equal-weight.”
Radiohead's Thom Yorke recently responded to the protests from fellow artists over Radiohead's upcoming performance in Tel Aviv, calling the controversy “extremely upsetting” and saying, “The kind of dialogue that they want to engage in is one that's black or white. I have a problem with that.” Yorke also asserted, “All of this creates divisive energy. You're not bringing people together. You're not encouraging dialogue or a sense of understanding.” Now, as Pitchfork reports, several pro-Palestine groups have condemned Yorke for his comments.
Filmmaker Ken Loach, who signed the original open letter urging Radiohead to cancel the performance, has issued this statement through Artists For Palestine UK: “Thom's is a simple choice: will he stand with the oppressor or the oppressed?” Meanwhile, just as Roger Waters countered Yorke's claim that he never tried to reach out privately to dialogue about the issue, in an open letter from Radiohead Fans For Palestine, Seamus O'Brolchain says the band has avoided the organization's attempts to engage them on the subject:
Let's get one thing clear. You say you're not happy that people “throw shit” at you in public rather than trying to engage. Well, we tried to engage. We sent you letters in the post, we politely tried to hand them to a band member at a public event, we called your agents and your publicists, and you ignored us. Not even an acknowledgement, nothing at all. We tried to open a dialogue and it was you who refused. It was you.
Radiohead Fans For Palestine also took issue with Yorke's quote, “It's deeply disrespectful to assume that we're either being misinformed or that we're so retarded we can't make these decisions ourselves.” O'Brolchain writes:
You say it's “mind-boggling” that people don't trust you to make decisions yourselves, yet you apparently think it's fine to use an ableist slur. You're clearly not as politically mature as you think. Maybe you should listen to others a bit more.
Ben Jamal, director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, also issued a statement:
It is saddening that Thom Yorke feels patronised by the union of the union of fellow musicians and Palestinian civil society respectfully asking the band not to cross the picket line. He makes no mention of the reason why – an entrenched apartheid system and an illegal occupation of East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza that entered its 51st year today. He accuses South African veterans of the anti-apartheid struggle like Archbishop Desmond Tutu of throwing the word apartheid around. If Radiohead genuinely believes that the Palestinian people misunderstand the nature of their oppression and the response required, then they should meet with representatives face to explain how they have come to this judgment as was in fact offered many times previously.
The Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement against Israel also relayed this statement from the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel:
Thom Yorke got one thing right: boycotts called for by oppressed communities struggling for their rights are indeed ‘divisive.' In the Montgomery Bus boycott, the Delano Grape Farmers boycott, the South African anti-apartheid boycott, among others, those who continued business-as-usual with the oppressors were set apart from those who chose to stand on the right side of history, with the rights of the oppressed. Where does Radiohead see itself?
The concert is scheduled for 7/19, and it will be very interesting to see whether Radiohead move ahead with it after all this public outcry.
ISLAMABAD, July 4 (APP):Pakistan has so far invested $4.2 million in the Azerbaijani economy, said Azerbaijan's Deputy Economy Minister Rufat Mammadov during Azerbaijani-Pakistani business conference in Baku on Wednesday.
He said that both sides pay great attention to bilateral investments.
“I would like to note that a special working group was established between the Ministry of Economy of Azerbaijan and the Ministry of Commerce of Pakistan on the development of bilateral investment cooperation,” Mammadov said.
“It is gratifying to note that in Azerbaijan, there are 267 companies with Pakistani capital that operate in such areas as trade, communications, logistics and so on,” Trend News Agency reported.
Mammadov noted that the trade turnover between the two countries is also growing.
“There are all opportunities for further increasing the bilateral trade between our countries and both countries are very interested in this,” Mammadov said.
Azerbaijan's trade turnover with Pakistan amounted to $5.82 million in January-May 2018, which is 38.6 percent more than in the same period last year, according to Azerbaijan's State Customs Committee.

Coventry – the city that was flattened by the Luftwaffe and later inspired The Specials' urban decay anthem "Ghost Town" – has been named the UK City of Culture 2021.
The West Midlands metropolis beat Paisley, Stoke-on-Trent, Swansea and Sunderland to gain the four-year title, currently held by Hull and before that by Londonderry.
Snobs who turn their noses up at anywhere outside the M25 might be surprised to learn the the city has an illustrious history - beyond Lady Godiva's naked protest.
According to The Coventry Telegraph, Monty Python's first ever live performance was at the Belgrade Theatre in 1971, Paul McCartney was stopped for speeding on Fletchamstead Highway in 1968, and up until the 1860s, it was a hub for the ribbon-weaving industry.
Coventry also has a number of tech and engineering alumni. The inventor of the turbojet engine, Frank Whittle, hailed from the area, as does cyborg scientist Kevin Warwick. John Kemp Starley, father of the modern bicycle, founded the Rover Company in Coventry in 1883.
The city's name entered the German language when Joseph Goebbels used the term "coventriert", meaning razed to the ground.
Coventry and Stalingrad, now Volgograd, were the world's first "twin" cities when they established a twinning relationship during the Second World War. It was subsequently twinned with Dresden, another famously bombed city.
It comes after the EU cancelled the UK's previously agreed turn to have a European City of Culture in 2023, writing off bids from Belfast/Derry, Dundee, Leeds, Milton Keynes and Nottingham. ®

Peterborough firefighters swapped their hoses for shopping bags in support of the annual Salvation Army Toy drive on Saturday.
Two trucks were overflowing with toys after a little Christmas shopping spree by firefighters at The Toy Shop on Hunter Street in the city's downtown. It has become a Christmas tradition for firefighters and their way of giving back to the community.
Christmas toy drive is underway today @PtboFireRescue & @ToyShopPtbo have teamed up again to donate $8k worth of toys to the cause. Story tonight on @CHEXNewswatch pic.twitter.com/9dfpV9wlX3 — Jesse Thomas (@jessethomas21) December 9, 2017
“There is a great need here in the City of Peterborough,” said firefighter Ed Venuk.
“We have needs through the hamper fund with the Salvation Army; we have a need with the toy fund. As well as this year we are focusing on other less fortunate by donating to the Warming Room and One Roof Community shelter.”
The Toy Shop owner Jean Grant takes the $2,000 the fire department raises and combines that with proceeds of her summer sidewalk sale — the result sees her purchase a bundle of toys worth nearly $8,000.
“Out there is a child that really needs one of the toys that we have collected,” said Grant.
“It's going to make a difference in a child's life and hopefully many children's lives. It will help with the stress parents and families feel during this holiday season.”
Firefighters then deliver the toys to Lansdowne Place mall to add them to the mountain of toys collected for the Salvation Army's toy drive.
“We work really hard trying to get the best toys and the best value for the money,” said Grant. “We try to cover all the bases to make sure there is something out there for everyone that will make a difference.
The effort not only helps families but also the business community.
“We love to keep it local and we love to keep that money right here in Peterborough,” said Venuk. “The more that stays here, the better.”
Firefigthers also donated $1,500 to the Salvation Army's hamper fund.
Perhaps it is the baseball fan in me, but I am a traditionalist in many ways.
I believe in taking it one game at a time, never messing with a hot streak and playing your hardest until the final out. I don't walk on the white lines aand I don't talk about a no-hitter until it is done. I love the feel of an old ballpark with the game on the line and I detest the very thought of the designated hitter, artificial turf and the day piped-in music replaced the ballpark organ.
Most local newspapers no longer print box scores for last night's games. I guess they figure there is just an app for that somewhere. It may be a symbolic example of the fact that a growing number of local newspapers are quite frankly not that local anymore, considering the rise of multi-region media companies that have acquired much of the market share over the years. True locally owned, staffed and produced newspapers that are focused on catering to local expectations are harder and harder to find these days.
I am sure there are countless theories or justifications for those trends, and a healthy debate on the myriad of factors is worth considering. A free press is a critical thread of the fabric of our society, and the daily newspaper is an important tradition to support. To do so requires the media industry start soul searching to find the many causes for this trend and develop reasonable solutions to them, just as any other business would do in the face of similar declines.
One data point that would be interesting to examine is the subscription trends amongst conservative readers. It is no great secret that the perception amongst most Americans has long been that the media has a liberal slant to it. These accusations predate Gov. Edwards and President Trump, with even media icons like Cronkite and Murrow hearing similar complaints. If the social media and water-cooler conversations of today are to be believed, a growing number of conservatives feel that there is a deepening philosophical tint to the news.
Last fall, the New York TLast week, one of Louisiana's local papers called for the resignation of the Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives, Taylor Barras. This came as a particular surprise to many as the editorial board calling for his resignation was his hometown paper, The Daily Advertiser. Rep. Barras has only been the House Speaker for 16 months and has led his colleagues as a fair, civil and steadfast gentleman, free of any allegations of impropriety or harm. The editorial cited his inability to force the House of Representatives to raise new taxes and secure stability for the popular TOPS program as the reason he should resign his post, even though the Legislature appears hours away from adopting a balanced budget without raising taxes that also fully funds TOPS.
Pushback to the Advertiser's editorial came quickly from many parts of the state, and the piece was quickly pulled down from the newspaper's website (though it has since returned).
Taylor Barras is the first independently elected Louisiana speaker of the House whom anyone can remember. Sure, the House is chaotic, unpredictable and prone to extensive debates filled with divergent opinions. But Speaker Barras runs the House in a manner that allows each member to vote their conscience, speak their mind and represent their constituents. The 2017 House of Representatives is the truest form of democracy Louisiana has to offer these days, a goal that was once long sought by many newspaper editorial boards up until the moment it came to pass.
Look, I am definitely a traditionalist, but not all traditions are meant to continue forever. For decades in Louisiana, the governor and his hand-picked speaker of the House and the president of the Senate would usually force the rest of the Legislature to do what they wanted. This tradition has at least partially contributed to decades of low achievement, untrustworthy budgets and parochial interests that won the day. The future in the Capitol is a more independent and taxpayer-focused legislative process. Glimpses of that future have been seen this session. The next election cycle will likely put it on steroids.
Some traditions are meant to last forever, but this break from tradition is a good one. The media was right to call for it for years, and now it is here. The new normal in Baton Rouge is a state government where every elected official has a voice. Speaker Barras was the first to instill this new mentality, and for that, he should be thanked.

TOKYO-Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government came under fire Tuesday after a senior MP suggested only women should raise children under three and another urged newly-weds to have at least three kids.
Abe's government has made “womenomics” - or boosting women's participation in the workplace - a priority, as the country's workforce drops amid a rapidly ageing population.
But Koichi Hagiuda, a senior member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), touched off a firestorm on Sunday when he said men rearing children might be “unwelcome” for them.
“Children need an environment where they can stay with their mothers ... if you ask infants under three which parent they like more, the answer should be mama, even though there are no firm statistics to support it,” said Hagiuda, 54, the LDP's executive acting secretary-general.
Those remarks came after another MP, Kanji Kato, doubled down on comments suggesting young couples should produce at least three children, saying he had received popular backing.
But the leader of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party lashed out on Tuesday, saying the comments were “intolerable.”
“There are many people who cannot give birth to children despite wanting to and there are many single-father families,” Yukio Edano said. “Don't they notice these facts?”
Sumire Hamada, from rights group Asia-Japan Women's Resource Center, told AFP that Hagiuda's comments were “out of the question.”
“What happened to the government's pledge to build a society where men can participate in child-rearing?
“These comments overturn what the government has said, and I'm sure many fathers have been angered” by Hagiuda's “rude remarks,” she said.
Another campaigner said the remarks could encourage men to persist in the long working-hours culture endemic in Japan. Tetsuya Ando, founder of the organisation Fathering Japan, told AFP: “When he said children under three like mothers more than fathers, that's unacceptable.”
“That kind of remark puts pressure on working mothers to stay at home while removing fathers' rights to rear children,” said Ando, 55, himself a dad-of-three.

KARACHI - The Karachi University (KU) administration in a surprising security move has banned motorcyclists to wear helmet within the university premises.
Nearly 15 more suspects were taken into custody as what the District East police sped up their actions in a bid to arrest a ‘serial attacker' engaged in attacking women in parts of Gulshan-e-Iqbal and its surrounding areas from the last ten days.
The act has come following the events of knife-wielding motorcyclist attacking women on the streets of Karachi. The step is taken as a ‘precautionary move' to protect the students inside the university. Security advisor KU Dr Muhammad Zubair told media that until the arrest of serial attacker, we won't allow anyone to wear helmet within the university. He said that all those students and staff wearing helmets following today will be asked by security guards present at the gates to deposit them at the entry points before entering the university or to take off their helmets and will be checked in order not to have any knife with them.
On the other hand, Nearly 15 more suspects were taken into custody as what the District East police have sped up their actions in a bid to arrest a ‘serial attacker' engaged in attacking women in parts of Gulshan-e-Iqbal and its surrounding areas from the last ten days.
The suspects were detained during snap checking, patrolling and search operations in parts of Gulistan-e-Jauhar and its surrounding areas since early hours of Friday, however, the police remained fail to arrest a serial attacker.
Law enforcement agencies, particularly District East police have so far been detained over two dozen suspects since they have enhanced snap checking and raids in Gulistan-e-Jauhar and its surrounding areas.
On the other hand, IGP Sindh Allah Dino Khowaja held a meeting at Central Police Office on Friday about to review the law and order situation, particularly the knife attacks in a city.
IGP Sindh appointed Zone East DIG Sultan Khowaja as a focal person about to share the details or police progress ahead of the knife attacks with the media. He also directed the police officials concerned to arrest the serial attacker while adopting the latest and modern strategy. He also directed to strengthen the coordination with the Rangers and other law enforcement agencies.
J. Cole's "Kevin's Heart" video
It's been just a little more than a week since J. Cole announced his latest record, KOD, but since then he's already dropped it and released two videos. The first, the wild, cash-crazy “ATM”, arrived last Friday, and today he's shared a clip for KOD's “Kevin's Heart”.
Directed by regular collaborator Scott Lazer, the video stars Kevin Hart himself as the comedian and actor is alternately judged and beckoned by a variety of women. It's a clear reference to Hart's own infidelity, which made headlines late last year, and a situation that dovetails with the song's themes. It's a bold move on Hart's part, for sure. Cole cameos roughly halfway through the song, mirroring Hart's struggles with a stroller in a way that suggests he's all too familiar with Hart's other, more personal struggles.
Watch it below.
KOD serves as the follow-up to J. Cole's 2016 album 4 Your Eyez Only. You can stream it here.
Oxford researchers reckon they've spotted the next emerging trend in Android advertising (and possibly malware): using common libraries to “collude” between apps with different privilege levels.
Libraries are a common enough vector for attackers to target, but the trio of boffins (Vincent Taylor, Alastair Beresford and Ivan Martinovic) point out most research looks at apps in isolation.
So they took a different approach, looking at how the same library in two different apps could expose information from a higher-privilege app to one with lower privilege.
They write that this “intra-library collusion” (ILC) happens “when individual libraries obtain greater combined privileges on a device by virtue of being embedded within multiple apps, with each app having a distinct set of permissions granted”.
As the paper explains, shared libraries can borrow permissions an app doesn't have Click to embiggen
That's a threat, because library re-use across different apps isn't a bug, it's a feature: it makes app development more efficient and keeps apps small by letting them use code pre-loaded to a device.
While noting that attackers are standardising their own libraries, the researchers focussed their effort on advertising libraries, since these are almost ubiquitous in the world of smartphone apps, and are already collecting and aggregating sensitive personal data.
Their research focussed on libraries handling location, app usage, device information, communication data like call logs and messages, access to storage (including, for example, a user's files which can indicate their interests), and the microphone.
Of more than 15,000 apps with more than a million downloads, the researchers went to work decompiling apps to identify the libraries they linked to. Those they successfully decompiled, they analysed for their intra-library collusion potential.
The 18 most popular libraries include familiar names:
Library % of apps com/facebook 11.9 com/google/android/gms/analytics 9.8 com/flurry 6.3 com/chartboost/sdk 5.9 com/unity3d 5.2 com/applovin 3.5 com/mopub 3.1 com/inmobi 3.0 com/google/ads 3.0 com/google/android/gcm 2.7 com/tapjoy 2.4 org/cocos2d 2.4 com/amazon 2.0 com/millennialmedia 1.6 org/apache/commons 1.4 com/heyzap 1.4 com/nostra13/universalimageloader 1.3 com/adobe/air 1.0
“The main catalyst that allows ILC to happen is the failure of the Android permission system to separate the privileges of libraries and their host apps”, they write, and this at least offers opportunities for an underhanded ad network to improve their data collection without seeking extra permissions from users.
They note that in such scenarios, app developers have a strong incentive to not support library privilege separation, since “it may impact their profits negatively”.
Digging deeper into how advertiser libraries behaved, they found on average those libraries “leak sensitive data from a device up to 2.4 times a day and that the average user has their personal data sent to 1.7 different ad servers per day”.
While the focus of the paper is on how advertisers might exploit ILC, it clearly offers an attack vector, especially on jailbroken or rooted phones. There's already evidence in previous studies that as many as 7 percent of apps from the Play Store contain potentially malicious libraries, suggesting that “attackers have turned their attention to libraries as a means of malware propagation”. ®

Rafael Nadal is soon to be back on top of the men's tennis world. (AAP)
Rafael Nadal will be world No.1 again on Monday and it will be for the first time since July 2014, capping a remarkable tennis renaissance for the Spaniard.
Roger Federer has pulled out of the Cincinnati Open with a back injury, meaning Rafael Nadal will be the new world No.1 in next week's rankings.
Federer, who has participated in the Ohio warm-up tournament for the US Open on seven occasions, said he had picked up the injury in Montreal, where he lost to Germany's Alexander Zverev in the final.
"I am very sorry to pull out of the Western and Southern Open as I always enjoy playing here," Federer said in a statement issued by the tournament.
"Cincinnati has some of the best fans in the world and I am sorry I will miss them. Unfortunately, I tweaked my back in Montreal and I need to rest this week."
Federer's withdrawal assures that Nadal will be top of the rankings when they are issued on August 21. The Spaniard will return to the top spot for the first time since July 6, 2014.
Nadal will be buoyed by that news when he gets his Cincinnati campaign underway against veteran Frenchman Richard Gasquet in the second round.
Gasquet accounted for Australia's John-Patrick Smith 6-4 6-4 in his tournament opener on Monday but the win was far from what the regulation scoreline suggested.
Smith, who qualified for the tournament, roared to an early lead in the second set as he evoked memories of Pat Rafter, chipping and charging at will to break Gasquet and take a 4-2 lead in the second.
It wasn't to last though. Gasquet broke back immediately but needed five chances to do so before breaking again and then serving out the match.
Croatia's Ivo Karlovic took a bit longer to get through his first round match.
He took down fellow big man Jiri Vesely 6-3 3-6 7-5 and served 29 aces on his way to a second round clash with Frenchman Jo-Wilfired Tsonga.
CHICAGO): US police on Monday widened a manhunt for a gunman who shot and killed an elderly man, and then posted a video of the seemingly random Easter Sunday attack on Facebook.
Police in Cleveland, Ohio said they believe the suspect, 37-year-old Steve Stephens, is armed and dangerous, and have alerted authorities in four neighboring states to be on the lookout for him.
Robert Godwin Sr, 74, was shot and killed on Sunday, apparently at random as he walked home after an Easter dinner, police and local media reported.
“We know that Steve is still out there someplace,” said Cleveland police chief Calvin Williams. “We don't know his condition and, of course, right now we don't know his location. We're asking the public to remain vigilant.”
Police issued an arrest warrant for aggravated homicide against Stephens, described as a six-foot one-inch, 244-pound (110-kilo) black man with a full beard who was last seen in a white Ford Fusion with temporary license plates.
In a video uploaded to Stephens's Facebook page, a man resembling him is seen exiting a vehicle and approaching his victim, who is shown with a gun to his head and then falling to the ground after a shot is fired. “I killed 13, so I'm working on 14 as we speak,” the suspect says in a second video clip. “I'm just driving around hitting motherfuckers, man. I just snapped man, fuck.”
Police said they have not verified his claim to have committed other murders.
Facebook subsequently took down the videos. “This is a horrific crime and we do not allow this kind of content on Facebook,” the company said in a statement.
“We work hard to keep a safe environment on Facebook, and are in touch with law enforcement in emergencies when there are direct threats to physical safety.”
Stephens's mother told CNN she called him on Sunday after learning about the video and he told her he was shooting people because he was “mad with his girlfriend.”
Police said the woman he referred to was in a safe place.
Cleveland detectives also made contact with Stephens by phone early in the investigation, Williams said.
“They tried to, of course, convince him to turn himself in and, of course, that hasn't happened to date so again, we're asking the public's help in finding this guy. We know he's out there someplace,” he said.
The last “ping” from Stephens's cellphone was from Erie, Pennsylvania, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of Cleveland.
Cleveland police have asked the states of Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana and Michigan to be on alert.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the US Marshals Service have joined the hunt.
“This man is dangerous and he could be nearby, he could be far away, anywhere in between,” said Stephen Anthony, the FBI special agent in charge.
“We're going to make this individual's world very, very, very small, so I'm very optimistic,” said Peter Elliot, the marshal on the case. “I think things are going to happen, and I believe things are going to happen pretty quickly.”
But Williams said police had searched dozens of locations overnight “to no avail.”
“If there's somebody who is helping Steve or think you're helping Steve, you're really not. You're going to get yourself in trouble, along with him,” he warned.
Stephens worked for Beech Brook, a behavioral health agency serving children through mental health services, foster care and adoption, at-risk youth and other programs.
In his video, Stephens displayed his Beech Brook badge.
“We are shocked and horrified like everyone else,” Nancy Kortemeyer, a spokeswoman for the facility told CNN. “To think that one of our employees could do this is awful.”

In "Scandal" Season 6 Episode 4, Olivia will come to realize her mistake for incriminating Cyrus Beene (Kerry Washington) in the murder of Frankie Vargas (Ricardo Chavira).
Titled as 'The Belt', the released promo by ABC unveils how Olivia tells Huck (Guillermo Diaz) and Quinn (Katie Lowes) that Cyrus is the ultimate conspirator of Frankie's death. The plot twisted when Tom (Brian Letscher) highlights Cyrus as the man behind setting up the murder.
A known murderer may have confessed to the heinous crime, but it doesn't wrap up the investigation process. While celebrations are in order for the new president of the United States Mellie Grant (Bellamy Young) and Olivia too, the latter soon understands Cyrus isn't the man of interest, reports TV Line.

President Fitzgerald Grant's conversation with Olivia unfolds a hidden truth as in a surprising turn of events, Cyrus isn't the man. Olivia along with the Gladiators unwraps facts and information of the day Frankie was killed, which will be further revealed in the approaching episode.
The next chapter will focus on Cyrus as he is determined to prove himself innocent. Cyrus's resilient efforts to let go of the murder stain off him is predicted to be a challenge as he is still in confinement. Frankie' former running mate will try his best to get linked with his political connections so that Cyrus is free from the murder charge. He also agreed to take assistance from Elizabeth as his chief of staff in order to take political help to keep Cyrus out of jail.
Episode 4 will also allow Olivia to be acquainted with information regarding the murder. It is expected to change the course of the track as Olivia and the Gladiators will be the first one to know more about Frankie' death and they will have to decide whether to expose the information or keep it under the wraps.
In an interview with TV Line, Goldwyn maintained that there's plenty more for the viewers to see in the season. "We'll find out in episodes to come what's actually going down," the actor teased.
Mini flashbacks from the previous episode shows how loyal Cyrus was with the late governor. Cyrus had made clear that Frankie is the only one with his ultimate trust and support. Frankie, in return was also fond of Cyrus and was determined to support him, which is why he asked Cyrus to be his Vice President.
However, the mystery still entangles Olivia and the Gladiators as they set off to search for the real killer. "Scandal" Season 6 Episode 4 is slated to air on February 16 at 9 p.m. EST on ABC.
Serverless applications are all the rage right now — and some companies are even leapfrogging containers to go all-in on services like AWS Lambda and Azure Functions. Unsurprisingly, these services are now spawning their own startup ecosystems. IOpipe, which is coming out of beta today, is an application operations platform (with a current focus on monitoring) for AWS's Lambda service.
The Seattle-based company also today announced that it has raised a $2.5 million seed round from Madrona Venture Group, NEA and Underscore VC, all of which have plenty of experience in the infrastructure space.
IOpipe co-founders Adam Johnson (CEO) and Erica Windisch (CTO), too, are highly experienced in this space, having previously worked at companies like Docker and Midokura (Adam was the first hire at Midokura and Erica founded Docker's security team). They recently graduated from the Techstars NY program.
The idea behind IOpipe is pretty straightforward: provide developers and ops teams better insights into how their applications run on Lambda (with support for other platforms potentially coming in the future) to help them troubleshoot bugs, memory leaks and other issues. All developers have to do to enable the service, which provides them with all the usual performance metrics for their functions in a real-time dashboard, is to wrap their functions into IOpipe's code. The service also measures calls to third-party services, including all the standard AWS services like S3 or DynamoDB.
Johnson tells me that the company's customers span a wide gamut and include startups and enterprises. This is, of course, a function of Lambda's customers, too. “Every week I'm surprised about the companies I run into that are running Lambda,” Johnson said. A year ago, these users were still mostly early adopters, but since then, quite a few enterprises are starting to experiment with Lambda or even running production workloads on the platform.
The company currently has eight employees, though with this new funding round, it'll probably expand quickly. Looking ahead, the team plans to build more features on top of its current solution (which now features a plug-in architecture) to branch out from its current operations focus to better serve developers directly, too. “We spent a lot of time up until now building out the table stakes features for monitoring and making sure they are scalable and stable,” Johnson noted, adding that the service's plug-in architecture now allows the team to provide its users with more functionality.

United Nations
The UN Security Council on Saturday unanimously adopted a resolution supporting efforts by Russia and Turkey to end the nearly six-year conflict in Syria and jumpstart peace negotiations.
The resolution approved Saturday afternoon also calls for the “rapid, safe and unhindered” delivery of humanitarian aid throughout Syria. And it looks forward to a meeting of the Syrian government and opposition representative in Kazakhstan's capital Astana in late January.
Western members of the council had sought changes to the draft resolution circulated by Russia and Turkey during consultations Saturday morning to clarify the role of the UN and the meaning of the agreement brokered by Moscow and Ankara.
The final text dropped an endorsement of the Syria cease-fire agreement brokered by Moscow and Ankara. And it changed the draft to call the Astana meeting “an important step ahead of the resumption of negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations in Geneva on Feb. 8, 2017.”
The resolution aims to pave the way for the new talks under the aegis of key Syria government backers Russia and Iran, and of Turkey, which backs rebel groups.
The text of the measure “welcomes and supports the efforts by Russia and Turkey to end violence in Syria and jumpstart a political process.”
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on the phone Saturday with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the conflict in Syria and “continued security cooperation”, his office said.
The talks came as the 15-member UN Security Council unanimously voted to back a Russian-Turkish peace plan for a ceasefire in Syria and the launch of new peace talks for the war-wracked country.
“Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening… spoke by telephone with Russian President Vladimir Putin,” the premier's office said in a statement.
“The two leaders discussed developments in the region, with emphasis on Syria and continued security coordination in this sphere, which has already proven itself in preventing misunderstandings,” it added.—Agencies

“Saskatchewan has one of the highest rates of domestic violence. That's something as a province, we really need to work hard on improving and changing. That's not a statistic we want to be known for,” said Janine Baumann, the executive director of Family Service Saskatoon.
“The more supports you can provide, hopefully, you can prevent that cycle of violence, which is what we're really trying to do.”
The week is also about acknowledging victim services staff and volunteer victim support workers who assist those impacted by crime.
Milwaukee Urban Water Trail
Voyageurs once plumbed Wisconsin by rivers. Today, folks rediscover Wisconsin by paddle and portage. But that rediscovery isn't constrained to tannin-stained rivers up north. One can see Wisconsin's largest city on the Milwaukee Urban Water Trail.
“It's a safe way to explore an urban environment,” says Angie Tornes, Wisconsin Field Office Manager of the Rivers, Trails, and Conservation Assistance Program, National Park Service.
You can paddle past Milwaukee's industrial past and present beside coal barges and beneath freight trains. But there's more to see than steel.
“Green and great blue herons abound,” said Tornes.
Thirty-five miles in length, the trail is comprised of the Milwaukee, Menomonee, and Kinnickinnic Rivers. View a map here. Rent kayaks, canoes, and stand-up-paddleboards at Milwaukee Kayak Company.
Beth Handle of the Milwaukee Kayak Company, said, “We are located on the Milwaukee River in downtown Milwaukee with easy access to the Kinnickinnic River, Menomonee River and Milwaukee Harbor. Paddling through our Urban Water Trail provides a great opportunity to experience our city by water where you can take in the sights and sounds of our RiverWalk, local establishments, and nature throughout.”
Stop off at the RiverWalk for that quintessential Milwaukee quencher: beer.
Tornes said, “It's an eye opener for people who didn't know these rivers are there. It's a great way to discover downtown and there are hundreds more people using the rivers each year.”

A Pakistan Cricket Board official has confirmed that former international batsman Nasir Jamshed and another man were arrested and then released on bail in Britain amid an investigation into alleged spot-fixing in the Pakistan Super League.
“Jamshed and another man, Yusuf, were arrested by the National Crime Agency,” a PCB official told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
The PCB official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to comment on the issue.
Britain's National Crime Authority released an earlier statement saying two men in their 30s had been arrested on Feb 13 and released on bail until April in connection with bribery offences as part of an ongoing investigation into international cricket match spot-fixing.
The PCB has already provisionally suspended Islamabad United's Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif from the domestic Twenty20 tournament because of their alleged involvement in the corruption. Sharjeel and Latif returned to Lahore on Wednesday and faced more interviews with the cricket board's anti-corruption unit.
Jamshed was suspended Monday from competing in any form of cricket.
A third Islamabad United player is also under investigation and a player from each of the Karachi Kings and Quetta Gladiators franchises were questioned by the PCB's anti-corruption unit in the United Arab Emirates, where the Super League is being staged.
All three players were allowed to continue playing in the tournament.
“We know what we are doing,” PSL chairman Najam Sethi said in an interview on a private television channel late Tuesday.
“We have all the evidence and we knew this for a while. We had information, but we cannot talk about stuff right now, a charge sheet will be given to players soon.”
Sethi said PCB's Anti-Corruption Unit had information about spot-fixing before the PSL began on Feb 9.
“We had identified a few players and then at final stages we knew the ICC had some information as well,” he said.
“When we compared it, the information was the same and then we decided to act on this.”
“We have these players' phones in which there is more information who they were in touch with, what they talked about," Sethi added.
He said the cricket board's anti-corruption unit had infiltrated gambling operations in Pakistan ahead of the tournament.
It's not the first time Pakistan cricketers have been embroiled in corruption controversies. In 1999 Salim Malik and Ataur Rehman were banned for life following a match-fixing investigation.
In 2010 three players Mohammad Amir, Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif were suspended for five years for their involvement in the bowling of deliberate no-balls at pre-determined times during a test match in England.
It is natural to want to help people in need, but experts say giving cash to panhandlers may not be the best method. A better way to help is by donating to local charities designed to work with the homeless.
Del Mar's fractious debate over vacation rentals is back on the front burner, with a lawsuit filed in state court and the city council poised to plot its next steps toward a new long-term policy.
A coalition of Del Mar residents filed suit on June 1 in San Diego Superior Court, challenging the city council's ruling in April that Del Mar's 40-year-old planning documents do not allow short-term rentals (STRs).
The council confined their ruling to rentals of less than 30 days and applied it to every residential area in the city except for one side of a two-block stretch of Stratford Court that does not include any rental homes. The June lawsuit characterizes that action as an outright ban.
“We feel that our property rights are being infringed upon,” said Eric Charnholm, one of three plaintiffs named in the lawsuit.
Charnholm has lived in Del Mar's beach colony since he was a toddler, when his parents were among the city's most prominent real estate agents.
“This community has always been based on vacation rentals; it's been a big part of what has built this community into the desirable place that it is,” he said. “There's right and there's wrong, and this is just wrong.”
Dozens of residents made similar arguments as city leaders wrangled with the issue over the past year amid an evenly split uproar, some residents imploring the council to protect Del Mar's neighborhood feel and others pleading to continue renting out their homes as they have for generations. The city council eventually rejected those historical arguments, pointing to language in the 1976 Community Plan that restricts homes to one person per room.
While the controversy raged, some of the more vocal STR supporters vowed to sue the city and created the Del Mar Alliance for the Preservation of Beach Access and Village. Their lawsuit argues that city leaders ran afoul of two crucial state mandates: the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the California Coastal Act.
CEQA requires municipal agencies to apply for state review whenever a proposal would have a significant environmental impact, including changes to land-use regulations. The Coastal Act requires beach jurisdictions to develop a Local Coastal Program (LCP) that guarantees access to coastal areas. In their April ruling, the council said they were subject to neither CEQA review nor an LCP amendment because they were not issuing a new ordinance, but rather, interpreting the 1976 Community Plan. Mayor Terry Sinnott, in casting the lone dissenting vote, suggested otherwise.
With jurisdictions throughout California wrestled with their own policies on vacation rentals, the Coastal Commission has consistently opposed rental bans. And in December, the commission issued guidance to all coastal communities explaining that efforts to regulate rentals require an LCP amendment and/or a coastal development permit.
“We do not believe that regulation outside of that LCP/CDP context is legally enforceable in the coastal zone,” Steve Kinsey, the commission's chairman, wrote in the letter. In at least two instances — Pismo Beach in 2011 and Imperial Beach in 2002 —the commission rejected attempts to ban short-term rentals. However, the commission has in several instances supported limits and regulations, including caps on how long a home can be rented out.
That is the direction in which Del Mar is now leaning. The City Council is set on Monday, June 19, to take up its STR deliberations for the first time in six weeks. At the meeting, councilmembers will get their first look at language on allowing rentals of no fewer than seven days at a time, and not to total more than 29 days within a calendar year. The session will also look at a wide range of rental-related issues, including the cost of enforcing new rules and the possibility of grandfathering in renters who can prove they had rental permits prior to 1976.
The council has said their goal is to enact its reforms before a moratorium imposed last year expires this coming February. In the meantime, the moratorium rules remain in effect—only homeowners who can prove that they were renting prior to April 2016 may continue to do so.
Leah Messer is a hot mess mom. She is always running late, losing things, and walking around with a frazzled look. The hand she has been dealt isn't the easiest, especially because her first experience being a mom was to twin girls, not just a single baby. Through two marriages and two divorces, Messer has held her own for the most part. Life is starting to throw curveballs and it appeared that she was knocking them out of the park until the Teen Mom 2 sneak peek was released. Losing your cool happens sometimes, and Leah Messer is not exempt from it. According to the Hollywood Gossip, Leah loses her temper with her girls and screams at them. This causes them to get upset and Messer heads back in the house to scream some more. The sneak peek proves that even when everything looks like it is going great, there are still bad days to get through. Being a hot mess mom happens to even the best mom every now and again. ????❤️???? A photo posted by Leah dawn (@leahdawn92mtv) on Dec 30, 2016 at 3:00pm PST MTV airing this moment in Leah Messer's story has fans wondering whether or not she has actually changed. It appeared that she had finally gotten her life together. She regained custody of her twin girls and worked out things with ex-husband, Corey Simms in order to co-parent more efficiently. Messer and Jeremy Calvert have been working on co-parenting Adalyn together as well. Despite the fact that she is now a single mom of three girls, it appeared things were on an upswing. Watching Messer lose her cool and go off on her young daughters really upset fans. Many took to social media to bash her and the way she acted in the clip. At one point, Leah Messer looked like she may be headed down the wrong path. She was caught almost falling asleep on camera while holding a baby and during that same season, she went to rehab. While Messer will still deny she was ever addicted to prescription pills, the speculation about what was really going on was running rampant across social media. Rehab was completed and she headed back her hometown to start things over. This is when things began looking up and the relationships with both of her ex-husbands seemed to fall into place. Rumors of dating have been swirling but Messer insists she is not with anyone and hasn't been dating. The best date night I've had in a longgggg time!???????????????? #DinnerDate with my babies! ???? #LongHorn our favorite place to eat!????☺️❤️️ A photo posted by Leah dawn (@leahdawn92mtv) on Dec 26, 2016 at 5:40pm PST Fans are interested to see how things will play out with Leah Messer this season. She is already claiming that the editing MTV does makes her look bad. The sneak peek could have been edited but what was shown actually happened and losing her temper on her twin daughters isn't going to go over well at all. Using the editing excuse is pointless now, every one of the Teen Mom franchise stars has used this line at one point or another. Messer isn't the first, and she certainly won't be the last. An all-new season of Teen Mom 2 begins tomorrow night and Leah Messer will be front and center. The sneak peek is only a portion of what will be shown, leading fans to wonder what else will trigger her reacting like that. Messer has had a lot of ups and downs throughout filming the show and it looks like she is finally moving toward more normalcy, including slip ups like what was shown. Being a young mother isn't easy but many of the Teen Mom stars have been able to make it work. Leah Messer is proud of how far she has come and will continue to go in the future as long as she stays on the right path. [Featured Image by Leah Messer/Facebook]

Dominic Orr — known to many in the city as Bus Boy — was just four years old when he passed away recently, and a lot of BC Transit staff and passengers are going to miss him.
Dominic was born with Prader-Willi syndrome, which is a genetic disorder affecting muscle movement and speech. It's a tough thing for a little person to be burdened with, but he never seemed to let it get him down — he was well known for his happy outlook and his fascination with BC Transit buses.
A GoFundMe initiative for Dominic's mom, Stephanie, has raised more than $5,000 so far. There's also a petition up at Change.org to have one of our Victoria double deck buses named the Dominic Orr Double Decker. It's headed towards 1000 signatures, and you can add yours here.
Love, Dr. Scott James

President Trump Unveils Plan To Fight Opioid Crisis An estimated 64,000 people died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2016 — the vast majority of those were from heroin or synthetic opioids. New Hampshire is one of the states the hardest hit by the epidemic and on Monday President Trump unveiled his plan to fight the crisis.
This is a year Genevieve Fisher is unlikely to forget.
First, the 25-year-old country singer-songwriter saw her song, Take It On Home, break through the Top 40 country music charts after four successive songs reached the Top 50.
A month later Fisher won the country music category at the Jack Richardson London Music Awards.
Then, the Country Music Association of Ontario announced Fisher and London native Jessica Mitchell were both nominated for the association's female artist of the year award, later won by Meghan Patrick.
And, now, Fisher's newest single, You Me We, is her second consecutive single to break into the Top 40, up against Canadian and American country stars.
“It's just been amazing,” said Fisher, who also found time along the way to get married to Brian Shaw.
“This year's been crazy.
How far You Me We will climb is anyone's guess. So far, Fisher said it's been a “roller coaster ride” with the tune.
“Every song is different and you never know what's going to happen,” Fisher said. “This was a tough song. I was getting worried because it wasn't getting picked up (by radio stations) but then all of a sudden they started playing it.”
Other songs by Fisher that made the Top 50, but not beyond, include July (2012), Shut Down This Day (2013), Bad Enough (2013) and Night In Night Out (2014).
The graduate of Western University's Don Wright Faculty of Music was identified by the TopCountry.ca website, as one of the emerging country artists to watch in 2017 and she has not disappointed.
To date, there is no plan to put out an album. Fisher is an independent artist not signed to a ­label.
“I want to make sure I'm putting out songs that I really want to sing,” said Fisher, who's not opposed to signing with a label.
“So I feel like there are more pluses to be an indie artist right now because you have the freedom to do what you want and when you want to do it.”
Fisher said her calendar for next summer's festival season is “packed” and she hasn't yet heard if she'll be performing at this year's Country Music Association of Ontario's awards gala being held in London June 3 at Centennial Hall.
“I'm not sure, but I would love to,” said Fisher. “It'll be an interesting year and we'll have to wait and see what happens.”

KASUR - If the policemen are unable to protect life and honour of the common man, they have no right to remain on their posts.
Lawmakers and office-bearers of different political parties stated this during a talk with media here the other day.
Punjab Parliamentary Secretary on Communication and Works Haji Naeem Safdar Ansari criticised the police for its failure to arrest the culprits who attacked and robbed the Kasur Press Club (KPC) president. He said that KPC president Haji Sharif Mehr has always struggled for rights of the poor people beyond his personal interests. He urged the government to take notice of the incident and ensure effective steps to prevent such incidents in the future.
PPP secretary information Ch Manzoor Ahmed said that Punjab Police have become a private force for security of the rulers. He stressed the need for punishing negligent cops whose indifference let the robbery happened.
PTI District Coordinator Nadeem Haroon Khan held the government responsible for the incident, saying the rulers have made Punjab Police a force for protocol of their ministers which, he said, has adversely affected the police capability.
WASHINGTON - The United Arab Emirates' ambassador to the United States said on Tuesday there was no military aspect to steps taken by Arab powers against Qatar, which they accuse of supporting terrorism, but that further economic pressure could be applied.
Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut ties with Qatar and imposed stringent economic sanctions on it. Doha denies their accusations that it supports militants and Iran. Mixed messages from the United States, an ally to all parties in the crisis, also has appeared to complicate the diplomacy in a crisis that has reverberated across the Middle East and beyond.
"There is absolutely no military component to anything that we are doing," UAE Ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba told reporters in Washington.
He said he has been in contact several times with US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to assure him the US military base in Qatar, Al Udeid, would not be affected by the crisis. Otaiba said the measures against Qatar were not an attempt to have the base moved "but if anyone asks we'd be willing to have that conversation." He pointed out a defense accord that the United States and the UAE signed last month would allow Washington send more troops and equipment there.
Qatar said on Wednesday it had withdrawn its peacekeeping troops from the disputed frontier between Djibouti and Eritrea, after the two East African countries sided with Saudi Arabia and its allies in their standoff with Qatar. Qatar's Foreign Ministry did not give a reason for the move but it comes as Doha faces a diplomatic crisis with some of its Arab neighbors. They cut ties a week ago, accusing Qatar of backing Islamists and Iran, something Doha strongly denies.
"Qatar has been an impartial diplomatic mediator in resolving crises and disputes between brotherly and friendly countries and will continue to be a major player in the international community," the ministry said in a statement. It did not specify the number of troops affected but said it had informed Djibouti's government of the withdrawal. Moving US air operations would involve a massive undertaking by the US military, which coordinates its air campaigns in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan from Qatar. The countries have designated dozens of people and entities with alleged links to Qatar as terrorists. When asked what further steps could be taken against Qatar, Otaiba said:
"We've designated 59 people and 12 entities. It's likely that you could see designations of their bank accounts and perhaps of the banks themselves. And so there'll be an escalation of economic pressure, again, short of a policy shift or negotiations that lead to a policy shift."
Otaiba said the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt were compiling a list of demands for Qatar that would be "handed over to the United States fairly soon."
He said they would broadly address the three areas of support for terrorism, meddling in the internal affairs of these countries and attacks through Qatari-owned media platforms.
Otaiba said the four nations are seeking a shift in Qatar's behavior through economic and political pressure. "It's not our goal to undermine the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) but at the same time we don't want a member of the GCC undermining us," he said.
US President Donald Trump stepped into the crisis by appearing to side against Qatar and accused Doha on Friday of being a "high level" sponsor of terrorism.
Saudi Arabia and Bahrain welcomed Trump's demand for Qatar to stop supporting terrorism.
Otaiba said the White House was supportive of the Arab powers' position. Asked about Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's call for the UAE and other Gulf countries to take de-escalation measures to ease the crisis, Otaiba said, "That's not going to happen."
Meanwhile, Turkish President Tayyip Erdoğan was sending his top diplomat to Qatar on Wednesday in a bid to broker an end to what he has called the inhumane behaviour of neighbouring Gulf States in severing ties with Doha and imposing sanctions.
Turkey has backed Qatar in a dispute that has ramifications across the Middle East, from Cairo to Baghdad, and raised concerns in Washington and Moscow. Doha denies accusations by Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain that it supports terrorism and courts regional rival Iran.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu was scheduled to meet Qatar's emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani during a visit also expected to take him to Saudi Arabia.
Qatar said on Wednesday it had withdrawn troops from the border between the east African states of Djibouti and Eritrea where the Gulf state has been acting as mediator in a border dispute. It gave no reasons for the move, but Djibouti had earlier downgraded its diplomatic ties with Qatar after the Gulf move against Doha.
The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain appear to be violating people's human rights by threatening to jail or fine them for expressing sympathy for Qatar, UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein said on Wednesday.
The four states, which have branded dozens of people and entities with alleged links to Qatar as terrorists, must respect citizens' rights, Zeid said.
"It is becoming clear that the measures being adopted are overly broad in scope and implementation, and have the potential to seriously disrupt the lives of thousands of women, children and men, simply because they belong to one of the nationalities involved in the dispute," Zeid said in a statement.
The Benicia High School football team beat host Fairfield 48-8 on Friday in the Solano County Athletic Conference opener for both schools.
The Panthers (5-1, 1-0) led 14-0 after a quarter and 34-8 at halftime.
Quarterback Kameron Lane was 12 of 17 for 240 yards with three passing touchdowns and no interceptions. He also ran in a score.
Justin Zimmer caught two touchdown strikes, both from 36 yards and Aaron Jenkins caught a 54-yard touchdown. Jenkins also scored on a 36-yard touchdown run and Kendall Lane scored on a 41-yard run. Braeden Lavezzo scored on an eight-yard TD.
Kendall Lane had eight carries for 74 yards on the ground and Jenkins added 50 yards on five carries.
Benicia beat Fairfield 47-0 in junior varsity play.
The team behind popular Worcester restaurant deadhorse hill will be giving the city a new dining option with the opening of a American-Korean restaurant at the former location of Sweet Kitchen and Bar on Shrewsbury Street.
Called "simjang," the restaurant is expected to open in the fall with its concept inspired by Korean culture and cuisine, according to a news release. There will be quickly-prepared foods for people on the go as well as dishes to share.
Deadhorse hill opened 15 months ago under Jared Forman, Sean Woods, and Albert LaValley. Now, the owners will offer a "gateway for diners to experience lesser known flavor profiles and dishes in a vibrant, energetic environment" with simjang.
"Staying true to the values of deadhorse hill, the team will continue using local and seasonal, responsibly-sourced ingredients, intertwining them with more traditional Korean elements," the news release reads. "The menu will feature easy-to-order, quickly prepared, affordable dishes along with larger format items designed to be shared."
Simjang is the Korean word for "heart." The restaurant wll have cocktails as well, according to the news release.
"Worcester is known as the Heart of the Commonwealth, and we want this restaurant to be attached to our community in the same vein," Forman said. "This city is where things used to happen and where so much is happening once again. Excitement and growth is pulsing through Worcester, and we love continuing to be a part of it by sharing one of our favorite cuisines with the neighborhood. We want simjang to be a place you can have fun, get messy, learn something new, and indulge."
Simjang will join a host of other restaurants on busy Shrewsbury Street. The restaurant will be right next to Volturno and Wormtown Brewery.
Sweet closed its doors last month. Chef Alina Eisenhauer hinted at the time that another restaurant would go into the 72 Shrewsbury St. space.
A man from Marengo has been charged with operating while intoxicated vehicular homicide for an accident early Sunday morning on Interstate 80 that killed the passenger in his pick-up.
According to the Iowa State Patrol, a semi had been on the shoulder of eastbound I80 near Malcom. It was in the right lane and accelerating to the posted speed limit when the crash happened. Thirty-six-year-old Jesus Alfredo Belez of Marengo was driving the pick-up that rear-ended the semi. His 37-year-old passenger, Amy Renee Richard of Marengo, died.
Belez has been charged with a felony that carries a maximum prison term of 25 years.
"The more bodies I saw, I realized that I have to give an outlet for people to mourn — and express my own sorrow as well. So I just grabbed some supplies and basically set out this memorial."
It didn't take much to encourage others to write their own messages. When the posters were filled, Goulich says friends brought more, and then people started bringing their own supplies — paper, markers, flowers and stuffed toys.
He says some people have also left food and water for anyone that needs it.
"And now this grew into something very beautiful and very different," he says.
Meanwhile, about half a block away at her shop called the Secret Garden, Liu spent the day offering free flowers to members of her stunned community.
She estimates she's given out hundreds of single stems of roses, lilies, carnations and gerberas since the morning. The 34-year-old suspects many ended up at the impromptu memorial.
"We'd just like to help a little. We cannot do anything for now but we have flowers for the people working on Yonge Street. There are lots of people," says Liu. She has owned the store for a year, but the shop has been part of the community for about 30 years, she adds.
"It lets them feel warm and everyone can come together — that helps. I feel good after doing something like this. I think the whole community is really, really strong."
Alek Minassian, 25, has been charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and 13 counts of attempted murder. Police said a 14th attempted murder charge was expected before the end of the day.

John Mellencamp is alive and well and still making good music for his core clique of fans.
Mellencamp made a stop at Mohegan Sun Arena on Sunday night as part of his "Sad Clowns and Hillbillies Tour"
You remember John? He wrote and sang some of your favorite songs of the 80s, FM radio staples like "Small Town," "Jack and Diane" and "Pink Houses."
He was Johnny Cougar in his first go-round, and morphed into Mellencamp while inventing "heartland rock." When the 90s rolled around the interest seemed to gradually wane for a rock band that was plying its trade with mandolins and accordions.
Suddenly one of the pop culture icons of the era was considered "eclectic."
Instead of switching gears and chasing trends, Mellencamp forged ahead and continues to write great songs that shed light, reveal truth, or at a bare minimum, make you want to dance.
Mellencamp's entire repertoire on Sunday fit that template, from the searing opener of "Lawless Times" to the set-closing "Cherry Bomb." He shared the stage with opener and album collaborator Carlene Carter on new songs "My Soul's Got Wings," and "Grandview" and backed by piano and violin, delivered a stirring soliloquy on racism in America with "Easy Target."
His acoustic rendition of "Jack and Diane" was playful, as he's joking admonished his audience for missing a verse. In the end, Mellencamp was merely the guitarist for the 4,000 voices singing his own song back to him.
The rest of the show was a stark reminder of just how much great music Mellencamp has given us during his career.
The six-piece band whirred through "Minutes to Memories," and the title track to "Rain on the Scarecrow," followed by "Check It Out," and "Paper in Fire" from his "The Lonesome Jubilee" release, two albums that helped buoy the fledgling Americana / alt.country scene.
He wrapped up the 90-minute set with "Crumblin' Down," "The Authority Song," and the aforementioned "Cherry Bomb."
Mellencamp didn't come back for an encore, but in reality could've done another set of hits having left songs like "Hurt So Good, his cover of Van Morrison's "Wild Night" and "Key West Intermezzo (I Saw You First)" on the cutting room floor.
ISTANBUL—The Daesh group on Monday claimed responsibility for the New Year's attack at a popular Istanbul nightclub that killed 39 people, including one Canadian, and wounded scores of others.Turkish police meanwhile detained eight people in connection to the attack but were still hunting for the gunman who disappeared amid the chaos of the attack.The Daesh-linked Aamaq News Agency said the attack was carried by a “heroic soldier of the caliphate who attacked the most famous nightclub where Christians were celebrating their pagan feast.”It said the man opened fire from an automatic rifle in “revenge for God's religion and in response to the orders” of Daesh leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.The group described Turkey as “the servant of the cross” and also suggested it was in retaliation for Turkish military offensives against the Daesh group in Syria and Iraq.Article Continued Below“We let infidel Turkey know that the blood of Muslims that is being shed by its airstrikes and artillery shelling will turn into fire on its territories,” the statement said.Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency said eight people were taken into custody by Istanbul anti-terrorism squads and they are being questioned at Istanbul's main police headquarters. It did not provide further information on the suspects.▶An assailant believed to have been dressed in a Santa Claus costume opened fire at a crowded nightclub in Istanbul during New Year's celebrations, killing at least 39 people and wounding close to 70 others.(The Associated Press)Earlier, Turkish media reports had said that Turkish authorities believed the Daesh group was behind the attack and that the gunman, who is still at large, comes from a Central Asian nation and is likely to be either from Uzbekistan or Kyrgyzstan.

WASHINGTON — The chairman and CEO of drug manufacturer Merck resigned from a White House council on manufacturing in protest of President Donald Trump's response to white supremacist violence in Charlottesville.
Trump very quickly took to Twitter to attack the CEO, Kenneth C. Frazier.
Frazier said in a statement that “America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.”
Trump has been criticized for his response on Saturday to the violent protests in Charlottesville, in which one counterprotester, Heather Heyer, was killed when the driver of a car plowed into a group of pedestrians. The driver, James Alex Fields, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder.
Trump condemned the “hatred, bigotry and violence,” but did not specifically call out the white supremacist and Nazi groups that staged the march and rally in Charlottesville. He also blamed the violence on “many sides.” The White House on Sunday issued an unsigned statement saying that “of course that includes white supremacists, KKK Neo-Nazi and all extremist groups.”
But Democrats and a handful of elected Republicans criticized the remarks that Trump made himself as insufficient.
Trump is meeting on Monday morning with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray to discuss the Charlottesville situation.
Frazier's resignation had some echoes to that of Walt Disney Co. CEO Robert Iger. He stepped down from a White House advisory council in June in protest of Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accords.
Susan Gorin: ‘We are all immigrants'
Posted on February 14, 2017 by Susan Gorin
By Supervisor Susan Gorin: The history of Sonoma Valley is one of migration from Native Americans and immigration from Spanish, Mexican, European, and American settlers. It is easy to see why this land was highly valued: excellent farming conditions, robust wildlife, ideal weather conditions, amazing water resources with creeks and rivers running throughout to meet the bay, stunning vistas of verdant landscape, and a moon view so impressive, the other name for Sonoma is Valley of the Moon. The valley has survived challenges, both natural and manmade, and we have continued to attract new residents who wish to live, work, and thrive in this beautiful land.
My office has received many emails and calls requesting action on immigration from those who wish to see the county become a sanctuary county to those who agree with the current administration's desire to show immigrants the door and a wall. In some ways, we are a house divided, but I also believe we are more united in our basic compassion. I recognize the pressures on our community with regard to housing, especially as we have a perfect storm of high rents, an extremely tight rental market, and a dearth of available parking. There are consequences to every action, both positive and negative, but throughout there must be compassion and common sense.
The Sonoma County Board of Supervisors has begun discussions on Immigrant Services, including: the need for a community summit; ways to enhance the County and community's capacity for immigrant legal defense; and the County's current immigration-related activities and how to maintain the safety of immigrant communities.
Unless you are a Native American, we are all immigrants. Every one of us — or our ancestors — arrived in this place and made a decision to remain as a part of the community. We are fortunate to have a beautiful place to live and it is easy to forget the role of immigrants in making this possible. Love Vella Cheese? Be grateful for Gaetano (Tom) and Zolita Vella for their decision to emigrate here from Italy. Grateful for our vistas of undeveloped land around Sonoma? Thank the Montini family. Everywhere in the Valley there is evidence of the contributions and benefits we have gleaned from immigration, including our thriving industrial agricultural economy of today.
Our history with regard to immigration is deeply mixed, most notably with respect to Chinese immigrants drawn here during the California Gold Rush of 1849 to build railroads, provide agricultural labor, and more. In 1858, Hungarian immigrant Agoston Haraszthy founded the first winery in California, Buena Vista. Haraszathy depended heavily upon the labor of Chinese immigrants to clear the land, plant vines, and construct the beautiful winery nestled on the eastside. Chinese were a common sight in the Valley and across the nation.
By 1870, Chinese people comprised 25 percent of the labor force in California alone. The nation as a whole became increasingly intolerant and suspicious of the contributions of Chinese. In 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed and stayed in place until it was repealed in 1943. Chinese laborers were prohibited from entry and those who remained were required to register or face criminal deportation for decades. The result was our Chinese community, mostly laborers, diminished significantly. We can learn from this story.
Today, our economy is thriving based upon our ability to deliver services, produce products and operate businesses. In the Valley, we are heavily dependent upon our collective resources to maintain this economy; immigrants are a vital part of this equation. Immigrants are our grandparents, spouses, neighbors, business owners, and friends.
County response to major rainstorms
Where we once wished for rain, now we wish for moderation! January was a difficult month for many people, especially in West County. I want to extend my gratitude towards the hundreds of county employees who worked extremely long hours in difficult conditions during our recent round of storms, called “Double Crest Plus 2017.”
During this time, we had nearly four days of over flood stage. Our Emergency Operations Center did a tremendous job coordinating agencies to respond in real time and as a result, saved lives and property. Transportation and Public Works, Permit Sonoma (PRMD), Fire and Sheriffs Department (Public Safety), General Services, Animal Care & Control, and many other departments dedicated considerable resources to protecting and serving the county. I am also grateful to the state agencies, such as the CHP and National Guard for their services.
At one point, Roads Crews were working 20-hour shifts to repair over 100 roads, including 85 roads closures requiring the removal of 157 tons of debris. We ask for your patience at this time as TPW is working as quickly as possible to full the hundreds of potholes that opened as a result of the flooding in addition to addressing a myriad of other issues.
One highway closure caught the attention of Sonoma Valley, CalTrans and others: the nine-day closure of Highway 37, a critical linkage for the North Bay. Most don't realize that there is a flooding/inundation issue, as well as a capacity issue on the highway. The heavy rainfall in January surprised many as the flooding closed Highway 37 near Novato. Bay level rise, combined with tidal action, threatens to inundate most of the highway over the next 50+ years.
I have been working with a four County policy committee on alternatives to the highway expansion and elevation, along with potential funding options. More information will be discussed in our community in the near future. But note that CalTRans is now actively reviewing short-term solutions to the flooding issues and longer-term elevation of that short stretch of the highway.
Even before the current rains, the County of Sonoma has incurred nearly $10 million in damages. In response, the Board of Supervisors has approved an extension of a formal state of emergency to enable us to collect federal funding. Stay tuned as we continue to navigate the rainy season.
As Americans celebrate July 4th, CNN reports that a woman has climbed the Statue of Liberty, and the island is being evacuated. The woman in question has only scaled the base of the statue, according to CNN, and the New York City Police Department is reportedly attempting to get her down.
According to ABC 7, reports of the woman climbing the statue began trickling in shortly after a protest group called Rise and Resist unfurled a banner reading "ABOLISH ICE" from the statue's base. According to the Huffington Post, six members of that group were subsequently arrested; however, Rise and Resist said in a tweet that it is unaffiliated with the woman climbing the statue.
"Rise and Resist planned a banner drop today at the Statue of Liberty," the group tweeted after the woman was seen scaling Lady Liberty. "This action did not include the climber on the statue. Our action was completed earlier. While it was not part of our action, our first priority and concern is for the safety of the climber."
CNN and ABC 7 report that the woman was seen at various points walking around underneath Lady Liberty's sandal, waving what appeared to be a T-shirt or small flag, and lying on her stomach with her feet kicked up. Her motives are unknown, and it's unclear if she is protesting anything.
Nevertheless, Jerry Willis of the National Park Service told ABC 7 that Liberty Island is being evacuated while law enforcement attempts to get the woman down from the statue.
"We've had two unusual events occur back-to-back," Willis told ABC 7. "So for the safety and security of our visitors, we decided to evacuate for the day."
"It's our busiest week of the year, historically," Willis added. "The island at this time of the day is mostly near capacity, at 4,000 to 4,500 people. All boats have been tasked will move people off the island. We have an evacuation plan. Given the heat of the day, the visitors complied with no issues." He also said that hanging banners from the Statue of Liberty is a violation of federal regulations.
Sgt. David Somma of the U.S. Park Police told CBS News that the woman refused to come down after being asked, and that her climbing of the statue was a "threat to public safety." Somma also said that law enforcement has "not been able to communicate with her," and that she hasn't told them why she scaled the base of the statue. CBS New York reports that officers from the NYPD's Emergency Service Unit is on the scene, and may have to rappel down the statue themselves to apprehend her if she doesn't descend on her own.
Rise and Resist was formed after the 2016 presidential election, and its members wrote about their July 4th protest in a press release Wednesday.
"Reflecting the sentiments of Saturday's nationwide End Family Separation protests, members of Rise and Resist staged a visual protest at the Statue of Liberty on Independence Day," the group wrote. "Dozens of tourists cheered on the activists, and the protest was broadcast via live stream over social media."
The group cited several reasons for calling to dismantle Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, which has come under intense criticism recently for policy of separating undocumented children from their parents. Although that policy has since been repealed, over 2,000 children are still being detained separately from their parents.
“ICE has proved to be a threat to our liberty and way of life, and should be abolished,” Leon Kirschner, a Rise and Resist member, said in the group's press release. “They go after the most vulnerable among us, acting without due process to detain people. For-profit companies are making money off family separation. This has to stop now.”
As of this writing, the woman who climbed the statue is still there.

A portrait of actor Johnny Depp made of tobacco, by artist Abdelrahman al-Habrouk, burns in Alexanria, Egypt August 10, 2017.
ALEXANDRIA, Egypt (Reuters) - In a small studio littered with empty cigarette packets in Egypt's second city, Alexandria, Abdelrahman al-Habrouk sits hunched over a sheet of paper making portraits with tobacco.
The cigarettes fuel his art; he breaks them in half, painstakingly traces out monochrome images of celebrities or animals with the fine flakes of tobacco, then sprinkles his creations with gunpowder and sets them on fire.

The resulting scorch-marks on the white paper form the portrait.
Habrouk, now 23, started using unusual materials to make images a couple of years ago, experimenting with coffee, salt and sand before settling on the tobacco technique because it is more durable.
"The idea is that I'm trying to make the art live longer," he told Reuters.
"I wanted to make something good out of something that is considered harmful," he added.

LONDON - England limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan expects a "young and hungry" Australia will be "galvanised" by the ball-tampering scandal that rocked world cricket when the old rivals meet in a one-day international series next month.
England, currently involved in a Test campaign with Pakistan, resume their involvement in 50-over cricket with a one-off match against Scotland in Edinburgh on June 10 before returning home for a five-match ODI series with Australia.
The England fixtures will be Australia's first international matches since a ball-tampering scandal during a Test match against South Africa in Cape Town in March led to the ongoing suspensions of then captain Steve Smith, his deputy David Warner and batsman Cameron Bancroft.
Australia will also be without all three members of their Ashes-winning fast-bowling attack -- Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood. But Morgan, who led an England team currently number one in the ODI world rankings to a 4-1 win over Australia in a five-match series held 'Down Under' in January, remained wary of the threat posed by the World Cup-holders.
"I think they will, with one eye on the World Cup, they will come with a strong performance," Morgan told reporters at an event in London on Wednesday to mark a year until the start of the 2019 World Cup in England and Wales. "What's happened to them in the last six months has the potential to galvanise a young, hungry side." Morgan added: "So we're going to have brought our 'A game' to this series. It's going to be a good challenge for us moving forward."
The former Ireland batsman was included in England squads for both the Scotland match and the Australia series announced Wednesday despite suffering a finger injury fielding for county side Middlesex during a One-Day Cup match against Somerset on Sunday.
Morgan was set to captain the World XI in a charity match against the West Indies at Lord's on Thursday which is being held to raise funds for stadiums in Dominica and Anguilla damaged by hurricanes that swept through the Caribbean last year. But while he won't be able to play in that match, Morgan will take charge in Scotland and then in five matches against Australia starting at The Oval on June 13.
"I have a small fracture in the ring finger of my right hand," Morgan explained. "I got hit in a game on Sunday at Somerset. It's disappointing, but it's not the worst news that could have come through. It's a week-to-10 days to get the swelling down in the finger and then protect it as we go on."
Morgan was disappointed, however, to be sidelined from Thursday's match at Lord's. "It was my first time being selected in a charitable but also World XI game, it's very special to be selected," he said. "It's at my (Middlesex) home ground, I'll definitely be there to watch and support, but it's a shame to miss out."
Squad for Scotland ODI: Eoin Morgan (capt), Moeen Ali, Jonathan Bairstow, Sam Billings, Alex Hales, Liam Plunkett, Adil Rashid, Joe Root, Jason Roy, Ben Stokes, David Willey, Chris Woakes, Mark Wood

BATTLE CREEK, Mich. >> A Michigan woman wants to send her daughter to college  and shes not afraid to beg.
Lori Truex (TRU-ex) began standing on a busy street corner in Battle Creek this week with a handmade plea for donations. Kendall Truex has been accepted to Michigan State University but needs $24,000.
Truex tells the Battle Creek Enquirer that shell share her daughters high school and community college transcripts and her Michigan State admission letter. Her sign says Kendall is a 4.0 student.
Truex says she drives a school bus, and her husband works in a factory. She says soliciting money for her daughter is out of her comfort zone but you do what you have to do for your kids.

Social media sensation Cameron Dallas has signed a recording contract in partnership with Columbia, Variety has learned. A top influencer, the 23-year-old boasts 20.8 million followers on Instagram, 16.5 million on Twitter and 5.7 million subscribers on YouTube and starred in the 2016 Netflix series “Chasing Cameron.”
As recently as last week, Dallas was spotted on the Los Angeles campus of Sony Music, of which Columbia Records is a subsidiary. Meetings with label brass about the direction of his music were on the agenda, according to sources.
A California native, Dallas first came to prominence in 2012 on Vine and eventually grew a following that landed him among the top stars of the now defunct Twitter platform. On Instagram, he currently holds an A grade and is ranked 93rd by social media metrics site Social Blade.
Columbia Records is one of the oldest labels in the U.S. and is home to such superstar acts as Bruce Springsteen, Adele, Beyonce and John Mayer.
Dallas is the latest signing under new Columbia chairman Ron Perry, who joined the company in January. Other recent arrivals include Diplo and “The Four” alum Zhavia, who appears on “Welcome to the Party” from “Deadpool 2” alongside Diplo, French Montana and Lil Pump.
The man responsible for a deadly crash last year has learned his fate. Michael Gress was given eight years in prison but as Shallima Maharaj reports, the sentence didn't satisfy the victim's family.
PanARMENIAN.Net - Amid a powerful assault carried out by Islamic State forces across government-held areas of Deir ez-Zor province on Saturday, March 17 night through Sunday afternoon, two Syrian Army artillery pieces were knocked by an anti-tank missile team belonging to the terrorist group, Al-Masdar News reports.
The attack took place on the northern outskirts of Abu Kamal city (near the Iraqi border) and saw IS engage and destroy two Syrian Army 130-mm M-46 field guns, a staple artillery piece in the arsenal of government forces.
During the wide-sweeping IS assault that was, Islamic State militants attacked the Syrian Army and allied paramilitary groups at the T-2 military airbase as well as the Euphrates cities of Al-Mayadeen and Abu Kamal.
Although unconfirmed, it appears that the group's offensive of Saturday to Sunday has since come to an end, however, at relatively high-cost to all sides with both the Syrian Army and allied forces and IS likely suffering a combined death toll of over one hundred men.

The vote saw an unprecedented purge from the race of would-be opponents to President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, leaving his only rival a little known politician who is hardly campaigning.

Would you like whiter teeth? Nine times out of 10, the answer would be yes. It seems that nowadays almost everyone wants to have whiter teeth.
Commercials for whitening products advertise that whiter smiles boost confidence. Right now you can do something for yourself and also help a child at the same time.
We at The Gentle Dentist are participating for our 19th year in the Smiles For Life Campaign. The campaign runs from March through June each year where participating dentists offer discounted teeth whitening services and donate all the proceeds to children. Hundreds of dental practices across the U.S. and Canada join in to raise money for seriously ill, disabled and underprivileged children. Our office has been participating with this campaign since 1998.
One hundred percent of the proceeds go to charity. Smiles For Life sends 50 percent to approved childrens charities such as the Garth Brooks Teammates for Kids Foundation, Feed the Children, St. Judes Childrens Hospital, and Ronald McDonald House.

The other 50 percent goes to a charity of the dental offices choice. Our supported charity is the Sand Castles Grief Support Program located in Detroit.
A whitening company called UltraDent donates the bleaching material and supplies, and the dentist and the staff donates their expertise and time.
An oral examination and cleaning are recommended before doing professional tooth whitening. It is important to have healthy gums and teeth before bleaching. During the consultation, the dentist will inform you of any areas of decay or recession. It is advised that these areas be fixed or filled prior to whitening to prevent any unnecessary sensitivity.
Sensitivity can still be a side effect of whitening, but proper measures can be made to minimize this. Using sensitive toothpaste with potassium nitrate will help the most. It is most effective if the toothpaste is used two weeks or more prior to starting the bleaching and to continue using it during the process.
Also studies have shown that chewing sugarless gum helps due to the increase in saliva, and it can be a distraction technique. If the sensitivity becomes overwhelming, then it is beneficial to back off on using the whitening products to every-other day.
The majority of people prefer to whiten in the comfort of their own home. The take-home whitening entails custom-fit trays in which teeth whitening material is placed inside and then worn either during the day or at night depending upon the strength of the bleach being used.
To have the trays made, a dental assistant will take impressions of your upper and lower teeth to make soft plastic custom trays that will be used to hold the whitening agent. The trays typically need time to be fabricated, and you would need a follow-up visit once they are completed.
When you pick up your custom trays, instructions will be given along with whitening syringes and a case to keep your trays in. The most common types of bleaching material contain carbamide peroxide or hydrogen peroxide. They range in percentages normally from 10-35. The stronger the bleach, the higher the percent. For example, the 35 percent carbamide peroxide is usually a daytime bleach that is only kept in for a short period of time whereas a 10 percent is worn in the trays overnight. You typically get to choose which percentage would work best for your lifestyle. Also, keep in mind that if your teeth are sensitive you would want to use a lower strength.
When using the trays, you place only a small drop of whitening material into every tooth chamber; you do not need to fill the whole tooth chamber with bleach. An amount smaller than a grain of rice does the trick because your saliva will cause the material to spread around the teeth. The material has active ingredients that penetrate the tooth enamel and bleach out any stains or discoloration. This type of whitening works best on teeth with a yellowish shade instead of a grayish hue.
The usual duration of take-home whitening is two weeks with daily use. However, the length of treatment can vary depending on the current tooth shade and desired results. Normally professional whitening trays can lighten teeth by up to three to five shades.

I'm back behind the controls of the good ship Power Rankings. Feels good. Natural. Right. So let's set the power rankings record straight as we sail into 2017 and the league closes in on the midpoint of what has been an unpredictable season so far.
All you have to do to secure the top spot in the rankings is win 15 consecutive games -- which the surprising Blue Jackets have done, capped by a key road win on New Year's Eve over almost-as-hot Minnesota in the State of Hockey.
The Wild won 12 in a row before running into the buzz saw that is the Blue Jackets. Still, Wild coach Bruce Boudreau's squad hit Jan. 1 one point behind Chicago for the Central Division lead (with three games in hand) and owns the top winning percentage in the Western Conference.
With all the attention -- richly deserved -- focused on Columbus, it's been easy to forget just how good Pittsburgh has been. Led by the league's top goal-scorer, Sidney Crosby, the Pens went 12-1-2 in December and their 17 home wins are tops in the league.
The Rangers are cooking once again, riding a three-game win streak. Their 13 road wins rank first in the NHL -- which is always a good barometer of what separates the contenders from the pretenders.
Captain Alex Ovechkin keeps rolling toward 1,000 points and the Capitals picked up points in 11 of 15 December games as they try to keep Columbus, Pittsburgh and the Rangers within sight in the Metro Division.
The Blackhawks, bitten by the injury bug again, plateaued a bit as they prepared to kick off 2017 with an outdoor tilt against division rival St. Louis at Busch Stadium. Chicago has won just once in its last five games.
The Sharks -- whose nine December wins vaulted them to the top of the Pacific Division standings -- are making life difficult for Edmonton, Anaheim and Calgary. Brent Burns continues to lead all defensemen with just under a point a game.
The Habs hit 2017 -- and a trip back to Nashville for defenseman Shea Weber -- tracking a little sideways, with just two wins in their last six outings. But the Canadiens still enjoy a comfortable lead atop the Atlantic Division and rank fifth in the league in both goals-for and goals-against per game.
The Blues are hoping that hosting their first outdoor game will help reverse a trend that has seen them struggle through the final days of 2016. St. Louis won just six of its 14 December games.
The Oilers have been very good on the road this season (10-5-5), but much less successful (9-7-2) in their shiny new home in Edmonton. So it's not necessarily a bad thing that the Oilers kick off '17 with four on the road -- although they'll have their hands full in Columbus on Tuesday.
The Ducks began a five-game homestand with a shootout win over Philadelphia on Sunday, vaulting them into second place in the very crowded Pacific Division. Given how ordinary the Ducks have been on the road (8-8-6), they'd better take advantage of that home ice at the Honda Center.
Mikael Backlund is on fire and now leads the Flames with 11 goals as Calgary has moved into the top wild-card spot in the Western Conference. They still give up too much -- the Flames rank 20th in goals allowed per game -- but have rebounded nicely after a grisly start to the season.
The Kings continue to be very much in the playoff discussion. Jeff Carter is leading the way with 20 goals, including seven game-winners. Imagine what will happen if Anze Kopitar (three goals) gets going and Jonathan Quick gets healthy.
The 'Canes have their work cut out for them vis a vis the playoffs, but they have gone 5-2-1 in their last eight games and boast the league's top penalty-killing unit. Carolina has been exceptional at home and brutal on the road. It plays back to back in St. Louis and Chicago this week.
It wasn't that long ago that the Flyers were the toast of the NHL as they reeled off 10 wins in a row. Oops. The Flyers have gone 1-4-2 since that streak. They're dropped to the second wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference and are in danger of falling out of the playoff picture altogether.
Don't look now, but the Leafs have won five in a row after Auston Matthews' dramatic, OT winner in the Centennial Classic on Sunday outdoors in Toronto. Surely it's too soon for this young Leafs team to be a realistic playoff threat. Isn't it?
The Senators are just kind of meh, middle-of-the-road in the most important statistics-- and yet they continue to surprise by holding onto a playoff berth in the Atlantic Division. I honestly don't see that lasting much longer.
The Bruins, like Ottawa, are hanging around in the mediocre Atlantic in spite of an off season statistically for three-time Frank J. Selke Trophy winner Patrice Bergeron. Excellent penalty killing and the solid play of goalie Tuukka Rask has helped.
The Lightning are getting healthier and Ondrej Palat and Nikita Kucherov are helping to keep their otherwise disappointing team within hailing distance of the playoffs. No Ben Bishop puts more pressure on netminder Andrei Vasilevskiy -- although the latter has shown that he can handle the spotlight.
The Predators won just four of 14 games in December and will be without P.K. Subban for at least a couple more weeks. Nashville remains much in the playoff picture in the Central Division, but the Preds need to show more consistency if their preseason hype is to be fulfilled. The might want to start on Tuesday, when they welcome Shea Weber home.
The Stars keep waiting to turn the proverbial corner, but even with improved play they still lack the consistency needed to be a playoff team. If captain and emotional catalyst Jamie Benn, who was banged up in a New Year's Eve loss to Florida, is lost to injury for any length of time it could end Dallas' playoff hopes.
Every time I want to heap some more dirt on the Canucks they throw together an impressive stretch of hockey. Like now. In spite of an ugly minus-20 goal differential, Vancouver has won three in a row and remains in the hunt.
Jaromir Jagr, second all-time in NHL scoring, keeps chugging away. The rest of the moribund Panthers? Not so much. The defending Atlantic Division champs have not won three in a row all season. Good thing they fired their coach, though.
The Jets aren't very good at home, where they used to be dominant, and are worse on the road. It's pretty hard to make the playoffs that way. I have to think that ownership is getting a bit antsy about a team that is allowing just a hair under three goals a game.
The Wings showed plenty of heart in coming back outdoors in Toronto on New Year's Day to at least grab a loser's point for the overtime loss. But Detroit's offense is still pop gun on most nights and its power play, 0-for-3 on Sunday, is dead last in the league.
The Islanders, who waived netminder Jaroslav Halak last week, are actually playing their best hockey of the season. That they remain 13th in the Eastern Conference and have a league-low four road wins tells you all you need to know about their wasted season.
The Sabres are tied with Arizona for 29th in goals per game in the NHL and haven't won more than two games in a row since the first week of November. These have been hard times under the Pegula family for pro sports teams in Buffalo, with the Bills once again sitting out the NFL playoffs.
Injuries are an issue for the Devils, but most hockey folks thought this team would be much better than the one that managed just four wins in 15 December games and fell out of the playoff race in the Eastern Conference. The most shocking stat? New Jersey is 27th in goals allowed per game. Ouch.
Tough times in the desert for Dave Tippett's young crew. This team may not be ready for prime time, but they should be better than they've shown this season.
The Avalanche and their league-worst minus-48 goal differential and league-low 25 points are a tire fire. When does ownership take enough interest to make meaningful changes?
