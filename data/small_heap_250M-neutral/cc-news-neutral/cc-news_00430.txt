Forget Thanksgiving, we all know that the best day of the year food-wise is Super Bowl Sunday. Unfortunately for swimmers, the Super Bowl often falls right in that winter-season taper window where appetites are still at peak-of-winter-training Phelpsian levels, but we're no longer burning thousands and thousands of calories per day in the pool and weight room.
The hardest part of taper can be feeding that monstrous appetite without going overboard. A “holiday” known for its fried, unhealthy food can throw a wrench into even the most carefully-calibrated taper plan.
So, here are some ideas for healthy and healthier Super Bowl snack alternatives.
BUFFALO CAULIFLOWER BITES
Buffalo wings are a Super Bowl mainstay, but, with about 200 calories per two wings without even counting dipping sauce, calories can add up quickly. This alternative is high in protein and can allow you to eat more individual pieces.
BAKED PARMESAN ZUCCHINI
Who needs french fries or chips when you can have crispy, cheesy, oven-roasted zucchini sticks?
PEACH SALSA
A much lighter alternative to spinach artichoke or cheese dip, fruit salsa can also curb your dessert craving.
PEANUT BUTTER PROTEIN RICE KRISPIES TREATS
These rice krispies alternative are packed with protein to help satiate even the strongest taper appetites. They're also marshmallow-less and vegan, in case that's your jam.

GENEVA: After a 12-hour ordeal, rescue workers pulled a two-year-old girl unharmed out of a deep crevice they tumbled into during a family hike in the Swiss Alps, police said Friday.
"She emerged basically unscathed, with just a few scratches," Christian Zuber, a spokesperson for the regional police in the canton of Valais, told AFP.
The girl and their family, reportedly from the German-speaking part of Switzerland, had been visiting the region near the Aletsch glacier in southern Switzerland when they strayed from a foot path and fell into a narrow fissure in the ground.
The accident occurred around midday Wednesday, Zuber said.
More than 100 rescue workers toiled into the early hours of Thursday to hoist the girl out of six-metre-deep (20-foot) cavity, they said, adding that they were finally pulled up around 2:00 am (0000 GMT).
Matthias Lorenz, who heads the fire brigade in the Aletsch region, told the ATS news agency that the rescue workers had been in a race against the clock as they carefully moved away earth, rocks and boulders, "centimetre by centimetre".

The child had given signs of life throughout the rescue operation, they said.
"I have never before seen such a rescue operation," they added.
The girl was later taken by helicopter to a hospital in Bern, where they spent one night under observation before being released, Zuber said.

Following one last performance on May 17, 2017, Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell took their own life to the shock and dismay of millions. Taken just hours before their passing, these photographs taken during the singer's final show are almost unbearable to view. But they remind us of just how gifted this grunge titan really was.
Alongside fellow Seattle bands Nirvana and Pearl Jam, Soundgarden helped put the grunge music genre on the cultural map in the early 1990s. Thanks to hits such as “Black Hole Sun” and their uncompromising mix of classic and punk rock the group stood out among their peers. But it was ultimately singer Chris Cornell who received the most attention.

Known for their impressive vocal range, Cornell had a singing style reminiscent of traditional hard rock gods. However their dark lyrics painted a portrait of a man uncomfortable in the spotlight. Indeed their songs, including “The Day I Tried to Live” in 1994, dealt with the singer's experiences with addiction, depression and anxiety.

A researcher at the centre of a scandal over the alleged misuse of the data of nearly 100 million Facebook users said on Tuesday the work they did was not useful for micro-targeted advertisements that would be needed to sway an election.
Aleksandr Kogan, who worked for the University of Cambridge, is at the centre of a controversy over Cambridge Analytica's use of millions of users' data without their permission after it was hired by Donald Trump for their 2016 election campaign.
Kogan, whose curriculum vitae includes a post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Toronto in 2011-12, said the dataset they compiled would be of little help for targeted advertising. The data that was obtained would not be useful for identifying individuals, they said.
“I believe the project we did makes little to no sense if the goal is to run targeted ads on Facebook,” they said in written testimony to a parliamentary committee. “In fact, the platform's tools provide companies a far more effective pathway to target people based on their personalities than using scores from users from our work.”
Facebook has said that the personal information of about 87 million users may have been improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, after Kogan created a personality quiz app to collect the data.
Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have blamed Kogan for alleged data misuse, but they have said that they were being made a scapegoat by the companies for the scandal. Cambridge Analytica will later address Kogan's remarks at a briefing.
Cambridge Analytica is also under scrutiny over campaigning for the 2016 referendum when Britons voted to leave the European Union.
Kogan said that former Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, who was also a director of the consultancy's parent firm SCL Group, had previously lied to lawmakers when they said they had not received data from Kogan.
“We certainly gave them data, that's indisputable,” Kogan told lawmakers.
Asked if Nix had lied, Kogan answered: “Absolutely.”
Kogan also took exception with statements made in recent weeks by B.C. native Christopher Wylie, who worked for SCL and helped launch Cambridge Analytica before leaving the political consulting company in 2014. Wylie, from Victoria, has helped draw attention in recent weeks to the harvesting of data from Facebook by speaking to the New York Times and Britain's the Observer on how they created tools exploited by the Trump campaign team.
Kogan said the whistleblower “invents many things” and was “duplicitous” in their dealings with SCL.
For their part, Kogan hired a market research firm called Qualtrics to recruit 200,000 to 300,000 people to take the quiz to collect the data, resulting in expenses of $ 600,000-$ 800,000. Kogan's company was paid 230,000 pounds ($ 412,300 Cdn) by SCL for its predictive analysis based on the findings, they said.

However they added that they thought it was unlikely that SCL used the data for the Trump campaign, after they heard that it had not yielded good results when it was deployed in Republican candidate Ted Cruz's campaign.
Kogan said that they never drew a salary from GSR, the company that they founded to do the research that was wound up last year. Most of the money received from SCL was spent on coding work, acquiring data and legal fees. They were allowed to keep the data they gathered on the project.
Kogan said that GSR had a close relationship with Facebook, and one of their partners at the firm, Joseph Chancellor, now worked for the social media giant.

ZANESVILLE, Ohio- The Ohio Bureau of Workers Compensation and the Zanesville Chamber of Commerce are working together to improve safety and save companies money.
The Zanesville Chamber runs a safety counsel program for the Ohio B.W.C. President of the Chamber Dana Matz said there are breakfast meetings each month that discuss how to improve safety in the workforce.
“The advantages of being coming to a member of safety council is learning how to improve safety and wellness in the workplace. A safer workplace, a healthier workplace reduces absenteeism, reduces workplace accidents which again lead to absenteeism. So by reducing those cost companies can be more profitable,” said Matz.
Matz said 100 companies are involved and the average meeting attendance is around 85 people a month.
“Any employee of the company can attend those meetings. So it doesn't have to be the main boss, the office manager, or the safety person. You can send multiple people, to attend these meetings,” said Matz.
You can visit the Chamber of Commerce website to see if you are an industry or business that qualifies. The next meeting will be June 27th.

Accra, July 4, GNA - The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) Global is preparing to implement a three-year project aimed at building up the Internal Auditing profession in Ghana and Kenya, as part of its strategic focus.
The three-year project will be implemented in Ghana through the Institute of Internal Auditors Ghana, the local chapter of the global professional body, with funding released annually based on the success of the previous year's activities.
Ms Mireille Harnois, an internal Auditor and member of the Institute Relations Committee of IIA Global, who made a presentation to members of IIA Ghana on Tuesday, said IIA Global had realised a potential for growth in the Internal Audit profession in Africa, following a study conducted by the World Bank for IIA Global.
Findings from the study, they said, indicated that while the Internal Audit profession was at a matured level in other parts of the world, such as the United States of America and Europe; it was at initial and emerging levels in Africa, thus the need to invest in developing the profession further.
The study, which covered 11 Anglophone African countries, also found that there was the need for effective Internal Audit in the public and private sector as well as awareness of the Internal Audit function and its contribution to governance.
There was limited resources for training in the profession, while efforts were poorly coordinated across the continent.
For Ghana, Ms. Harnois noted the need to focus on the public sector as the internal audit function was not practised fully as it should be in that sector, compared to the private sector.
The Internal Audit function in the public sector was practised more as an operations function in organisations, rather than as a third line of defence, as it should and was also narrowed down to only financial controls and compliance functions.
“What we need to do is advocacy to change the culture and perception of what Internal Audit is and also do some awareness creation among stakeholders,” they said.
They said the IIA Global's investment in Ghana would focus on Advocacy and Education, training and certifications as well as the establishment of a Centre of Excellence which would provide resources for Internal Auditors.
“The way we see the profession today and where we will see the profession in five to ten years will be totally different. The benefit will not only be for the Auditors themselves, but also for their organisations and at the end, the entire community and country will benefit from the work that is being done,” they stated.
Mrs Juliet Aboagye-Wiafe, President of IIA Ghana, said the three-year project to be implemented in Ghana was timely as the institute struggled with funds to undertake its activities in spite of the critical nature of Internal Auditing.
The investment from IIA Global would thus help to build the capacity of Auditors through education, training and advocacy and noted that it was particularly important to advocate its stakeholders, especially government and heads of organisations, to understand and appreciate the importance of Internal Auditing.
“The main challenge has been acceptance. Because people don't really know it the value of Auditing, it is very difficult. Even in your own organisation, you may struggle. So we want to be recognised nationally,” they noted, adding “Auditors are not police officers or police officers; we want to add value to the organisation.”

A 26-year-old Mberengwa man was sentenced to three months in prison for bashing their 46-year-old cougar for allegedly flirting with another man, the court heard.
Freedom Moyo from Chimoko Village under Chief Negove in Mberengwa appeared before Mberengwa Magistrate Shepherd Njanja facing assault charges.
They pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three months in prison, wholly suspended on condition of good behaviour for the next five years.
It is the State's case that Moyo found their lover Grace Gumbo standing with another man whose name was not disclosed in court, the two seemed to have been flirting with each other and it angered him.
They went berserk and started insulting Gumbo calling them a prostitute; they then went on to attack them
The court heard that Gumbo was severely beaten by their young lover. Moyo was then arrested on the spot by a mob that witnessed and stopped the fight.
The case was reported to the police leading to their subsequent appearance in court.
Chicago gets back-to-back homers from Anthony Rizzo and Ian Happ to start the game, but New York is able to battle back behind Curtis Granderson's 300th career long ball in a 9-4 win. (0:56)
NEW YORK -- Chicago Cubs manager Joe Maddon had their answer ready. After yet another perplexing game and outcome Wednesday -- the Cubs lost 9-4 to the New York Mets after blowing a 4-1 lead -- Maddon was asked if they could put their finger on what has gone wrong for the defending World Series champions.
"[Ian] Happ didn't play in the big leagues last year," Maddon said. "[Willson] Contreras played half a season. [Kyle] Schwarber did not play at all. [Javier] Baez was a backup player and [Albert] Almora came up in the middle of the season. I love my names as much as anyone else does but these are young and inexperienced guys. What you're seeing is young guys battling to get back to where we had been last year without the benefit of having veteran experience."
Perhaps youth does explain their inconsistent play, because nothing else seems to answer that question. Other than some expected hangover for the pitching staff, this season has made little sense.
In normal circumstances, the Cubs would have used Tuesday's 14-3 win over New York as a jumping-off point for a run, and when Anthony Rizzo homered to lead off a game for a second consecutive night, it looked as if they had their mojo back. Happ followed with a long ball as well, then Schwarber destroyed one a few innings later.
But then things fell apart. This time, the defense and bullpen came up short. It's always something with these 2017 Cubs.
"There's a certain unpredictability about us," Maddon said. "That's why we're a .500 ballclub right now. That's what happens when you're .500. You don't play that same good game every day."

When Kris Bryant looks bad at the plate and in the field, and it's Carl Edwards Jr. serving up the go-ahead home run, you know it's a unpredictable night. Maddon wasn't the only one pointing to the youth on the Cubs. Rizzo sees it as well.
"We're developing guys and winning ball games at the same time," they said. "Teams don't do that. We developed guys last year and won the World Series. No team has ever done that, I don't think. You have to take your lumps."
It has been a game of whack-a-mole for the better part of three months. The Cubs just can't get all facets of their game working at the same time. The bullpen was probably due for a bad night considering it has the fifth-best save percentage among National League teams. That's not bad for a team with a 32-33 record. No matter what happened Wednesday, the Cubs' problems still revolve around a homer-only happy offense and a starting staff that is just average right now.
"We do a good job, but we have to do a better job," Rizzo said.
The higher ceiling is on offense, where they've woefully underachieved and where most of the youth on the team resides. Can they mature quick enough to help the Cubs back to the playoffs? They think so.
"We're still a confident ballclub," Schwarber said. "We're going to go out there every day and compete our asses off. ... I'll take our guys any day."
Rizzo stressed the importance of putting things in perspective and understanding the process. But a step forward can only be followed by a step back so many times before a new realization takes hold. Maddon says they understand that as well; as the saying goes, "you are what your record says you are."
"We've earned the right to be in this position," they said. "We've played well enough to be a .500 club."
It would be easy to say a day off Thursday before heading to Pittsburgh can only do the team some good after a bad loss, but who really knows what this team needs? Perhaps an extra arm would help, but more than any new player the Cubs could acquire, they need to find some consistency in all parts of their game. We've been saying as much for months. A great win followed by a bad loss only confuses things even further, so Rizzo tried to project a sense of calm.
"The sun is going to rise tomorrow, we're going to wake up in the city and we're going to go on to Pittsburgh," they said.
What if you could reduce your kid's emotional vulnerability? Research suggests that you can. The Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) was initially developed by Dr. Marsha Linehan to help treat patients with borderline personality disorders, but it's now commonly used by clinicians to help people struggling with various psychological issues.
Over the years, DBT has been found to be particularly effective in helping in the development of emotion regulation skills. Specifically, the ABC PLEASE program developed under the DBT framework provides tools to deal with emotional vulnerability. Although it is a specialized therapy that can only be applied by highly trained practitioners, some of its underlying principles can be easily applied at home to help kids learn to regulate their emotions. Here are a few tips you can borrow from the ABC PLEASE method.
Accumulate positive emotions
Kids accumulate positive emotions when they participate in positive events. Helping your kid focus on positive emotions can help reduce their emotional vulnerability. Encouraging your kid to do things they enjoy – reading books, hanging out with friends, playing video-games – helps them accumulate positive emotions. The more positive emotions they have, the less likely they are to suffer from emotional vulnerability.
There is also evidence that images that evoke positive emotions can help improve one's moods. In other words, funny movies or humor can help kids reduce stress. Several studies also suggest that viewing positive images is an effective distractor from negative emotions. Thus harnessing the power of positive visualization (having your kid imagine things they like or displaying images of things they like) can help kids increase their positive emotions.
Build mastery
Your kid is more likely to develop positive emotions when they feel competent. A kid's emotional vulnerability reduces when they develop a sense of accomplishment. It's important to set reasonable expectations and gradually raise those expectations when they attain them. Remember that expectations set too high or too low can lead to frustration.
Cope ahead
Coping ahead begins by teaching your kid to identity different emotions. It also means helping them understand that different emotions can be described in different ways and are often interlinked. For instance, anxiety and insecurity are always associated with fear.
Once your kid is aware of the different emotions, developing an action plan for dealing with difficult emotions can help reduce their emotional vulnerability. Different, easy-to-adapt, emotion regulation strategies can help kids learn to cope when they encounter difficult emotions. In other words, a kid who is aware of the different emotions and how those emotions are manifested in their body is more likely to be aware of emotional triggers and to apply effective techniques to prevent a meltdown.
Effective techniques can include activities such as breathing exercises to help your kid relax, or activities that help distract from difficult emotions like reading, cycling, or listening to music.
Helping your kid practice different scenarios, especially focusing on how they react to difficult situations, also helps develop their “coping ahead” skills. According to the ABC PLEASE method, developing a plan to deal with difficult emotions ahead of time helps reduce emotional vulnerability.
Physical well being
Illness negatively affects emotional vulnerability. If your child is highly emotional, consulting a professional can help you ensure that their problems with emotions do not stem from their physical health. Physical well being means consulting a professional every time there is a need to, and respecting their or their recommendations.
Physical well being also includes issues such as fatigue and hunger. Your kid is more likely to be emotionally vulnerable when she's hungry, thirsty, or tired.
Low immunity
Kids with low immunity are more emotionally vulnerable. Low immunity can be the result of poor eating habits, lack of exercise, and environmental issues. Ensuring kids eat right and get exercise can help reduce their vulnerability. Encouraging your kid to connect with nature every day can help create more positive emotions.
Eating healthy
According to the ABC PLEASE method, eating healthy foods can help reduce kids' emotional vulnerability. It's important for kids to eat regular and balanced meals.
Avoid mood-altering substances
Certain foods have an impact on kids' emotions. An increasing amount of evidence suggests that cutting out certain foodstuffs from your kid's diet could help reduce anxiety and hyperactivity. Non-prescribed drugs or non-respected medical prescriptions can also have an impact on kids' emotions, and mind-altering substances can increase kid's emotional vulnerability.
Sleep
Fatigue increases emotional vulnerability. To reduce emotional vulnerability, kids need sufficient rest. According to the National Sleep Foundation, missing as little as 30 to 60 minutes of sleep time can have a negative effect on kids' behavior. The foundation points out that kids, unlike adults, don't slow down when they need sleep, they wind up. The foundation provides useful information on how much sleep babies and school-aged kids need.
Exercise
Regular exercise can help kids reduce their emotional vulnerability. Even a few minutes of free play everyday can help increase kids' positive emotions.
Although the tips presented above can help your kid work on their or their emotional vulnerability, they will not solve serious psychological issues your kid may be struggling with. Seeking help from a healthcare professional is a sign of strength, not weakness. A professional can help you develop an appropriate action plan adapted to your kid's needs.
There should be zero tolerance for pot use by drivers or their passengers, a new report by the Canadian Mental Health Association Ontario branch recommends.
The report, Cannabis Legalization and Regulation, also says that all marijuana revenue should go to fund mental health and addiction services, and that the minimum age to purchase the product should be 19 years old.
“The risk is that legalization of cannabis may lead to an increase in use among Ontarians,” Camille Quenneville, CEO of CMHA Ontario, said in a statement Monday. “When taken together, our recommendations can minimize the harms associated with cannabis use and support a public health approach to this issue.”
As the Justin Trudeau government gets set to legalize pot by July 2018, CMHA Ontario prepared a report for the provincial government with recommendations on how to go forward.
The report says marijuana legalization should be viewed through a public health lens.
CMHA Ontario anticipates an increased need for mental health and addiction support services with legal pot, especially for youth and heavy consumers “ranging from brief interventions for at-risk users to more intensive interventions,” as well as extensive public education campaigns.
The “most concerning” issue is driving high, with data already showing that an estimated 10.4 million vehicle trips a year involve a motorist that had used marijuana, the report says.
Testing for drug-impaired driving may not accurately reflect the level of impairment, it says.
“Because the technology to detect an individual's level of impairment due to cannabis is still in development at this time, CMHA Ontario recommends a zero-tolerance policy for cannabis consumption in any motorized vehicle in order to ensure road safety during this time of transition,” the report says. “A zero-tolerance policy would include both the driver of the motorized vehicle, and any passengers in the car. It is important that a clear message be sent to the public as soon as possible regarding zero tolerance for impaired driving due to cannabis use.”
While the Canadian Medical Association, which represents the nation's doctors, called for a minimum legal pot-buying age of 21, CMHA Ontario suggested the lower age of 19.
“Frequent cannabis use can harm a developing brain and there is no evidence that supports a specific age when cannabis use is safe for young people,” the report says. “However, there are concerns that a higher minimum age may contribute to young people accessing cannabis from illegal sources. Establishing a higher minimum age standard will be less effective in undermining the black market, and may leave youth both criminalized and reliant on it.”

MEXICO CITY: Mexico Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Tuesday they doubted a proposed border tax on Mexican imports to the United States, which the White House has said could be used to finance President Donald Trump's border wall, would ever materialise.
Speaking on the sidelines of an event in Mexico City, Guajardo said they had spoken with several Trump's advisors and had not found any uniformity in their backing of the border tax.
"I wouldn't be so certain that it will end up in the proposal," they told reporters.
Billed as a way to boost U.S. manufacturing and pay for corporate tax cuts, the so-called border adjustment would essentially tax imports but not exports. It is expected to be part of House tax reform legislation that could emerge in March or April.
It is unclear whether the border adjustment proposal has President Donald Trump's support.
The White House has floated the idea of imposing a 20 percent tax on goods from Mexico to pay for a wall at the southern U.S. border. However, aides later said the tax was simply one of various measures being considered.
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to scuttle the North American Free Trade Agreement, which also includes Canada, if they cannot recast it to benefit U.S. interests, raising the risk of a major economic shock for Mexico.

PKK/YPG terrorists attacked a Turkish border outpost in southern Kilis province with anti-tank missiles on Saturday, killing one soldier and injuring five others.
The cross border attack from Syria's Afrin region targeted the border outpost of Saatli village, which is located some 20 kilometers northwest of Kilis city center.
The watchtower of the outpost was hit by a missile, increasing the number of injured soldiers. Initial reports stated that six soldiers were injured in the attack, with two in critical condition.
However, a statement by the Turkish Armed Forces later in the day said that one soldier was killed in the attack.
The statement added that another soldier was killed in clashes in Afrin.

Fourteen garden villages are to be built across England on sites including a former airfield and green belt land, ministers have said.
The villages, totaling 48,000 homes, will not be extensions of existing small towns or villages, but “distinct new places with their own community facilities,” the British government said.
Sites from Cornwall to Cumbria have been identified in the first round of approved locations, making them eligible for a share of a ￡6 million (US$7.4 million) government technical and financial support fund. After completion, the villages might vary in size from 1,500 homes up to 10,000.
The development of the villages would be locally led by communities rather than the central government, British Minister of State for Housing Gavin Barwell said
“New communities not only deliver homes, they also bring new jobs and facilities, and a big boost to local economies,” they said.
The 243 hectare former Deenethorpe airfield near Corby, Northamptonshire, is one of the sites that has been approved for a village.
The plans include a village green, shops and community hall, as well as more than 1,000 homes.
Dunton Hills, a garden village set to be built near Brentwood, Essex, is to have at least 2,500 homes, as well as new Gypsy and Traveller pitches.
West Carclaze in Cornwall is set to be an eco-village with 1,500 new energy-efficient homes, space for self-build and custom-built housing and a new primary school for more than 400 students.
Developers said it will have a solar farm and 350 hectares of green space in a new china clay heritage park incorporating the Sky Tip, a local landmark.
Bike trails and pubs are also planned.
However, local councilors have raised concerns about the small percentage of affordable housing and change in character of the historical mining area.
‘WINDOW DRESSING'
Councilor Dick Cole, leader of the Cornish devolution party Mebyon Kernow, who said they had objected to proposals for an eco-town for a decade, said the garden village announcement was no more than window dressing for a controversial project.
“The government talks about it being a locally led development, but the reality is that this is only happening because it was a government top-down initiative,” Cole said.
“They say it is a brownfield site, but many of the houses are on fields. It has been one of those projects that seems to have a momentum of its own, despite what local people say,” they added.

The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) yesterday said that it would revoke the operating license of the tour bus company involved in the nation's most fatal freeway bus crash, which killed 33 people onboard and injured 11.
Minister of Transportation and Communications Hochen Tan (賀陳旦) made the announcement after reviewing the accident with ministry officials.
“A preliminary investigation showed the cause of the accident was not road conditions,” Hochen said. “The cause is probably to do with the bus and its driver.”
“With investigators still determining the cause of the accident, the ministry will revoke Yeow Lih Transportation's (友力通運) tour bus operating license for committing a severe violation of Article 77 of the Highway Act (公路法),” they said.
People should refrain from buying low-price, one-day tours promising visits to too many attractions, they added.
Lawmakers yesterday called for the government to examine the problem of travel agencies providing tours with unreasonably low costs that compromise tour quality; to check whether the nearly 20-year-old bus had the required safety credentials; and make public the vehicle's inspection records.
Hochen said that names of poorly performing tour bus operators — particularly those that received a “D” grade from the Directorate-General of Highways (DGH) in mandatory evaluations conducted every two years — would be made public and their operations would be examined by the ministry.
Those firms would be given two weeks to address their problems, they said, adding that should they fail to improve, they would face suspension of some operations or revocation of their operating license as stipulated in Article 47 of the act.
Operators that received a “C” grade in the evaluation would face the same sanctions if they fail to address problems within two months, Hochen said.
Tour bus companies should review the records of their bus drivers and consider removing any who have behavioral issues, Hochen said, adding that this would help reassure the public that they are taking responsibility for their drivers.
The Tourism Bureau is to conduct a comprehensive examination of one-day tours on the market, particularly low-price tours with long itineraries, they said.
“Some one-day tours depart early in the morning and visit many attractions, which makes people think they are getting a bargain,” Hochen said. “However, these are not ideal and are designed to gain an edge in the market, but put people's lives at risk.”
An online platform set up by tour bus associations must include all itineraries, with the DGH to review them, Hochen said.
Travel Agent Association spokesperson Ringo Lee (李奇嶽) said Iris Travel's one-day tour package, which the bus involved in the crash on Monday night was servicing, cost NT$850 per person, which is considered a reasonable price, with similar deals ranging from NT$800 to NT$1,000.
The cost covers travel, lunch, insurance and tour guide costs, Lee said.
Lee said that the bus was built by Volvo, and had a hydraulic brake system and run-flat tires.
The bureau said the tour group was on a one-day tour to Wuling Farm (武陵農場) in Taichung's Heping District (和平) to view cherry blossoms that was arranged by Taipei-based Iris Travel Service Co (蝶戀花旅行社), which was established in 1999 and offers one-day, two-day and multiple-day domestic tours.

Former Florida receiver Antonio Callaway tested positive for marijuana at the NFL Scouting Combine, via multiple tweets.
Callaway's new agent, Malki Kawa, said a diluted sample caused the positive test.
“Callaway has told those close to them they were over-hydrated and will address the issue with teams,” Ian Rapoport of NFL Media reports.
Callaway was expected to be a mid-round pick, though they had red flags already.
UF suspended Callaway for the 2017 season. Their off-field problems included a citation for marijuana possession last May.
They made 54 catches for 721 yards and three touchdowns in 2016 and 89 receptions for 1,399 yards and seven touchdowns in two seasons at UF.

What Women Want is a weird movie when you consider that the premise is that Mel Gibson gets to read women's thoughts after reading beauty tips and getting electrocuted (it wouldn't be a Mel Gibson movie without the protagonist suffering some form of violence). But it's light, it's fluffy, and we certainly don't need a sequel. However, a remake isn't a bad idea, and one has been in the works titled What Men Want starring the excellent Taraji P. Henson. Today, Variety reports that Adam Shankman (Rock of Ages) has signed on to direct.
Per Variety, “In the remake, the roles are reversed, with Henson playing sports agent who has been constantly boxed out by their male colleagues. When they gain the power to hear men's thoughts, they are able to shift the paradigm to their advantage as they race to sign the NBA's next superstar.” Of course, men are disgusting and terrible, and while I'm sure the movie will do all it can to cutesy up the premise (I imagine most of the thoughts will be the standard fare of beer commercials with inner monologues ranging from “DURRR FOOTBALL” to “DURRR BOOBS”), if the movie were grounded in reality, Henson would go all Proud Mary on their colleagues.
Shankman, despite making some pretty awful movies (his past credits also include Bringing Down the House, The Pacifier, Cheaper by the Dozen 2, and Bedtime Stories), has a big year ahead of him. After they wrap What Men Want, which is set to open on January 11, 2019, he'll then move on to the Enchanted sequel, Disenchanted. However, no one seems to be asking that maybe the time for an Enchanted sequel has passed considering it's been over ten years and Disney princess movies are back in vogue. I'm sure Shankman will put together a big dance number that he'll be completely unable to capture.

ZANESVILLE, Ohio- An influx of people have reached out to Muskingum Behavioral Health for help with addiction since ‘Filling the Void' aired on WHIZ News.
‘Filling the Void' was a TV special that shared the story of addiction and recovery with Muskingum Behavioral Health's CEO Steve Carrel, anchor Bri Malaska, and those who are or have been struggling with addiction. Carrel said since the special aired on March 8th several people have reached out for help.
“It got people talking, every place I go, I have people saying ‘oh that was a great show' and it's usually followed up by at least one question and we get a chance to talk about it. Not just me or my staff, other people are just talking about the opioid problem and how it's impacting our community,” said Carrel.
Carrel said the increase of calls and people coming in, isn't the only way this special has helped the community. They said people talking about beating addiction shows others, who are struggling, that recovery is possible.
“You can do it and you can get into recovery. Not just get into recovery but, you can have a long-term recovery. That's a message that we have been really bad at telling over time,” said Carrel.

New Delhi: Expressing concern over increasing number of child rapes in Delhi, Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) Chairperson Swati Maliwal wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday seeking death penalty for those who rape minors.
The letter which they wrote after an eight-month-old girl was raped here last week, they demanded that “a system should be created” where those who rape a girl child should be given a death sentence.
“I want to divert your attention towards the incident where an eight-month-old girl was raped. This little girl is suffering and fighting for their life at AIIMS,” they said.
The DCW chairperson said in the past two years, they have written numerous letters to Modi — all of which have gone unanswered. “It is not only the rape of these children but it is my rape. I have written to you earlier many times but you choose not to reply. Sir, you are a ray of hope for all the girls including me. You have the responsibility for providing safety and security to these women and girls.”
Maliwal recently announced a one-month Satyagraha to protest against the rape case and demanded implementation of strict laws to curb crime rate against women in Delhi. “I am on a 30-day Satyagrah since the last four days. I will not go to my home during these days but will work in office in the day time, and in the night I will go to different places for inspection and will do double work.

NFL Network has suspended three analysts following the filing of a sexual harassment lawsuit against the league-owned broadcasting operation.
Hall of Famer Marshall Faulk, Heath Evans, and Ike Taylor have been suspended pending an investigation into allegations made by former NFL Network employee Jami Cantor, according to Bloomberg.com.
Faulk has the highest profile of the three, with key spots on the network's biggest studio shows, including its Sunday morning pregame show and its Thursday night pregame show.
According to the complaint, Faulk allegedly asked “deeply personal and invasive questions” about Cantor's sex life. They also allegedly fondled their breasts and groped them behind. Taylor allegedly sent Cantor “sexually inappropriate” pictures of himself, including with a video of them masturbating in the shower. The Bloomberg report does not specify the allegations against Evans.
The lawsuit also accuses former NFLN executive producer Eric Weinberger of sending “several nude pictures of themselves and sexually explicit texts” to Cantor. They allegedly told Cantor that they were “put on earth to pleasure me,” and allegedly pressed their crotch against Cantor's shoulder and asked them to touch it.
Weinberger currently serves as president of Bill Simmons' media group.
Former NFLN analyst Donovan McNabb also is accused of texting explicit comments to Cantor, who worked as a wardrobe stylist at the network.
The allegations appear in an amended complaint. Cantor originally filed suit in October.

SINGAPORE: The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) made a net profit of S$5.3 billion in the previous financial year, according to its annual report for FY2017/18 released on Wednesday (Jul 4).
The figure, which excludes a S$1.1 billion contribution to the Consolidated Fund, is lower than last year's record net profit of S$24.3 billion as negative currency translation effects partially offset interest income and investment gains.

For the year that ended Mar 31, 2018, MAS made a gain of S$8.5 billion from the investments of its official foreign reserves (OFR).
While the OFR recorded “strong” gains of S$22.3 billion as global markets continued to rally, S$13.8 billion of negative currency translation effects was incurred as the Singapore dollar strengthened against the US dollar and the Japanese yen.
This compared with the investment gain of S$30.1 billion made during FY2016/17, helped by higher investment returns and the depreciation of the Sing dollar against some major currencies.

“Investment gains … are inherently volatile,” said MAS managing director Ravi Menon.
“The best way to interpret the number is to look at the 10-year average (which is a) good judgment of the kinds of investment gains that MAS is making over a long-term period. Year to year, there will be fluctuations.”
Over the last 10 financial years, investment gains, derived after stripping out currency translation effects, averaged S$12.1 billion per annum, according to the annual report.
At the end of Mar 2018, MAS held S$376.5 billion of OFR on its balance sheet. This is invested in a well-diversified portfolio, comprising different asset classes across various geographies, for good long-term returns and resilience across market conditions.
About three-quarters of the MAS' portfolio are denominated in the US dollar, euro, yen and British pound, with the greenback forming the bulk. Investment-grade bonds in the advanced economies form the largest allocation in the portfolio, said the central bank.

Several large retail companies, including Wal-Mart , Target , Best Buy and Macy's , are making a direct appeal to President Donald Trump not to impose massive tariffs on goods imported from China, in a letter sent to the White House on Monday.
WASHINGTON: Retailers and shoemakers continued to sound alarms on Monday about their concerns that President Donald Trump's plan to impose sweeping tariffs on imported goods from China will result in higher consumer prices.
Several large U.S. retail companies, including Wal-Mart Inc, Target Corp, Best Buy Co Inc and Macy's Inc, on Monday sent President Donald Trump a letter urging them not to impose massive tariffs on goods imported from China.
In a separate letter to Trump on Monday, 82 shoe companies, including Nike Inc, Genesco, Payless ShoeSource Inc, Under Armour, Shoe Carnival Inc and Weyco Group echoed those concerns.
The Trump administration is said to be preparing tariffs against Chinese information technology, telecommunications and consumer products in an attempt to force changes in Beijing's intellectual property and investment practices. Washington could impose more than US$60 billion in tariffs on goods ranging from electronics to apparel, footwear and toys.
"Applying any additional broad-based tariff ... would punish American working families with higher prices on household basics like clothing, shoes, electronics, and home goods," the retailers said.
The footwear companies argued that shoes already are subject to hefty tariffs.

"Adding even more tariffs on top of this heavy burden would mean higher costs for footwear consumers and fewer U.S. jobs," the letter stated. "Given the price sensitivity of our products, any additional increases in our costs would strike right at the heart of our ability to keep product competitively priced for our consumers."
A so-called Section 301 action would allow Trump to impose unilateral tariffs on China in response to a conclusion by the U.S. government that the Chinese had violated intellectual property rules. The tariffs would not need approval from Congress.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the letter.
The letter is the latest example of the growing division between the Trump administration and many in the business community over trade policy. On Sunday, a group of trade associations that represent most of the United States' large businesses sent a letter echoing concerns about the economic ramifications of tariffs.

Trade associations publicly pushing back include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federation and the Information Technology Industry Council.
Sandy Kennedy, president of the Retail Industry Leaders Association, which organized Monday's letter, argued that tariffs would eliminate any benefit the recent tax overhaul provided the economy.
"This is not American industries crying wolf," they said in a statement.
The letter was signed by 24 companies, which also included Abercrombie & Fitch Co, American Eagle Outfitters Inc, Big Lots Inc, Chico's FAS Inc, Columbia Sportswear Co, Costco Wholesale Corp, Dollar Tree Inc, Gap Inc, Havertys Furniture Cos Inc, J.C. Penney Co Inc, Jo-Ann Stores Llc, Kohl's Corp, Ikea North America Services Llc, Levi Strauss & Co, Qurate Retail Group, Sears Holdings Corp, The Michaels Companies Inc, VF Corp, and Wolverine World Wide Inc.
The letter asked the administration to work with companies to find a solution.
"As you continue to investigate harmful technology and intellectual property practices, we ask that any remedy carefully consider the impact on consumer prices," the letter stated.

The bad blood between NeNe Leakes and Kim Zolciak continues to boil over.
On Thursday, the “Real Housewives of Atlanta” alum blasted Zolciak's eldest daughter, Brielle Biermann, on Instagram, after an old Snapchat video surfaced of the 20-year-old in Leakes' home, where roaches can be seen on the floor.
“We don't have roaches! If you found 1, u brought it with u or it fell outta yo funky p—y!,” Leakes, 49, wrote alongside a screenshot of Biermann's post. “Please know I will get You all the way together when you start f–king wit me and mine! Go somewhere and let the air outta those fake lips, fake titties and fake ass because you will never be @kylejenner [sic] Yo trashy mama should have taught you better!
A post shared by NeNe Leakes (@neneleakes) on Oct 5, 2017 at 3:19pm PDT
“My home is Brand New but you guys were so jealous of it, you couldn't even give a compliment. You had to stoop so low and be so disgusting #racisttrash #jealous.”
Zolciak, 39, later posted a screenshot of a text exchange they had with a cast member, shedding light on roachgate.
“First off that video is a combination of 2 videos! I COMBINED THEM! Brielle posted the first video on snap unaware of the large bug in front of them when they were kneeling down .. until their DM's blew up!” Zolciak wrote on Instagram.
“She removed the video immediately!! I was filming as an INVITED guest at @neneleakes for RHOA!! Brielle was invited as well! Brielle went to the bathroom and saw several bugs and had sent ME the video on snap and NO ONE ELSE!!! We ARE filming a show, remember that, (RHOA) and Nene released this video herself! No one has EVER seen this video but RHOA!,” the mother of six added.
Zolciak maintained they will “take the high road,” insisting their daughter never posted the video. They then addressed Leakes' comments in a separate Instagram message.
A post shared by Kim Zolciak-Biermann (@kimzolciakbiermann) on Oct 5, 2017 at 4:11pm PDT
“It's so sad and offensive that someone can stoop so low as to call someone a racist just because they are mad. Everyone in my life knows that I am far from racist and unfortunately NeNe Leakes has tried for the last 10 years to paint that picture because that's their last resort,” they wrote.
“In a day and age where racism is very much alive and people are actually dying because of real racists, it's heartbreaking that NeNe would cry wolf like this only because she's upset. I think everyone including NeNe needs to spend some time uplifting people instead of tearing them down. NeNe should be embracing love instead of making up lies.”
Zolciak concluded their post by dismissing Leakes' allegations. But Leakes wasn't done yet, later blaming Zolciak for the tape's distribution in a lengthy post.
“Kim Zolciak is the one that sent the video to Cynthia [Bailey], Sheree [Whitfield], Marlo [Hampton], Porsha [Williams] and Kandi [Burruss] while we were filming in Spain. Now they have the nerve to make a pitty [sic] post!” Leakes wrote on Instagram. “No one from Kim's household was invited to my white party. Kim came as Sheree's plus 1.”
Leakes slammed Zolciak as a liar, claiming the “calculated video” shows “how low they will really go!”

Bob Mosier, Anne Arundel County Public Schools spokesperson, said county schools have found success in the use of Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports and restorative practices.
“To have the chance to be a part of a discussion that could help inform public policy going forward is an opportunity we certainly saw as a valuable one,” Mosier said.
University of Connecticut Professor George Sugai, a top PBIS expert according to the Education Department, will also speak to the commission.
The release listed the event as starting at 10 a.m., with the first classroom visit at 10:30 a.m. followed by presentations and a panel at 11 a.m. The meeting will be live-streamed.

The Cabinet's decision to increase minimum support price (MSP) for Kharif crops, intended to appease farmers, does not seem to have struck the right chord.CCEA in its meeting on Wednesday approved an increase in MSP for summer crops, especially paddy and dal, as a move to fulfil its Budget promise and address farmers' concerns about the cost of crops.The increase, however, is based on A2+FL formula, which takes into account actual cost plus the imputed value of family labour in the production of a crop.Farmer associations across the country are unhappy with the cost calculations as they expected C2 costs to be taken into consideration. This formula factors in multiple costs, including imputed rent on land and interest on capital, which makes the cost of production much higher.During the announcement of the Budget in February 2018, Arun Jaitley had said that the insurance of MSPs of Kharif crops at 1.5 times their costs will be based on the A2+FL costs, and not the more ambitious C2 costs formula favoured by farm scientist MS Swaminathan.“The increase in MSP is not adequate. A2+FL does not factor in everything that goes in, in producing crops. Swaminathan report also states that it is C2 which needs to used to calculate MSP,” said Pushpendra Singh, a farm leader in Uttar Pradesh.The move comes as a way to address farmers' distress as major nationwide protests with various demands have taken place this year.According to aggregated data provided by farmer associations in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab and Maharashtra the current rise in MSP would have been approximately 40 percent higher had it been calculated on C2 costs.The CCEA has approved a rise in MSP for paddy by approximately Rs 250 per quintal to Rs 1,800 per quintal. Earlier, the prices were at Rs 1,550 per quintal. The cost would have been Rs 2,250 had C2 costs been factored in.The cost of the revised MSP is estimated to be around Rs 33,500 crore as of now.Minimum support price is a form of market intervention by the government to insure farmers against any sudden fall in agricultural produce prices. The MSP is a guaranteed price for their produce from the State.Farm associations are also now concerned about state governments improving purchasing mechanisms. “Now the ball is in the court of concerned states. They need to work meticulously on improving the amount and mechanism involved in purchasing of crops,” said Mohini Mohan, national secretary, Bhartiya Kisan Sangh.Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that the Union Cabinet will approve the increase in MSP to at least 1.5 times of the production cost in the forthcoming meeting.Paddy is the main Kharif crop, the sowing of which has already begun with the onset of the southwest monsoon.“In some of the Kharif crops where the MSP is already 1.5 times of the production cost, the increase will be minimal. But there will a sharp increase in crops like paddy, ragi and moong, whose MSP are well below the 150 percent of the input cost,” an official source had said prior to the meeting.The MSP will largely apply to paddy and pulses but will benefit ‘nutri-cereals' like millets the most. The added cost of MSP is 0.2 percent of GDP, according to the Cabinet note. The share of paddy in the additional outgo will be around Rs 12,300 crore.A range of crops was covered by the latest MSP, unlike the usual focus on rice and wheat. A procurement mechanism is to be announced later. The highest priority, in calculating the cost of production, has been given to labour, which is about 53 percent while other costs like fertilisers, farm animals, pesticides, seeds and irrigation make up the remaining.According to a report in The Economic Times, the government delayed the announcement of MSP of kharif crops, the sowing of which has already begun, as it was weighing whether to take such a big political decision considering the huge financial burden on the exchequer.Farm experts are of the view that the sharp increase in the paddy MSP could further boost India's rice production, which touched an all-time high of 111 million tonnes in 2017-18 crop year and the output is much more than the domestic demand.The cultivation of paddy, which is a water-guzzling crop, needs to be discouraged and not promoted, they said, adding that higher rice production will lead to increase in government procurement and swelling of the food subsidy bill.This hike assumes significance given that it covers the crop which constitutes over 50 percent of the total acreage of food grain crops during Kharif season. This move is expected to put an additional burden of an estimated Rs 12,000 crore on account of procurement based on records of procurement in previous years.
Nicolas Pereira previews day four at Wimbledon which will see both Rafael Nadal and Simona Halep in action. (1:26)
WIMBLEDON -- After successful opening round campaigns, Day 4 of Wimbledon sees the return of both the men's and women's world No.1s.
Rafael Nadal's quest for a first Wimbledon title since 2010 started well as they dispatched Dudi Sela in straight sets (6-3, 6-3, 6-2) Tuesday. With a height difference of four inches and the Spaniard's superior strength, the Israeli player never really had a look in.

Nadal will play 30-year-old Mikhail Kukushkin Thursday, who ousted British No.1 Kyle Edmund from Eastbourne in a shock upset last month and overcame Vasek Pospisil in their Wimbledon opener.
The Spaniard ought to take another straightforward win over the World No.77 -- this will be the third career meeting for the pair, with Nadal having claimed all three victories.

It's time tennis accepts and implements the 25-second shot clock Some players are unhappy they weren't consulted. Others don't think a clock is necessary. But like electronic-line calling before it, the 25-second shot clock is a change to tennis that will make the game better. 1 Related
Halep has not had huge success at Wimbledon in previous years -- in 2017 they were knocked out at the quarterfinal stage by Britain's Johanna Konta, the second year in succession that they had exited in the last eight.
But this year, Halep approaches their Wimbledon campaign a little differently -- for the first time they enter into one of the four major tournaments with a Grand Slam title, last month's French Open, in their cabinet.
The 26-year-old Romanian has been in terrific form and ousted them round one opponent, Kurumi Nara with ease Tuesday.
Halep and Zheng have faced one another just one time before -- in the semifinals at the Shenzhen Open in 2015, where the Romanian dropped just five games and then went on to claim the title.
No.21 Kyle Edmund vs. Bradley Klahn (1-1)
Edmund has had a fantastic year. They have climbed through the ranks, aided by a run to the Australian Open semifinals, and overtaking Andy Murray as British No. 1.
In the men's singles, Edmund is the only remaining British player and ousted Australia's Alex Bolt with ease in their first round match.
While the Brit is riding a career-high, their American opponent Bradley Klahn is at the end of a two-year journey back to form following back surgery that nearly ended their playing career.
Edmund is looking to reach the third round of Wimbledon for the first time and a win Thursday could set up a third-round clash with Novak Djokovic Saturday.
Johanna Konta, the women's British No. 1, will also be trying to extend their Wimbledon run on Thursday -- they face Dominika Cibulkova.
No. 3 Garbine Muguruza vs. Alison Van Uytvanck

Muguruza, the defending women's champion, has flown relatively under the radar so far this tournament. They defeated Naomi Broady 6-2, 7-5 Tuesday -- the Brit put up a valiant effort in the second, but the reigning champ never looked in any real danger.
The Spaniard's next opponent, Van Uytvanck, has won WTA titles before, but never made any real impact at a major tournament. Despite the Belgian player coasting through their first round match against Polona Hercog in straight sets, Muguruza will be looking to close out the match pretty quickly.
The pair have never met before.
Marvel Studios celebrates its tenth anniversary with a hurricane of carnage. Avengers: Infinity War hits like a machine gun with an extended clip. It is an unrelenting onslaught of destruction; sprinkled with just enough humor to keep the melancholy at bay. Characters we've grown to love to face their destiny from a merciless foe. Infinity War is so gargantuan in scope, it almost becomes too much to digest. The smaller moments that have made the Marvel Cinematic Universe so enjoyable, are lost in the spectacle. This review is spoiler free.
After years of watching bit players fail them repeatedly, Thanos (Josh Brolin) and their ferocious Black Order get off the bench and into the game. Infinity War opens with the death obsessed Titan on a rampage. Their quest to collect the six Infinity Stones has become paramount. Anyone standing in their way is run over. Scattered survivors ring the alarm on Earth. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) are alerted. The Avengers, disbanded after the events of Civil War, must forget their differences and unite again. This time the mission is not only saving humankind, but trillions of lives in the universe. Our heroes seem hopelessly outmatched, but have formidable allies. A King in Wakanda and band of misfit Guardians prove to be essential to the fight.
Infinity War is an all hand on deck feature. Almost every character we've seen in the MCU shows up here. Some have a lot more to say and do than others. The big baddie gobbles up most of the screen time. Thanos is the villain and primary character. Every scene involves them in some way. Josh Brolin is a CGI beast. Thanos has uncompromising power that is displayed early and often. The character is consumed by righteous conviction. The script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely places emphasis on their motivation. Thanos believes that taking life is the only way to guarantee life's existence. It's a mad logic that cannot be reasoned with.
Infinity War has deeply emotional moments that come and go too quickly. The pace of the story allows no time to absorb sizable impacts. Sledgehammer reveals become fleeting because the plot has moved on to another equally seismic event. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo aren't quibbling with tragedy. Every tear shed is seemingly followed by a fist. The epic action scenes overwhelm the drama. Infinity War runs like a cheetah at one hundred and forty-nine minutes. The Russo Brothers, who also directed Civil War and The Winter Soldier, never stop to breathe. In a way, the film is like a video game in its depiction of violence. It becomes ubiquitous and inescapable.
Chris Pratt's Star-Lord and Dave Bautista's Drax are the comic foils of Infinity War. They are hysterical. Drax is especially a scene stealer with their droll delivery and literal barbs. The Guardians of the Galaxy inject much needed humor. The film is so dark and unforgiving; the spot moments of levity lift tremendous weight. Infinity War is incredibly somber, even with the mind-blowing action. A few laughs go a long way.
It's important to view Infinity War as the first half of the story. Fans of the Infinity Gauntlet and Infinity War comic series will likely be chomping at the bit when they walk out of this film. The plot is different, but I think the general resolve is going to be similar. This expectation may soften the crushing blows of the film. The events of Infinity War mark a titanic shift in the direction of the MCU. The stories to come will build on this tale with different perspectives. Hence my initial reaction to Infinity War is sort of muted. I want to see the sequel next year and judge the experience as a whole.
Marvel Studios flexes serious cinematic muscle with Infinity War. It's the logical destination to a decade's worth of build-up. The film is undeniably huge in every regard, maybe too big. Despite the anticipation, it just didn't grab me like Civil War or Black Panther. Infinity War has one post credits scene.

REUTERS: Former Portugal coach Paul Bento has taken over as head coach of Chinese Super League side Chongqing Lifan, the club said on Monday.
Bento, who led their native Portugal to the World Cup finals in Brazil in 2014, replaced South Korea's Chang Woe-ryong and has been tasked with keeping Chongqing in China's top flight while bringing players from the academy into the first team.
"It is very rare in professional football for a coach to be given a long-term role and I'm very lucky to have this one," Bento said.
"I will try my best not to let the chairperson and the corporation down.
"Besides coaching the first team, we will also work heavily on the youth system and we will try to bring more young players through to the first team."
Chongqing finished 10th last season, the club's second campaign under Chang.

"Hiring Mr Bento is not only about the club's short term vision but is part of a long term strategy," club chairperson Zhang Lizhang said.
"Having a new coach in position is part of having a healthy vision. It is about building the youth system, the first team and grassroots through schools. We want depth and width."

Still fascinated by Berlin's industrial and wartime past? After a lonely wait of 30 years, the oldest U-Bahn tunnel in Germany has reopened for public tours thanks to Berlin Unterwelten, the historical nonprofit known for its exclusive guided jaunts through Wedding's Cold War bunkers and the Humboldthain flak tower.
Not far from the latter lies the former site of AEG, one of Berlin's first electric companies. Descend beneath it, and you'll find the 295-metre-long Versuchstunnel (“test tunnel”) founder Emil Rathenau ordered built in 1897 to convince Berlin's city planners that an underground railway was the solution to the city's mounting traffic issues. It didn't work, at least not back then: a cheaper, above-ground alternative, which we now know as the U1, was installed in 1902.
Over the course of 90 minutes, Unterwelten's guide, a native Berliner in a neon-yellow safety vest, leads you through the dimly-lit tube, which measures about three metres in diameter, while explaining its multi-chaptered past. It's cold and clammy, around 10 degrees even in summer, with old wiring under the ceiling recalling the long-discontinued electrical railway inside.
Saltpetre remnants still crystallise on the walls from when ammunitions were built in this very spot during World War I; further on, the guide points out the holes used to anchor bunks during WWII, when the tunnel was transformed into a bomb shelter for AEG factory workers. It was then used to transport materials and workers to AEG's secondary factory on Ackerstraße, before the whole complex shuttered in 1984.
If you're ready to head into the dark bowels of the city, on June 17 join the “Lange Nacht der Unterwelten” for the tunnel's 120-year birthday. Tours are only in German at the moment, but will be offered in English by the end of the year.
Berliner Unterwelten Tour A Voltastr. 6, Wedding, Sat 11-12:30, 13-14:30, €13, book at www.berliner-unterwelten.de
ZANESVILLE, Ohio- Flu season is upon us and the Ohio Department of Public Health says the number of flu cases in the state is on the rise.
The Department of Public Health says there has been 257 hospitalizations since the flu season started which is significantly larger than the 83 hospitalizations during the season last year. The Zanesville-Muskingum County Health Department says the county itself has seen a raise in cases.
“It's definitely up in Ohio. We've noticed it in our county. Last month we had four hospitalizations with influenza,or the flu, and we've already had three hospitalizations so far this month.”
Health officials say the flu shot is the best way to protect yourself from the virus and it's not too late to get one. It is recommended that anyone six months of age and older receive the shot; and pregnant mothers should get the shot to protect their babies.
“It's recommended that you get it about October – give or take a month. October is considered the best month to get it in. And certainly into November. It takes about two weeks for it to take effect. So we're not expecting the peak to hit for another two to four weeks.”
However, the shot this year has been about 10 percent less effective leaving people wondering if it's even worth getting.
“I don't think I would. I really don't. You know, because that reduces the chances…it makes the chances more of you getting the flu,” said James Sears.
“I've done a lot of research with vaccinations so I'm kind of on the borderline fence with a lot of the things. But I think it's better to do it because it's safer for them, I think, to have the vaccinations,” Jessica Valentine shared.
Officials say many of the concerns people have about getting the shot are unfounded, but if you're still on the fence and don't want to get one there are other ways to protect yourself such as: using alcohol based hand sanitizer or sneezing and coughing into your elbow.
“Well good handwashing techniques,” said Marc Thomas a Registered Nurse at Rambo Health Clinic. “If you know you're around someone that's sick try to be sure that your absolutely washing your hands good there. Protecting yourself with a mask. That type of thing.”
Both the Zanesville-Muskingum County Health Department and Rambo Health Clinic are still giving out shots. Both places will continue to give the shot until they run out of supply.

London police issued more than 200 warnings and roughly 50 tickets this St. Patrick's Day.
“We did have to shut down a few large parties that were threatening to spill into the streets,” said Sgt. Dave Ellyatt in a news release.
“It was a busy day but overall there were no major issues.”
In total, three people were arrested for violating the criminal code, one person was charged with a drug offense, 49 provincial offence notices were issued along with two bylaw charges and 214 warnings.
Police say 21 bars and restaurants were inspected and several infractions were cited.
The London fire department removed a tent under an immediate threat to life provision under the Fire Protection and Prevention Act.
Multiple warnings were issued for smoke alarm and carbon monoxide alarm infractions.
Police and student leaders in the city were trying to get ahead of would-be revellers, sending out a news release Monday and following with a social media campaign asking people to party peacefully.
Police have beefed up St. Patrick's Day patrols for the past several years following the 2012 riot along Fleming Drive that saw a news van go up in flames and beer bottles and other objects thrown in a five-hour melee that forced police to don riot helmets.
Several students were suspended from Fanshawe College and others charged as a result.
Can you ever love someone too much?
Callie Farrow's love for their twin sister Tilda is so powerful that it borders on the obsessional… so are their suspicions that Tilda's husband is a violent, domestic abuser just a figment of their overactive imagination, or is their life truly in danger?
Prepare to have your mind teased, tormented and twisted by the stunning debut novel from former TV and newspaper journalist Jane Robins in their first foray into fiction writing after penning several true-crime books including The Curious Habits of Dr Adams and The Magnificent Spilsbury.
A deep, dark and disturbing chiller-thriller, White Bodies is a labyrinthine, psychological page-turner, a story bristling with tension, mind games and shocking revelations that will make your skin crawl, set your brain spinning and send shivers up your spine.
In a plot that is as clever as it is compelling, we enter the complex lives of Callie and Tilda, and are thrust into the heart of a sinister sibling relationship that exposes both the menacing side of love and the unbreakable ties that bind twin sisters together.
Felix Nordberg and their wife Tilda Farrow seem like the perfect couple. Young and in love, Felix is a wealthy London financier and Tilda is a beautiful, up-and-coming actor. But behind their flawless façade, not everything is as it seems.
Callie, Tilda's shy and unassuming twin, has watched their sister start to visibly shrink under Felix's domineering love. They can't work out if Felix is ‘a truly amazing person' who adores Tilda, or ‘deeply dangerous.'
But now Tilda has stopped working, nearly stopped eating, and turned into a neat freak, with mugs wrapped in cling film and suspicious syringes hidden in the bathroom bin. They know about Felix's uncontrollable rages, and has seen the small bruises on their sister's arms but Tilda is starting to resent Callie's interference in their life.
Callie too has something to hide… since the age of seven, they have been monitoring their twin, ‘observing her, checking she's okay' and keeping a ‘dossier' on Tilda's life.
Worried about the psychological hold that Felix seems to have over Tilda, Callie joins an internet support group for victims of abuse and their friends. However, things spiral out of control and they start to doubt their own judgment when one of their new web acquaintances is killed by an abusive man.
Callie becomes determined to save Tilda, but the cost of their rescue mission could destroy them all…
White Bodies is an intriguing and mesmerising story, exploring themes of obsession, manipulation, and sibling rivalry with originality, jaw-dropping shock tactics and an addictive blend of domestic noir and psycho thriller.
The bizarre and unsettling bond between Callie and Tilda is the driving force behind all the drama and darkness, their past and present lives slowly unfolding and at the same time exposing the fault lines in their relationship.
Robins has created a truly fascinating and gripping novel, fizzing with menace and suspense, and with a suitably gobsmacking twist in the tail. To miss it is to miss out on a treat!

The Cowboys tried to trade Orlando Scandrick during the draft when they selected three cornerbacks hoping to take their position. Scandrick, though, has no hard feelings.
“I'm all in,” Scandrick said, via Clarence Hill of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “This is the only place I know. I have never been in another locker room. I don't want to go in another locker room. I want to finish this thing out there and to win a championship. I have accepted the challenge of the new guys coming in. I've told them I'm not going to give anybody my job.”
Scandrick, who has played nine seasons and made 58 starts, has the most experience among the team's cornerbacks. They signed veteran Nolan Carroll but have second-year player Anthony Brown and rookie draft picks Chidobe Awuzie (second round), Jourdan Lewis (third round) and Marquez White (sixth round) to go with them.
“Of course, when they bring in new people that gives you extra motivation,” Scandrick said. “But the time is now. My time is now. I'm not going to look over my shoulder wondering what is going to happen. I feel like I was an ascending player when I tore my ACL and I'm going back to that.”
Scandrick tore ligaments in their right knee during training camp in 2015. They missed all of that season and never played at 100 percent in 2016, with hamstring injuries and plantar fasciitis as byproducts of their return from knee surgery. In nine seasons, they have eight interceptions and 61 pass breakups.

Ethiopia's prime minister has rejected calls by the UN and EU for independent investigations into the deaths of hundreds of people during months of anti-government protests.
Hailemariam Desalegn has said that Ethiopia is able to carry out the investigations itself.
Protesters from the Amhara and Oromia regions have been complaining about political and economic marginalisation.
The government has imposed a state of emergency in response to the protests.
The country was hit by an unprecedented wave of demonstrations, which began in November 2015.
International rights groups have said that hundreds of people lost their lives in incidents where police and protesters clashed.
In the past, the government has disputed the figures and said that the security forces were responding to what were described as “anti-peace forces”.

Mr Hailemariam told the BBC that an investigation by Ethiopia's Human Rights Commission, a body created by the constitution, was the only way of dealing with the issue.
They said that the commission was an independent institution but admitted that it “lacked capacity” and said that it could be strengthened.
They also defended the state of emergency, imposed in October last year, saying it has brought “normalcy” to the country.
They said the recent four-month extension of the emergency law by parliament was “necessary to consolidate some of the gains that the state had achieved in instituting reforms”.
Mr Hailemariam said that the government has been focussing on solving the unemployment issue, especially among the youth, which they admitted had “brought resentment”.
They said that the thousands who were arrested in a nationwide crackdown were still being held in prison and will have to go though the judicial process.
French automaker Renault is planning to move the production of its Clio models from France to its Oyak-Renault plant in northwestern Turkey's Bursa, sources told Reuters Friday.
The plan to shift the production of the Clio model to Bursa is a politically sensitive issue in France. In 2010, Renault tried to shift all Clio production out of the country but had to leave this idea aside upon the opposition from its biggest shareholder, the French government.
The production of an electric car at the plant in France will mitigate the political impact of the decision, even though this time the production of the Clio is terminated. A sector source said that out of every 100 fifth-generation Clio, 94 will be produced in Bursa and Renault's Novo Mesto facility in Slovenia. The plant in Bursa has been producing fourth generation Clios since 2012. It is also the only producer of Clio station wagons and Megane sedans.
"The main factory to produce the new Clio will be Bursa, followed by Novo Mesto. Flins will complete the production if these two factories cannot meet the demand," another source said, adding that only 6 percent of Clio may be produced at the Flins factory, located west of Paris, and will only be valid for a few years when sales peak. A Renault spokesperson, however, said no final decision has been made about Clio's production plans.
UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Mike Watkins scored 19 points and grabbed 10 rebounds for their 11th double-double of the season and Penn State beat Iowa 82-58 on Saturday.
Lamar Stevens added 17 points and Tony Carr 16 for the Nittany Lions (16-9, 6-6 Big Ten Conference), who've won three of their last four.
Tyler Cook led Iowa (12-13, 3-9) with 19 points and Luka Garza had 13 for the Hawkeyes, who have dropped seven of their last 10.
Penn State seized control early when a dunk from Watkins with 12:39 left in the first half turned a 14-all tie into a 33-14 run. Carr fueled it with 12 points while Watkins had eight during the stretch to give Penn State a 47-28 halftime lead.
Shep Garner hit their third 3-pointer to open the second half and Iowa trailed by as many as 25 and got no closer than 14 the rest of the way.
BIG PICTURE
Iowa: The Hawkeyes' continue to struggle on the road where they're 1-7 overall. That includes a 1-5 mark in enemy Big Ten arenas where the Hawkeyes have fallen by double figures each time. They'll play three of their final six on the road.
Penn State: The Nittany Lions had been in a similar position numerous times this season where seemingly comfortable second-half leads slipped away and turned into losses. It's happened at home and on the road, recently when the Nittany Lions led No. 5 Michigan State by 12 with 15:23 left. If Penn State can continue to finish teams like they did Iowa, the program's best Big Ten finish in coach Patrick Chambers' seven years should be easily attainable with six games left.

REUTERS: England manager Gareth Southgate has vowed to select players based on form not reputation while admitting that the team's current world ranking of 13th is just not good enough.
Southgate, who replaced Sam Allardyce on an interim basis in September and was named full-time manager in November after four matches in charge, has been tasked with reviving England's fortunes after a disastrous Euro 2016 campaign.
"I'm very conscious I've got to get the balance right because ultimately my responsibility is to produce a winning England team," the 46-year-old told the Daily Telegraph in an interview.
"I never pick on reputation - form has to come into it. You have to look at the opposition and the type of game you're expecting and select the players best suited to that.
"We have players of great potential but at the moment we're 13th in the world. We've got to be better, everything we do has got to be better. Even being second in the world isn't good enough, we have to be the best we can be, and that's the best."
Southgate also said their side needed to develop the same ruthless winning mentality that Eddie Jones has instilled in the country's rugby team, which has led to their unprecedented run of success.
"It's clear they don't believe they can be beaten. That plays a huge role," Southgate said after Jones' side scored a late converted try to beat Wales 21-16 in Cardiff last Saturday to extend their winning streak to 16 games.
"You get a sense of the culture that's there. One of the things I was interested in was that culture.
"How are they working? How do they deliver? Because that's what we are trying to take into the England team: how do we create an environment that will bring the best out of the players?
"Confidence plays a part. As a coach, you're working out how to challenge at every moment. That said, the challenge should also come from the players themselves. Ownership of what they are doing is really important."

Bloomberg
A strengthening US economy might spur the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates twice between this month and March as a tight labor market pushes risks to the upside, a Bloomberg survey showed.
Median results of the survey of 41 economists, conducted from Tuesday to Thursday last week, showed that economists still expect three rate hikes next year, but moved forward one of those projected moves to March from June.
There was near unanimity that the central bank would raise the target range for the federal funds rate a quarter percentage point from 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent after its two-day meeting starting today in Washington.
“The unemployment rate has fallen sharply to 4.1 percent and on top of that we've had two straight quarters of 3 percent-plus growth,” Amherst Pierpont Securities chief economist Stephen Stanley said. “Everything on the economic front is pointing toward more and not fewer hikes.”
The Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is to issue a statement and new economic projections at 2pm tomorrow. Fed Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to hold a news conference at 2:30pm.
That is expected to be Yellen's last post-meeting session with the media. Fed Governor Jerome Powell, US President Donald Trump's nominee to succeed them in February, is likely to be confirmed by the US Senate.
Economists do not expect the leadership change to result in any major shift in Fed policy next year. Ninety percent of those surveyed said they believe the path of the federal funds rate would be “about the same” next year compared with their expectations had Yellen been reappointed.
However, economists do see the economy beginning to pick up in ways that were not evident in the middle of this year. The survey showed the perceived balance of risks to the outlook for inflation and growth shifting noticeably higher, with 63 percent of those surveyed now seeing risks tilted to the upside.
That means they think it is more likely that growth and inflation will exceed the Fed's expectations than fall short.
In the September poll, just 25 percent saw risks tilted to the upside.
That balance was tilted to the upside in Bloomberg's March survey, but shifted to “roughly balanced,” and slightly to the downside, after inflation readings fell below expectations for several months beginning in March.
Bloomberg economists Carl Riccadonna and Yelena Shulyatyeva forecast two rate hikes next year, in June and December. They also expect the FOMC's median growth projection for next year would jump to 2.4 percent.
The Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, after excluding food and energy, fell as low as 1.3 percent in August, although it inched back to 1.4 percent in October. It has been below the Fed's 2 percent target for most of the past five years.
GDP on an annualized basis exceeded 3 percent in the second and third quarters this year, the first time it has done that in two consecutive quarters since 2014.
Economists predicted a few changes in new quarterly projections that Fed officials are to submit next week. Most notably they expected the median Fed forecast for economic growth next year to reach 2.3 percent, up from 2.1 percent in September.
However, they did not expect policymakers to adjust their median forecast for inflation at the end of next year from 1.9 percent.

Accra, June 04, GNA - Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia on Wednesday signed a book of condolence opened by the State for the late Paa Kwesi Bekoe Amissah-Arthur at the Accra International Conference Centre.
The deceased was Ghana's Vice President from August 06, 2012, to January 07, 2017.
Dr. Bawumiah, speaking to journalists after signing the book, said the late former Vice President served the nation dutifully and honestly.
They described them as “a first class gentleman”, who related humbly with everyone including their political opponents.
They had “a very calm disposition towards people” which was “very re-assuring and a first class gentleman, and would be missed by the nation and theirs family”.
President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has announced that the late Amissah-Arthur would be given state burial and directed that the national flag should fly at half-mast in tribute to him.
The former Vice President reportedly collapsed during a workout at the Air Force Mess Gymnasium on the early hours of Friday, June 29, rushed to the 37 Military Hospital and they were pronounced dead.
 They are survived by a wife Matilda and two adult children.

CHITTAGONG: Emergency workers in Bangladesh on Thursday (Jun 15) stepped up the search for victims of the country's worst ever landslides, with mounting claims that the disaster was made worse by unchecked development.
Rescuers found two more bodies, including that of a woman apparently washed away, taking the death toll from floods and landslides across southeast Bangladesh to 154.
"We think they were washed away by strong currents during Tuesday's landslides," local fire chief Didarul Alam told AFP.
"We have stepped up our rescue work in the five worst affected spots. But it's a huge struggle to dig through four feet (1.2 metres) of mud. Also villagers were not sure where the bodies were buried."
Emergency workers also found the body of a soldier missing since Tuesday, army spokesperson Rashidul Hasan told AFP.

The landslides were the deadliest in the country's history, eclipsing the previous highest death toll of 127 a decade ago.
Bijoy Giri Chakma, an elected tribal leader in the hardest-hit district of Rangamati, told AFP the landslides were the worst they had ever seen, and blamed unplanned construction and the large-scale cutting of trees for the scale of the disaster.
"Trees have been felled indiscriminately, which loosens the soil. A lot of these hills are now completely barren," said Chakma.
Their views chimed with those of local rights activists.
"The disaster is human-made. But there is a tendency to blame nature for this," said Sheepa Hafiza, head of the rights group Ain o Salish Kendra, at a news briefing on Wednesday.
Authorities say hundreds of homes were buried by mud and rubble sent cascading down hillsides after monsoon rains dumped 343 millimetres (13.5 inches) of water on the southeast of the country in just 24 hours.
Disaster Management Department chief Reaz Ahmed said teams had begun to assess the full extent of the damage left by two days of incessant rains in the Chittagong hills, which cover one tenth of the country's landmass.
Authorities have opened 18 shelters in the worst-hit hill districts, where 4,500 people have been evacuated.
The monsoon rains came two weeks after Cyclone Mora smashed into Bangladesh's southeast, killing at least eight people and damaging tens of thousands of homes.
South Asia is frequently hit by flooding and landslides in the summer with the arrival of the annual monsoon rains.
More than 200 people were killed in Sri Lanka last month when the monsoon triggered landslides and the worst flooding the island has seen in well over a decade.

The African Development Bank (AfDB) is billed to embark on a roadshow in Abuja, to mobilise key stakeholders towards putting together a pipeline of bankable projects ahead of the Africa Investment Forum (AIF), which is designed to bridge the continent's investment gaps, particularly in infrastructure.
AIF represents Africa's own investment marketplace for accelerated economic transformation.
The Abuja roadshow, which precedes the AIF, will hold on July 10, 2018, while the investment forum is scheduled for
between November 7 and 9 in Johannesburg, South Africa.
Working with multilateral institutions, the private sector and governments, the AfDB is helping Nigeria and other African countries to develop investment-ready projects for investors, fund managers and others managing substantial assets.
Through the AIF, the Bank and its partners will screen and enhance bankable projects, attract co-investors, and facilitate transactions to close Africa's investment gaps, estimated at between $200 billion to $ 1.2 trillion a year.
Infrastructure financing needs alone are estimated at $130 billion to $170 billion a year, with total commitments standing at just $63 billion as at 2016, representing a financing gap of approximately $67 to $107 billion a year, in just infrastructure.
Nigeria's National Infrastructure Master Plan (NIIMP) 2014-2044 estimates that the country needs about $3 trillion over the next 30 years to bridge its infrastructure financing gap.
The AfDB is convinced that traditional fund providers at different levels of government do not have the required resources, and believes that external funding sources are therefore inevitable over the long-term.
The Abuja roadshow will include a briefing session, interaction with key industry players, and presentations from Nigeria's senior Presidency and Finance Ministry officials on the country's development priorities and project pipeline that could benefit from the AIF partnership.
The roadshow, the AfDB said, is in line with its continued efforts to support Nigeria and other African countries to accelerate the development of infrastructure.
The build-up to AIF kicked off with an official launch in South Africa on May 8.
Speaking at the event, the Premier of the Gauteng Province, the host province of the inaugural AIF, David Makhura, endorsed the Forum as a world-class initiative that is uniquely positioned to transform the continent's development landscape.
Taylor Rogers is accused of selling a gram of heroin to 19-year-old Jillian Searle who died in March after being found unconscious by their mother.
Serena Williams and their sister, Venus Williams, are a force to be reckoned with on the tennis court. But they're also forces off the court, where 36-year-old Williams is a mother to their daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian, with their husband, Alexis Ohanian. Because Williams and their sister are so close, it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that Williams revealed they want a "little sister" for baby Olympia, because successful women obviously run in the family.
A lot has changed since Williams first learned that they were pregnant in early 2017. Williams revealed during an episode of their HBO documentary mini-series, Being Serena, according to People, that the first thought they had once they learned they were pregnant was about their career. "Oh my god, how am I going to play [tennis]?," Williams said, according to People. But after welcoming their daughter in September, their thoughts about playing tennis have altered slightly.
In a new interview with Harper's Bazaar U.K., Williams revealed that they are more than ready to have more kids with their husband, if it wasn't for their career. "If I wasn't playing tennis, I'd be pregnant right now — sorry, I'm one of those women," Williams revealed, according to E! News. "I've been injured so many times, and played on it, my body is used to adjusting."
Williams has nothing to apologize for; you can see why Williams and Ohanian might want more kids — their Instagram photos with their daughter are so cute and show just how happy they are as parents.
Williams already has an idea of how they want to expand their family. They told Harper's Bazaar U.K., according to E! News:
I told Alexis, I hope it's another girl. Olympia needs a little sister, and then we can have a boy. I've only been around girls my whole life.
In addition to their sister, Venus, Williams also has three other sisters, according to Biography. With that in mind, it's really not surprising that they would want to raise daughters.
Although Williams revealed to Harper's Bazaar U.K. that if they aren't playing tennis, they would be raising more babies, it is clear that their daughter has been on their mind even when they are on the tennis court. For example, Williams wore a catsuit on the tennis court on Tuesday during the French Open in honor of all the moms out there "who had a tough recovery from pregnancy," according to Sports Illustrated.
And after playing in the French Open on Tuesday, Williams told ESPN that they had other priorities to attend to — like their daughter. "I want to get home and see Olympia, because I have been here all day," Williams told ESPN. "Usually we hang out all the time. If I'm not practicing, we're hanging out...I'm a super hands-on mom. Maybe too much."
This isn't the first time Williams has revealed that they are ready to have more kids. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight this past March, Williams confirmed that they are definitely ready to have another child. "I definitely want two, God willing," Williams said at the time. "But right now, I want tennis as well. So, I'm going to wait and see what happens."
Since Williams is in the height of their career, according to USA Today, it would only make sense for them to stay where they are and not rush into having another child just yet. But, given everything she's revealed recently, it definitely seems like that, when they are ready, they have a pretty good idea about how exactly they want their family to grow.
Rail fares have increased twice as much as pay since 2010, according to new research ahead of news on how many prices will go up next year.
Commuters and other passengers will find out on Tuesday how much extra they will be charged from the new year.
The Government links the annual January rise in Britain's regulated fares with the previous July's Retail Price Index (RPI) measure of inflation, which will be announced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Regulated fares make up almost half of all tickets and include season tickets and standard returns.
They increased by 1.9% in January, but the RPI figure for July this year is expected to be around 3.9%, which would lead to the highest increase in fares since 2012.
An analysis by the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) showed that rail fares have risen by around 32% in eight years, while average weekly earnings have only grown by 16%.
The rises mean for example that a new nurse or police officer commuting from Chelmsford to London, where an annual season ticket would cost £4,000 after the latest rise, would pay 20% of their salary on an annual season ticket, said the union.
RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: "Government policy of suppressing workers' wages while at the same time presiding over corporate welfare on our privatised railway has resulted in a toxic combination of fare rises easily outstripping wages.
"The private operators and government say the rises are necessary to fund investment but the reality is that they are pocketing the profits while passengers are paying more for less, with rail engineering work being delayed or cancelled, skilled railway jobs being lost and staff cut on trains, stations and at ticket offices."
Fewer than half (47%) of passengers are satisfied with the value for money of train tickets, according to the latest survey by passenger watchdog Transport Focus.
TUC research showed that UK commuters spend up to six times as much of their salary on rail fares as other European passengers.
As fares for passengers rise, private train companies paid out £228 million in dividends to their shareholders, while the taxpayer handed £3.2 billion to these companies last year, said the union organisation.
TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said: "This is grim news for commuters, who are facing another year of fare hikes. Overcrowded and understaffed trains are costing them more and more.
"Meanwhile it's pay day for private rail companies, whose owners gifted themselves nearly a quarter billion in dividends last year.
"Enough is enough. It's time for rail services to be publicly owned, saving money for passengers and taxpayers alike."
Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said the Government "simply can't justify allowing passengers to be ripped-off under privatised rail".
"It is outrageous that UK commuters pay over the odds in order to subsidise travel in France, Germany, Holland and Italy and generate huge profits for private train companies," they said.
"The Tories ought to be standing up for the interests of the travelling public rather than the private and foreign state-owned companies who run our railways.
"The Retail Price Index should be scrapped as the measure for increases and replaced with the lower Consumer Price Index."
A Department for Transport spokesperson said: "The Government carefully monitors how rail fares and average earnings change, and keeps under review the way fare levels are calculated.
"We are investing in the biggest rail modernisation programme for over a century to improve services for passengers - providing faster and better trains with more seats.
"We have always fairly balanced the cost of this investment between the taxpayer and the passenger. We are driving the industry hard to improve efficiency to ensure we maximise the value of passengers' and taxpayers' investment in the railways.
"Regulated rail fares are capped in line with inflation for next year."
Beginning on April 17, fishermen without a licence will be restricted to a daily limit on a number of shellfish species.
Measures to protect the sustainability of shellfish stock have come into effect. The restrictions are: One lobster; 10 Nephrops (Norway Lobster); Five crabs (edible, green, spider and velvet) either of one of the named species or a combination); Five scallops (King, Queen or a combination).
Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “The setting of catch limits will make it possible for the Scottish Government to distinguish between those genuinely pursuing a hobby and those catching sufficient quantities to make it a financially viable exercise.
“While I recognise and support the public's right to fish, this right must be balanced with the management of commercial fishing activity and the sustainability and health of the stock.
“In recent years, fishermen have expressed increasing concern about the health of these fisheries. The commercial fishing sector supports taking action against illegal unlicensed fishing and I hope the proposed catch limits will help tackle this issue.”
The Shellfish (Restrictions on taking by unlicensed Fishing Boats) (Scotland) Order 2017 came into force on April 17, 2017 following a consultation on the long-standing issue of unlicensed fishermen selling their catch under the guise of conducting a hobby.
Marine Scotland compliance officers patrol all inshore waters with Rigid Inflatable Boats (RIBs) and are in close contact with fishermen. Officers also make regular visits to fish buyers to ensure they buy from vessels that are registered and hold a valid UK fishing vessel license.

The Hollywood actor, director, and producer who started first with different odd jobs overcame the overwhelming challenges and ended up becoming a major icon in the industry. They have produced, directed as well as written some of the best movies in the industry.
Eastwood who first started out as an actor will always be remembered for their role in the TV series, ‘Rawhide' which formed the foundation of their success. Eastwood has one of the most inspiring stories with regards to their humble beginnings. Here are lesser known facts about the rare talent.
Clint Eastwood's Short Bio
Clint Eastwood who was born on May 31, 1930, to their parents – Clinton Eastwood Sr. and Ruth Wood in San Francisco, California. They were born into a regular middle-class family, having a migrant worker for a father and a factory worker for a mother. But this did not discourage them from their dreams. Being born during the Great Depression era, Clint had to change schools often as their parents were always on the move in search of better jobs and improved living standards. They attended Oakland Technical High School after their parents finally settled in Oakland. While in school, their interest in arts started to manifest as they would participate in school plays although they never enjoyed them. After graduating from high school, Eastwood did several odd jobs before joining the army.
Their movie career started after they left the army in 1953. After being encouraged by their friends in the army, Clint went for a screen test at Universal Studios. They were soon chosen to play a role in movies Revenge of the Creature and Tarantula. During this time, they still did odd jobs like digging swimming pools to add to their little income. In 1958, they got a major role in the series Rawhide. But their major breakthrough came in the 60s when they accepted the elliptical “Man with No Name” role in a trilogy of westerns; A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). After those, Eastwood had risen to a known figure in the industry and started getting more roles like Hang ‘Em High, Where Eagles Dare, and Coogan's Bluff – all in 1968.

Clint Eastwood's Children – Wife, Sons, Daughters
Clint Eastwood and Dina
Clint Eastwood and DinaClint Eastwood and their engaging personal life hardly escape the prying eyes of the media as well as the public. The renowned Hollywood actor and producer is known for their unrestrained life which involved several relationships with different women who also bore them children.
They got married two times and is a father to seven children. Eastwood was first married in 1953 to Maggie Johnson whom they met on a blind date.

However, they went their separate ways afterward, and the director continued with their womanizing lifestyle.
In 1975, Eastwood started a relationship with Sondra Locke, an actor.

Defensive end Michael Bennett met with the media for the first time since being traded to the Eagles earlier this month and said that it is “going to be fun” to get a chance to come after the quarterbacks of the NFC East after spending the last five years in the NFC West with the Seahawks.
Bennett said Washington's Alex Smith “knows they can't run from me” and said they expect Eli Manning and Dak Prescott to also have their guards up now that he's trying to bring them down. Not that Bennett will be working alone in their efforts to thwart the plans of divison rivals.
Brandon Graham, Chris Long, Fletcher Cox, Derek Barnett, Timmy Jernigan and Haloti Ngata join Bennett on the defensive line in Philly and Bennett didn't shy away from superlatives when assessing the potential of the unit.
“I think it can be one of the greatest,” Bennett said, via ESPN.com. “I think we can have one of the greatest defensive lines to ever play the game if we approach the game like every single way, just go out there and keep doing what they're doing and just finding a way to just add and keep showing how many great players [we have]. And I think a great defensive line is about the rotation. It's kind of like Golden State, you want to be able to have those guys that can come in and shoot and shoot and score every time.”
All those players mean that Bennett will likely be playing less than they did in Seattle, but that may only keep them fresher and operating at a high efficiency as the weeks go by later this year. If that's the case, the Eagles' defensive line has a good chance of being as good as the one that helped the team win the Super Bowl in February.
That will be a welcome development even if others get the nod for best of all time.

Looks like Sarah and Jemma are back to beefing again...
As another week begins inside the Celebrity Big Brother house, things are looking as dramatic as ever- despite last weeks make-ups.
After a week of dramz between Jemma Lucy and Sarah Harding, the pair had appeared to finally let bygones by bygones- following an awkward ‘I don't like you, you don't like me but lets be nice' hugging sesh in the bedroom.
That old chestnut…
However, in a sneak preview for tonights episode, it would appear that old habits die hard- as Jemma Lucy is criticising Sarah Harding romance with Chad Johnson.
Following last weeks events, in which Sarah and Chad became romantically linked (even sharing a smooch, despite Sarah's ‘fella outside the house), Jemma has now branded their housemates ‘snakes'.
See: ‘I watched my mother slowly die': CBB star Chad Johnson's shock family heartache which left them single for seven years revealed
In tonights episode, the 29-year-old reality TV star brands Sarah a ‘d**k tease' following their advancements with Chad- telling Big Brother in the diary room: ‘She is an absolute d**k tease. They don't even like him!'.
Jemma later brands the housemates ‘snakes', writing on the bathroom mirror ‘snakes everywhere' in lipstick. When quizzed on this move by Big Brother, the reality TV ‘gal simply explained: ‘I think certain housemates are snaky. So I tried to express myself!'.
Ouch!
Many fans will be surprised to see Jemma un-burying the hatchet with Sarah, as the Ex on the Beach ‘gal has been under much scrutiny amongst fans over their rocky relationship with the Girls Aloud singer.
See: ‘Get their out!' CBB fans call for Jemma Lucy to be REMOVED from the house after shock fight with Sarah Harding
After a series of altercations with Sarah, a number outraged fans had taken to social media to call Jemma out for their actions within the house- with many feeling like she'd taken their beef too far.
However, for some fans it's a situation of no smoke without fire- and so it's shouldn't come as a surprise that Jemma is wound up again.
We'd love to know your thoughts on Jemma's actions in the house- Tweet us @CelebsNow!

This ‘gas chamber' capital city can get on your nerves. What with the pollution, the pace, the murky politics around. And last fortnight, I decided to get going …towards Satoli, not too far from Mukteshar and Almora in Nainital. Within a couple of hours after reaching Satoli and settling down in a lovely cottage — One Partridge Hill — one felt the change in the very atmosphere.Not just an abundance of clean fresh air but absolute tranquility. Solitude!
There is something wonderfully serene about this belt; drawing several who's who of the capital city towards it …to this serenity. Our hosts, couldn't last minute make it but gave adequate instructions to the staff to provide us elaborate veggie meals and take us around …we traveled towards Mukteshwar, Kwarab and the connecting locales.
For me the only jarring note in this otherwise great trip was monkeys and apes all along – that is, all over the Kumaon region. They seemed to be not just along the roads and highways but also on agricultural stretches. In fact, an agricultural expert told me that farmers and cultivators of this belt are finding the going tough as monkeys have been let loose.
SAIRA BANO, DILIP KUMAR
In 1999, I knew Saira Bano and Dilip Kumar were in New Delhi. I was keen to interview them, so I tried all the possible sources that could connect me with them. But the closest I could get by way of a source was a homoeopath who was treating the couple. And the closest they could get by way of helping me get an appointment with them was to tell me that they were staying at the Le Meridien Hotel.
I landed at the hotel lobby, but before I could move towards the reception, I could see Saira Bano and Dilip Kumar in the glass lift descending to the lobby.
I rushed towards them, but in vain as the couple asked me to first have an appointment while walking through the lobby. It was the summer of 1999 — the year of the big political controversy surrounding Dilip Kumar and the Nishaan-e-Imtiaz, which the Pakistani Government had bestowed on him, and which they refused to return….I was told that the two were meeting several important political people in Delhi at the time and were keeping miles away from journos.
Not one to give up, I finally managed to interview Saira Bano. My first question to them was “Why doesn't your husband return this award? Why keep it when it is causing so much tension?”
She'd replied, “Return it? Are we living in a democracy or is it some sort of dictatorship? How much we are being bullied! Tell me how much of a mess can you take in your life? After all, this award was not given to them now, but it was given last year, in March 1998. Even then, Dilip Saab was so cautious, that they first took permission from our Government and from the Prime Minister.”
“But your critics are crying themselves hoarse, saying that this is 1999, there's a war with Pakistan so the scenario has changed…”
To that, Saira Bano said, “Tell me, do we now go looking for all those trophies, awards and citations that our cricketers and sportspersons received when they had played in Pakistan? Should we ask them to give back all those awards they'd received earlier? I'm told that even LK Advani sahib had got some citation from Pakistan…all this talk of returning awards seems petty.”
“Your husband's critics point out that Rabindranath Tagore had returned the title that the British had bestowed on him.”
“Rabindranath Tagore returned it on their way on a certain occasion. They aren't labeled anti-national, nor was they bullied and threatened, like we are being bullied and threatened,” was their terse reply.
“It is said that certain Right-wing political parties in Mumbai are not happy with the social service you undertook after the Bombay riots of 1992-1993. Is this why you are facing this backlash?” I queried.
They said, “There is a communal trace to the whole issue, but let me add that I do social service for all people, people from different communities. I try to reach out to whoever is in need…And I do so with a group of close friends who belong to different communities.”
“Usually film stars stand united in times of crisis, but in this present crisis that you and your husband are facing, film stars are maintaining a studied silence. What do you think of this?”
“Have they stood by anyone? Nobody takes a stand these days! Even when Sanju (Sanjay Dutt) was being harassed, the only two people who spoke for them were Shatrughan Sinha and my husband. Even when the film Fire was in trouble, only my husband spoke out on the matter.”
USTAD DAGAR PASSES AWAY
The very first time I had attended a Dhrupad concert was in the mid 80s, at the residence of the then envoy of Qatar to India, Dr Hassan Al Nimah …The setting was absolutely perfect – under white shaminas erected on the sprawling lawns of the ambassador's residence, the two Dagar brothers – Ustad N Zahiruddin Dagar and Ustad N Faiyazuddin rendered Dhrupad.
And the very first time I had met Ustad Sayeeduddin Dagar was around the same time i.e. mid 80s. In fact, several days after that concert I wanted to interview the Dagar brothers and set out looking for their home. I was directed to a first floor flat in New Delhi's East Nizamuddin locality. The stairs led to a study which had a shelter (white sheet) spread out on the floor. Ustad Zahiruddin was sitting on it doing riyaz …I wasushered inwards by Ustad Faiyazudin sahib's wife Mehmooda Begum. They had introduced me to their brothers –in – law- Ustad Sayeeduddin, Nasir Aminuddin, Fahimuddin, Zia Mohiuddin and Zia Fariduddin.
And now when news comes in of the passing away of Sayeeduddin Dagar nostalgia overpowers. One doesn't want to sound clichéd but then, how else to describe the scenario – passage of time taking its toll… Yes, till about a couple of decades back, it was a full household when the seven Dagar brothers were alive. One would see them all at their small home Though three of them – Zahiruddin, Sayeeduddin and Faiyazuddin – lived in that home together with their families (Faiyazuddin and Sayeeduddin were married with children but Zahiruddin remained a bachelor), the other four brothers – Aminuddin, Fahimuddin, Zia Fariduddin and Mohiuddin – would visit from the cities they were based. And yes, it was a treat to watch them for their seemed much togetherness and that feel of a clan. Clan of great music givers, for not to be overlooked is the fact that Dhrupad started in the 15th Century when a Dagar was a court musician for Emperor Akbar and till date, this tradition has been going on, unbroken so far.
And I had last met Sayeeduddin Dagar around the start of 2014, during the two day long concerts by the Dagars at the Indira National Centre for Arts.Sayeeduddin Dagar was performing with their sons, Aneesuddin and Nafeesuddin.That evening amongst the audience were a large number of their French students – several had travelled from France to India to be able to do riyaz with them and were putting up at the various guest houses in this capital city.After the concert we all drove to Wasifuddin Dagar's Asiad Village home for dinner and an informal get -together …There was tremendous warmth and I got to meet their French disciples – prominent was the 67 year old Mitchelle Dehoky, Jerome Cormier, Brigitte Peterfalvi …and several other Indian disciples too. I recall meeting one of their Jaipur based senior disciples, Iqbal Khan, who is closely associated with the Dagar family for years and makes it a point to be there for each and every occasion associated with this family.
Brighton & Hove Albion will be in the Premier League next season for the first time in their history.
Their place in the top flight of English football - for the first time in 34 years - was confirmed this evening. Albion beat Wigan 2-1 which all but sealed promotion owing to their superior goal difference.
However, Huddersfield conceded a late equaliser at Derby, which meant the Seagulls' place in the top flight was official.
Brighton fans invaded the Amex pitch for the second time on the day to celebrate, before the Albion players led more celebrations in front of the East Stand.
Seagulls boss Chris Hughton then came out on to the West Stand to address Albion fans to a huge ovation.
Speaking to the Brighton supporters, they said: "First of all and I've had to wait an hour or so to officially confirm it but we are now in the Premier League.
"I arrived at this club just under two and a half years ago and the support you've given me has been outstanding.
"There will be supporters out there who have gone through very difficult years. Going back to the Goldstone years, from there to Gillingham and eventually back to Brighton and this wonderful stadium that the chairperson and owner has provided for us.
"As a coach and a manager, you want to work in an environment which is a wonderful environment. From the day I walked into this club, I was very aware it was that.
"We have had a group of players that have been desperate to do well for you and it's been a real group effort this year.
"We played here in a play-off semi-final last year against Sheffield Wednesday and it was one of the best atmospheres that I've seen at a football game.
"What you've done is taken that on all this season, home and away, and credit to you and we'll look forward to a Premier League campaign next year.
"It will be incredibly exciting and tough and we will need you again next season."

Nearly 15,000 children in Northumberland are living in poverty, new figures reveal.
The statistics were released by the End Child Poverty coalition, covering the period from July to September 2017, following analysis of tax credit data and national trends in worklessness.
They show that a total of 14,847 (24.18 per cent) youngsters throughout the county face poverty – up from 23.48 per cent in the 2016 figures (October to December 2015).
In the Berwick-upon-Tweed constituency, the Druridge Bay ward is the worst affected area, with 343 children (30.66 per cent) living below the breadline.
Ward councillor Scott Dickinson said: “These figures don't surprise me, but they sadden me.
“Never as a local member have I seen foodbanks and support services at places like Hadston House required so much.
“Luckily in Hadston and Widdrington we have a fantastic community spirit that pulls together and helps one another, dedicated parish councillors and community organisations that provide a community wealth that money cannot buy.”
The totals for the Lynemouth and Pegswood wards are 243 (27.01 per cent) and 220 (22.05 per cent) respectively.
The figures are much lower in other wards, including Ponteland North – 138 children (15.48 per cent) and Longhorsley – 58 children (9.56 per cent) respectively.
The worst area in the county is Hirst in Ashington (40.14 per cent), which is in Ian Lavery MP's Wansbeck constituency.
Other wards above 35 per cent include Newbiggin Central and East (40 per cent) and Ashington Central (38.64 per cent).
The figures for the Morpeth wards are as follows. Morpeth Stobhill – 193 children (19.22 per cent); Morpeth Kirkhill – 147 children (15.61 per cent); Morpeth North – 77 children (10.66 per cent).
Mr Lavery, chairperson of the Labour Party, said: “Sadly this report does not surprise me. The stories I hear from constituents of day-to-day suffering and struggle have increased year-on-year since the Tories took power in 2010.
“The figures tell only part of the story as areas right across my constituency have more than half of local residents having their lives marred by poverty.
“I have nothing but admiration and support for local charities and organisations trying to intervene, but the scourge of poverty will not be eradicated whilst this Conservative Government is in power and their Victorian attitude toward the most vulnerable in our society continues.”
The Herald contacted Berwick-upon-Tweed Conservative MP Anne-Marie Trevelyan for comment, but did not receive one before going to publication.
Health advisory lifted for Yacht Club Beach in Cape Coral
A health advisory was lifted Tuesday afternoon for the Yacht Club Beach, according to the Florida Department of Health in Lee County.
The advisory was placed last week in regards to high bacteria levels at the beach on 5819 Driftwood Parkway in Cape Coral, the health department said.
Tests completed on Tuesday for enterococcus bacteria in water samples taken on April 23 showed levels under the maximum containment level, the health department said.

(CNN) – El Salvador may be the first country to have a community of 3D-printed homes.
A nonprofit called New Story is raising $1 million to bring more than 100 3D-printed homes to the country over the next two years. The organization funds homes for families in need and people displaced by natural disasters.
“We want to bring this to the families who need it the most,” CEO and cofounder Brett Hagler told CNN last week.
The company is already working with the technology. Earlier this month, it unveiled its first permanent 3D-printed home at the SXSW festival in Austin.
The Austin home had three rooms — a main bedroom, a living room and a small office or child's bedroom — along with a bathroom.
But it was far from traditional: The house was assembled in 48 hours by a giant 3D printer. The machine uses a concrete mix that hardens as it dries, and New Story says it is sturdier than regular concrete homes.
New Story worked with an Austin-based robotics construction startup called ICON on the Austin home. The companies developed a custom 3D printer, called the Vulcan, to “print” the house. New Story later added windows, lighting, furniture and decor.
“[The Austin house] could turn into a little Airbnb or an office,” Hagler said.
Hagler, 28, added that they expect it will eventually take 12-to-24 hours to build a home.
“That's the promise of robotics — it's only going to get faster,” they said.
New Story says that more than half of the money it is raising for the El Salvador project will go toward research, development and transportation of the Vulcan printer and software. ICON is also a partner on that effort.
“We want to bring this to the families who need it the most,” Hagler said.
While its work in El Salvador will be the company's most ambitious housing plan to date, it's not the first time New Story has brought houses to families in need.
The organization has partnered with local nonprofits to fund such homes in the past, and has built more than 850 homes in Haiti, El Salvador, Mexico and Bolivia since its December 2014 launch.
Previous New Story homes were built with basic concrete blocks and a tin roof. The process took about 15 days to build and cost more than $6,000.
But the organization expects the 3D-printing technology to help reduce costs and service more people more quickly. For example, the new homes in El Salvador will cost about $4,000.
“One organization — as good as it is — can only do so much,” they said. “We thought what about trying to focus more on research, development and innovation. We asked, ‘What if we could significantly decrease the cost and significantly increase speed [of building homes]?'”
New Story and ICON aren't the first to develop a printer for homes. Last year, for example, a company called Apis Cor printed a home in Russia.

“A major problem with the Taipei City Government is that its departments divide duties, but do not cooperate,” Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je (柯文哲) said yesterday.
Ko made the remarks at a meeting with borough wardens of Neihu District (內湖).
Gangqian Borough (港墘) Warden Wei Ching-chen (魏景城) said that they had proposed widening Gangqian Road between Zhouzi Street and Ruiguang Road to relieve heavy traffic and that Taipei Deputy Mayor Charles Lin (林欽榮) had agreed to complete the construction before the end of this year.
Wei asked about the progress of the plan and whether the city government would keep its promise.
The Taipei Department of Public Works' New Construction Office said the plan was being handled by the Traffic Engineering Office, which has not delivered it for urban design review.
However, the Taipei Department of Urban Development said that as that section of road is part of a Neihu Technology Park build-operate-transfer project, the Taipei Department of Economic Development should urge the construction company that won the bid to send a construction plan for urban design review.
Ko attributed the slow progress to the departments' failures.
Residents only want the construction to be finished as soon as possible, Ko said, adding that they have requested that the Department of Economic Development ask the construction firm to send its plan for review as soon as possible and that the New Construction Office begin work as soon as the plan is approved.
The city government has planned 24 meetings for Ko to discuss issues with the city's 456 borough wardens, of which yesterday's meeting — held with 19 borough wardens — was the 18th.

A major season that began with the Masters favourite falling down stairs ended with one of the game's best young players capturing the PGA Championship, a reminder of the ephemeral nature of the most unpredictable of sports.
CHARLOTTE, North Carolina: A major season that began with the Masters favourite falling down stairs ended with one of the game's best young players capturing the PGA Championship, a reminder of the ephemeral nature of the most unpredictable of sports.
Dustin Johnson was the focus of the golf world on the eve of the Masters, coming off three successive victories, having ascended to the world number one ranking and for a few months an unstoppable juggernaut.
Four months later, Johnson is almost a peripheral figure and Justin Thomas is the talk of the town, though the latter barely figured in discussions on the eve of the PGA Championship at Quail Hollow which finished on Sunday.
Instead, the media was obsessed with Jordan Spieth's quest to surpass Tiger Woods as the youngest man to complete the career grand slam, while Rory McIlroy was the pre-tournament favourite, at least in the eyes of those who like to place money on the outcome.
But Spieth was never a factor at Quail Hollow, while McIlroy ended the week saying they might take an extended break in an effort to deal with pain in their back and left arm.
How do you make sense of it all? It's golf, a sport where almost every major offers a different cast of lead characters, and nobody takes the starring role more than occasionally.

“We won one of the majors,” said British Open champion Spieth, the 'we' referring to themselves and their caddie.
“I understand that's a great year in the majors. If I did this every year, I would go down as the greatest player ever to have played the game.
“Winning them is so difficult you can have a fantastic year without winning a major. Look at what Tiger (Woods) did in 2013. They won five events, including a Players Championship (but did not win a major).”
Masters champion Sergio Garcia does not need to be told how difficult it is to win a major. The former teenage phenomenon was 0-for-73 until they beat Justin Rose in a playoff at Augusta.
“I did think about am I ever going to win one?” Garcia said after putting on the prized green jacket. “I've had so many good chances and either I lost them or someone has done something extraordinary to beat me. So it did cross my mind.”
Brooks Koepka blew away the field in the final round to win the U.S. Open at Erin Hills, while Spieth produced an astonishing finish - five-under over a four-hole stretch - to edge Matt Kuchar at the British Open.
The PGA Championship, which plodded along laboriously for three days, suddenly came to life on the back nine on Sunday, with five tied for the lead at one stage before 24-year-old Thomas emerged triumphant.
Golf fans must now wait eight long months for the next major, during which time the spotlight will turn again to Irishman McIlroy and their quest to become the sixth man to complete the modern grand slam.
So who will be the next player to join the major champions club - Hideki Matsuyama? Rickie Fowler? Jon Rahm?
Maybe it will be one of that trio, but it just as likely to be someone barely on the radar right now. That's golf.

The Montreal Canadiens were a colossal disappointment in 2017-18. After winning the Atlantic Division two years ago, many expected them to at least make it back to the playoffs, but that didn't happen. Now, it seems like the team has quietly embraced a different path.
Heading into last year, the Habs were trying to be good. There was no rebuild, reset, or whatever you want to call it. That's what made the year such a disaster. But based on the offseason the Canadiens have had, it looks like this is going to be a rebuild after all.
GM Marc Bergevin wasn't willing to use that word when addressing the media on Sunday, but there's no denying that this is the situation the organization is in right now. The team clearly wasn't good enough last year and it didn't get a whole lot better this summer. Sure, they swapped Alex Galchenyuk for Max Domi, they added Joel Armia and Xavier Ouellet, but those aren't moves that'll put them over the top.
If anything, the fact that they decided to eat Steve Mason‘s cap hit in the trade they made with Winnipeg last week shows that they're willing to spend cap dollars to acquire draft picks and young players.
This is totally the right decision for the franchise. They have too many holes to fill to be a legitimate Stanley Cup contender. They need a top four left-handed defensemen, they need a number one and number two center, and they could use some added scoring punch on the wings, too. But don't give management too much credit for going in this direction because they simply had no choice.
They clearly wanted a chance to pitch John Tavares, but they aren't interested in hearing from them. They checked in with Paul Stastny, but that didn't work out either, so here we are. They've got cap space, but there's no one to give it to.
On a positive note, the Canadiens have addressed their long-term center needs by drafting Ryan Poehling in 2017 and Jesperi Kotkaniemi in 2018. Those players are likely a couple of years away, so there's no rush for the Canadiens to be good right now.
Many have suggested that this isn't a rebuild or re-tool until they get rid of Carey Price and Shea Weber, but you can still rebuild with veterans. Surround the young players on the roster with quality players that can lead through their experience and preparation.
Also, that doesn't mean that those players can't be traded a year or two from now.
The next few years should be interested in Montreal. With most teams in the division seemingly getting better, it appears as though these next few seasons will be pretty lean for Habs nation, but that might not be such a bad thing in the long run.

The Governor of Osun State , Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, has urged civil service in Nigeria to strive and be more productive and efficient in carrying out their duties.
Aregbesola who stated this at the Public Servants Award Presentation Ceremony organized to honour outstanding civil and public servants in the state honoured 170 workers in the state for being productive, efficient and diligent to duty.
Aregbesola attributed some of the challenges facing the country to lack of productivity, noting that a country's ability to develop its economy depends on how efficient and productive its workforce can be.
They lamented low productivity of workers in the country particularly in the civil and public services which according to them has affected all, particularly the citizen's national daily lives.
Aregbesola called on Nigerians, especially the ‎bureaucrats to rise to the challenge by prioritizing efficiency, productivity and competence in all they do, saying the success of a nation lies in its productivity capacity.
They said, “it is unfortunate that as big as we are, and as famous as we are as a nation, we still lack the required productivity and efficiency to succeed as a country.
“Our level of productivity as a people in Nigeria is abysmally low just as the menace has had negative impact on our economy as a nation. We have the resources but we are not productive.
“A country's ability to develop its economy is dependent on how efficient and productive its workforce can be, so our productivity as a people in Nigeria is very low and this is affecting us.
“And very unfortunately our environment typifies the low level of our productivity and we have a lot to do to improve it.”
The governor added that their drive to improve the economy of the state is not about himself, but rather because of the masses, saying the public servants are in the best position to support their administration at making life better for the people.

The heaviest snowfall in four years in Britain caused travel mayhem on Sunday, while more than 300 flights were canceled at Germany's busiest airport and a ferry ran aground at the French port of Calais.
Hundreds of air passengers were stranded in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital, as well as Britain, and many took to Twitter to complain.
About 330 flights were canceled by 5pm after heavy snow and sub-zero temperatures struck the region around Frankfurt Airport, a spokesperson for airport operator Fraport told reporters.
The airport — Germany's largest air hub and the home base for major carrier Lufthansa — had been scheduled to handle a total of 1,260 flights over the day.
Duesseldorf Airport was also forced to close for four hours during the afternoon, news agency DPA reported.
Meanwhile, trains were delayed, redirected or canceled across western North Rhine-Westphalia state.
In Britain, Birmingham Airport, which serves the country's second-biggest city, suspended flights for all of Sunday morning, as staff worked to clear the runway of heavy snow.
The airport typically handles about 30,000 passengers and 200 flights a day in December.
It diverted 11 flights elsewhere and expected to cancel more than that, a spokesperson said.
London's Luton Airport closed its runway for two hours before reopening at about 11:30am to departing aircraft, a spokesperson said.
It had opened to incoming flights by early afternoon.
One frustrated traveler described the airport as “like a war zone.”
Police forces in worst-hit Wales and central England urged motorists not to travel unless “absolutely necessary” as they dealt with surging calls.
There had been road incidents “all over the place,” a spokesperson for the Highways England agency said.
The flurries continued to fall into the afternoon, threatening to block roads.
Swathes of Britain were hit by the snowfall, particularly in central and western regions, according to the official weather service.
Sennybridge, in Brecon Beacons National Park in Wales, topped the records with 30cm, while Coleshill, close to Birmingham, received 10cm, it reported.
Light snow and sleet fell through the morning in London, leaving Northolt, on the outskirts of the capital, with a covering of 2cm, the Met Office said.
“We've gone through the worst of it,” office spokesperson Oli Claydon said in the early afternoon.
Most areas affected would have a “bright, sunny start to Monday,” they added.
The last time Britain saw this much heavy snow nationwide was March 2013, and during the winter of 2010, Claydon said.
In France, a ferry with more than 300 people on board ran aground in high winds in Calais, interrupting traffic in one of Europe's busiest passenger ports, but causing no injuries.
Having been stranded for several hours, the P&O vessel was secured and passengers were able to disembark after they were given food and drinks.
The ferry, The Pride of Kent, ran aground at about noon after it hit a gangway while making to leave for Dover in southeast England.
Five tug boats were used in the operation to free the vessel, as winds gusting at up to 110kph made the task difficult.
Elsewhere in France, 32 departments were placed on orange alert with winds of more than 100kph forecast in some areas.
In the northern Pas-de-Calais and Nord regions, about 20,000 homes were without electricity due to gale-force winds, power provider Enedis said.
Alfie's parents barrister, Paul Diamond has told a High Court hearing the tot should be allowed to be transported to Bambino Gesu hospital as they can survive for a significant amount of time without life-support.
An air ambulance is said to be ready at Alder Hey hospital to take Alfie to Italy for further treatment.
But Alfies' parents need approval to remove them from care at the Liverpool children's hospital from the High Court.
Bambino Gesu is also ready to fly a respirator out to Alfie should they not be able to be transported straight away.
The Vatican owned hospital also confirmed their team is ready to leave on a plane provided by Defence Minister Roberta Pinotti.
Hospital president Dr Mariella Enoc said they were ready to receive Alfie.
Gianluigi Buffon slammed “false gossip” for trying to destabilise Juventus amid reports of a falling out with teammate Medhi Benatia.
Italian media had blamed Benatia for failing to mark Kalidou Koulibaly as the Napoli man scored the only goal in Sunday's game, trimming Juve's lead atop Serie A to one point.
That came after Benatia conceded the controversial penalty that allowed Real Madrid to eliminate Juventus in the Champions League quarterfinals.
But despite reports claimed Buffon got into an argument with the Moroccan defender, they rubbished reports of a bust-up on Tuesday.
“It's the kind of gossip, patently invented, that comes after the defeat of teams like Juventus who don't have an Achilles heel,” Buffon told Juventus TV. “They try to destabilise the environment and undermine the certainty and the union of the group.
“No-one, at least in my 17 years at Juventus, is allowed to point the finger at someone and blame an error for a defeat. What's more, as long as I'm captain of this team that will never happen.
“I'd like to add that Medhi is an extremely respectful lad and that he's tied to our cause with an education and way of being in an exceptional group.
“I'm sorry to be forced to point it out, but I have to because in the face of news which is, if not defamatory at least false, I think a clarification is needed to protect the group and Medhi, who is a splendid lad.”
Juventus are still in pursuit of a seventh straight Serie A title, and Buffon said their one-point edge could prove crucial.
“We've dropped five very important points in recent days, but we're still first with a very small advantage,” Buffon added. “There are 20 days to go, in which we'll have to return to the pitch with ferocity and sporting brutality and to be united.
“The match with Inter [on Saturday] is a decisive one, but the ones with Bologna, Roma, and Verona will be too and then there's the Italian Cup final.
“If not we'll play into the hands of our opponents and those who, in our few moments of difficulty, have always tried to create problems with ill-founded news, without ever succeeding.”
TORONTO (AP) — At almost the halfway mark, Auston Matthews is on pace to finish with one of the best rookie seasons in NHL history.
The Toronto Maple Leafs' 19-year-old star scored twice, including the overtime winner, in Sunday's Centennial Classic and leads all first-year players with 20 goals and 32 points through 36 games.
The No. 1 pick of the 2016 draft is on pace for 46 goals, a mark reached by only six rookies in NHL history — Alex Ovechkin the most recent in a mostly Hall of Fame group that includes Teemu Selanne (76), Mike Bossy (53), Wayne Gretzky (51), Joe Nieuwendyk (51) and Blair MacDonald, who was 26 years old when they tallied 46 for Edmonton.
Matthews accomplishing the feat might be more impressive.
Everyone on that group, save Gretzky, was older than Matthews as a rookie.
And Matthews is performing in an era when the goalies are much better and scoring is down substantially.
When Selanne tallied 76 goals for the Winnipeg Jets, for example, teams were averaging 3.63 goals per game with an average save percentage of .885.
Now, the average is 2.73 goals per game with an average save percentage of .914.
Matthews isn't doing most of the scoring on the power play as Ovechkin did with Washington, when power-play opportunities rose substantially amid rule changes following the 2004-05 lockout.
The Russian winger scored 21 of their 52 goals with the man advantage, while adding 28 at even strength.
Ovechkin finished with more than 450 minutes of power-play time. Matthews is on pace for just over 220 with clubs averaging almost three fewer power plays per game.
Matthews is on track for the second-most prolific rookie scoring season at even strength.
He's on pace for 39 even-strength goals, which would trail only Selanne's 52. The Great One had 37.
Eric Lindros, also age 19 for Philadelphia in the '92-93 season, scored 32 goals at even strength in only 61 games, but did so in a league with more offense and power plays and poorer goaltending.
For Matthews to reach these stats in this era at this age, again, makes their potential feats all the more striking.
“I don't think I'm surprised anymore,” Zach Hyman, Matthews' season-long linemate, said. “When you have a shot like they do and their skillset, where he's able to get open, and when you take as many shots as they do — it's hard to get that many shots and he's able to generate tons of shots.
“With their shot, he's going to score a lot of goals.”
Matthews, to that point, is again heading toward mostly uncharted waters in terms of the number of shots, averaging 3.7 per game and on pace for more than 300.
Only four rookies in NHL history have had that many shots in a season: Ovechkin with a record 425, Selanne at 387, Dale Hawerchuk at 339 and Brian Leetch at 308.
Matthews doesn't seem to be overly lucky either. He's scoring on 15 percent of their shots, a fairly sustainable number.
“He's got a skillset that allows them to do things that a lot of other people can't do,” defenseman Morgan Rielly said. “But on top of that he's got a good brain, they work hard and he's been playing with good teammates.”
Perhaps seeking to calm the growing hype, Maple Leafs coach Mike Babcock noted that how a Matthews-led line struggled Sunday at points against Detroit's top unit.
Henrik Zetterberg's line struck for three goals when Matthews was on the ice, including the game-tying tally from Anthony Mantha with 1.1 seconds remaining in regulation.
Despite that, Matthews finished at almost 50 percent puck possession.
The Arizona-born center is struggling in the faceoff circle, among the league's worst at 44.2 percent, following a 41 percent performance against the Wings.
Still, Babcock has started matching Matthews against top lines in recent weeks, an uptick in their responsibility for the Leafs.
Babcock protected Matthews in the early months this season by starting them in the offensive zone as much as possible, often against lesser lines and defensive pairings, but that's stopped of late.
Matthews had a 17 percent offensive zone start percentage against the Wings.
“I don't look after them at all anymore,” Babcock said.
Beyond the potentially prolific NHL marks, Matthews is also consequently on track to shatter the Leafs rookie records for goals and points; Wendel Clark had 34 goals in '85-86, Peter Ihnacak had 66 points in '82-83.
“He's just going to get better,” Babcock said. “He's going to get quicker through the neutral zone. He's going to play with more pace. He's going to understand more. He's just going to get better.”

New Delhi: The service tax ranging from 5 to 20 per cent added to bills of customers can no more be made mandatory at restaurants. On Monday, Department of Consumer Affairs said that automatic applying of a service fee is violation of fair trade practices.
Already state governments have been asked to communicate to restaurants and hotels that service charge is not mandatory but a customer may pay it voluntarily whereas an unhappy customer may not pay any service fee at all.
As per government sources, the Hotel Association of India has also confirmed that service charge is discretionary and the Department of Consumer Affairs has pressed upon making customers as well as hotel and restaurants aware about this provision in the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
The Houston Astros have acquired reliever Tyler Clippard from the Chicago White Sox for a player to be named or cash considerations.
Clippard was traded from the New York Yankees to Chicago in a seven-player deal on July 18. The 32-year-old right-hander went 1-1 with a 1.80 ERA and two saves in 11 appearances with the rebuilding White Sox.
The deal was announced Sunday night.
The Astros lead the American League with a 72-45 record. They begin a home-and-home series against Arizona on Monday night.
Clippard has a 48-41 record with a 3.04 ERA and 59 saves in 11 years in the majors. They made the NL All-Star team with Washington in 2011 and 2014.
The White Sox have the worst record in the AL at 45-70.
Sabathia hopes to come off DL this weekend
CC Sabathia hopes to come off the disabled list as soon as they are eligible Saturday.
The Yankees left-hander threw a bullpen session before Monday's Subway Series opener against the New York Mets and said their right knee felt much better.
“I was cutting it loose at the end,” they said. “Very encouraged.”
Sabathia left a start at Toronto in pain last Tuesday with knee inflammation. The following day they had cortisone, platelet rich plasma and Synvisc injections.
They threw about 30 pitches Monday and plans to throw another bullpen in a few days.
“A big difference from where I was last Tuesday,” they said.
Sabathia is 9-5 with a 4.05 ERA in 19 starts. They pitch with a brace because of the knee, which was repaired with surgery in July 2014 and again last October.
Before last week, they had not had pain injections since the operation last fall. They said additional shots might be necessary this season.
With Sabathia and right-hander Masahiro Tanaka on the disabled list, right-hander Luis Cessa was recalled from Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to start against the Mets on Monday and left-hander Caleb Smith was optioned to the Triple-A farm team.
Etc.

HP CEO Don Weisler said Steve Fieler, the company's new CFO, has been "in our succession planning for a very long time."
HP named Steve Fieler chief financial officer, replacing Cathie Lesjak, effective July 1. Lesjak is becoming chief operating officer on an interim basis ahead of their retirement in early 2019, the company said.
“Having worked with Steve over many years, I have great confidence in their ability to propel us forward and continue to drive profitable growth,” Chief Executive Dion Weisler stated.
Weisler said Fieler has been “in our succession planning for a very long time.”
Fieler currently heads HP's treasury and corporate finance functions. An 11-year veteran of the company, they were CFO for HP Software before they left in 2014 to become finance chief of Proteus Digital Health. They then returned to HP in January 2017, the company said.
Lesjak, who joined Hewlett-Packard in 1986, is credited with helping HP reinvent itself following its 2015 split, when Hewlett-Packard divided into HP and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise.
“Cathie deserves tremendous credit for helping drive our performance, growth, and reinvention,” Weisler said. “She is a best-in-class leader with incredible commitment to delivering shareholder value and has done an extraordinary job assembling a world-class team. I'm grateful for their continued support and leadership in the COO role.”
Lesjak, who was named a CFO to Watch in 2017, replaces COO Jon Flaxman, who died in March after 36 years with the company.
The executive moves were announced as HP raised its annual forecast. The company reported second-quarter net revenue of $14 billion, up 13% from a year ago. It raised its full-year forecast, helped by strong demand for notebooks and desktops, where revenue rose 14.5%.
According to research firm International Data Corp., HP had 22.6% of the market for global PC shipments in the first quarter. Revenue from its printing business was up nearly 11%, helped by its acquisition of Samsung Electronics' printer business last year.
Analysts had been predicting revenue of $13.57 billion.
Crop Production Clinics at Gering and other locations across Nebraska in January 2018 sponsored by Nebraska Extension will provide valuable information to help crop producers and agribusiness professionals improve their profitability and sustainability.

BEAUTY: Campaigners have targeted modelling contests such as Miss England
Within days of darts and Formula 1 pit girls being axed by sports bosses, campaigners targeted modelling contests such as Miss England.
They claim they are “sexist” and “demean” this taking part. The killjoys' demand sparked outrage from thousands of women who enter the Miss England competition every year.
Carina Tyrrell won the contest in 2014 and finished in the top five at Miss World the same year – while they were studying medicine at Cambridge University.
Speaking last night Carina, 28, said they believe that beauty pageants “empower” women to grow in confidence.

In addition to Carlos Arthur Nuzman's provisional suspension, the Swiss-based IOC also suspended the Brazilian Olympic Committee and froze all IOC payments to the body. The IOC said Brazil's athletes would not be affected, allowing them to compete in the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea.

OXON HILL, Md. (AP) — Minority coaches like Clemson co-offensive coordinator Tony Elliott are getting help from the NCAA in their pursuit of head coaching positions.
The NFL's Rooney Rule compels pro teams to interview minority candidates for head coaching jobs, but college football as a public entity can't institute something similar. Instead, the NCAA is putting some of its rising candidates through its Champion Forum to better prepare them for the interview process.
It is an effort to increase the diversity in the Power Five conferences and across the country.
Minorities make up only 19 percent of Division I head football coaches and less across the Power Five conferences. In contrast, 61 percent of Division I players are minorities.
The Champion Forum has helped Penn State's James Franklin, Vanderbilt's Derek Mason, Stanford's David Shaw and others get head jobs with the aim of pushing along the next generation.
Whether you're a daily weed smoker, a part-time user, or never touch the stuff, you've still heard the term 420. This code for cannabis has become commonplace throughout our culture, but most people don't know that it's origins can be traced back to the Bay Area.
The Waldo's were a group of teens attending San Rafael High School. As the story goes, they were given a treasure map to track down a large crop of weed that had been planted by a member of the coast guard. Each day the Waldo's would meet at 4:20pm to go searching for the plants. The 420 code spread among their friends, then throughout the school, then throughout the world. Waldo Steve and Waldo Dave stopped by Kevin Klein Live this morning to relive the origins of the phenomenon.
“We weren't stupid stoners. We were seekers. We were guys who wanted adventure,” reminisced Waldo Dave. “It turned into a secret code that we could use in front of our parents, teachers, cops, whatever and they never knew what we were talking about.”
Waldo Steve was quick to mention that the 420 term evolved from an earlier code phrase. “There's a statue on the San Rafael campus of Louis Pasteur, the chemist.” “All day long, we'd see each other in the hallways, we'd smile and nod and say ‘420 Louis'. “Eventually we just dropped Louis and we'd just look at each other and go ‘420'”.
Their story is fascinating – like Dazed and Confused meets The Goonies. Listen to the full interview to find out what the Waldo's think about other people claiming they created 420, how they got a beer from Lagunitas named after them, and whether being a 420 founding father has ever gotten them laid.

Botswana Sectors of Educators Trade Union (BOSETU) leadership held a four day workshop in Selebi Phikwe where members were grilled on a number of issues.
Teachers turned into students as presenters schooled them on topics ranging from Leadership, Work Ethic, Management and Supervision,Public Service Act and Finance.
The selected teachers are expected to then impart the acquired knowledge to other teachers, in a drive by BOSETU to change mindsets and empower educators.
In their presentation on leadership, BOSETU Vice President Mogomotsi Motshegwa said every person has an inborn ability to lead, but such characteristics must be developed and nurtured to increase a person's effectiveness. Motshegwa stressed that success in any effort is determined by the quality of leadership.
“Individuals may have different value systems and management abilities but influencing human behavior is the essential and ultimate result. Leadership is about the capacity to influence human behaviour,” said Motshegwa.
Urging the attendants to be exemplary leaders, Motshegwa said it is important for leaders of any organisation to acknowledge its weaknesses and strengths.
“Deliberate decisions should be made to develop and empower all involved in the running of the organisation,” they said.
They said the starting point for every leader is to cultivate the right attitude. Motshegwa said attitude is the only distinction between a leader and a follower.
“People read and respond to a leader's prevailing attitudes, not what a leader says or which strategies they put forward,” Motshegwa told their attentive class.
BOSETU is expected to hold workshops of this nature in different regions in their spirited efforts to transform education and empower teachers.
By Ghaith Abdul-Ahad / The Guardian, MOSUL, Iraq
Every day, early in the morning, the former missile scientist would leave their house in the Iraqi city of Mosul. Riding buses, or on foot — they could no longer afford gasoline — they would call on friends, check on their mother or visit their sister's family. Sometimes they would hunt for cheap kerosene, or try to score contraband books or cigarettes. Most often, they would meander aimlessly — a traveler in their own city.
In the evening, they would sit at their old wooden desk, bent over their notebook, recording the day. Most of what they wrote was banal: the price of tomatoes, a quarrel with their wife — but they also wrote their observations of the remarkable events unfolding in Mosul.
“I must live this moment and record it,” one entry reads, from August 2014, two months after the fall of the city. “We live like prisoners serving long jail sentences. Some of us will come out having finished reading dozens of books. Others will be devastated and destroyed.”
By the time they stopped writing, they had filled five volumes. They are the handwritten diaries of a city under occupation and a chart of how the Islamic State group tried to live up to its name — by running a city.
In the early days of June 2014, the new gunmen were broadly welcomed in Mosul. Unlike the brutal and corrupt Iraqi army, they were polite. They guarded public buildings, prevented looting and dismantled the concrete barricades that choked the city.
“There were no more car bombs, no clashes and no IEDs [improvised explosive devices],” the scientist wrote. “Mosul is at peace finally. They control the streets and people are awestruck. They allow people to leave Mosul, and schools are teaching government curriculums.”
There was some confusion regarding their identity. Were they Sunni tribal revolutionaries? Baathist officers from former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein's old army? Jihadist militants like al-Qaeda? These different groups had been a fact of life ever since the US-led invasion in 2003. For years, the factions had vied for power in Mosul, seeking legitimacy by waging a ruthless urban guerrilla war — first against the US occupiers, then subsequent Iraqi governments.
Indeed, some were already acting as a kind of shadow government — “taxing” businesses and extorting a percentage from every municipal contract. Those who failed to comply were often kidnapped and shot.
“We paid them a percentage of every contract for a decade,” said Azzam, an electrical engineer at the department of energy. “Eight percent. The head of our directorate would get a phone call from them before every bidding process. They chose who would win and who got appointed to what job. A third of all new vacant positions were set them. No one dared to disobey. Those who didn't pay were kidnapped. Every government institution was infiltrated, even the police.
“When Mosul fell, they appeared on the surface,” Azzam said.
Two days after the fall of the city, one of Azzam's colleagues came to work dressed in an Afghan shalwar-kameez, and introduced themselves as the new supervisor for the Islamic State.
All of the Islamic State group's previous victories paled in comparison to the capture of Mosul, one of the biggest defeats in the history of Iraq: the fall of its second city, the rout of 50,000 soldiers and police officers, and the capture of hundreds of tonnes of weapons, equipment and armored vehicles.
As healthcare costs continue to rise Oklahoma will soon become the first state allowed to negotiate with drug-makers if their medicine doesn't work.
In March, the Oklahoma Healthcare Authority submitted a state plan amendment proposal to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Last week they announced that they have received the go-ahead to start a program asking drug companies for reimbursement if a drug doesn't help patients.
“In essence, this means that if a drug does not perform as claimed, the manufacturer will rebate the cost of the drug or another negotiated amount. For example, if a drug claims to keep people out of the hospital and doesn't, the manufacturer may be liable for the cost of the hospitalization,” said OHCA Pharmacy Director Nancy Nesser.
According to OHCA drug companies won't be required to take part in the program. The agency has initiated talks with 20 companies of which 10 are currently actively engaged in discussions or are in contract negotiations.
John Carpenter has been pretty busy lately recording music and going out on tour. He's apparently been so busy that they claim that they haven't seen any of the new horror movies. The statement seems kind of odd coming from one of the most legendary directors in the horror genre, but maybe that's what makes them a legend. They haven't directed anything since 2010's The Ward, but he's currently on board for the new Halloween sequel for Blumhouse where they serve as executive producer as well as handling the scoring duties.
In a new interview, John Carpenter was asked about the new horror resurgence. While they say that they keep up with the big Academy Award movies since they get sent screeners, they admit that he's too busy to check out the new horror movies. It's not because they don't like the genre, they instead blame the flood of new titles of all kinds of different subgenres as the reason. They had this to say.
"I was doing music for several years here, so I've been busy. I wasn't thinking about that. I've watched the movies they've sent out every year, the screeners for the Academy. I enjoy those. I get to catch up on some of the mainstream stuff. But the horror stuff, I don't. There are so many horror films being made at all sorts of levels. There's just so many of them. And I'm sure a bunch of them are really good. I just don't take the time to find out."
Jordan Peele's Get Out has been nominated for Academy Awards this year, which is a rare occurrence and though it doesn't seem that John Carpenter has seen it yet, they were very happy about the nominations. Carpenter will probably end up seeing the movie since it is nominated and there are screeners out. The director was quick to compliment Jason Blum when they learned of the Academy Awards nominations. They say.
"It's great! I tell you, that's the genius of Jason Blum. Oh, I don't know, what am I talking about? I'm happy, really happy. I think that's terrific."
The Halloween sequel is currently filming in South Carolina and though John Carpenter hasn't been spotted on the set yet, we have seen a picture of their chair. In addition, we recently received our first look at the Shape, aka Michael Myers on the set and everything appears to be running smoothly for the highly anticipated sequel. Carpenter admits that they really enjoyed what Jason Blum, David Gordon Green, and Danny McBride pitched them to get them involved with the project. Hopefully the director will find some time to check out the movie when it's released in October.
Though John Carpenter hasn't had the time to catch up on some of the newest horror movies, one can imagine that he'll at the very least check out Get, if they haven't already. Carpenter's schedule seems to be pretty jam packed at the moment while they prepare the new score for the Halloween reboot. Carpenter will be working with their son on the new score, which the director and composer is excited about. You can check out more from the interview with John Carpenter over at Rotten Tomatoes.

Good Girls is promoting a controversial four-day trip to “sex island” near Cartagena, Colombia that includes “unlimited amounts” of love throughout the depraved trip, according to the company's website.
While prostitution is legal in the South American nation, pimping is illegal.
The law also prohibits the promotion of sex tourism. It's unknown if Good Girls is breaking any laws.
Nonetheless, Good Girls Sex Resort appears to be pushing ahead with the exclusive, x-rated fantasy trip – the details of which are jaw-dropping.
Thirty guests are promised daily “sexual surprises” from 60 available women aboard a luxury yacht.
Promoters also refer to the outrageous getaway as a “drug-friendly environment,” full of girls ready to make guests “feel like a king.”
“If you have any special desires or fantasies inform the host or the girls and they will make sure to fulfill them,” the Good Girls website reads.
The U.K.'s Independent reported Friday that YouTube had pulled Good Girls' video advertising the holiday.
Commenters have questioned the veracity of the so-called trip, which apparently sets sail from Cartagena on Nov. 24.
Others have suggested an investigation into the legality of the process.
"Investigate them for sexual slavery if any of the women were forced/coerced. One never knows," a reader posted to the Daily Mail.
Another added: "I need to find out where this terrible place is, so I know to avoid it."
Others have called the company promoting the getaway as "sick" and "vile."
The pregnant wife of a man killed by a boulder that crashed through the window of their car is pleading for information. She's asking for the public's help in finding the person responsible for their husband's death.
The California Highway Patrol says someone pushed a 35-pound, basketball-sized rock off an overpass on State Route 134 in Pasadena late Tuesday.

Guadalupe Gutierrez was driving the family's Toyota westbound on the 134 when the boulder smashed through the windshield. Them husband, Christopher Lopez, 23, riding in the passenger seat, was killed. Neither Gutierrez nor the couple's 4-year-old daughter, riding in the back seat, was hurt.
They fought back tears Thursday as they asked for potential witnesses to come forward.

The sixth-generation Ford Mustang is entering its fifth year on the market and there's plenty that awaits you in showrooms if you haven't pulled the trigger yet.
Speaking of triggers, the big news for 2019 is the arrival of a new Mustang Bullitt. The car celebrates this year's 50th anniversary of the movie “Bullitt” and comes with a unique 475-horsepower version of the Mustang GT's 5.0-liter V-8. The car has also been fitted with additional performance upgrades, and naturally it can be ordered in Dark Highland Green.
Also arriving for 2019 is the Mustang GT California Special, which is inspired by the Mustang GT/CS dealer special introduced for 1968. The modern car, based on the Mustang GT, gives a nod to the original with a blacked-out grille and a stripe. It doesn't boast any extra power so matches the 460 hp of the stock Mustang GT.

Ford has also expanded the color palette for 2019. Taking a leaf out of Dodge's playbook, the Blue Oval has introduced new vintage-inspired colors including Velocity Blue, Need for Green and the Bullitt's asupervisorstioned Dark Highland Green.
Other updates include a rev-matching function for Mustang GTs equipped with a six-speed manual; a 12-speaker Bang & Olufsen audio system; and an active exhaust system for the Mustang EcoBoost.
The range starts with the Mustang EcoBoost, which is powered by a 2.3-liter turbocharged inline-4 delivering 310 horsepower and 350 pound-feet of torque. The Mustang GT sports a 5.0-liter V-8 with 460 hp and 420 lb-ft. Both models are available with either a six-speed manual or 10-speed automatic, and there are also available performance packs to further sharpen things.
2019 Ford Mustang GT Convertible California Special Enlarge Photo
At the top of the range, for now, are the Shelby GT350 and GT350R models. These come with a 5.2-liter V-8 good for 526 hp and 429 lb-ft, and manual transmissions only. Next year, a Shelby GT500 boasting over 700 hp will join the range.
Sales of the 2019 Mustang start this summer.

The Saskatchewan government is reminding people their health card need to be updated with new stickers before the new year.
Renewal packages were mailed by eHealth Saskatchewan to over 689,000 households earlier this this year. The packages included updated stickers that will renew health cards until Dec. 31, 2020.
READ MORE: Saskatchewan Health Authority launches, replacing 12 provincial health regions
Most health cards expire on Dec. 31, 2017. If an individual's health card expires, government officials said they could be billed for medical services.
People with provincial health coverage who have not received their health card renewal stickers in the mail should contact eHealth at 1-800-667-7551 or email at Change@eHealthSask.ca.
eHealth's office at 2130 11th Ave. in Regina is also open Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. CT, except on statutory holidays.
Officials said the most common reason why renewal stickers don't come in the mail is because a person has moved and not updated their address. Addresses can be updated online with eHealth Saskatchewan.
Each legislative session, we provide the Shawnee Mission area's elected officials with the chance to share their thoughts about what's happening in the state capitol. Rep. Nancy Lusk, Rep. Randy Powell and Sen. Mary Pilcher-Cook are scheduled to send updates this week. (Rep. Powell did not respond to our invitation to submit a column). Here's Rep. Lusk's filing:
Do you read Forbes Magazine? I do. I see lessons in the business stories they publish that are relevant to the school funding decision before us.
Most of their stories feature a business that was in decline or facing new challenges in the ever evolving marketplace, but despite that has managed to become rejuvenated. Those success stories almost always have two common elements: one, a new vision; and two, a significant reinvestment of capital.
For example, a recent issue of Forbes had a story about the Guittard Chocolate Company in San Francisco. Founded by the owner's great grandfather in 1868, the company was struggling. But with a new vision of using old family recipes, and new processing techniques, they are now able to make chocolate of better quality than the big guys (like Hershey's and Mars), and in quantities that the new artisan chocolate makers can't match. Today the company is profitable.
But the chocolate business remains capital-intensive. And so, the Guittard Chocolate Company plows an average of 30 percent of their profits back into the business each year!
We in the legislature face a decision this session of how to fund the state's future. It is not just about funding K-12 education, but a decision about the quality of our future workforce and the future vitality of the Kansas economy.
Why not learn from today's competitive businesses?
To rejuvenate a business it takes two things:
A Vision
A willingness to invest
Just like the Guittard Chocolate Company and other companies that are regrouping with new survival visions, our state needed a new vision to educate and equip our future workforce for survival in the global marketplace. Fortunately, thanks to the KS State Board of Education and the KS Department of Education, we now have a new vision for public education. It is called KANSANS CAN! and its goals relate to what the KS Supreme Court is seeking in the new school finance formula, and to what the new WestEd school finance cost-function study was designed to measure.
Here is some brief background: In 2014 the legislature adopted education benchmarks called the Rose standards, and directed the KS State Board of Education to “design subjects and areas of instruction to achieve the goal established by” each of the Rose standards. The Kansas State Board of Education took up this charge and implemented the Rose standards into the new state K-12 education standards, called the “Kansas College and Career Ready Standards.”
Next, Randy Watson, the Kansas Commissioner of Education, and the Kansas Department of Education conducted 287 community conversations across the state, and asked the question, “What are the characteristics, qualities, abilities and skills of a successful 24-year old Kansan?” Those conversations not only included educational professionals, but also business and industry focus groups – all of whom placed a high value on “soft skills” such as teamwork and applied problem-solving.
The feedback was translated into data, from which the KS State Board of Education developed its new vision, KANSANS CAN!, and they identified five outcomes that are tied to the Rose standards to help measure the progress toward achieving the new vision. They are:
1.Social-emotional growth measured locally
2.Kindergarten readiness
3.Individual Plan of Study based on career interest
4.High school graduation
5.Postsecondary success
This quote from the KANSANS CAN! webpage sums up the KS State Board of Education's vision:
Kansans are demanding higher standards in academic skills, as well as employability and citizenship skills, and the need to move away from a “one-size-fits-all” system that relies exclusively on state assessments. This new vision for education calls for a more student-focused system that provides support and resources for individual success and will require everyone to work together to make it a reality. Together, Kansans Can!
So, we have the vision. Do we have the willingness to invest? That is the question the Kansas Supreme Court has posed for the legislature, and the deadline for the decision is April 30th.
I like this quote of the WestEd study, “Public school funding is an investment, with upfront costs paying dividends in the form of productive citizens.” By providing universal access to a quality education, we are preparing children to become economically self-sufficient, and getting them ready for citizenship in a democratic society.

Jurgen Klopp insists Liverpool finishing in the top four remains a more realistic target than the “dream” of being Premier League champions.
Liverpool have not finished in the Champions League qualification places in consecutive seasons since the 2008 and 2009 campaigns.
Klopp could repeat that feat with another top-four finish this season, with their side looking to extend their two-point advantage over fifth-placed Tottenham at Anfield on Sunday.
“When you start a season you can dream of something and you have to make a realistic target as well,” said Klopp.
“Being champion is probably the dream – not only at Liverpool but especially at Liverpool. Because of the season City is playing that is quite difficult. Then I would prefer to be second, to be honest, if you cannot be first.
“But if you are second, third or fourth at the end of the season when you look back all three positions are good and similarly difficult to reach.
“Everybody thinks Arsenal is away but they are not. In one matchday if one of us is losing and Arsenal winning, then they are five points [behind]. Tottenham is behind all of us in the Champions League position at the moment, so [top four] is for sure a success.”
While Liverpool sold Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona for £146m in January, Tottenham have managed to keep hold of their core group of players.
Kyle Walker's move to Manchester City last summer remains the only major departure, and Klopp admits they are envious of Spurs' ability to retain their top assets.
“I can only say with all the respect that Tottenham is a really interesting project. I don't know too much about Tottenham, about their circumstances, but obviously the group wants to stay together. That is another good thing,” said Klopp.
“Harry Kane is still there, the whole world is going nuts obviously transfer wise and I think if someone has too much money or more than enough then it would make sense to ask, ‘Don't you want to play for our team?'  They are obviously at an outstanding level since I was in England.
“Dele Alli – not the same season as last season but still the highest quality – [Christian] Eriksen constantly and [Heung-min] Son really good. They are just a good side and they are still together.
“The whole world buys players from everywhere but no one buys one player from Tottenham. Maybe they don't want to go. You can imagine working together helps a lot.
“With these players and their age group, the players are closer to 20 than 30, so that is a very interesting project.”

You can read more about the game below - we definitely think it's worth a look if you're into Fortnite or PUBG.
If you've ever taken a deep-dive into your family's past to learn more about where you might have come from, how your family got to be the way that it is, or where it is, you know that it can be pretty interesting stuff. And genealogy TV shows like Who Do You Think You Are? and Finding Your Roots have taken that process and added your favorite celebrities to the mix, because they too want to know more about who they are and where they came from. There are a number of celebrities you didn't know are actually distantly related, as well, which can make the process and stories even more intriguing.
In some ways, it might make sense that famous people would be related to other famous people, but these aren't mothers and daughters, fathers and sons, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, or siblings. These celebrities are more distantly related, but related all the same, you may just not have ever known it before. Some celebrity connections can be quite surprising — this isn't the Franco brothers or Rashida and Quincy Jones. From Justin Bieber to Hilary Duff, Madonna, and more, some of the celebrities that are actually distantly related are people you'd never expect.
1 Kate Middleton, Dakota Fanning, & Elle Fanning WPA Pool/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images, Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images The Duchess of Cambridge and the Fanning sisters are very, very distantly related, but they are still related. Middleton, Dakota, and Elle Fanning are 21st cousins, experts from Ancestry told People. The three share a common ancestor in King Edward III of England.
2 Al Roker & Lenny Kravitz Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images, Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images Roker confirmed on the TODAY show that they and Lenny Kravitz are related — their grandfathers were cousins. Who knew?
3 Bernie Sanders & Larry David Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images News/Getty Images, David McNew/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images Larry David has portrayed Bernie Sanders multiple times on Saturday Night Live because the two look quite a bit alike, but they didn't know that they were, in fact, related until later on. When David appeared on PBS's Finding Your Roots, they learned that they and Sanders are, in fact, cousins, as Time reported.
4 Prince Charles & Ralph Fiennes Charles McQuillan/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images, Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images The Prince of Wales and actor Ralph Fiennes, who's played many royals over the course of their career, are actually related. Us Weekly reported that Prince Charles and Fiennes are eighth cousins, sharing a connection to James II of Scotland.
5 Madonna & Hillary Clinton Mike Coppola/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images, Mike Coppola/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images Pop legend Madonna and Hillary Clinton might not seem to be that much alike, but they're actually related. The Washington Post reported that a Washington-based genealogist named William Addams Reitwiesner found that Madonna and Clinton are 10th cousins, but declined to comment on their research to the Post directly.
6 Matt Damon & Ben Affleck Craig Barritt/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images, Emma McIntyre/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images Hollywood best friends Matt Damon and Ben Affleck aren't just friends, they're also related. E! reported that research from the New England Genealogical Society found that Damon and Affleck share an ancestor named William Knowlton Jr., who settled in Massachusetts sometime around 1630.
7 Ryan Gosling & Justin Bieber Samuel de Roman/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images, Stuart Franklin/Getty Images Sport/Getty Images In a different article, E! reported that Ancestry experts found that famous Canadians Ryan Gosling and Justin Bieber are 11th cousins once removed. Bieber is also related to some other pretty major Canadian superstars as well.
8 Kit Harington & Rose Leslie Stefania M. D'Alessandro/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images, Andrew Toth/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images They may be newlyweds, but Game of Thrones co-stars Kit Harington and Rose Leslie are also actually (very, very) distantly related. An Ancestry blog post noted that Harington and Leslie share a common ancestor in King Charles II, who restored the British monarchy after the British Civil War.
9 Justin Bieber & Avril Lavigne Phillip Faraone/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images, Jag Gundu/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images Not only is Justin Bieber related to Ryan Gosling, but they're actually both related to Avril Lavigne as well. As the asupervisorstioned article from E! noted, Bieber and Lavigne are actually 12th cousins. Celine Dion is also related to this crew, which just makes this story all the more interesting.
10 Emily Blunt & Stanley Tucci Christopher Polk/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images, Emma McIntyre/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images Emily Blunt and their The Devil Wears Prada co-star Stanley Tucci aren't just co-stars, they're family. Blunt invited Tucci to their 2010 wedding to actor John Krasinski, which is how Tucci met their wife — Blunt's older sister Felicity, E! reported in a separate article.
11 Robert Pattinson, Prince William, & Prince Harry Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images, WPA Pool/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images BBC America reported that Ancestry found that Robert Pattinson is actually related to several famous people, including Vlad the Impaler and Princes William and Harry. Pattinson and Princes William and Harry are distant cousins.
12 Hilary Duff & Queen Elizabeth II Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images, Chris Jackson/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images E! reported that a genealogy study found that Hilary Duff and Queen Elizabeth II are 18th cousins, sharing a connection to King Edward III. Duff is reportedly the closest American celeb related to Them Majesty the Queen.
President Uhuru Kenyatta wants the Asset Recovery Agency to move with speed and recover money and assets bought looted public funds.
In an apparent reference to the ongoing cases involving over 40 suspects in the 9 billion shillings National Youth Service (NYS) scandal, the President warned public officers that the government will spare no effort in recovering the stolen public money and ensuring that those found culpable are prosecuted.
The NYS 9 billion shillings scandal, the over 1.2 billion shillings National cereals and Produce board, Kenya Power and the Kenya pipeline are the latest scandals that have left the country reputation literally limping.
However, it is the speed at which the investigation and prosecution agencies have handled the cases that have endeared Kenyans at least for now.
Get breaking news on your Mobile as-it-happens. SMS ‘NEWS' to 22163
24 suspects among them Public service principal secretary Lillian Omolo and NYS Director general Richard Ndubai are cooling their heels in various police custodies in the city over the NYS scam after the Anti-corruption court set Tuesday next week as the day to decide whether they will be released on bail.
But the Head of state wouldn't hear none of it going by their tough stance Wednesday on corrupt individuals.
Speaking in Jacaranda grounds in Embakasi, President Kenyatta said the culprits will be prosecuted and jailed.
The Head of State said the Government will recover all resources stolen from Kenyans through corruption schemes.
They cautioned Kenyans from using tribal sentiments to defend individuals caught in the web of corruption.
TheAnti-corruption court has in the meantime ordered 30 suspects in the NYS scandal who are still at large to present themselves at the Directorate of the criminal investigations by Thursday.
Uber Technologies will re-start its ride-hailing business in Finland on Wednesday after a one-year pause, it said, seeking to benefit from the country's transport law reform.
HELSINKI: Uber Technologies will re-start its ride-hailing business in Finland on Wednesday after a one-year pause, it said, seeking to benefit from the country's transport law reform.
The U.S. company has come under pressure from traditional taxi drivers and regulators across Europe, who accuse it of unfair competition and skirting traditional licensing rules.

In Finland, Uber was deemed legal provided its drivers held valid taxi licences, but the company has been the target of police investigations and drivers have been ordered to give up their earnings to the state for not having valid permits.
An overhaul of transport legislation came into force on July 1, removing a cap on the number of taxi licences the government issues in a year and fare restrictions, while creating a legal framework for apps such as Uber.
The company will relaunch its uberX and UberBLACK services on Wednesday afternoon in the wider capital region, including Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa and Kauniainen.
"Drivers who have been fully licensed under the new regulations will now be able to help hundreds of thousands of Finns get around at the touch of a button," Uber Nordics general manager Joel Jarvinen said in a statement.

"We hope that other countries, where local people are not currently able to use apps like Uber either to get around or to make money on their terms, will soon follow suit."
Jarvinen said more than a quarter million people in the Helsinki area have opened the Uber app since August even though the company was not operating.

Via Air travelers to and from the Greenbrier Valley had a rude awakening this week when it was announced that their flights had been cancelled.
On Tuesday, Via Air began cancelling flights in and out of the Greenbrier Valley Airport (GVA). The only two flights in and out of GVA were cancelled Wednesday, and one was cancelled on Thursday. The remaining Thursday flight had been combined with another flight serving the Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport in Virginia, meaning that passengers flying into GVA would have a layover at the Shenandoah airport instead of aboard the nonstop flight from Charlotte that they'd paid for.
Via Air provides Essential Air Service to GVA utilizing one 50-passenger jet. This week, said Greenbrier Valley Airport Director Stephen Snyder, Via opted to take that jet out of service at GVA in order to provide a charter flight from Colorado to Montana.
And, they said, this is not the first time. On the Monday after Thanksgiving, Nov. 28, Via cancelled flights in and out of GVA. Snyder said they tracked the aircraft and discovered it was carrying a private charter from Nassau, Bahamas, to the United States.
Via just began providing air service to GVA in October after Snyder and the Greenbrier County Airport Authority opted out of a contract with Silver Airways. Snyder had campaigned to cancel Silver Airways' contract with GVA due to a pattern of late and cancelled flights, lost luggage and generally poor customer service.
When the Essential Air Service contract was put up to bid, Via Air came back with a flight schedule that Snyder and the Greenbrier County Airport Authority found attractive – 12 nonstop flights to and from Charlotte per week with no lulls in service during the winter months.
When Via began flying out of GVA, it did so with much fanfare including a rollout deal where passengers could fly to Charlotte for under $10 for the month of October. But, the deal quickly soured as Via began cancelling flights during some of the heaviest travel times of the year: Thanksgiving and Christmas. Snyder, like their GVA customers, is not happy about it.
“I'm downright angry about it,” Snyder said. “The owner (of Via Air) has clearly placed those other customers ahead of the Essential Air Service route.”
Snyder said they spent all day Wednesday fielding complaints from angry travelers and in conference calls to the Department of Transportation (DOT). They have also reached out to the offices of Senators Joe Manchin and Shelley Moore Capito and Congressman Evan Jenkins.
“I will use every single tool at my disposal to make (Via Air) compliant, safe and on time,” Snyder said. “We will not be taken for granted.”
Not only are they not honoring their contract with the DOT, they are directly negatively affecting the local economy, Snyder said. Via Air has contracts with airport in Beckley, Parkersburg, Clarksburg and here, at the GVA.
“That's half of the commercial service in West Virginia,” Snyder said. “Other airports have had this same problem. Some of them have pulled jets for maintenance – which I support – but there has been a general lack of availability.”
Via Air receives an annual subsidy of $4,731,866 to provide GVA with Essential Air Service. Snyder said that the subsidy is paid on a per-flight basis by the DOT. When they cancel their flights, they don't get paid, Snyder said, but, they noted, they're getting paid by their private charters instead.
“If Via performed what the Department of Transportation expected them to perform, we wouldn't be having this conversation,” they said.
Meanwhile, Snyder said they offer their deepest apologies to customers whose flights have been cancelled.
“I will not sleep until this problem is resolved. I promise this,” they said.
It is recommended that customers who are flying in and out of the GVA contact the airport directly at 304-986-4000 ext. 8905 for the most up-to-date flight information.
Snyder also recommends filing a complaint with the DOT if your flight has been cancelled by Via Air. The customer service phone number for the DOT is 202-366-2220 or you can go to www.transportation.gov/airconsumer to file online.
The Mountain Messenger reached out to Via Air for comment, but did not hear back from them as of press time.

The May 1 Action Alliance on Monday announced that an appeal for a referendum on workers' rights and wage increases are to be the focus of the Workers' Day march in Taipei on Tuesday next week.
The annual march is to begin on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office Building and proceed to the Legislative Yuan a few blocks away, said the alliance, which is comprised of trade unions.
The focus of this year's event is to be “opposition to overwork and demanding a referendum on higher wages and workers' rights,” it said.
The alliance opposes this year's revisions to the Labor Standards Act (勞動基準法), which it has criticized as “backsliding” on workers' rights.
The alliance is proposing holding a referendum so the “vicious revisions” can be overturned.
Labor Rights Referendum Alliance member Hsieh Yi-hung (謝毅弘) said efforts are being made to solicit endorsement of the proposed referendum, which would also call for a new law that regulates national holidays and returns the seven holidays that were canceled as part of the amended law.
The alliance hopes that 300,000 signatures backing the referendum can be collected before the end of August so that the referendum can be held at the same time as the nine-in-one local elections on Nov. 24, Hsieh said.
Calling for the monthly minimum wage to be raised from NT$22,000 to NT$28,000 over the next three years, Taiwan Higher Education Union researcher Chen Po-chien (陳柏謙) said that the nation experienced accumulated economic growth of more than 20 percent from 2007 to 2016.
During that period, the consumer price index rose 9.1 percent, but the earnings of private-sector workers only grew 8.3 percent.
“Taiwanese workers should be given a 10 percent wage increase every year over the next three years,” Chen said. “This is no more than a basic requirement.”
DIMONDALE, Mich. (AP) — The Michigan Department of Natural Resources is seeking people who want to become conservation officers.
The 23-week training academy starts July 15 in Dimondale, near Lansing. Applications are due March 1.
The academy is the first step to becoming a Michigan conservation officer. During the academy, recruits become paid state employees.
After graduating, they become probationary officers and spend several more months training throughout the state before being assigned to one of Michigan's 83 counties.
DNR officers are certified police officers with authority to enforce all state laws. They also have unique training in areas related to the outdoors, such as off-road driving, survival tactics and first aid.

PFT PM
Here it is. You've waited patiently. (Mostly.)
Tuesday's edition of the #PFTPM podcast has interviews with three of the top draft prospects. UCLA quarterback Josh Rosen, N.C. State defensive end Bradley Chubb, and Alabama receiver Calvin Ridley.
It's all part of a 90-minute edition of the afternoon, drive-home podcast, which has plenty of other content beyond the three interviews — including questions from the @PFTPMPosse.
Those interviews and more (including a visit with Peter King) will be included in Wednesday's PFT Live. But if you want to hear the interviews now, there's only one place to get them.
Database software startup MongoDB is planning to raise $152 million at a market valuation of $1.1 billion in the latest tech IPO.
In an amended prospectus, the company, which was founded in 2007 and booked $124 million in sales for the year ended Jan. 31, 2017, said it would offer eight million shares to the public at a price range of $18 to $20. At the midpoint, MongoDB would command a fully diluted market value of $1.1 billion.
“MongoDB is the leading modern, general purpose database platform,” the prospectus said. “Our platform unleashes the power of software and data for developers and the applications they build.”
According to IDC, the worldwide database software market was $44.6 billion in 2016 and is expected to grow to $61.3 billion in 2020, representing an 8% compound annual growth rate. The company is seeking “to challenge companies like Oracle with an open-sourced, subscription-based approach to enterprise database software,” MarketWatch said.
“Legacy database vendors have historically dominated this market,” MongoDB said. “We believe this market is one of the few within the enterprise technology stack that has yet to be disrupted by a modern alternative, creating our opportunity.”
MongoDB would be the next big tech initial public offering after the successful debuts of Roku and Switch. As of July 31, it had more than 4,300 customers in more than 85 countries, compared to more than 1,700 and 3,200 customers as of Jan. 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively.
Losses have stabilized but the company has been burning through cash, spending $86.7 million in the year ending Jan. 31 and $45.8 million in the first six months ending July 31. Revenue, which mostly comes from subscriptions, has increased from $40.8 million for the year ended Jan. 31, 2015.
To encourage developer usage, MongoDB offers Community Server as an open-source, “freemium” offering. It said the software has been downloaded more than 10 million times in the last 12 months alone but warned that “Competitors could develop modifications of our software to compete with us in the marketplace.”
They also caused a stir in 2012 when they declared in a post-match interview after a game with Granada: "I'm sad and the club know why."
Juventus declined to comment when contacted by Reuters, while Real Madrid said: "Our official comments are made through our official media channels."
Real have not issued any statement on their website about Ronaldo, although in the past days they have issued statements denying reports they have made transfer bids for Paris St Germain forwards Neymar and Kylian Mbappe.
Spanish newspaper Marca suggested on Wednesday that Ronaldo is unhappy at Real because they are searching for their successor and president Florentino Perez has publicly courted Neymar, urging the Brazilian last year to come to Madrid if they want to win the prestigious Ballon d'Or award.
A cash-in-transit van burst into flames on a Durban street on Wednesday.
A car guard stationed outside a popular fashion store in Greyville‚ said they observed the van stop and burst into flames.
"There was no gunfire or anything ‚ it just burst into flames‚" the car guard said.
The security guards were not injured in the fire.
Within minutes‚ traffic was cordoned off and firefighters doused the flames.
A police officer at the scene said foul play wasn't suspected.
They said an electrical fault is believed to have caused the flames and that safety measures automatically lock down the vehicle and the contents.
The smouldering van was towed away.

Alexis Sanchez is poised to make their home debut as Manchester United aim to bounce back from a damaging defeat at Tottenham Hotspur when struggling Huddersfield Town visit Old Trafford on Saturday.
United fell 15 points behind runaway leaders Manchester City with a 2-0 defeat at Spurs on Wednesday that also saw the gap between United in second and Tottenham in fifth cut to just five points in the race for Champions League qualification.
Sanchez has yet to score in two appearances since joining from Arsenal in a swap deal that saw Henrikh Mkhitaryan head to the Emirates.
However, midfielder Juan Mata believes Sanchez's mere presence has helped raise the bar of what can be expected of United for the rest of the season.
“Alexis is a great player and I'm sure that they will help us a lot,” said Mata, who themselves has been pushed further down the pecking order by the Chilean's signing.
“His arrival is great news because a player of their level always raises the competition within the team and our competitiveness.”
United are set to be without Marouane Fellaini who was substituted against Spurs just eight minutes after they had come off the bench as a substitute.
Mourinho confirmed the Belgium midfielder has a knee ligament injury and joins defender Eric Bailly (ankle) and forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic (knee) on the sidelines.
Huddersfield have slumped to just a point above the drop zone on the back of four straight defeats, but the highlight of their return to the top flight for the first time in 45 years came in beating United 2-1 back in October.
– ‘Decisive spell' –
And Mata has warned their team-mates not to underestimate David Wagner's side even though the Terriers are winless in seven league games.
“Huddersfield are struggling to win in this start of 2018 but they already showed in our first game against them what they're capable of,” added the Spanish playmaker.
“We need to try to learn from that experience so we can make the most of our strengths and get the three points.
“We are aware that we are entering the decisive spell of the season, and I can tell you that we feel strong and encouraged to fight for as much success as possible.”
Huddersfield midfielder Philip Billing urged their team-mates not to be intimidated by the prospect of facing United's stellar names in front of nearly 75,000 people at Old Trafford.
“It's Manchester United and they have world class players but you can't think about that – it's 11 versus 11,” said the Denmark Under-21 international.
“Anything can happen in football, we beat them at home and I see no reason why we can't beat them again if we take our chances.”
Striker Elias Kachunga is still out with a knee ligament injury, whilst defender Jon Gorenc Stankovic is still short of fitness following their return from a long-term knee problem.
“It's frustrating for us at the minute but that's football, it's now that tests you as a team,” added Billing.
“Now we've got to show that we're the terrier and we've got the fighting spirit.”

The Chargers fired a head coach with an offensive background on Sunday when they dismissed Mike McCoy.
The first name to pop up in their search for McCoy's replacement does their work on the other side of the ball. Adam Schefter of ESPN reports that San Diego has requested permission to interview Patriots defensive coordinator Matt Patricia.
Patricia can speak to the Chargers and other teams over the weekend because the Patriots have the week off thanks to their top seeding in the AFC. Patricia's defense had a lot to do with getting them to that point and they finished the year with the fewest points allowed of any team in the league.
Patricia's name has also come up in relation to the Rams' head coaching vacancy as well. The Chargers are set to make their intentions regarding a move to L.A. clear in the next couple of weeks and Patricia may not be the only coach to catch the attention of both teams ahead of a potential co-habitation in the City of Angels.
ENGLAND football fans want to reward Jordan Pickford's heroics in the World Cup in the most bizarre way.
TASS/GETTY HUNGRY: A five-year-old tweet by Jordan Pickford about Nandos has gone viral
The Everton keeper, 24, was the star last night as England beat Colombia 4-3 on penalties to set up a quarterfinal clash with Sweden on Saturday. It was the first time England have ever won a penalty shootout at a World Cup, with Pickford saving well from Carlos Bacca before Spurs midfielder Eric Dier tucked home the winning spot-kick. In the wake of England's win — their first in a World Cup knockout game since 2006 — one of Pickford's old tweets has resurfaced. On October 15 2013, the then-Sunderland shot-stopper tweeted: "Think Nando's is on the cards".

LONDON: On a tennis court in London, former British number one Tim Henman is training a somewhat unusual group of candidates to become ball boys and girls for a tournament in December: dogs.
The canines try to catch tennis balls as well as sit still as Henman lists the traits they need to succeed at the tryout to become "ball dogs": "Lightning speed, endless endurance and good concentration".

The dogs are being trained for the Dec. 6-9 Champions Tennis event held each year at London's Royal Albert Hall with a host of veteran tennis names.
"Fingers crossed they will all be good enough to make the final cut and appear at this year's Champions Tennis event," Henman said.
"I'd love to play alongside them in December. The dogs' enthusiasm and desire to fetch would certainly make it even more of a fantastic spectacle and no doubt they'd get more attention than the players."
"Ball dogs" are not a novelty in tennis, with them already having appeared on court at the Brazil Open.

The dogs still have some training to do before organisers decide whether they will be working alongside the tournament's ball boys and girls.
Running for more than 20 years, the Champions Tennis event features former Grand Slam winners and numbers ones, with the likes of Pete Sampras, Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe previously taking part.
Henman and Goran Ivanisevic are among those confirmed to participate this year.

Why good people suffer
1 SHARES Share Tweet
By Fr. Bel R. San Luis, SVD
Once a distraught man knelt in front of a life-size crucifix and poured out their problems and sufferings.
They were startled when the Lord suddenly spoke from the cross: “Alright, stop crying now. I know how you feel. Let's exchange places. I'll carry all your sufferings and you hang here on the cross, 24 hours a day!
The man replied: “Err… Well… you see, Lord, I was not really serious. Thank you… Bye.”
* * *
In this “valley of tears,” we all have our own trials and adversities. The above story shows that even the Son of God underwent terrible pains and sufferings.
* * *
There's a devoted husband and father of three children. He's forty-seven years old, a respected doctor in the community and active member of the parish.
He's lying in a hospital bed wracked with intolerable pain; their days are numbered. Cancer has spread from their pancreas throughout their abdomen. There's one unanswered question in their mind and in the minds of their family and friends. That one question is, “Why?”
* * *
Why good people suffer instead of being rewarded in this life by the God they faithfully serve.
Moreover, people do get to wondering why some who seem to care nothing at all about God and religion apparently prosper, while the good and God-fearing struggle with a host of trials and sufferings.
* * *
In the first reading of this 5th Sunday in ordinary time, Job wondered, too, about why the good must suffer when they lost thousands of their cattle and “a lightning struck their sheep and servants; their seven sons and three daughters were crushed to death after a violent wind struck their house.” That was not enough. Satan struck Job with the serious ulcer from the sole of their feet to the top of their head.
* * *
Their wife, a mulier fortis, taunted them to deny their God. To which Job replied: “You speak like a foolish woman.
You have received good things from the hand of God, why should we not receive bad either?”
Their “friends” even tried to convince them that they must have committed some heinous sin that had brought on God's wrath and punishment. Job searched their heart, but could honestly find no wrongdoing.
* * *
The story of Job teaches that a good, faithful life in this world is NO GUARANTEE that you will be immune from trials and sufferings.
But the story teaches, too, that if one is faithful and patient amidst trials, they will be rewarded just like Job whose destroyed properties were restored two-fold and their children were also restored to life.
* * *
Jesus was concerned with the problem of human suffering in all its forms as shown in this Sunday's gospel. We see them curing people who were afflicted with various diseases, including the simple fever of Peter's mother-in-law (cf. Mk 1,30). But they never abolished suffering altogether.
* * *
By the way, a witty guy said that the reason why Peter nursed a grudge against the Lord, denying them three times, was because they cured their mother-in-law.
* * *
We may not be able to do healing miracles as Jesus did. But much of the world's suffering would be minimized if we would be more caring, more generous and sensitive to the feelings of our fellowmen.
* * *
ASK YOURSELF: Are you a cause of suffering to your fellowmen or are you God's instrument of healing?

Bigg Boss 11, Episode 71, 11 December 2017: Shilpa, Hiten, Priyank, Luv get nominated
Hiten hiding the truth that they saved Shilpa and not Arshi during nominations has become a major topic for discussion.
After waking up to the song Rum Whisky from the film Vicky Donor, Vikas and Hiten discuss the matter, and latter accepts their mistake. Arshi is pissed as they tell Priyank that Hiten doesn't matter to them any more just like Shilpa. Shilpa and Puneesh, too, discuss the same issue, while Shilpa says that Hiten wanted to be in the good books of Arshi and hence they didn't tell them Puneesh reveals Akash's game plan wherein they have told them that they will be with Arshi this week and next week with Shilpa.
Luv is still sulking over Hina and Priyank placing their name in the less deserving category yesterday. They have many arguments with Priyank, and Hina who wants their friendship to remain strong, becomes the mediator between them. They keep telling them to end the fight, but Luv asks Hina to nominate them if they want to. Priyank tells Hina to give Luv some more time. But, both, Hina and Priyank are not aware that this is Luv's trick.  They are doing all this for the other housemates to feel that they are having an actual fight so that they start confiding in him, and Luv says this in front of the camera. They say that they will be friends again in no time.
Luv writes a get well soon message for Hina on a tissue paper with the help of nail paint. Hina reads it and tells Priyank about it. Priyank tells them that they think that Luv has a soft corner for her, but they won't admit it because they are shy. Hina says they know that they are in a relationship. Hina and Luv start talking, and they apologise to them again, but Luv says that they feel betrayed by the two people whom they loved the most. They tell them that they are looking stupid now as they are talking to them and that they will not reconcile till the time they want to. Hina starts crying and Priyank asks Luv to let the bygones be bygones. After sometime, they have a change of heart and the three hug each other.
But Luv and Priyank's fight don't seem to end. Hina tries to get some information from Luv about other housemates, but they don't tell them This doesn't go down well with Priyank. The argument intensifies and they both get into a war of words and threaten each other. Hina tries to be the peacemaker, but fails. Priyank points to the camera and apologises to Luv's dad for the repercussions. These angers Luv further and they again threaten Priyank to keep their family out of it. After sometime, Luv apologises to Priyank and they accept. Hina tells both of them that they should not be fighting as people give examples of their friendship in the outside world.
The lawn area is now the grounds for the nomination task. A tree with apple shaped balloons will determine the fate of the contestants this week. Every balloon has the picture of one contestant on it. The current captain of the house, Arshi, has the authority to burst the balloon of any contestant they feel like, each time the gong rings. The ‘gharwale' have been divided into two teams: Team Red and Team Blue. Both the teams have to come up with a strategy to convince Arshi to save them by not bursting their team's balloon. Blue team has Vikas, Puneesh, Hina and Akash, while red team has Luv, Shilpa, Hiten and Priyank. The two teams have to make sure that they have more apples than the opposite team after the task comes to an end.
Hiten and Vikas decide to have some fun and try to convince Arshi to pluck Akash's apple, just to scare him, and they do exactly that. The first gong rings and they cut Akash's apple. Vikas tells Arshi to cut the apples of the red team for the next two times and they agree, but when the second gong plays, Arshi cuts Hina's apple, who is in the blue team. When the third gong plays, Arshi cuts Shilpa's apple, because they think they are a strong contender. At the fourth gong, Arshi cuts Luv's apple as they think they don't deserve to be on the show. Arshi's decision after the fifth and the final gong rings is most important as that will decide the fate of the contestants. Hiten asks Arshi to save their team but they don't and cuts Priyank's apple and therefore Luv, Priyank, Shilpa and Hiten get nominated this week for evictions. Arshi then questions Hiten for lying to her, and Hiten apologises.
Meanwhile, Akash tells the other two commoners, Puneesh and Arshi, that they want Shilpa out of the game as they are a big threat to him. On this, Arshi says that so far Shilpa got footage because of them (Arshi and Akash). Puneesh goes up to Shilpa and tells them what Akash told them and Arshi. Shilpa laughs about it and discusses the same with Hiten, who tells them that Akash has this habit of backstabbing people. Soon after, Shilpa getting irritated with Akash's touching them becomes the topic of discussion. Luv tells Akash to draw a line.
When Arshi and Akash discuss this topic while almost blaming Shilpa, Puneesh suggests Akash that they shouldn't drag this topic, because they will end up degrading their image. Hina is of the opinion that Shilpa is a strong woman and they should take a stand for herself. But when they learn that Shilpa wanted Luv to tell Akash, she's fine. Vikas says that Akash is definitely crossing the line and causing discomfort to Shilpa, while Arshi thinks that they have been doing this for 10 weeks, so why is Shilpa's raising the matter now. In fact, Arshi tries to use their point in favour of their friend, Akash, who is scared that Salman Khan may raise this issue during Weekend Ka Vaar, and they even think of a plan of saving themselves from the host's ire.
KUALA LUMPUR: The government of former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak spent years systematically obstructing probes into the alleged looting of state fund 1MDB, while also ruthlessly muzzling critics, according to current and former government officials.
They said the meddling in the investigation by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) effectively shut down local inquiries into the scandal at 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) even as five other countries, including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore, carried out their own probes.

Any suppression of the probe in Malaysia ended abruptly in May when Najib lost power in an election.
On Tuesday, Najib was arrested by the Malaysian authorities in relation to a probe into SRC International, a former 1MDB unit, according to an investigating task force. Sources close to the matter said they may face several charges.
Najib, who lost power in an election last month, has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to 1MDB and SRC. A current Najib aide declined to respond to allegations there was meddling and a cover-up.
Interviews by Reuters with a dozen current and former government officials show that the obstruction of investigators occurred on multiple levels.

One senior MACC investigator said they were convinced there was tampering with key witnesses.
The official, who declined to be identified because they are still involved in the 1MDB probe, said they felt that by the time MACC got to talk to the witnesses they had been coached on what to say or were too frightened to talk because they had been threatened.
Other witnesses couldn't be found.
"There were some witnesses who disappeared, ran abroad," and some were clearly told by officials from other government agencies to do so, said the MACC official. They didn't name these witnesses because some of them are still being sought.
Najib's office also sought to tightly control any public comment on 1MDB.
MACC is supposed to be an independent government agency that works without government interference, but three former MACC communications officers told Reuters that many of the press releases on the 1MDB probe issued by MACC were written by the prime minister's office.
And it wasn't just at the anti-corruption agency that the heat was intense.
New finance minister, Lim Guan Eng, told Reuters there was an "extensive cover up" at the ministry of finance (MOF).
"ALMOST PERFECT CASE"
Malaysia's new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad told Reuters the week before last that they hold Najib fully responsible for the 1MDB scandal and that Malaysian authorities have "an almost perfect case" against him.
As a result of an anti-kleptocracy probe, the U.S. Department of Justice has alleged more than US$4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB and that about US$700 million of the fund's money ended up in Najib's personal bank accounts.
Najib told Reuters in an interview last month they should not be blamed for any of the problems at the fund and declared they knew nothing about why hundreds of millions of dollars from 1MDB allegedly appeared in their bank account.
Some of the ways in which those looking into the 1MDB scandal had been sidelined have been known for some time.
For example, in July 2015, Najib removed the then attorney general Abdul Gani Patail for "health reasons" at a time when the official was preparing to charge Najib.
They also removed deputy prime minister Muhyiddin Yassin the same month after they had criticised Najib over their handling of the scandal.
But the intensity of the pressure that MACC faced from other arms of government is only now becoming clear.
BULLET SENT TO Their HOME
In May, about two weeks after Najib's ousting, the newly appointed head of the MACC, Mohn Shukri Abdull, recalled how their investigation into 1MDB had been blocked in 2015.
Shukri, who had been deputy commissioner at MACC until they retired two years ago, recalled how they had faced threats to their job and worse - a bullet was sent to their home in 2015. They sought and received U.S. police protection during a visit to Washington and New York because they felt they were being followed by Malaysian government agents.
"We didn't know who were the main people who were putting the pressure on MACC, but there were many of them," another MACC official said. It "was coming from all sides."
The senior MACC official also said police interfered in MACC's investigations as they closed in on a probe on how about US$10.6 million from SRC went into Najib's bank account.
They said some witnesses in that probe could not be found because they were being held at police headquarters.
Malaysian police did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
Khalid Abu Bakar, who was Malaysia's police chief from 2012-2017, has been barred from leaving Malaysia since the election. Mahathir has said Khalid would be investigated for their role in the 1MDB probe.
Khalid did not respond to a request for comment.
When asked about the sacking and transfer of officials involved in the probe, the Najib aide said the actions were to suppress a "political coup". They denied there had been intimidation.
AUDITORS IN THE DARK
A senior government source said civil servants at the MOF, which was also run by Najib, were instructed to cover up the 1MDB affair.
"Decisions were made at PMO (prime minister's office). And MOF had to find a way to hide it and figure out a way to pay for it," this person said.
Checks and balances were ignored. For example, a member of the auditor general's team who looked at 1MDB's finances in 2015 said the fund was highly secretive, and did not release all its documents and hard disks to the auditors.
Najib acknowledged in the Reuters interview that "there were certain short-term payments that needed to be done" in relation to 1MDB after the fund had become so politicised that it couldn't act on its own.
Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated as the next U.S president on Jan. 20, brings with them a high level of uncertainty for 2017, investment managers and economists say.
Following the election of Trump on Nov. 8, U.S. stocks took off, with key indices hitting multiple records highs. The Dow Jones industrial average — the benchmark index of blue chip companies — came tantalizingly close to topping the 20,000-point plateau for the first time before the rally petered out in the last trading days of 2016.
“To characterize the markets in this past year, I would say that the first three quarters have a a grind, but the last two months have been like having the fun uncle come to visit — unexpected, a bit messy and surprisingly fun,” said Sheryl Purdy, a vice-president and investment advisor at Leede Jones Gable Inc. in Calgary.
Trump campaigned on a populist message that was pro-business and protectionist at the same time, saying they would cut taxes, spend money on infrastructure, and scrap or renegotiate trade deals.
The incoming U.S. president is a “wildcard,” said Marshall Auerbach, research associate at the Levy Economics Institute at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y.
”You don't really know what he's going to do. You don't really know the extent to which we should take their protectionist threats seriously, and obviously that's going to have a significant impact on Canada if they do,” Auerbach said.
While Trump has expressed support for the Keystone XL pipeline, which the Obama administration rejected, there are other areas, such as their stance on NAFTA, and their general contrasting approach with that of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on immigration, that could bring some real problems, which could adversely affect Canada, they said.
Doug Porter, chief economist for BMO Capital Markets, thinks the big uncertainty remains in what exactly Trump will propose and what they will be able to get passed into law.
“Frankly, at this point, no one can be sure of what exactly he's going to ultimately get through Congress,” Porter said.
“There's certainly great hope in the market that's they going to bring in stimulative policies, whether that is tax cuts, some deregulation or even infrastructure spending, and that's really what's given the market quite a bit of juice in the last month or so, but he's also sounded very protectionist, and you know for Canada that's a big potential negative.”
Given Trump's behaviour so far, Purdy expects they will be “highly unpredictable and easily provoked, in my opinion.”
Focus on impact of overnight tweets
Markets will have to pay attention to Trump's ”2 a.m. tweets that have effects on publicly traded companies,” they said, alluding to a series of their social media messages that led to a battering of the share prices of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.
Purday suggested that investing strategies should concentrate on Trump policies that are voted in by the Republican-led Congress.
While the Trump presidency is expected to bring with it the unknown, money managers do see an upside.
Barry Schwartz, chief investment officer at Baskin Wealth Management, said Trump “seems to be the best pro-business president-elect that the U.S. economy has ever had, I mean as good as [Ronald] Reagan.”
For an investor buying stocks to participate in better business and a better economy, ”then the next four years may be incredible for stock market participants,” Schwartz said.

SWEDEN have secured a placed in the World Cup quarter finals against England – but who are the stunning plus ones cheering on the team?
Both teams won their World Cup last-16 games on Tuesday night, with Sweden beating Switzerland and the Three Lions beating Colombia. Striker Emil Forsberg fired home to give the Swedes a 1-0 victory, securing their side a place in the quarters for the first time since 1994. Their stunning wife and former footballer Shanga is not in Russia as they prepare to give birth to the couple's first child. But that hasn't stopped them showing support. They had posted several Instagram snaps in their yellow top, including one with their dog also wearing a shirt.

Maja Nilsson, wife of Victor Lindelof, has been to all of the Scandinavian nation's games, including last night when they posted snaps from Zenit Arena, St Petersburg, saying: “After three hours we finally made it to CAMP SWEDEN.” The blonde beauty and their pals seemed eager to get the party started early as they posed in the sunshine clinking large steins of beer before cheering on the Swedish team. Also overseeing their win was social media influencer Maja who married Manchester United defender Lindelof in Sweden last month. Maja, who hosts a podcast alongside fellow WAG Sanna Dahlstrom, shared photos of the beautiful countryside ceremony on their personal blog and Instagram, where they boast 99,000 followers.

They came under fire from some United fans when they hit out at bosses over the “disgusting” cost of executive boxes at Old Trafford. Speaking on their podcast, Livet På Läktaren (Life in the Stands), they said: “Players have the option to rent a box. “I'm not even going to tell you for how much, but a disgusting amount. If you don't buy one you're considered a loser. "But having a box is wonderful. You get your own waiter.”

KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's Youth and Sports Minister Khairy Jamaluddin has directed Sports Commissioner (SC) Zaiton Othman to lodge a police report against the Klang City International marathon organiser for holding the event without approval.
This comes after three runners were injured in a car accident during the marathon on Sunday (Dec 10).
"This is an offence under the Sports Development Act (1997) which, if convicted, be liable to a maximum fine of RM5,000, jail term not exceeding six months or both. All organisers of runs and marathons have to seek approval from the SC before applying for approval from the sports associations, the police and the local authorities.
“The police are investigating an accident after three runners were injured,” they told reporters after visiting one of the runners, Evelyn Ang Gek Suan with the commissioner at Sungai Buloh Hospital.
Khairy said the commissioner will blacklist the marathon organiser from future events.
Evelyn, 44, suffered serious injuries in the head and jaw while two other runners, Ahmad Hadafi Jus, 44, and Amiruddin Hamid,37, suffered minor foot injuries, in the accident at Batu 2, Jalan Kapar, at 4.30am on Sunday.

They were in stable condition after undergoing brain surgery to remove blood clots but remained unconscious in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
Khairy said the ministry plans to amend the Sports Development Act to make it compulsory for the organisers to apply for Sports Commission approval 90 days before the event to scrutinise their readiness and finances.
"Long before this road accident occurred, I proposed the amendment of this Act, where the fines are to be raised to RM500,000 and the prison sentences to be extended,” Khairy said.
According to the Star, a spokesperson from the marathon organiser said it had adhered to the procedures and filed all the necessary application.
“No company in the world will dare go on with such a big event without going through the relevant authorities because this concerns the safety of all participants,” a spokesperson was quoted as saying.
The spokesperson added that the organisers have been cooperating with the investigations.

“The energy in Mission makes me want to pick up my tempo,” they said. “I look forward to becoming part of the community not only by helping residents learn which shoe is right for their needs, whether they are runners, walkers, or their profession requires them to be on their feet all day, but through group runs, education and store events.”
The company is planning a late June “sneak peek” event for the new store.
The news of The Running Well Store's arrival is especially welcome in light of a rash of vacancies that have hit Mission's main business corridor. The new shop will take over the space left vacant by the departure of Vintage Mission and The Electronics Store.
Founded in 2006 as Sports Medicine Metro Walk and Run, the company has been named among the top 50 running stores in the country four times by Competitor Running Group. Gates said the company is regarded for its expertise in analyzing runners' strides and focus on proper shoe fit.

Investment trusts are a great asset to use to invest for the future. These instruments, which are structured as companies, have been around in one form or another for hundreds of years, allowing generations to build wealth and invest with ease.
One of the key benefits of investment trusts is that they can invest in instruments that are not available to most investors. Some own airplanes they lease to airlines, while others invest in secured and unsecured loans to generate an above average income for shareholders.
Some also offer UK investors exposure to overseas investments, which they may not be able to get access to themselves. The Scottish Mortage Investment Trust, for example, owns shares in retail giant Amazon.
However, while some investment trusts are attractive due to their exotic exposures, others do not have similar qualities.
Unfortunately, a number of investment trusts, particularly income trusts, own a portfolio that's broadly similar to the FTSE 100. And while these trusts may offer higher dividend yields, thanks to overweight allocations to the market's highest-yielding stocks, their fees eat up all of the additional income.
A better buy
The FTSE 100 is the UK's leading stock index, and it's also a great income investment. At the time of writing, the index supports a dividend yield of 3.9%, many times the average interest rate offered on most high street banks' savings accounts today. With this ready-made portfolio of 100 of the biggest companies in the world, it's difficult to see why investors would look anywhere else for income.
Granted, there are funds out there that offer higher dividend yields. For example, the Shires Income plc and Murray Income trusts yield 4.7% and 4.2% respectively, but after you deduct fees, the returns on offer look less appealing.
Counting costs
The iShares 100 UK Equity Index Fund, which tracks the FTSE 100, charges only 0.07% per year, with no initial fees for investors. This means that after deducting fees, investors can look forward to an annual return equivalent to 3.8% from the FTSE 100 excluding capital gains. For the sake of simplicity, I'm going to assume that the returns from this index tracker and trusts are limited to just income to make the impact of fees more apparent.
On the other hand, while Murray and Shires might look more attractive on a yield basis initially, I believe that the fees charged level the playing field. Shire charges a little over 1% per annum in fees, bringing the annual return down to 3.7%. Meanwhile, Murray charges a total of 0.8% bringing the total return down to 3.4%.
I believe that these figures clearly show that as an income play, the FTSE 100 is a much better buy than investment trusts. Trusts might look as if they offer better income potential at first glance, but after deducting fees, investors might be better off.
These numbers exclude capital gains, which could turn the tables back in the trusts' favour. However, with investment trusts you're relying on the skill of the manager to keep outperforming. With the FTSE 100, there's no such risk so you won't end up overpaying for lacklustre returns.

With the economy picking up, Taiwanese plan to spend an average of NT$31,000 during the six-day Lunar New Year holiday, with a majority opting to stay in the country, which should be a boon for the service industry, a survey by online job bank yes123 showed.
Salary increases for military personnel, public-school teachers and civil servants, and higher employee annual bonuses this year should spur domestic demand, yes123 spokesperson Yang Tsung-pin (楊宗斌) said on Thursday, adding that these should benefit the retail, hotel, entertainment and other service industries.
With a shorter holiday break this year — six days — most people are planning to spend it in the country, Yang said.
More than 90 percent of respondents plan to hand out hongbao (紅包, red envelopes containing money) to their elders or younger people, with an average budget of NT$12,377, or about 40 percent of the NT$31,000 that people are planning to spend during the holiday, the poll showed.
Fifty-six percent said they plan to give the same amount they handed out last year, while 25 percent said they might increase the amount this year.
Living expenses was one of the reasons cited by those who plan to decrease the amount they hand out, Yang said.
Others include not receiving a raise or lower bonuses, they said.
The poll also showed that the top five questions most people dread being asked during Lunar New Year gatherings are: When are you getting married; How much are you making and is it enough; Where are you working, or What is your job; How many months are you getting for this year's annual bonus; and Are you currently seeing someone?
The online survey of people who are employed but looking for other jobs was conducted from Jan. 11 to Jan. 23. It received 1,413 valid responses.

Over the weekend, North Korea signalled to the world that they may be in possession of missiles capable of striking the United States and, in turn, Canada.
There is no downplaying the seriousness of the current situation. Two intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) were on show Saturday during a military parade for the anniversary of the birth 105 years ago of the rogue states founder, Kim Il Sung.
Although by the time Monday rolled around, the news cycle had turned to focus on what happened the day after the parade, when North Korea attempted to launch a missile.
North Korea missile test fails after militaristic parade, was the headline one news site placed above their Reuters story detailing the failed launch.
Dont let that word failed make you think the issue is any less urgent. Sure, a successful launch would have been even more troubling news. But for all of North Koreas failures and for all of their theatrical rhetoric, when they move two steps back its only after moving three steps forward. They are without a doubt making progress on becoming a nuclear state that can seriously harm the West.
The ICBMs are a problem because they are exactly what they sound like  missiles that can travel across continents. While different ICBMs have different ranges, most of the models on the market can travel from North Korea to major cities including Washington, D.C., New York City, Ottawa and Toronto.
Due to the scarcity of credible information coming out of the hermit kingdom, its unknown what actually was in those ICBM canisters on parade. Maybe they have the missiles. Maybe they dont. But based on the severity of the issue, we need to include the worst case scenario in our threat assessments.
The second big issue is their nuclear capabilities. The ICBM may be able to make it over, but it wont cause harm if its not loaded with a weapon.
North Koreas nuclear program has increased in the frequency of launches and the size of kiloton yields under Kim Jong Uns leadership. Seismic readings from the most recent tests last year indicate they are experimenting with explosions about the same size as those detonated on Japan during the Second World War.
While the various failed launches tell us that North Koreas weapons are far from stable, the regime may not wait until they feel theyve perfected their approach to perform an actual launch against a live target. After all, the United States only conducted the Trinity test  the first ever nuclear detonation  two weeks before dropping the bomb on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945.
The other alarming scenario is that North Korea may be planning to launch an electromagnetic pulse over the United States. This is an atmospheric detonation that creates a waveform that destroys most electrical components within its line of sight. If its launched high enough in the sky, it can take down the U.S. electricity grid, which in turn shuts off the clean water supply, transportation networks, regional food terminals, and more. Due to how integrated our systems are, this would disable the Canadian grid too.
I write about this issue in depth in my forthcoming book, Pulse Attack: The Real Story Behind The Secret Weapon That Can Destroy North America.
The implications of a nuclear-capable North Korea is an existential threat not just to our neighbours in the south, but to Canada as well. The issue has to be front of mind for our political leadership.
Live Score, FIFA U-17 World Cup, India vs USA: Valiant India Down 0-3 Now
News18 Sports Updated:October 6, 2017, 9:45 PM IST
21:44(IST) GOAL: USA survived the scare and started a counter-attack, Carlton beat the defence and eventually put the ball in the back of the net. India is now down 0-3, but the scoreline doesn't reflect the valiant display of the Indians 21:42(IST) 21:34(IST) Nongdamba Naorem was the player who made that great effort 21:28(IST) India make two substitutions, striker Rahim Ali is on in place of Abhijeet Sarkar 21:20(IST) USA should have had a third there, Akinola had just the goal-keeper to beat but hit that over the goal post 21:17(IST) Had that gone in, the decibel levels would have gone up at the JLN stadium here in Delhi 21:13(IST) Not the luckiest of days for India on the field 21:11(IST) India are now trailing by 0-2, this had to happen, as the USA are a far superior team. It's a learning curve for these boys who will benefit from this experience 21:09(IST) strong> strong> The Indian goal-keeper has been a bright spot for India 21:05(IST) The players are back on the ground and India get a lucky break almost immediately but Aniket is unable to take advantage of the mistake. Eventually USA manage to get the ball out of their box 20:53(IST) That's half-time then and India are trailing 0-1 against a very tough USA team. Coach de Matos can be proud of their boys' efforts so far, given the wide gap between the two teams but yes they have a job at their hand in the second half. 20:46(IST) India stringing some good passes here and showing signs of intent. That was another great attack, hitting USA on the break. 20:40(IST) India on the attack and they are entering the final third of the Brazilians now with good solo runs. India will have to throw more bodies into attack in order to create problems for the American defence 20:36(IST) USA on the attack again and this time it was from the right flank but the final cross left a lot to be desired from.

The Indian mid-fielders are trying to carry the ball too far without passing and that is what is hurting possession currently 20:16(IST) It has been one-way traffic so far and as expected USA has been dictating play so far. They are creating space on the flanks and also spreading the play wide cleverly. Both the flanks have been changing the line of play pretty well, but India's defence so far has managed to stand tall. It is clear that India will have to park the 'proverbial bus' and keep defending for the 90 minutes 20:11(IST) Amarjit Singh Kiyam, the Indian captain commits a foul far outside the penalty box and USA has a free kick. Sargent hits it straight at the wall. India survives another scare 20:09(IST) Both teams haven't managed to keep possession of the ball till now.

Our correspondent Abhimanyu Sen caught up with fans outside the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium some time ago FIFA U-17 WORLD CUP: INDIA PREPARES FOR BIG DEBUT http://www.news18.com/videos/sports/fifa-u-17-world-cup-india-prepares-for-big-debut-1538849.html Load More
PREVIEW: More than 50,000 people will be present at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on the opening day of the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup on Friday, when hosts India will make their world cup debut across all age groups, male or female. The excitement is expected to touch fever pitch once the referee kicks-off the second game of the day.
The historic moment, something all of India has been waiting for and talking about, will be graced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, though they are not expected to stay for the 8 PM kick-off, which is when the Indian colts will be in action.
The Blue colts, now coached by the Portuguese Luis Norton de Matos, have travelled extensively over the last two years playing a variety of opponents in the process, and one of the teams they faced was USA, who beat them 4-0 in Goa just over a year ago.
There is no doubt that this is a very big moment for Indian football and the task on hand will be daunting.
USA have played in all the editions of this tournament previously, and with the likes of U-20 star Josh Sargent leading the attack, the task on hand only gets harder.
"It is a huge moment for India to be participating in the World Cup. But this is only the first step towards the future," De Matos warned while speaking to the media on the eve of the match.
"The players know very well what they are facing tomorrow, but football is a game where anything can happen. We have to prepare and know the strengths of our opponents and weaknesses," de Matos added.
The Indian colts will be led by the midfielder Amarjit Singh, who along with the likes of Jeakson Singh, Suresh Singh, Aniket Jadhav and Komal Thatal will be expected to shoulder the burden of troubling the US defensive line.
But more than the attack, it is the defence that will be under scrutiny. India will begin without right back Boris Singh who is carrying over a red card offence from earlier, and it is up to the likes of Sanjeev Stalin, Anwar Ali and the USA based Namit Deshpande, who will have to hold strong in front of the goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh.
"The process starts at the back and it will be very crucial to defend well. Everyone will have to defend, because that is the way to get a result," said the coach on the eve of the opening game.
"We create chances, but unlike more established teams we take more chances to find the back of the net." The need of the hour is teamwork to ensure the World Cup dream does not leave a bitter taste in the mouth.
"We have made our sacrifices and worked hard to reach this place, and now the time has come for us to go and give it our best shot," said a confident Amarjit before they head out for one final practice session ahead of the big game.
"It is essential to not panic in the game because otherwise it will be difficult to replicate the things we have done in training," the coach concluded. "USA is a very strong team in comparison to the Indian team. They have very potent attack, but we will work hard and try to make a game of it and make India proud."
USA, though will not be taking anything for granted against the hosts. "India is a very hardworking team and the home conditions coupled with the massive home support is bound to help them up their game on the day," John Hackworth noted.
One of the aspects that might be of concern to the visiting team will be the local weather conditions, but the young forward Josh Sargent very calmly dodged that bullet saying, "Last year we got used to the conditions pretty quickly and we expect the same this time as well."
"We go into the game as favourites, but we know that India are a good team who will work hard all through the game," they added.
When asked if it would be one sided affair against the hosts defence, Hackworth pointed out, "India's forward line has some exciting talent and unless we can contain them it will be difficult for us to eke out a result in our favour."
"When we played India last year, we won, but the score line is not a true suggestion or estimate of the true potential of the hosts," quipped Hackworth.
Irrespective of the result on the opening day, the much-awaited debut at the world stage is likely to be the reason, world football's 'Sleeping Giant' finally wakes up.

Keisuke Honda and Makoto Hasebe have both retired from international football following Japan's exit from the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
The Blue Samurai let a 2-0 lead slip off in their Round of 16 fixtures with Belgium before the Red Devils launched a dramatic comeback to win 3-2.
Japan captain Hasebe who has made 114 appearances for the Japanese side praised the team-mates who supported them during their career in a post on Instagram.
“Playing for the national team is different from club teams in that the players don't know when or who will be selected. So I understand I'm being self-centered by announcing this,” the 34-year-old, Eintracht Frankfurt midfielder wrote.
Hasebe played in all four games at the 2018 FIFA World Cup for Japan.
Honda who did not start a game in Russia, but came off the bench as a second half substitute in Rostov, believes the future is bright for Japan.

SHANGHAI: A Chinese technology firm embroiled in a patent dispute with US chip giant Micron said Wednesday (Jul 4) that a court had ruled in its favour and ordered an immediate halt of several Micron products in China.
According to the state-owned Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co, a court in the southeastern city of Fuzhou has ruled that Micron must stop sales of more than a dozen solid-state drives, memory sticks and chips.

The court ruling was not immediately available.
A Taiwanese partner of Jinhua, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), issued a similar statement, saying the court had issued a preliminary injunction against 26 Micron products.
The case comes amid increasing trade friction between the world's top two economies, with billions of dollars in fresh trade tariffs due to come into force on Friday.
Earlier this week, US authorities blocked a seven-year application from China Mobile to enter the domestic market, citing national security concerns.

Micron is the world's fourth-biggest semiconductor supplier by sales revenue following South Korean firms Samsung and SK Hynix and US chip giant Intel.
More than half of its net sales come from China, the Idaho-based firm said in its 2017 earnings report.
It said in June the case could "have a material adverse effect" on its business, requiring changes to its China operation.
China established Jinhua in February 2016 in a bid to make its own home-produced chips, with the firm investing 37 billion yuan that year to build a production line with technology support from UMC.
sentifi.com Channel NewsAsia - Sentifi topic widget
Jinhua said Micron's "unbridled behaviour" had caused "irreparable damage" to the firm and it will keep monitoring any other products that used Micron's chips.
Semiconductors are among China's biggest imports, rivalling oil, and have become a stark reminder of its dependence on US technology.
Earlier this year, Washington banned Chinese telecom and smartphone giant ZTE from purchasing crucial US components for seven years, threatening its survival, as punishment for breaking US export controls.
In a politically charged settlement reached last month, Washington then temporarily allowed ZTE to resume some activities while it works to meet conditions set by US officials.
A former Republican member of congress has dropped their bid for California governor, saying it's too difficult for Republicans to raise enough money for a serious campaign in the heavily Democratic state.
The Sacramento Bee reports former U.S. Rep. Doug Ose ended their campaign Monday. That's less than two months after they filed paperwork to enter the race to succeed outgoing Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown.
No Republican has won a statewide race in California since 2006.
Their exit leaves two Republicans in the contest: Assemblyman Travis Allen of Huntington Beach and business person John Cox.
Four Democrats are running: Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, state Treasurer John Chiang and former state schools chief Delaine Easton.
Ose represented the Sacramento area in Congress from 1999 to 2005.

The Pyeongchang Winter Olympics concluded Sunday evening in South Korea. The closing ceremony saw fewer athletes than the opening event 17 days ago — some Olympians have already gone home — but didn't stint on pageantry, K-pop and expressions of hope for peace between the two Koreas.

"Although parting is sad, we will remember Pyeongchang with beautiful memories. Athletes, you are true champions," said Lee Hee-beom, the Pyeongchang Olympics organizing committee president. "The seed of peace you have planted here in Pyeongchang will grow as a big tree in the not-distant future. The hope and aspirations of South and North Korean athletes together with cheerleaders will definitely serve as a cornerstone of the unification of the Korean Peninsula."

There has been a two decade battle to get a playing field at the South West corner of Pico and Fourth. That field was to provide expanded playing fields for both the crowded high school across the street and additional recreational sport options for everyone. This idea was enshrined in the Civic Center Specific Plan (2002 draft 2005 adoption) which also wisely provided for a multi-story Civic center parking garage to absorb the existing surface parking that would displace by building that field and a proposed adjacent Early Childhood Learning Center (ECLS, formerly ECEC) to be run by Santa Monica College (SMC).
Eventually that garage was built but meanwhile the ECLS started metastasizing. Its original maximum size was 12,500 sqft (25' high) with a 7,500 sqft playground plus a 50 car parking lot. In its current incarnation, now going before the Coastal Commission on October 12, it has ballooned to 20,000 sqft (40' high) and a 32,000 sqft playground with only 16 parking spaces. But more critically instead of providing its own parking spaces it took 285 spaces (55 for the ECLS itself plus 230 displaced by its footprint) in the new parking structure leaving only 217 spaces for the field. The field, when built, will displace about 430 spaces (the number of spaces may vary depending on the final field size).
ADVERTISEMENT
Thus the ECLS's grabbing too many parking structure spaces means the field has only half the spaces it needs and thus cannot be built. Not helping was the City Hall addition, which also took some 90 parking structure spaces, but even without those the ECLS parking demand would prevent the field from getting built. Because the City carelessly let the ECLS balloon up and then allowed it to start the Coastal Commission approval process, without simultaneously considering the field, the ECLS has effectively killed the playing field. The Coastal Commission will not allow parking removal for the field since public parking near the beach is part of its coastal access mandate and in June the City refused the School District's generous offer of $50 million to build a parking structure under the playing field site. Equally negligent was the City's failure to require the ECLS to provide its own subterranean parking. The College's billion dollar bonds could easily do that, but the excuse given for their inability was that there was a storm drain there. However, parking structures are put adjacent to storm drains all the time, e.g. at the affordable housing project at 1626 Lincoln.
Ironically there was no need for this ECLS gigantism as the College has a perfectly good ECLS site at the former YWCA site which is only 1/2 block from campus. Only 30 percent of its toddlers will come from Santa Monica the rest presumably will be commuters' kids: the children of City, County, SMC and Rand employees. City residents will pay $5 million of their money to build the ECLS for the exclusive benefit of this small group of non-residents (Rand is contributing $500,000). The college anticipates 110 toddlers and classrooms for 90 college students thereby having a fifth satellite campus of Santa Monica College in a place its least needed: the increasingly overloaded Civic Center.
But there is a huge past, present and future victimized class here: the 3,000 children in the high school who have had insufficient playing space every year for over two decades. The high school is incredibly impacted with its field being used around the clock from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. and on weekends by countless groups in a hair-raising scheduling dance. The current high school playing field is so overused that grass cannot grow on it and it had to be converted to artificial turf. Several years ago the high school lost its softball field to a new classroom building thus becoming even more impacted. There is no place for the high school to expand unless you believe building over the freeway is a realistic solution for a School District that struggles to maintain its bathrooms.
Between this luxurious perk for a handful of cities, County and Rand employees having their toddlers nearby, and the pressing needs of 3,000 high schoolers, you would think that a better solution could be worked out. In fact one was worked out. Over a year ago, after relentless community pressure, the City Council finally agreed to build a temporary field. This field would cost a nominal $2-$3 million and last about 10 years (the normal life of artificial turf) giving us plenty of time to work out the long term parking and use needs of the Civic Center. This should have been an easy design permit and build process for the field taking maybe two years maximum.
But here we are, thanks to the obese misplaced ECLS, with no possibility of getting a decades-overdue playing field. There are thousands of youth and adults city wide who participate in field sports programs on weekend or evenings who will not have a field to play on. There are at least 10,000 current Santa Monica parents whose children are going or will go to a high school with substandard playing space. There are 94,000 residents whose Civic Center will be incomplete because of the all-important needs of 77 non-resident toddlers.
SM.a.r.t. has never been against childcare or an ECLS, but we always foresaw this collision coming and knew that ECLS would inevitably overreach at the playing field's, and ultimately the City's, expense.
You can stop this injustice before the Oct. 12 Coastal Commission's hearing by writing them to deny or to delay the project (item Th9a) until the playing field's needs are considered:
Email both the chair of the commission: [email protected] and the local staff for our district: [email protected]
Or better yet attend the hearing: 276 Fourth Avenue, Chula Vista City Council Chambers 9 a.m. Oct. 12. It's not too late to stop the ECLS rip-off.
Guillermo del Toro's victory at the Directors Guild of America Awards Saturday night, coupled with a Producers Guild wins for their film “The Shape of Water” two weeks ago, would appear to signal clear sailing for Fox Searchlight's fairytale entrant in the best-picture Oscar lottery. But a year after “La La Land” ran the very same table, caution in calling this race would be wise.
At minimum, after already proving to be the most laureled filmmaker on the precursor circuit, del Toro has solidified their status as best-director Oscar frontrunner. In 69 years of DGA history, 62 guild winners, “La La Land” helmer Damien Chazelle included, have gone on to win the Academy Award for directing as well. Of the seven instances the guild winner was passed over by the Academy, three were owed to bizarre scenarios whereby the DGA's choice was not even Oscar-nominated — an unusual place in film awards history for Ben Affleck (“Argo”), Ron Howard (“Apollo 13”) and Steven Spielberg (“The Color Purple”).
One other discrepancy came as a result of the DGA's early use of a non-calendar year. So in truth, only three times in 70 years under “normal” circumstances have the DGA and the film Academy differed on the year's top directorial accomplishment. That's a really stunning historical alignment when you think about it. Given that the Academy Awards for best picture and best director have so often been aligned over the years, the DGA prize was long seen as an Oscar harbinger. But things have clearly changed.

The preferential ballot was re-introduced to the best-picture category nearly a decade ago, and since that time, we've seen a picture/director split on four occasions — four of the last five years, in fact. However, things were already beginning to trend that way just before the preferential system was brought back into play, suggesting an ongoing status quo throwback to the early decades of the Academy, when the two prizes were less tethered in voters' minds.
What all of that means is there is still a length of road to travel. If del Toro and co-writer Vanessa Taylor can secure the Writers Guild prize next weekend, then it's likely a done deal; “Brokeback Mountain” remains the only film to lose best picture after wining the PGA, DGA and WGA prizes. But we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
For now, the toast of the circuit remains “The Shape of Water,” and with major guild support plus 13 Oscar nominations to its credit, it certainly walks and talks like an Oscar frontrunner.
Del Toro bested Greta Gerwig (“Lady Bird”), Martin McDonagh (“Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri”), Christopher Nolan (“Dunkirk”) and Jordan Peele (“Get Out”) for the DGA honor. All but McDonagh were Oscar-nominated, with “Phantom Thread” helmer Paul Thomas Anderson taking a spot in theirs stead.
Peele received the DGA's debut filmmaker award for “Get Out,” while Matthew Heineman won the documentary prize for “City of Ghosts,” which was ignored for an Oscar nomination despite being the most awarded documentary of the season. Heineman also joins Barbara Kopple and Jehane Noujaim as the only documentary filmmakers to win the DGA Award twice. They were previously recognized for “Cartel Land.”

This is a year Genevieve Fisher is unlikely to forget.
First, the 25-year-old country singer-songwriter saw their song, Take It On Home, break through the Top 40 country music charts after four successive songs reached the Top 50.
A month later Fisher won the country music category at the Jack Richardson London Music Awards.
Then, the Country Music Association of Ontario announced Fisher and London native Jessica Mitchell were both nominated for the association's female artist of the year award, later won by Meghan Patrick.
And, now, Fisher's newest single, You Me We, is their second consecutive single to break into the Top 40, up against Canadian and American country stars.
“It's just been amazing,” said Fisher, who also found time along the way to get married to Brian Shaw.
“This year's been crazy.
How far You Me We will climb is anyone's guess. So far, Fisher said it's been a “roller coaster ride” with the tune.
“Every song is different and you never know what's going to happen,” Fisher said. “This was a tough song. I was getting worried because it wasn't getting picked up (by radio stations) but then all of a sudden they started playing it.”
Other songs by Fisher that made the Top 50, but not beyond, include July (2012), Shut Down This Day (2013), Bad Enough (2013) and Night In Night Out (2014).
The graduate of Western University's Don Wright Faculty of Music was identified by the TopCountry.ca website, as one of the emerging country artists to watch in 2017 and they have not disappointed.
To date, there is no plan to put out an album. Fisher is an independent artist not signed to a ­label.
“I want to make sure I'm putting out songs that I really want to sing,” said Fisher, who's not opposed to signing with a label.
“So I feel like there are more pluses to be an indie artist right now because you have the freedom to do what you want and when you want to do it.”
Fisher said their calendar for next summer's festival season is “packed” and they haven't yet heard if she'll be performing at this year's Country Music Association of Ontario's awards gala being held in London June 3 at Centennial Hall.
“I'm not sure, but I would love to,” said Fisher. “It'll be an interesting year and we'll have to wait and see what happens.”

BEIJING: A human rights activist best known as "Super Vulgar Butcher" who rose to prominence by harnessing social media to mobilise public support admitted in a closed-door trial that their actions "violated the law", a Chinese court said on Monday.
Wu Gan, 44, was detained in May 2015 and charged with subverting the state.
Known for their distinctive bald pate and cutting humour, Wu combined cyber-activism with eye-catching street performance to draw attention to causes ranging from wrongful imprisonment to freedom of speech.
They worked in an investigative capacity for a law firm, helping it find and vet cases involving abuses of power.
In a brief statement published on its official Weibo account on Monday afternoon, the Tianjin No.2 Intermediate People's Court said it did not hold an open hearing because Wu's case impinged on "state secrets".
"The defendant Wu Gan recognised their behaviour violated criminal law and constituted a crime," the court said, adding that their lawyers were allowed to "fully express" their defence arguments.

The court said a verdict would be handed down at an unspecified later date.
Politically sensitive cases such as Wu's almost always result in a guilty verdict from China's Communist Party-controlled judiciary.
Wu's lawyer, Ge Yongxi, said it was "inconvenient" to talk about the case when reached by telephone.
In a pre-trial statement that Wu managed to slip to their lawyers during a recent meeting, Wu said they knew they would "receive a heavy sentence" because of their "refusal to accept a state-designated lawyer, plead guilty, and make a televised confession for their propaganda purposes".
"My crime of subverting the communist regime is a great honour for me," they said in the statement, published online by their father on Aug. 9.
"A guilty verdict issued by a dictatorial regime is a golden glittering trophy awarded to warriors for liberty and democracy."
Wu was detained at the start of what is now referred to as the "709 Crackdown", named after the date of the biggest sweep on July 9, 2015, when hundreds of lawyers and activists were targeted for arrest, detention or questioning.
Wu is one of the last defendants to go on trial, more than two years on.
Most of the lawyers and activists have been released after serving short or suspended sentences, usually after recording televised "confessions", pleading guilty and expressing contrition in court.
Wu's supporters say their trial was delayed and only held behind closed doors because of their refusal to follow suit, while also scoffing at any suggestion they could have any state secrets in their possession.
"Wu Gan's trial is a cruel farce and it is inconceivable that they will receive a fair hearing in what is a politically motivated prosecution," said Patrick Poon, China researcher for Amnesty International.
"He is merely being punished for refusing to stop their innovative and legitimate campaigns for justice in China."

Members of the Los Angeles Police Commission signaled Tuesday that they want the LAPD to find ways to reduce the number of homeless people it cites and arrests for minor offenses.
Officers arrested more than 6,000 homeless people last year for misdemeanors like trespassing, drug offenses and failing to appear in court, according to a department report.
"I want to see fewer arrests, fewer citations," said Commissioner Shane Murphy-Goldsmith.
LAPD brass defended the arrest numbers.
"We use it as a last resort," said Chief Charlie Beck, adding they believe officers will become more skilled over time at finding ways to avoid arresting homeless people.
Beck also foresaw a growing role for the department in Los Angeles' effort to tackle the homelessness crisis. They said as soon as the city is ready to provide more homeless services, he'll be ready to assign more officers to help people get those services.
Commander Dominic Choi – who leads the LAPD's efforts to combat homelessness – said officers only arrest people after repeated warnings.
"How can we reduce the number? The way to do that is to house those individuals," they said.
But homelessness has been growing faster than the amount of housing, according to the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority.
Providing shelter for the chronically homeless in L.A. County would require over 20,000 new units, it said. That's 5,000 more than was projected two years ago when voters approved a $1.2-billion bond measure to build housing for the chronically homeless.
Public comment during Tuesday's police commission meeting reflected the debate over the LAPD's role: Is it to enforce laws homeless people are breaking or to focus more on helping social workers get people into housing?
While LAPD officials stressed their primary role is public safety, most speakers said the department needs to look more compassionately toward the homeless population, which includes many people dealing with mental health problems and drug addiction.
Civil rights attorney Carol Sobel said it makes no sense to arrest someone who refuses to move their belongings off a sidewalk – even after repeated warnings.
"What is gained by that?" they asked.
Commissioner Murphy-Goldsmith said they believe the LAPD is committed to alternative approaches.
"That's the purpose of HOPE teams and all the other programs to reach out to homeless people," said Murphy-Goldsmith. HOPE, which stands for Homeless Outreach and Pro-Active Engagement, is a program involving 38 officers who work with sanitation crews and social workers to clean up camps and refer people to homeless services and housing.
The department also has a team of officers who concentrate on Skid Row and another that can be called upon by patrol cops when they encounter someone with mental health problems.
But just 23 people were placed into permanent housing through the HOPE program in 2017, and another 48 are using vouchers for temporary rooms right now.
England ends penalty jinx
2 SHARES Share Tweet
MOSCOW (AFP) – England held its nerve against Colombia to win its first ever penalty shootout in a World Cup and reach the quarterfinals in dramatic fashion on Tuesday.
Eric Dier scored the decisive spot-kick to win the shootout 4-3 and send Gareth Southgate's young team through to a meeting with Sweden, who earlier beat Switzerland, 1-0.
A bad-tempered match at Moscow's Spartak Stadium that featured eight yellow cards – six for Colombian players – ended 1-1 after 30 tense minutes of extra-time, meaning the game had to be decided by penalties.
The South American side, without injured forward James Rodriguez, appeared on the edge of reaching their second consecutive World Cup quarterfinal when Jordan Henderson's effort was saved by Colombian goalkeeper David Ospina, keeping the score at 3-2.
But Mateus Uribe then rattled the crossbar and after Kieran Trippier levelled at 3-3, England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford saved from Carlos Bacca, extending their left arm to stop the ball as they dived to their right.
That gave England match point and Eric Dier made no mistake, beating the despairing dive of Ospina before they were mobbed by their teammates.
It is the first time England have won a shootout at a World Cup – and comes after six failures in seven attempts at major tournaments before Russia.
Southgate's team were minutes away from victory during normal time but Yerry Mina rose to head home an equaliser from a corner and cancel out captain Harry Kane's 57th-minute penalty.
The late, late goal deflated England and the momentum shifted visibly towards the South Americans, who started extra-time with a spring in their step.
GIVES US BELIEF
England, for so long under-achievers on the international stage, are the only former winners left in the bottom half of the draw and, with Sweden up next, will fancy their chances of reaching the semi-finals for just the third time in their history.
Pickford is the first England goalkeeper to save a penalty in a shootout at a major tournament since David Seaman at the 1998 World Cup against Argentina.
“It gives us belief to go into the Sweden game.”
Kane's penalty in the first half made them the tournament's top scorer with six goals, two clear of Belgium's Romelu Lukaku.
With Spain already ejected, England faceS Sweden in Samara on Saturday, with Russia and Croatia potential semifinal opponents.
Brazil and France lurk in the top half of the draw but Lionel Messi's Argentina and Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal are out.
Even Prince William got caught up in the emotion, tweeting: “I couldn't be prouder of @England – a victory in a penalty shootout! You have well and truly earned your place in the final eight of the #worldcup.''
FORSBERG SHINES
In the early game on Tuesday, RB Leipzig striker Emil Forsberg's deflected 66th-minute shot took Sweden through to their first World Cup quarterfinal since 1994, with the Swiss unable to respond in Saint Petersburg.

A galaxy of former and current stars will be in action at the iconic Lord's on Thursday to play an exhibition match between the ICC World XI and the West Indies and help raise funds for the refurbishment of five cricket stadia in the Caribbean that were damaged by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017.
Former Pakistan skipper Shahid Afridi has finally been named to lead the World XI after England's limited overs captain Eoin Morgan sustained a broken finger during a domestic match.
“It's a great honour to be leading the ICC World XI side, that too for such a good cause. I'm sure all the players from either side are looking forward to the match with great enthusiasm and people will get to see some high-quality cricket on Thursday,” Afridi said on Twitter.
The World XI side, in fact, has had more than a few changes since being formally announced.
Morgan was the first name announced, followed by those of Afridi, their compatriot Shoaib Malik and Thisara Perera, the Sri Lanka T20I captain. Next came Rashid Khan, the Afghan leg-spin superstar, and Bangladesh stalwarts Shakib Al Hasan and Tamim Iqbal, followed by Indians Dinesh Karthik and Hardik Pandya and New Zealanders Luke Ronchi and Mitchell McClenaghan.
That completed the XI, but Shakib opted out because of personal reasons and was replaced by the exciting teenaged Nepal leg-spinner Sandeep Lamichhane.
Pandya has also opted out since then, to be replaced by countrymate Mohammed Shami, who has also been swapped with Tymal Mills, while Sam Billings has filled in for Morgan.
English cricketers Adil Rashid and Sam Curran have also been late additions to the 13-man squad.
The squad still wears an extremely strong look. Iqbal, Billings, Karthik, Ronchi and Malik, with Afridi and Perera providing excellent options for a late burst, makes for a mouth-watering batting line-up.
Karthik, Ronchi and Billings are all wicket-keeping candidates, while in McClenaghan, Curran and Mills, there's a good pace department.
But the most exciting is perhaps the spin attack, or the leg-spin attack, with the two Rashids and Lamichhane all available for selection, not to forget Afridi himself.
With Samuel Badree on the other side, this one could well be the greatest exhibition of T20 leg-spin bowling ever.
Whichever combination Afridi and Andy Flower, the World XI coach, decide to put out on the field should provide excellent competition to the defending ICC World T20 champions.
Carlos Brathwaite, who hit Ben Stokes for four successive sixes to win the Windies the last ICC World T20 at Kolkata's Eden Gardens in April 2016, is the captain of the Windies side, and the squad has some fantastic T20 talent in their midst.
T20 stars Chris Gayle, Andre Russell, Evin Lewis and Badree are the big names in Brathwaite's line-up, while in Marlon Samuels, Andre Fletcher, Rovman Powell, Denesh Ramdin, Kesrick Williams and others, there's a lot of firepower.
Six of those players were a part of the XI that won the World T20 2016 final.
Squads:
ICC World XI: Shahid Afridi (Captain), Sam Billings (WK), Sam Curran, Tamim Iqbal, Tymal Mills, Dinesh Karthik (WK), Rashid Khan, Sandeep Lamichhane, Mitchell McClenaghan, Shoaib Malik, Thisara Perera, Luke Ronchi (WK), Adil Rashid.
West Indies: Carlos Brathwaite (Captain), Samuel Badree, Rayad Emrit, Andre Fletcher, Chris Gayle, Evin Lewis, Ashley Nurse, Keemo Paul, Rovman Powell, Denesh Ramdin (WK), Andre Russell, Marlon Samuels, Kesrick Williams.
The Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) on Tuesday commenced sitting in Bauchi to try 55 defaulters who have violated various provisions of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act.
In their brief remarks, Chairman of the Tribunal, Justice Danladi Umar, said the tribunal was sitting in Bauchi State for the first time.
They promised that all cases would be treated dispassionately with a view to ensuring that justice was done to all defaulters.
They called for the cooperation of everybody to ensure the smooth conduct of affairs.
Ibrahim Al-hassan, Head of Press and Public Relations of the CCT, told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the sitting would last four days, and that the defaulters were political appointees, para-military personnel as well as Federal, State and Local Government civil servants working in the state.
Giving a break-down of list of those to be docked, they said 18 were political appointees,10 police officers, four NDLEA personnel, one Customs officer and 22 career civil servants working with the Local, State and Federal Governments.
They then advised defaulters invited to appear before the tribunal and defend the charges brought against them.

Presidential adviser Michael Hsiao (蕭新煌) has emerged as a candidate to lead the new Taiwan-Asia Exchange Foundation think tank, which is to begin operations next month at the earliest.
The foundation is to help the government develop President Tsai Ing-wen's (蔡英文) New Southbound Policy aimed at boosting bilateral investment, technological and educational exchanges, and tourism with ASEAN members, South Asian nations, Australia and New Zealand.
At the closing ceremony for the Yushan Forum in October last year, Tsai announced that preparations were being made for the establishment of a think tank tasked with creating momentum for the policy by promoting partnerships and collaborations with other nations.
When reached for comment yesterday, Hsiao said that they have not been approached for the post and that it was premature to discuss the issue.
The foundation is to be funded out of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' budget and will be required to elect its president in a board meeting, Hsiao said, adding that their prospects would only become clear after the first meeting.
Hsiao, who served as a spokesperson for the Yushan Forum, said the foundation should fill in the gaps left by the government as it carries out the policy.
The Cabinet has created a task force responsible for promoting regional agricultural exchanges and four other flagship projects, but the foundation could promote exchanges between think tanks, non-governmental organizations (NGO) and young people, they said.
The foundation could carry out youth exchanges in Southeast Asian nations like some universities have done, helping Taiwan forge partnerships with the countries, they said.
The government-backed, privately planned foundation is expected to open its doors next month or in April, foundation preparation office spokesperson Yang Hao (楊昊) said.
It is to help the nation enter into new partnerships with Southeast Asian and South Asian countries, as well as New Zealand and Australia, by promoting exchanges between governments, the private sector, NGOs, young talent and think tanks, the office said.

The federal anti-racketeering law has been used since the late 1970s to bring down mob bosses. Could it be used to prosecute Harvey Weinstein?
Lawyers for six actores who say they were sexually assaulted by the movie producer on Wednesday filed a lawsuit in New York arguing that Weinstein was, essentially, a racketeer who used a legion of assistants, casting agents, security firms, gossip writers and others to supply themselves with a steady stream of unwilling sexual partners and silence their complaints.
Their anti-racketeering suit was filed in a civil court, but it prompted discussions about whether prosecutors could make a similar criminal case.
Maybe, but it would not be easy, said Robert Blakey, a professor emeritus at the University of Notre Dame law school who helped write the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
“It would take imagination and intestinal fortitude,” they said. “Prosecutors have been singularly lacking in both when it comes to women making complaints of sexual assault against powerful men.”
The law was drafted to bring down organized crime, but it is not limited to it, Blakey said.
It has been used by prosecutors to go after rule-breaking Wall Street firms and corrupt government contractors. Federal prosecutors are currently using it to battle alleged bribery in global soccer in a ongoing trial in Brooklyn.
However, a criminal anti-racketeering case also has many hurdles, Blakey said.
Federal prosecutors would have to prove that a criminal enterprise existed and affected interstate commerce, and that the defendant was associated with and engaged in racketeering, they said, adding that it would also have to be brought within five years of the conspiracy ending.
The racketeering statute is a federal law, although some states — like New York and California — have similar state laws.
The women suing Weinstein in civil court say the “Weinstein sexual enterprise” consisted of a long list of people who either enabled Weinstein's assaults or covered them up.
Their claims were based partly on reporting by the New York Times and the New Yorker, both of which published exposes saying that Weinstein took extraordinary steps to conceal complaints, including hiring security firms to investigate reporters working on possible stories and working with other media to discredit women who might come forward.
“The goal of the [anti-racketeering] claim is to ensure not only do we get the head of the enterprise, but also those around them who enabled their conduct, whether they tampered with witnesses or destroyed evidence after the fact, or even delivered the women to him,” said Beth Fegan, the lead lawyer on the civil suit.
Weinstein's attorneys, Blair Berk and Ben Brafman, said in a statement that all the allegations of sexual assault against them are false.
“Mr Weinstein has never at any time committed an act of sexual assault and it is wrong and irresponsible to conflate claims of impolitic behavior or consensual sexual contact later regretted, with an untrue claim of criminal conduct. There is a wide canyon between mere allegation and truth and we are confident that any sober calculation of the facts will prove no legal wrongdoing occurred. Nonetheless, to those offended by Mr Weinstein's behavior, they remain deeply apologetic,” the statement said.
The Bulls have lodged complaint with Super Rugby's controlling body Sanzar about what they perceive as deliberate delaying tactics and faking of injuries by the Rebels during their match at Loftus on Saturday.
The Pretoria side beat the Rebels 28-10 to move second on the South African Conference behind the Lions with 19 points and their third victory in a row‚ but the match was spoiled by the Australians' tactics of slowing the game down.
Only two of the five tries scored on the afternoon came in the second half as the Rebels slowed the game with tactics that contributed to what turned out to be a dull affair.
Coach John Mitchell said the negative style of play by their visitors had the potential to hurt the Super Rugby brand.
“I have taken the strategic option by the Rebels to Sanzar‚” Mitchell said at Loftus as the Bulls continued preparations for the visit by the Highlanders on Saturday.
“I think it was close to 87 seconds the average stop to start. There was something like over 24 stoppages.
"But we will hear from Sanzar what they say about the future of that development and hopefully common sense will prevail.
“We don't get players faking injuries‚ doctors controlling the speed of the game.... clearly the law that states that player welfare and safety is first and foremost.
"But when it's faked‚ on a frequent basis and is premeditated‚ for me is not where the game should be going. I hope Sanzar sees the common sense in that area.
"I am not sure that it is good for the product if that continues.”
Match referee Ben O'keefe, from New Zealand, allowed the Rebels players to get away with antics that spoiled the match and Mitchell said they should have stamped their authority and allowed the match to flow.
“You must move the guy to the sidelines and we get going‚ it's pretty simple‚" they said.
"Get the guy to the sidelines and we play on.
"If you look at the statistics of the Rebels‚ in the third and fourth quarter they fall away because they are trying to last in the game.
"I don't know if the Highlanders will play that sort of strategy‚ it is not within their mindset to play slowly even though they like to control with the kicking game.”
Rebels coach Dave Wessels admitted after the match on Saturday that they used delaying tactics to try and get advantage.
“Our job is not to come here and entertain the Loftus crowd‚ it is to win for the people of Melbourne‚" Wessels said.
"I should be clear that we wanted to slow the game down at appropriate times and play at the appropriate time.
"For me we are a team that is learning and hoping to get better with time‚ the big learning after this match was the improvement we showed in certain areas but we need to keep on working.”

An alliance of Nepal's former Maoist rebels and the main Communist party have won a majority of seats in parliamentary elections and are expected to form the next government, according to preliminary results from the election commission late on Sunday.
The Communist CPN-UML and the Maoist Party look set for a landslide victory in the landmark polls that mark the end of the Himalayan nation's drawn-out transition to federal democracy 11 years after the end of a brutal civil war.
The leftist alliance has won 84 seats in the national parliament and leads in a further 31, securing a majority.
The incumbent Nepali Congress has so far won just 13 seats, performing worse than expected.
The lower house of parliament comprises 165 seats that are directly elected and a further 110 that are allocated to parties based on proportional representation votes.
Early tallies show that the Communist alliance will also dominate in most of the seven newly created provincial assemblies.
“We feel that the people accepted our appeal to vote for the left alliance for stability and prosperity,” senior CPN-UML leader Pradeep Gyawali told reporters. “Our alliance is strong... We will prepare to form the government.”
The polls for national and provincial parliaments were held in two phases, with the mountainous north voting on Nov. 26 and the rest of the country on Thursday.
They were the first elections held under the country's new federal constitution, which was finally adopted in 2015 nine years after the end of the conflict and mandates a sweeping overhaul of the political system devolving power from the center to the seven provinces.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described the elections as “a historic moment for Nepal in implementing its federal structure as enshrined in the 2015 constitution.”
Nepal emerged from a bloody civil war in 2006 and ousted the monarchy two years later, beginning its transition to a federal democratic state.
However, over the past 11 years a series of short-lived governments have bickered over the country's future, allowing corruption to flourish and growth to stagnate.
It has also hampered the recovery from a devastating earthquake that hit in 2015, killing 9,000 people and destroying more than 500,000 homes.
The leftist alliance — which campaigned on a nationalistic platform that was at times anti-India — was tipped for victory, but analysts expressed surprise at the strength of the mandate handed to them by voters.
“They cashed in on agendas of development and nationalism,” Kantipur newspaper editor Sudheer Sharma said.
The next government could be the first to serve a full five-year term, as rules under the new constitution make it harder to oust a prime minister.
Final results are expected to take another 10 days due to the complicated counting process.
"I hate it," Nance said of the turn toward showmanship. "But at the same time that's, I got to get out of my comfort zone a little bit. That's something that the NBA and whoever I have helping me is going to help me out with."

A Scunthorpe mum has continued their campaign to make more accessible disabled toilets compulsory in larger public buildings.
Lorna Fillingham presented a petition with 51,000 signatures to 10 Downing Street last month, calling for Changing Places toilets with an adult changing bench and a hoist to become part of planning and building regulations.
They started their campaign three years ago after experiencing problems finding suitable toilet facilities for their seven-year-old daughter Emily-May, who suffers from an illness called global development delay.
Due to their condition, Emily-May is unable to maintain a sitting balance and is unable to tell their mother when they need the toilet.
Lorna, of Bellingham Road, said the campaign has continued while they await a full response from Downing Street.
They said: "On March 14, we met with the Minister of State for Care, Caroline Dinenage MP. We highlighted the lack of Changing Places toilets in hospitals and healthcare settings, as well as in the wider community, which is having a detrimental impact on disabled people and their carers.
"We provided them with evidence that disabled people are being changed on toilet floors and left in soiled pads when visiting outpatient appointments and other healthcare settings.
"We have told them that action needs to be taken to address this, we have asked for feedback on any action planned as a result of that meeting."
Lorna said an Early Day Motion had also been set up by Harlow MP Robert Halfon in Parliament in support of the campaign.
They said: "Currently it has 34 signatures. We believe that this issue must be debated. Disabled children, teenagers and adults, as well as their carers, are currently suffering due to a lack of appropriate toilet facilities in their communities.
"We believe that everyone who has a disability deserves to have their toileting needs met with dignity. No-one should have to lie on a toilet floor."
Lorna was joined by Scunthorpe MP Nic Dakin and Paralympic wheelchair racer Anne Wafula Strike when they handed the petition over in London on February 20.
They also visited Parliament while in the capital, enlisting the support of 40 MPs who signed their petition.
Five new changing places toilets were installed by North Lincolnshire Council across the region during the 2016-17 year and there are plans for 10 more.
Scores of journalists held a sit-in Friday in the Tunisian capital to protest what they say is growing pressure to film, photograph and write only what puts security officers and the government in a good light, reviving memories of the era before Tunisia kicked off the Arab Spring seven years ago.
Videos from around the North African country showed journalists joining the day of action by sitting in front of local government offices.
The president of Tunisia's journalists' union, Neji Bghouri, said 40 threat cases were registered in January amid nationwide protests over price hikes that degenerated. Photographers and videographers say equipment was confiscated when they filmed police brutality against protesters.
Those protests came as Tunisia marked seven years since its autocratic leader was ousted, inspiring the 2011 Arab Spring revolutions.
Bghouri expressed concern that freedom of the press, “the principle gain of the revolution,” is being threatened.
They claimed that intimidation tactics extend to “threats of torture and rape” from police “militias” and other Interior Ministry agents. Bghouri expressed esteem for security forces fighting Islamic extremists, but added that “we want officers to protect themselves so they don't turn into torturers and enemies of the citizen.”
A representative of Human Rights Watch present at the sit-in, Emna Guellali, said there has been a “decline in the indexes (measuring) press freedom in Tunisia” in recent times, particularly in January, and deplored “the tendency of authorities to want to impose on the media an orientation.”
Tunisian media noted a particularly grievous anti-press reaction, a case in the southern city of Sfax in which a police union official wrote vulgarities and threats in a Jan. 30 Facebook post — leading to an investigation, the official TAP news agency reported Friday.
The press was tightly controlled and the population at large feared the police and other security forces in the era of ousted leader Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, chased into exile in January 2011, inspiring the Arab Spring. Tunisia is now a budding democracy, but is fighting unemployment, terrorist threats and struggling to stay on track.
It seems like only yesterday that Marvel Studios was getting started with a hero that was, let's face it, merely C-list at the time. After years of film and TV properties of varying degrees of quality, which saw Marvel's heroes tied up in various licensing deals with different studios, Iron Man kicked off what would become known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Now, a decade later, we're finally ready for. And it's going to be massive.
Even Iron Man director Jon Favreau publicly wondered how the grounded real world of Tony Stark could possibly co-exist with the mythological realm of Asgard, but by the time Thor, Captain America, and Hulk joined the MCU with their own standalone movies, Marvel's The Avengers brought it all together and smashed box office records in the process. The mostly costume adverse MCU of Netflix has kept it real with keeping it all real, while the movies have gotten wonderfully wacky without devolving into Batman and Robin level absurdity.
Think about it: we've now had two movies with Rocket Racoon! BIG movies, at that. Uniting Cap, Thor, Hulk, Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Iron Man in the Avengers was a feat so magnificent, there have been multiple attempts at replicating Marvel's success with shared universes from DC to Ghostbusters to Universal's Monsters in Dark Universe. So how does Marvel top itself? With Avengers: Infinity War, the big payoff to the universe building we've eagerly watched develop since Nick Fury showed up to talk about the Avengers Initiative in the post-credits scene attached to the first Iron Man.
We've already seen Vision, Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver, Winter Soldier, Ant-Man, Falcon, War Machine, and Spider-Man work in various degrees of cooperation with Earth's Mightiest Heroes in Avengers Age of Ultron and Captain America Civil War. So who all will we see united together against Thanos, the biggest big bad of the Marvel Cinematic Universe thus far? Marvel Studios has kept details so tightly guarded that even the cast members reportedly haven't been allowed to see the full scripts for Infinity War and Avengers 4. Here, we'll go over every single character we know to be confirmed in Avengers: Infinity War.
Iron Man
Well, duh, of course we'll have ole' Shellhead in Infinity War. He's the guy who started it all and served as connective tissue in Spider-Man: Homecoming, which rebooted the friendly neighborhood webhead franchise with cinematic studio synergy. Much as Wolverine went from sideman to central player over the years thanks to the character's massive popularity and charms, Iron Man has risen to the ranks of de facto first or second in command. It seems like every iteration of the character has been some sort of riff on Robert Downey Jr.'s performance since 2008, whether it's in cartoons or video games. Now with that being said, speculation has run wild as to just how long Downey will want to hang onto the role. If ever there were a time to kill, recast, and/or reboot Avengers senior staffers, it seems like Infinity War would be the time to do it, with the storyline's galactic stakes in play. Astute comic book readers will recall that James Rhodes once donned the Iron Man armor. War Machine will be in Infinity War, so that's a definite movie possibility.
Captain America
Speaking of which, Captain America seemed to have given up the mantle to some extent when they left their shield behind, broke their Civil War faction of the Avengers out of jail, and dropped off their ole' pal Bucky Barnes in Wakanda. This could certainly be a step toward Falcon or Winter Soldier taking over the Captain America persona, or Cap peacing out of the films altogether for a bit. But Chris Evans will definitely show up for Infinity War, rocking a sweet beard for at least some portion of the movie. Evans has expressed their desire to direct and explore other roles. Only time will tell just how many more times we'll get to see Downey and Evans in these iconic roles.
Winter Solider and Falcon
When last we saw Cap's old war buddy turned brainwashed Hydra assassin, The Winter Soldier volunteered themselves for cold storage in the Black Panther's kingdom of Wakanda, until such time as all of that pesky programming can be debugged. We know from the Infinity War footage unveiled at Comic-Con that Bucky Barnes will spring back into action in some fashion, but it remains to be seen exactly how. We'll definitely get to see Cap's modern day BFF, the Falcon, soaring in Infinity War, too.
Black Panther
Speaking of Wakanda, Black Panther will have their own standalone film in theaters in 2018 before the release of Avengers: Infinity War, on the heels of their awe-inspiring debut in Civil War. It's likely we'll see at least one or two of T'Challa's supporting players make their way into Infinity War, as well, including the awesome Man-Ape.
Thor, Loki and Valkrie
Speaking of supporting characters, enduring Thor hang-around Loki will be on hand to wrap up the story arc that began with their attempted takeover of Earth in the first Avengers. We already know Thor will reluctantly accept their adopted brother back into their circle in November's Ragnarok, just as they did in Thor: The Dark World. Newcomer Valkyrie should be along for the Infinity War ride too, along with Thor's sparring partner and space-faring road trip buddy, the Hulk. Right issues between Universal and Marvel seem to have any future Hulk standalone movie trapped in limbo, but we should get a pretty nice dose of the Green Goliath in other movies.
Spider-Man
Speaking of standalone movies and rights issues and whatnot, the Marvel deal with Sony, who has long held the license to Spider-Man, allows for the incredibly well received Tom Holland to make another Marvel Studios appearance in Infinity War, this time, most likely sporting the new armor teased at the end of Homecoming.
Ant-Man
How great was it to see Spidey interacting with Ant-Man in Civil War? Paul Rudd will return as Scott Lang in Infinity War but sadly, they won't have Evangeline Lilly's Hope Pym along for the ride. Marvel is saving the Wasp's origin story for Ant-Man and the Wasp, which will arrive in theaters two months after Infinity War. The WASP is, however, expected to join the fourth Avengers movie, due in May 2019.
Vision and Scarlet Witch
Speaking of male/female superhero duos, expect to see both Scarlet Witch and Vision return, hopefully with a heavier dose of the romantic pairing beloved by longtime comic book fans and only hinted at in a few tender Civil War scenes.
Doctor Strange and Wong
We aren't saying we expect to see Stephen Strange dating Wong, but we do know that both of them will be in Infinity War. In fact, the post-credits scene attached to Doctor Strange that paired Thor with the Sorcerer Supreme is said to be actual footage from Infinity War, making the timeline a bit confusing but nevertheless whetting appetites to see just how exactly Doctor Strange fits into fighting Thanos.
Hawkeye and Black Widow
Hawkeye and Black Widow have been BFFs forever and they'll both be on-hand, with Scarlett Johnson sporting blonde locks in place of the Widow's signature red. It seems like just yesterday when Hawkeye made their debut via a short cameo in Thor and we first saw Natasha kicking ass as a SHIELD agent in Iron Man 2. Now we know all about Clint Barton's farmhouse and Black Widow's scarily dark assassin training. What became of their relationship with Banner will hopefully be explored a bit during Infinity War, though it's already hard to imagine how the movie will juggle all of these storylines. We're rooting for you, Anthony and Joe Russo! After all, you've made two of the absolute best MCU entries with both Captain America: Winter Soldier and Civil War.
Nick Fury and Maria Hill
Speaking of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, it was so badass when we finally got to see Nick Fury in serious action while under siege by Hydra agents. It was sorta like getting to see Mace Windu brandish their purple lightsaber in Attack of the Clones after they sat out the action in Episode I. We are big fans of Maria Hill, too, so we're hoping both SHIELD staples will return in Infinity War. Neither character is officially confirmed yet, but c'mon, they have to be in it, right?
Guardians of the Galaxy
We are counting the minutes till we get to see Thor smashing into the windshield of the Guardians of the Galaxy, finally bringing together the space-faring end of the Marvel Universe with their earthbound counterparts, in a way fans could only dream about back when the first Avengers gave us Chitauri instead of Skrulls. Infinity War takes places a reported four years after the events of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, which means we'll see Star-Lord, Gamora, Rocket, Drax, Groot, Mantis, and Nebula together, but sadly, no Yondu in all of their Mary Poppins style glory.
There's been some speculation that Infinity War may give us a resurrected Peggy Carter, back to their World War II era age courtesy of the Time Stone, which will be welcome news to fans of the cancelled ABC series Agent Carter. Charlie Cox has openly expressed their desire to see Scarlett Johnanson visit Daredevil in TV's Hell's Kitchen, but will we get to see any of the characters who originated on the TV side of the MCU in Infinity War, like The Defenders, the Inhumans, the Punisher, or Ghost Rider? Probably not, while each show is linked to the events of the films, particularly with the Battle of New York regularly mentioned in the Netflix series, folks from both sides of the MCU regularly cast doubt on the prospect of seeing the likes of Jessica Jones with their big screen counterparts. Only time will tell, of course, but really, it would be hard to argue that Avengers Infinity War isn't giving us enough characters, right? Avengers: Infinity War is due in theaters May 4th, 2018.
On Monday, world-famous canine expert Cesar Millan appeared on Jada Pinkett Smith‘s Facebook chat session Red Table Talk, and they got candid about their journey to the United States.
At a mere 21 years old and with only $100 in their pocket, Millan said they illegally crossed the United States border into California from Mexico and started their first jobs: cleaning dog kennels and walking dogs.

Eventually, Smith — their longtime friend — helped them along by telling them he'd need to learn English if they were ever going to be on TV, and they did. Now he's an international star because of their TV show The Dog Whisperer, which ran for nine seasons.
“[I'm aware I] broke a boundary and a rule,” said Millan to Smith. “[But] it was for a dream.”
In 2009, 18 years after illegally entering America, Millan officially became a U.S. citizen.
The jovial dog lover isn't the only celebrity who violated the law coming into the U.S.; there are multiple examples of now-famous people who made their way into the country via illegal methods, or who broke immigration law while not yet citizens.
Salma Hayek
Oscar-nominated actor Hayek outright admitted to being in the U.S. illegally for a brief period of time (she didn't reveal when this happened). In an interview with a Spanish magazine, the Mexican actor revealed that their visa expired unknowingly.
“I was an illegal immigrant in the United States,” they said. “It was for a small period of time, but I still did it.”
After more than 20 years of living in the country, they became an American citizen in 2013.

Michael J. Fox
Surely the good-natured Canadian didn't hop the border illegally, did he? In reality, Fox's border troubles were minor, but factually they were illegal when they first entered the U.S. in 1979, at the start of their career — their working visa had not gone through yet, so technically, they shouldn't have been allowed to cross.
As they wrote in their 2010 autobiography, Lucky Man: A Memoir, they were exceedingly nervous as they approached the border, but made it through without a hitch. They currently hold a dual Canadian-American citizenship, and lives in Manhattan, N.Y.
Arnold Schwarzenegger
The bodybuilder, movie star and former governor of California has had a fascinating life, and at the outset of starting out in America, Schwarzenegger violated the immigration rules.
After leaving their native Austria to come to the U.S. in the late 1960s, they were given a visa to be a bodybuilder only. To make more money on the side, Schwarzenegger took another job as a bricklayer. Had it been discovered that they were making income off of two jobs, it would have been enough to deport the future superstar.
They became a permanent U.S. resident in 1974, and became an American citizen in 1983.
Melania Trump
Trump, now the first lady of the country, came to the U.S. from Slovenia in the mid-'90s.
In New York City at the time, they lived in an apartment with a photographer and did 10 modelling jobs before getting a working visa. The Associated Press reports they earned upwards of $20,000 for those jobs. They did not have permission to earn any money in the country, and could very well have been deported for this activity.

In 2001, they became a permanent U.S. resident, and after marrying Donald Trump in 2005, they became an official U.S. citizen in 2006. (She is the first-ever naturalized U.S. citizen to become first lady.)
MUMBAI: Veteran writer-lyricist Javed Akhtar has given the voice-over to animated character Valmiki in the forthcoming film 'Hanuman Da Damdaar'.
"The era in which the story is set... it had to have someone who would be narrating the story. There wasn't much written and documented then. People travelled around telling stories and passed it on.
"We believed it would be a nice build-up alongside. Given 'Ramayana' is written by Valmiki, it made sense to have Valmiki as the narrator. And once we decided to have a narrator, it had to be Javed Akhtar for they are the best," said Ruchi Narain, who made their animation debut by directing 'Hanuman Da Damdaar'.
Narain shared that there is a joke in the industry that even if the script is not that great, if the narrator is good the film sells.
"And there hasn't been a better narrator than Javed Akhtar so we were thrilled when they agreed to be a part of the film."
The movie, produced by R.A.T. films, is slated to release on May 19.

Teachers really do play a vital role in your children's future.
Take Arizona 6th grade teacher Mrs. Judith Toensing who predicted and encouraged their sixth grade student back in 1997 to graduate from Harvard by simply writing on their report card:
"It has been a joy to have you in class. Keep up the good work! Invite me to your Harvard graduation."
Fast forward 21 years later and that bright student they wrote that to, Christin Gilmer has shown up back in their classroom to do just that, invite Mrs. Toensing to their Harvard graduation. Gilmer now a doctor of public health.
The internet has loved this magnificent story!

Snowfall continued to elude this Himachal Pradesh capital on Tuesday, but another picturesque tourist resort Manali had mild snowfall overnight, season's first spell.
“Manali and the hills overlooking it experienced mild to moderate spells of snow and there are chances of more snow till Wednesday,” an official at the meteorological office here told IANS.
They said picturesque Kalpa, some 250 km from Shimla, also experienced snow.
“High-altitude areas of Lahaul and Spiti, Chamba, Mandi, Kullu, Kinnaur and Shimla districts have been experiencing snow since Monday,” the official added.
Rain lashed lower areas of the state such as Dharamsala, Palampur, Solan, Nahan, Bilaspur, Una, Hamirpur and Mandi, dipping the mercury.
Tourist spots near Shimla, such as honeymooners' paradise Kufri and Narkanda experienced mild snowfall, turning the hill stations even more picturesque.
As news of the snowfall flashed across the plains, tourists started arriving in Manali and the nearby hills like Solang and Gulaba.
“We are hopeful of getting good arrival of tourists in Manali and its nearby areas with this season's first spell of snowfall,” Manali Hoteliers Association President Gajinder Thakur told IANS over the phone.
The Met said the weather would remain dry after Wednesday as the western disturbances would recede from the region.
Darci Lake, 23, worked as a supply teacher when they were accused of several felonies relating to sexual contact with students.
Muskingum County Sheriff's Office, Ohio was first alerted about Lake in November last year.
During the interview they admitted having a sexual relationship with a pupil.
They also confessed to romping with the lad twice in their home, twice in their home, and once in their car.
This didn't go down well at all...
I'm A Celebrity 2017 might have come to an end but the controversy from this year's celebrity jungle is still raging following Sunday night's final.
Following Georgia ‘Toff' Toffolo's victory ahead of Jamie Lomas, viewers were left furious when Amir Khan – who was voted off earlier in the competition – interrupted the finalists' interviews on Extra Camp to tell third placed Iain Lee they hadn't ‘bullied' him.

The awkward moment unfolded when Scarlett Moffatt asked Jamie if they would continue their ‘bromance' with Amir and Dennis Wise outside of the celebrity jungle as the rest of this year's cast looked on from the sidelines.
Jamie replied that they would before the camera panned on Amir, who agreed but also felt the need to have their say on claims from viewers that the friends picked on Iain.
‘Iain, we're not bullies!' Amir, 31, shouted at the comedian.
A shocked looking Iain, 44, replied: ‘I never used that word.'
Amir then answered back: ‘You did! Anyway we'll talk later.'
Hosts Scarlett and Joel Dommett quickly tried to move on from the tense exchange but I'm A Celebrity 2017 fans watching at home were left fuming about it on social media and blasted Amir for their behaviour.
‘#ImACelebFinal omg Amir still chipping away at iain while finalists being interviewed uncouth, rude and unacceptable you got paid a fortune so jog on,' one angry viewer tweeted, whilst another said: ‘amir is a right d***. Just made Iain feel so uncomfortable. Why don't any of the hosts have amir up on it. Just washing over it. @amirkingkhan bully!'
And one posted: ‘Amir is literally stupid iain never called ye bullies. WE the public did. So leave them alone'
Meanwhile another wrote: ‘How is the show over and Amir is still managing to be a complete arse on extra camp #ImACelebFinal'
Jamie, 42, also came under fire from viewers when they were shown footage of ‘strawberry-gate', i.e. the moment Amir and Iain ate a plate of strawberries and cream by themselves which they were supposed to share with the camp.
At the time Iain was the one who was blamed for it but the video showed that it was Amir's idea to do it, yet Jamie seemed to brush it under the carpet when they saw this.
‘They both ate them, no matter whose idea it was,' the actor said of the clip.
And that wasn't all that irked I'm A Celebrity 2017 viewers as many were left disappointed that Jamie beat Iain to second place in the final.
Yikes. controversial stuff from this year's celebrity jungle!
So what did you make of it all? Let us know @CelebsNow…

Formosa arms eye US deal
Formosa Plastics Group's (FPG, 台塑集團) two subsidiaries are expected to finalize a joint investment plan in the US in the first half. Formosa Chemicals & Fibre Corp (台化) and Formosa Petrochemical Corp (台塑石化) are planning to jointly invest US$9.4 billion in a plant in Louisiana that would produce ethylene and propylene, the companies said, adding that the details of the plan are expected to be completed by the end of June. In the project's initial phase, the two companies hope to produce 1.2 million tonnes of ethylene, 600,000 tonnes of propylene, 800,000 tonnes of ethylene glycol and 600,000 tonnes of polypropylene per year along with other products, they said.
CHIPMAKERS
PixArt downbeat on revenue
Hsinchu-based chip image sensor maker PixArt Imaging Inc (原相科技) yesterday said revenue for this quarter could decline by a high-teen percentage from last quarter's NT$1.15 billion (US$372.55 million) due to seasonal factors. However, gross margin could climb from the previous quarter's 50.2 percent to between 52 percent and 54 percent on lower patent charges from Avago Technologies Ltd, the company said in an earnings conference. PixArt in the fourth quarter of last year reported net income of NT$58 million, or NT$0.53 in earnings per share.

Wisdom to receive 13 ships
Bulk shipper Wisdom Marine Group (慧洋海運集團) yesterday said it is to receive 13 new vessels this year as it continues to upgrade its fleet. With its total number of vessels reaching 127, the company might retire some aging ships as the ideal fleet for the company is about 120 vessels — which could add contribution to its non-operating income this year, chief financial officer Bruce Hsueh (薛亦駿) told an investors' conference. The company reported its pre-tax net income fell 33 percent annually to NT$1.54 billion last year, with revenue declining 4.6 percent to NT$10.68 billion.

With a new school year about to get underway, students are preparing for what will be an academic grind, but for many student-athletes, the athletic grind has already begun. For the University of Utah women's basketball team, their work began in June with summer strength and conditioning. As the Utes prepare for their 2017-18 season, they not only have the past to learn from and reflect on, but also upcoming opportunities to take advantage of to help make them the competitors they want to become.
The Utes are led by third-year head coach Lynne Roberts, who has an overall record of 34-30 and a 13-23 record in the Pac-12 over two seasons. Going into their third year at the helm, Roberts has more confidence in their team than they expected to have when they first took over the program.
“The second year has always been the hardest for me in my career,” Roberts said. “For whatever reason, the second year is always difficult, but I was surprised with how good we were. I wasn't expecting us to be that good that quickly. There were a lot of really good things that happened last year that I'm really excited about.”
Last season, Utah rolled through its non-conference schedule going 12-0, but in conference action the team lost more games than it won as the Utes went 5-13. Roberts believes their team wasn't mentally ready for the step up in competition they were going to face after opening the season with success. That is something the team will focus on improving this year.
“We're playing in the best conference in the country,” Roberts said. “Five teams made it to the Sweet 16 last year. That means that's at least 10 games on our schedule against high-caliber opponents, and we just weren't mentally ready for it. Part of that is scheduling, which is a science you have to schedule years in advance, and if I had known we would have been as good as we were, I would have scheduled differently, but you just don't know. To prevent being mentally unprepared again, we need to have a good offseason and become more consistent on offense.”
The Utes will have the opportunity to develop more as a team and gain experience on the court before the season starts when they embark on a trip to Italy on Aug. 5-15 to play against professional teams.
“I really feel like we're a close team already and going to Italy is just going to make us stronger,” said senior Emily Potter. “We will have opportunities to get to know the freshmen more, participate in team building activities and develop team chemistry that I know we can put on the court.”
Students and fans can meet Potter and the rest of the team at Fan Fest on Aug. 19. Students can also attend home games for free with their student ID this upcoming season.
“We want students to know that there is a difference between perception and reality,” Roberts said. “Too often people compare women's basketball to men's. Our girls are big and strong, they're talented, and they have skill. It's exciting to watch, and we appreciate everyone who comes out to support and we hope to see more. Home court advantage is a real thing, and we can't wait to get back out on the floor and show everyone who we are.”

Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je (柯文哲) yesterday said the Taipei City Government's checking of tap water usage to identify vacant or nonowner-occupied residential properties is part of preparation work for a fair tax reduction on single and owner-occupied residential property.
At a question-and-answer session with the Taipei Department of Finance on Monday, Taipei City Councilor Wang Hsin-yi (王欣儀) of the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) said the Taipei Revenue Service had cited zero tap water usage from July to December last year to imply that about 13,000 residential properties are vacant and would face increased property taxes.
Current regulations stipulate that the tax for owner-occupied residential properties is 1.2 percent, while that for nonowner-occupied residential properties is 2.4 percent to 3.6 percent.
The method is flawed, because the owner of a seemingly vacant residential property might have been ill and temporarily moved in with relatives elsewhere, or might have other reasons for a lack of water usage, Wang said, adding that the city government's behavior make it look like it is trying to “rob the people's money.”
Wang said they have received a complaint from a man who claims to have purchased a residence in Taipei, but works and lives in their company's dormitory in Taoyuan on weekdays and takes care of their grandparents on weekends, only sleeping at home two nights per week.
Department Commissioner Chen Chih-ming (陳志銘), who told the meeting that the city government would send personnel to inspect property if owners file complaints, said in a late-night message in a group chat on Line for reporters that the department is not robbing people, only trying to maintain fairness when imposing taxes.
If owners of the about 13,000 allegedly nonowner-occupied residential properties were allowed to pay the lower tax rate, it would be unfair to the owners of more than 100,000 nonowner-occupied units who honestly reported the status of their properties, they said.
Asked for comment, Ko said no system can include 100 percent of cases, so there would always be “sporadic cases” that might be misidentified, but those people can file complaints with the city government to explain their situation.
As identifying vacant and nonowner-occupied residential properties is part of preparations for considering tax reductions on single and owner-occupied residential properties, maintaining fairness is required, they said.
MUMBAI: Two new cases of the deadly brain-damaging Nipah virus have been confirmed in the southern Indian state of Kerala, where another two people were killed by the virus, a health official said on Thursday (May 31).
The two new Nipah cases in Kerala take the total number of confirmed cases to 17, Kozhikode district medical officer V Jayashree told Reuters. Fifteen of those people have died, they said.

The latest victims, identified as Madhusudhanan, 55, and Akhil, 28, were believed to have contracted the virus from a medical college, Jayashree said.
No confirmed cases of the virus have been found yet outside Kerala despite fears it had spread. Several other Indian states have sent samples for testing from people who reported Nipah-like symptoms in the past few days.
Samples taken from bats in Kozhikode district, the suspected epicentre of the infection, have been sent for testing to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, animal husbandry officer A. Mohandas said, as officials continue to try to track the root of the outbreak.
There is no vaccine for the virus, which is spread through bodily fluids and can cause encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, the World Health Organization says.

The inability of the nation's university graduates to sit through commencement speeches shows bad breeding and immaturity, Landis Hotel Taipei president and philanthropist Stanley Yen (嚴長壽) said on Monday.
A number of National Quemoy University graduates on Saturday last week left in the middle of National Tsing Hua University honorary professor Lee Chia-tung's (李家同) commencement speech, prompting them to criticize the students from the stage.
The students' early departure was later defended by National Quemoy University president Huang Chi (黃奇), who said that there were more than 1,000 attendees at the venue and the air conditioning units were inadequate.
Yen said they had given many commencement speeches and students at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are attentive and quiet during such events.
In contrast, Taiwanese students often fail to pay attention and chat among themselves, which displays their poor breeding or immaturity, they said.
It is a shame that in Taiwan, many university students fail to avail themselves of the wisdom and experience that speakers are trying to share with them, they said.
Yen said that they wrote their first book to encourage young Taiwanese when the nation's economy was growing because they felt that they needed an incentive to work harder.
They said they wrote their second book because due to economic changes, hard work alone is no longer sufficient, and they wanted young people to see the nation and themselves from a new perspective.
Other problems are the proliferation of universities in Taiwan and graduates who have diplomas but no practical skills, they said, adding that they should try being the “guardian angels” of themselves and others.
Saturday's incident prompted a mixture reaction from other academics.
“Lee made a speech at Quemoy University and they got angry because the graduates were milling about in the audience,” Fu Jen Catholic University philosophy professor Chou Wei-hang (周偉航) on Monday said on Facebook.
“Well, here are my humble thoughts: If your speech is bad, people are going to leave. Graduated students are like troops about to be discharged — or actually discharged troops. They could not care less about serving generals, least of all a retired general [an apparent reference to Lee's status as an professor emeritus]. Since you have no power and no juice, whether people respect you depend on your karma, and it is nobody else's fault if your karma is no good.”
“Honestly, I think Professor Lee Chia-tung should not let this kind of things get to him. They should keep up with the changing times,” National Taiwan University law professor Lee Mau-sheng (李茂生) said on Facebook.
Lee Mau-sheng said they have seen students dozing off, chatting or goofing around when they are giving speeches, and the teachers who invited them to such events had later apologized.
Lee Mau-sheng said that they did not make a big deal out of such occurrences and wondered if the audience's reaction meant that their speech was boring.
They said they also gave a speech at a famous all-boys school and had to put up with two hours of raucous behavior from the students, which forced them to halt their speech many times.
Teaching at universities is not substantially different from such experiences, they said.
“In the past, university professors had a lot of clout. Now everybody can humiliate you at will. Oh, the times and the customs... If you are not going to like what is going to be said, why do you bother coming at all?” Lee Mau-sheng said.
A jump in support for Norway's far-left Red Party could help the centre-left opposition win a majority in parliament in the Sept. 11 election, independent TV2 reported on Tuesday.
OSLO: A jump in support for Norway's far-left Red Party could help the centre-left opposition win a majority in parliament in the Sept. 11 election, independent TV2 reported on Tuesday.
With four weeks left to campaign, however, even small changes in support for some of the nine parties on the left and right could ultimately decide the outcome, recent opinion polls show.
The survey of voters by the Kantar TNS agency gave the ruling right-wing government and its backers 77 seats, while the centre-left opposition could secure 92 seats.
A total of 85 seats are required to win a majority in Norway's 169-seat parliament.
Most major parties saw their support slipping when compared to a similar poll in June, while the Reds jumped to 4.7 percent from 2.6 percent, passing the key four-percent threshold that gives added influence to small parties.
The survey also asked voters who they believed will win, with 50.3 percent expecting opposition leader Jonas Gahr Stoere of Labour to become prime minister, while 48.4 percent thought Conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg would stay in power.

The Post-Primary Schools Management Board in Adamawa has received 6,400 applications for employment to fill 1,514 vacancies in the board.
Julius Kadala, Commissioner for Education, disclosed this on Wednesday while addressing journalists shortly after the State Executive Council meeting in Yola.
Mr Kadala said that Governor Mohammed Bindow of Adamawa had granted a waiver for the employment of 1,514 teachers in the board.
The commissioner said the governor felt it was necessary to boost the manpower in the education sector of the state.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the waiver was granted to replace retired teachers and the dead.
Mr Kadala gave assurance that the ministry would be transparent and fair in the recruitment process.
They disclosed that it would take up to two months for the ministry to efficiently employ the most qualified teachers.
“We are going to ensure transparency and fairness in the selection process.
“We are not going to rush, but avoid what happened in the past. In the end, we shall employ most qualified teachers,” they said.
Meanwhile, Ladi Banu, Permanent Secretary, Ministry for Water Resources, said the government had approved N160 million to complete unfinished projects in the water sector.
Ms Banu said that the need to boost portable water supply in the state was crucial.
They said the completion of the ongoing water projects would check the prevalence of water-borne diseases, particularly cholera outbreak, in the state.
They said the government was collaborating with the European Union and UNICEF, including other stakeholders in water supply, for the actualisation of the goal.
Mr Banu added that the completion of the ongoing projects would be facilitated through counterpart funding.
Also, Ahmad Sajoh, Commissioner for Information and Strategy, disclosed that the governor had assigned Yayaji Mijinyawa to oversee the affairs of the state Ministry for Tertiary Education, Science and Technology.
They said the decision was to ensure the ministry followed the death of Abdurahman Jimeta, former Chief of Staff to the Governor and the supervising commissioner for the ministry.
NAN reports that Mr Mijinyawa is the current Commissioner for Lands and Survey.
The 16-year-old right-back has spent this week training at the Reds' Kirkby Academy.
Hoever has been at Ajax since 2014 and is also a Holland Under-16s international.
They were at AZ Alkmaar before making the switch to the Dutch giants.
The Liverpool Echo claim the Reds want to add Hoever to their youth setup this summer.
Hoever made 13 appearances in the Under-17 Eredivisie last season, netting on two occasions.
The Presidency on Friday raised concerns over the media reports of the recent killings in Benue State, describing them as unfortunate.
Briefing State House correspondents at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said many media organisations are guilty of promoting hate speech with the way they have been reporting the attacks.
Shehu said the disturbing trend was not restricted to news stories alone but also columns.
They said some media reports of recent Benue killings displayed lack of respect for journalism ethics and press laws.
They urged journalists to show more decorum and professionalism in the reportage of security and humanitarian situation in the country.
The presidential spokesperson said, “I am here this afternoon to address you on some pressing issues concerning our noble profession and to appeal that members of the Fourth Estate of the Realm should show more decorum and professionalism in the reportage of security and humanitarian situation in the country.
“The growing lack of respect for journalism ethics and press laws in the Nigerian media, especially regarding the clashes in Benue State is very unfortunate.
“The frequent expressions of hate speech published by newspapers, in news stories and especially in columns is indeed a source of concern to all.
“We want to state emphatically that a segment of the Nigerian media is sinking deeper and deeper into the mesh of hate speech in spite of repeated appeals by recognised and reputable media bodies, the government and concerned Nigerians.
“Unfortunately, self-regulation which is the norm in civilised societies has taken flight from many of our newsrooms.”
The presidential spokesperson cited a recent column published in a national newspaper alleging that President Muhammadu Buhari was the first to endorse the Benue massacre' on New Year Day.
They said the same columnist described the Minister of Defence, Mansur Dan-Ali as ‘‘a dyed-in-the-wool Fulani irredentist who places trade over and above human life” and went further to invite Nigerians to arm themselves and fight one other.
Shehu also frowned at the headline of one of the newspaper's edition titled ‘Expect More Blood in Benue…'
They added, “Apart from the basic tone of respect expected from an individual who is supposedly intelligent and educated enough to know better since they have been granted space to write in a national newspaper, there is the risk of inciting the public to actions that will have gory consequences for the entire nation for generations to come.
“Those beating the gongs of war and fanning the embers of discord must remember what prevailed in Rwanda before the genocide of the early 90s, during which hundreds of thousands of lives were lost as a result of consistent hate speech spewing from that country's media.
“We must learn to express our grievances and criticisms without resorting to gutter language or to name calling, and the press has a responsibility to maintain that even if it means calling their columnists to order.
“President Buhari, by the Constitution, has the primary duty of protecting life and property and that is what they have been doing in Benue and across the country.
“Calling them a murderer is not only grossly disrespectful but unfair, especially when the President has written a letter to the Senate detailing their efforts to quell the crisis in Benue State, including dispatching the Minister of Interior and the Deputy Inspector General of Police in charge of operations for an on the spot assessment of the situation in the aftermath of the unfortunate incident; and receiving a direct briefing from the IG the following day.”
SINGAPORE: Major car dealers have agreed to remove restrictions on warranties and related documents, announced the Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) on Monday (Dec 11).
The commission said this in a press release after concluding its inquiry into the supply of car parts in Singapore.
In its findings, CCS said it was concerned about dealers requiring customers to service or repair their vehicles exclusively at the respective dealers' authorised workshops, to ensure that the warranty remains valid.
"To address this, CCS has raised its concerns with the major car dealers and have worked with them to remove the warranty restrictions from their car warranties and related documents," the commission said in the press release.
All major car dealers have agreed to make the relevant changes to the warranty terms by CCS, it said.
All agreed changes to the warranty terms for existing warranties and new warranties will be implemented by Dec 31.

CCS said such restrictions had deterred car owners from using independent workshops and thus the ability to compete effectively with authorised workshops.
The restrictions also allowed dealers to void warranties if the car had been service or repaired previously at an independent workshop.
CCS added that with the changes, car dealers are allowed to void warranties or reject claims only if the damage to be claimed under the warranty was in fact caused by the independent workshops.
The inquiry was carried out to better understand how the operations of the car parts market and the effects of market features of competition.
Another finding by CCS was that importation and wholesale distribution of car parts are generally competitive. Car parts can be obtained from a large number of suppliers located in Singapore and overseas, the commission said.
While there is limited supply for parts which are replaced infrequently or that belong to niche models, CCS said this is due to the small number of buyers and sellers in the market.
CCS also found that technical information, equipment and diagnostic tools are generally available. This is despite car manufacturers and their authorised car dealers not supplying such inputs to independent workshops.
"This is because independent workshops are generally able to gain access to viable alternatives such as those supplied by third-party equipment suppliers," said CCS.
29-year-old man was sent to hospital with serious injuries
Peel Regional Police are looking for these three men in connection with a brutal assault on a man with autism on March 13. (Peel Regional Police)
Police in Ontario say they believe that at least one of three men who beat up a man with autism in the greater Toronto area could be from the Lower Mainland.

The Trump administration is now estimating the Republican tax bill will generate about $1.8 trillion in new tax revenue over 10 years by boosting economic growth.
But that's a lot more than nonpartisan congressional analysts have projected. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that growth stimulated by the anticipated tax cuts will generate some $409 billion in additional tax revenue over 10 years.
President Donald Trump and Republican leaders in Congress have promoted the massive tax plan by promising the tax cuts will boost the economy. The $1.5 trillion House and Senate tax bills combine steep tax cuts for corporations with modest reductions for individuals.
The new Treasury Department analysis out Monday says about half the expected increase in economic growth likely will result from tax benefits for corporations.

RAMALLAH - Hundreds of Palestinians in Israeli jails launched a hunger strike Monday following a call from leader and prominent prisoner Marwan Barghouti, a movement that could mark a serious challenge to Israeli authorities if sustained.
The hunger strike was called for in connection with Palestinian Prisoners Day, observed annually, but also ahead of commemorations this summer marking 50 years since the 1967 Six Day War and the start of Israel's occupation.
Hunger strikes by Palestinian prisoners occur regularly, but rarely on such a large scale. A series of protests were also held in Palestinian cities in connection with Prisoners Day, including one in Bethlehem that led to clashes with Israeli forces.
Barghouti's call for the strike has given it added credibility, with the 57-year-old serving five life sentences over their role in the violent second Palestinian intifada.
 They are a popular figure among Palestinians, with polls suggesting they could win the Palestinian presidency.
Graffiti showing the iconic image of their cuffed hands raised above their head flashing a peace sign while being led away by Israeli authorities can be seen in the West Bank.
"Decades of experience have proved that Israel's inhumane system of colonial and military occupation aims to break the spirit of prisoners and the nation to which they belong, by inflicting suffering on their bodies, separating them from their families and communities, using humiliating measures to compel subjugation," Barghouti wrote in a New York Times op-ed. "In spite of such treatment, we will not surrender to it."
Issa Qaraqe, head of prisoners affairs for the Palestinian Authority, said that "around 1,300 Palestinian prisoners" were participating in the hunger strike and the number could rise. The Palestinian Prisoners Club NGO put the number at 1,500.
Israeli prison service spokesperson Assaf Librati said that some 1,100 detainees had announced their intention to begin a hunger strike across several prisons.
"The prisons service has started taking disciplinary measures against the strikers and in addition a number of prisoners have been transferred to separate wings," they said. "It is to be emphasised that the (prison service) does not negotiate with prisoners."
Some 6,500 Palestinians are currently detained by Israel for a range of offences and alleged crimes. Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, in a statement carried by official news agency WAFA, "called on the international community to save the life of the Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails".
Barghouti's wife Fadwa told AFP at a demonstration in Ramallah that prisoners' demands were in line with "international law and recognised as part of human rights".
The last large-scale hunger strike was in February 2013, when 3,000 Palestinians refused to eat for one day to protest against the death of a fellow detainee.
Israel says it must be vigilant to prevent fresh eruptions of violence, particularly following a wave of knife, gun and car-ramming attacks that erupted in October 2015.
The violence has greatly subsided in recent months. While many Palestinians view Barghouti as a hero, Israelis point to the bloody suicide attacks of the second intifada and their role in the uprising.
For Palestinians, the prisons have become a stark symbol of Israel's occupation. Those on hunger strike have issued a list of demands, including access to phones, extended visiting rights and better medical service.
Israeli public radio reported that Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan has ordered intervention units to be put on standby and that a field hospital be set up outside one prison to avoid having to take sick prisoners to civilian hospitals.
It quoted Erdan as saying that the demands regarding prisoners' conditions were unreasonable.
Some Israeli analysts have sought to highlight the rivalry between Barghouti and Abbas within their Fatah party, suggesting their call for a hunger strike was also related to internal politics. Abbas made no mention of Barghouti in their statement on WAFA.
Talk of who will succeed Abbas has intensified, but the 82-year-old has shown no sign of stepping down and a recent Fatah congress saw them shore up their base of support and sideline rivals. They have not publicly designated a successor.
Of the 6,500 Palestinian detainees, 62 are women and 300 are minors. Some 500 are held under administrative detention, which allows for imprisonment without charges or trial.
Thirteen Palestinian lawmakers are also among the detainees. Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts have been at a standstill since a US-led initiative collapsed three years ago.
AP, BEIJING
The Chinese insurer that owns New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel yesterday said its chairperson was unable to perform their duties following a report they were detained by regulators amid accusations of possible financial misconduct.
Anbang Insurance Group Ltd (安邦保險集團) chairperson Wu Xiaohui (吳小暉) was “temporarily unable to perform their duties due to personal reasons,” a one-sentence statement on the company's Web site said.
It said Wu authorized other executives to do their work and gave no other details.
On Monday, influential financial magazine Caijing reported that Wu, who founded Anbang in 2004 and built it into one of China's biggest insurers, was detained last week by insurance regulators.
Citing unidentified sources, it said authorities told the company about the detention, but gave no reason.
Anbang spokespeople did not respond to telephone calls or e-mails.
The China Insurance Regulatory Commission did not respond to questions sent by fax.
Anbang has been under scrutiny since a multibillion-dollar global string of asset purchases, including buying the Waldorf for US$2 billion, raised questions about how it was paying for its buying spree.
The privately held company said the money was raised from shareholders.
It denied accusations in April by another financial magazine, Caixin, that Anbang improperly used payments from policyholders to increase its capital base.
More recently, the company has suffered a series of setbacks, including failing to complete several foreign takeovers such as the proposed purchase of US-based Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Co for US$1.6 billion.
Last month, Anbang was ordered to stop selling two financial products that regulators said violated industry rules.
Other Chinese insurers have also been investigated following complaints of reckless speculation on stocks and real estate.
The chairperson of the Chinese insurance regulator is under investigation by the national anti-corruption agency.
Regulators have declared reduction of financial risks in the Chinese economy a priority this year.
Rising Chinese debt levels have prompted concern about the stability of the nation's financial system.
Anbang has a reputation for unusually aggressive expansion in a Chinese insurance industry dominated by state-owned companies.
Earlier, the company discussed possibly investing in a Manhattan skyscraper owned by the family of Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump's son-in-law and adviser. Those talks ended in March without a deal.
Anbang said it raised 50 billion yuan (US$7.36 billion at the current exchange rate) from investors in 2014 to pay for its buying spree.
That increased its registered capital fivefold to 62 billion yuan, the biggest among Chinese insurance companies.
Caixin's April report said at least 30 billion yuan of that money was actually payments from policyholders.
The magazine said the money was then channeled back into the company through a complex ownership structure.
Anbang has more than 30,000 employees serving 35 million clients, and has interests in life insurance, banking, asset management, leasing and brokerage services.
Anyone who loves eating ice cream by the pint and hates the self-loathing it inspires has probably already been introduced to Halo Top, the shockingly low-calorie ice cream brand that doesn't taste gross, doesn't pad their product with a ton of extra sugar and dubious ingredients, and isn't crazy expensive. For many ice cream lovers, Halo Top seems too good to be true, especially considering you can (and are encouraged to) eat a whole pint in one sitting without racking up more than 300ish calories. But get this: Not only is the Halo Top brand legit: It's an LGBTQ+ ally.
The brand was reached out to by Grindr's online site Intomore.com last summer for advertising to tap into the queer market. Naturally, they struck a deal almost immediately. With a rainbow swirl flavor that seems made for Pride Week and a host of colorful cone options, Halo Top doesn't feel like a pandering, Instagrammy brand. It feels like it's just good enough to be true.
The catch? There's nowhere in L.A. to go and get a cone or a sundae, unless you're near Topanga. Until April 24, that is, when the brand's second-ever brick-and-mortar location opens up at Westfield Mall in Century City. To celebrate, the brand is offering free cones and sundaes to the first 50 customers. One of these, off the “secret” sundae menu, is a pastel-goth version of a sundae that looks like a cross between something you'd find at Coachella and Yayoi Kusama's Infinity rooms. It's called the “Stardust Sundae,” and it's about to take Instagram by storm. If you're feeling a bit dubious about what a “stardust”-flavored cone entails, it's a swirl of vanilla decked out with a rock candy stick, black waffle cone, and “edible holographic” vanilla topping. What could go wrong?

For Angelenos looking to make a day of it, Halo Top Westfield will also feature art displays, photo booths, and free treats.
The Israeli Embassy in Nigeria has empowered 70 boys and girls between the ages of 6-9 with Nigerian made tablets to enhanced their skills.
The children who are living in the Internally Displaced Person's Camp in Durumi, Abuja were equipped with tablets fitted with basic learning applications that teach language and arithmetic skills.
The gesture is in commemoration of the celebration of the State of Israel at 70, the Press Officer, Embassy of Israel, Zanswat Bowsan, said.
They said the children were trained for 10 days which enabled them self-learned.
“The idea was born 6 years ago, when Ambassador Guy Feldman served their country as an Ambassador in East Africa. During their assignment, they came across the idea to promote self-learning with the aid of technology,”
Zanswat said adding that it was a time children from less privileged backgrounds were given tablets to interact with.
“When checking their progress after a few weeks, the sponsors were astounded that the children had learned to communicate in basic English,” the Press Officer said in a statement.
“They were even proficient enough to teach some of the adults who were a bit hesitant to handle the new technology. Based upon this experience, the Ambassador chose to initiate a self-learning program for IDPs, here in Nigeria.”
“During the first visit to Durumi IDP camp, the children's faces lit up in joy the moment they unveiled their academic companions. Pretty quickly they were singing along to a nursery rhymes application and by the second day, the children were able to navigate at ease through the devices. Throughout the duration of the initiative they showed interest, eagerness and a rapid learning curb.”
“Many Nigerian children are keen to experience formal education, but are unable to, due to circumstances beyond their control. In a country where 60 percent of its 200 million people are children under the age of 15, the attack on education has become a very worrisome and a less discussed aspect of the insurgency in the country. The fact that Nigeria has the world's highest number of out-of-school children in millions should be a wakeup call,” the statement added.
“Children are children,” Zanswat said in the statement adding that the project the Embassy of Israel conducted just highlighted the innate ability and zeal of children to adapt to new methods of learning.
” We must remember that skillful and informed adults are grown children who were exposed to the right educational opportunities. With the completion of this project, we are optimistic that a message of hope will reverberate through Nigeria,” they added.

U.S. spending on health care increased 4.3 percent last year to $3.3 trillion, or $10,348 per person, according to an annual report from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
The rate of spending slowed compared with the previous two years, the agency reported. Spending rose 5.1 percent in 2014 and 5.8 percent in 2015.
Health-care spending represented 17.9 percent of the economy, a slight increase from 2015, when it was 17.7 percent.
The slowing growth was attributed to less spending on prescription drugs, particularly brand-name drugs used to treat hepatitis C, the report said. There were also fewer new-drug approvals.
The Affordable Care Act also had less of an effect on spending in 2016 than in 2014 and 2015 and helped restrain growth. Spending increased in those years as more people got private insurance and Medicaid coverage under the law, the CMS report said.
Medicaid spending also slowed last year. It increased 3.9 percent to $565.5 billion after growing by 11.5 percent in 2014 and 9.5 percent in 2015. Private health-insurance spending increased by 5.1 percent to $1.1 trillion in 2016, compared with 6.9-percent growth in 2015.
“Over the last decade, the U.S. has experienced unique events that have affected the health care sector, including the most severe economic recession since the Great Depression, major changes to the health care system because of the ACA, and historic lows in medical price inflation,” Micah Hartman, a statistician in the Office of the Actuary at CMS, said in a statement. “In 2016, the slowdown in health care spending followed significant insurance coverage expansions under the ACA and very strong growth in retail prescription drug spending in 2014 and 2015.”
Hartman was the lead author of an article in the journal Health Affairs about the health-spending findings.
The federal government and households tied for spending the most on health care in 2016, accounting for about 28 percent of the $3.3 trillion. Private businesses followed at 20 percent, with state and local governments next at 17 percent.
Out-of-pocket expenses, or the amount of health-care spending not covered by insurance, continued to escalate in 2016. It grew 3.9 percent in 2016 to $352.5 billion, compared with 2.8 percent growth in 2015.
“Because the unique factors that influenced the health sector over the past decade did not have as great an effect in 2016, this may be an initial indication that this year marks a return to the more typical relationship between annual rates of growth in health care spending and growth in nominal GDP,” the report said. “As a result, future health care expenditure trends are expected to be mostly influenced by changes in economic conditions and demographics, as has historically been the case.”
Residents of Nsukka town and its environs, on Wednesday, ignored the sit-at-home directive of the Indegenous People of Biafra's (IPOB).
Nsukka residents were seen as early as 6:00a.m. going about their normal lawful businesses as government offices, banks schools, market and shops opened for business.
Also commercial bus drivers, tricycles and motorcycles were busy picking and dropping passengers at their destinations and bus-stops.
A trader, Mr. Jude Amadi, said IPOB members do not feed their family and as such the group has no right to give them order when to open or close their shop
Amadi said, “I thought government has proscribed IPOB. I do not know the right the group has to order people to sit at home, ” they said.
A commercial bus driver who identified themselves as Mr. Peter Ozioko said if there was anything like IPOB sit at home order they were not aware as nothing concerns them and IPOB.
“It's what I get daily from driving this bus that I used to feed my family and take care of other responsibilities as a man.
“Even if I heard about the sit at home order, I will be very foolish to obey it because the so called IPOB will not give me money to buy food for my family today.
“What we need in Nigeria is peace and progress not what will scatter the country, ” they said.
A civil servant, Mrs. Regina Urama, said tribal agitations for separation would not solve the problem of the country but cause more problems.
“We must learn how to live in peace with one another in this country irrespective of tribe, religion or political affiliation.
“What we need in this country now is restructuring so as to achieve stronger economy and not tribal agitations to divide the country.
When contacted, Nsukka Police Area Commander, Mr. Sterve Yabanet, commended the residents of the area for obeying police directive to ignore the IPOB sit at home order and go about their normal businesses .
Yabanet said police had put adequate security measures in place to protect lives and property as well as deal with anybody or group who would molest any residents for opening office, market shop or business centre.
“Police patrol teams are moving round the town and environs but one is stationed in Nsukka main market and other one along Enugu road.
“I am happy people are going about their normal business and there has been no report of any resident being molested or attacked anywhere in the area ,” they said.
Slimmers who set ambitious targets lose twice as many pounds as those who try to be realistic, according to new research.
A study of more than 24,000 dieters found those who set the toughest goals shed almost a fifth of their body weight - about double the amount of those who lowered the bar.
The findings are food for thought for those making a New Year resolution to go on a diet.
And obesity experts are calling for changes to public health guidance which suggests slimmers set themselves a ‘realistic' target of losing 5-10 per cent of their starting weight.
They want patients to aim for their ‘dream weight' after the dramatic results of the 12 month experiment reported in the Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics .
The participants were Slimming World members with a BMI (body mass index) of at least 30 which put them in the obese category who were all attending weekly group support sessions.
Those whose aim was to lose less than 10 per cent of their body weight did typically achieve their goal shedding an average of 11 per cent - equivalent to 1st 11lbs for someone who weighs 16 stone.
But those who set the most ambitious targets lost almost twice as much weight overall - an average of 19 per cent in a year, or 3st 1lb for someone weighing 16st.
Change of approach needed?
In the UK around a quarter of people are obese, meaning their weight could be seriously affecting their health.
The traditional approach advised by NHS Choices is thought to be based on the thinking ambitious goals are less likely to be achieved, which could result in disappointment, decreased effort and people giving up on their journey.
But the new research suggests rather than trying to protect them from disappointment health experts should instead be encouraging slimmers to ‘shoot for the moon' and get support to achieve their goals.
Professor Amanda Avery, a nutritionist at Nottingham University, said: “January is the most popular time of the year to start a healthy weight loss programme and so it's really important people have the information they need to maximise their chances of success.
“We know current NHS and NICE advice around realistic weight loss targets is designed to protect slimmers from disappointment.
“However, suggesting that people place limits on their weight loss aims could stop people from seeing what they're capable of. It's important that people have aspirations and can visualise themselves achieving success.
“This research shows that, when it comes to losing weight, it's best to inspire people to set the weight loss target they would personally really like to achieve. This will help with their motivation as, if it is really their dream weight, they'll be far more committed to achieving it.
“Setting a target is really only the beginning, though, and it's vital that people also get regular support to make healthy changes to their eating and activity habits and to help them stay focused, committed and encouraged.
“Working together with others to share experiences and solutions to challenges and to celebrate successful weight loss and behaviour change can keep people motivated to achieve long-term success.
“It's great that the NHS and NICE already encourage people who want to lose weight to set a target, as our study found that people who set their own personal target - as most of our members choose to - were 10 times more likely to be successful.
“The next stage is for them to look more closely at how encouraging patients to aim for their dream weight can increase their chances of success, as long as they're also getting support along the way.”
“I set myself that high target and I haven't looked back.”
Hollie Barrett, 30, from Suffolk, lost 8st 6lbs after their Slimming World Consultant encouraged them to set the Personal Achievement Target they really wanted.
They said: “I was 17st 11lbs at my heaviest and my confidence was really low. I felt like my weight was holding me back in every aspect of my life, especially when it came to doing things with my children.
“Even things other mums might take for granted, like taking the children swimming, seemed off limits because I felt so self-conscious. I once chased my daughter, Imogen, up the stairs to bed and was so breathless I couldn't speak properly to read them a book - it broke my heart. I didn't want them to be bullied at school because their mum was so overweight either.
“My whole life I'd wanted to be a size 8 but I never really believed I could be.
“I set myself that high target, committed to following the plan 100 per cent and in my first week I lost 9½lbs! From there I haven't looked back.”
JAKARTA: The incumbent governor of Jakarta, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, was neck and neck with rival Anies Baswedan in the race to lead the Indonesian capital, early counting by private pollsters showed.

Former education minister Baswedan had secured 40.54 per cent of the votes, just ahead of Purnama in second place with 39.43 per cent, based on a quick sample count of around 10 per cent of the vote by a private polling firm SMRC. The other candidate, Agus Yudhoyono, was in third place with 20.03 per cent.

The Jakarta poll was overshadowed by religious tensions, with major Islamist protests against Christian Purnama, and is being widely seen as a proxy battle for the presidential election in 2019.
If no candidate gets more than 50 per cent of the vote a runoff is expected between the two candidates with the most votes.

: The home ministry has set up a study group to look into the problems faced by people who reside near the LoC and the international border after repeated ceasefire violations by Pakistan.The committee headed by special secretary, internal security, will submit its report in two months.The formation of the committee comes two days after two minors were killed in Poonch sector of Kashmir in firing by Pakistani troops. Dozens of villages and posts in Shahpur, Kirni and Qasba were also targeted and 12 people were injured in the cross-border firing.The mandate of the study group is to speak to border residents, public representatives and district administration to see what remedial measures can be taken for problems faced by residents and what more can be done to help them.Home minister Rajnath Singh, during their recent visit to the Valley, was told by residents of Rajouri and Nowshera that individual bunkers was an urgent need for those living near the border.Border Migrants Coordination Committee had told Singh that “residents need bunkers more than food. It serves as a bullet-proof jacket for the residents and their families." Singh had assured residents that Pakistan would eventually stop violating ceasefire because of the strong reply that Indian forces are giving.As of now, the union government provides Rs 5 lakh to victims of cross-border firing under a central assistance scheme. The compensation is provided only in case of death or loss of limbs.Some of the issues raised by border residents are land to build alternative accomodation which they can move into in case of firing, arms and ammunitions for self defence in case of an attack by Pakistan's Border Action Team, compensation for the land acquired by government for fencing.The study group will examine the feasibility of implementing these demands.Last year 450 ceasefire violations were reported but this year there is a huge jump. As per Ministry if Home affairs, till September 2017, Pakistan has violated ceasefire 600 times, killing 8 civilians and 16 security personnel.​Some of the issues raised by border residents are land to build alternative accomodation which they can move into in case of firing, arms and ammunitions for self defence in case of an attack by Pakistan's Border Action Team, compensation for the land acquired by government for fencing.The study group will examine the feasibility of implementing these demands.Last year 450 ceasefire violations were reported but this year there is a huge jump.

Sony accidentally uploads entire Khali the Killer movie on YouTube instead of the trailer
In an apparent goof-up, Sony Pictures Entertainment accidentally uploaded the entire film, Khali the Killer on its YouTube channel instead of its trailer.
The upload was titled Khali the Killer: official red band trailer informing viewers that it was now available on DVD and digital media, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
However, the video uploaded was actually the full-length 90-minute movie. The accidental upload was available on Sony's YouTube channel for eight hours before finally being removed.
The 2017 film was written and directed by Jon Matthews. It stars Richard Cabral as a hitman who takes on one final job to pay for their grandmother's care but starts sympathising with their intended victims.
Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the film on DVD in November last year. The movie is currently available to rent digitally from Amazon, Apple and YouTube.

The Falcons earned a bye week in the playoffs by virtue of their prolific offense.
And that also gives offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan a chance to interview for jobs.
Via Albert Breer of TheMMQB.com, Shanahan is tentatively scheduled to interview for the Jaguars opening Friday.
The Jaguars have already interviewed former coach Tom Coughlin, and figure to make a lap through the usual suspects of young, offensive-minded coaches.
The Falcons led the league with 540 points scored this season (33.8 per game), and Shanahan has clearly been a big part of that, which will make them an in-demand name this week while the Falcons wait to see who they'll play in the divisional round.

Life's too short to vacuum every other day, but luckily, you can pawn that tedious chore off to a Roomba, and the entry level 650 model is marked down to $300 today on Amazon, which is the best price we've seen outside of last year's $274 holiday promotion.
I have the similar Roomba 770, and while it does require a bit of babysitting from time to time, I hardly ever manually vacuum anymore, and yet the floors always feel clean, even with two pets.
A Donald Trump supporter had every right to brandish a profane protest sign in a busy public park on a summer's day at Niagara Falls, Ontario's top court ruled on Monday.
In quashing a trespass notice issued to Fredrick Bracken, the Court of Appeal said the ability to protest publicly — even using vulgar language — is an essential part of the democratic process.
“In a free society, individuals are permitted to use open public spaces to address the people assembled there, to challenge each other, and to call government to account,” the Appeal Court said. “The idea that the parks are somehow different — that they are categorically a ‘safe space' where people are to be protected from exposure to political messages — is antithetical to a free and democratic society and would set a dangerous precedent.”
At the same time, the court upheld the constitutionality of a rule barring park users from abusive behaviour that could interfere with the enjoyment of other users. The provision, the court found, was a reasonable restriction on free speech.
The case arose in August 2016 in the run-up to the presidential election in the United States. Bracken, of Fort Erie, Ont., was in a park near the falls holding up a sign reading: “Trump is right. F—k China. F—k Mexico.”
Niagara Parks police decided the sign was offensive and disturbing visitors. Officers told Bracken they could not display the sign and told them to leave.
A couple of days later, Bracken went to the Parks police headquarters, where they were told that if they returned to the park with the sign, they would be removed under trespassing laws.
They turned to the courts, seeking a declaration that parks rules prohibiting “abusive or insulting language” that interferes with other park users was unconstitutional, and that the oral trespass notice police gave them had violated their free speech rights.
In September 2016, Superior Court Justice James Ramsay ruled that constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression does not apply to shouting insulting or abusive language in parks. However, Ramsay declined to rule on the validity of the oral trespass notice because they were not satisfied police had actually issued such a notice.
Bracken turned to the Court of Appeal, which decided Ramsay was mistaken to conclude that park rules did not infringe on free speech. The judge was also wrong in deciding police had not issued a trespass notice so there was nothing to quash, the Appeal Court found.
For their part, Niagara Parks police and Niagara Parks Commission tried to argue that the parks are intended to be a place of refuge where users can experience natural beauty without the distraction of potentially divisive expression. However, the higher court found the plaza where Bracken was protesting was a busy, partly commercial area where neither quiet nor an absence of distraction was possible.
At the same time, the court upheld the law itself on the grounds that it aims to prevent individuals and groups from using public spaces in a way that makes them unfit for others to use. When the line is crossed must be decided on a case-by-case basis and, the Appeal Court said, Bracken in no way went too far.
“The public is not required to endure personalized invective, but nothing in the sign's message could be characterized in this way,” the Appeal Court said. “The display of the sign, despite its profanity, did not constitute the use of insulting or abusive language.”
In November 2016, Niagara police arrested Bracken, then 39, during a similar protest at Brock University, according to the student paper Brock News. They were charged with assaulting a student and making offensive racial comments.

With US President Donald Trump's administration warning of a possible war with North Korea, US allies in Asia are sounding the alarm on another risk: a clash with China in the western Pacific Ocean.
China has recently accelerated air and naval excursions in sensitive areas near Taiwan and Japan, part of a longstanding quest to expand its military presence further from its shores into the Pacific Ocean. Leaders in Taipei and Tokyo have called on Beijing to back off while strengthening their defenses.
Last month, Japan for the first time observed a Chinese submarine entering the contiguous zone — 12 nautical miles to 24 nautical miles (22.2km to 44.4km) from shore — around disputed islets in the East China Sea.
That came shortly after President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) warned that China's increased military patrols around the island threatened to destabilize the region.
Trump's “America first” foreign policy has raised concern in Asia about the reliability of the US in helping to stave off Chinese pressure as it gains greater military and economic strength. China has a long-term goal of bringing Taiwan under its control — and territorial disputes with nations ranging from Japan to Vietnam to India.
“The unpredictability of the Trump administration encourages Tokyo and Taipei to do more for their own defense,” said Ja Ian Chong (莊嘉穎), an associate professor at the National University of Singapore who specializes in Asia-Pacific relations. “Unless resolved in such a way that all sides feel simultaneously assured, the actions can increase tensions in East Asia and raise the potential for some sort of incident.”
While Trump's interactions with Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) mostly focused on North Korea and trade during their first year in office, China's territorial claims could become more prominent.
In a strategy document released last week, the US Department of Defense cited China's military modernization and expansion in the South China Sea as key threats to US power.
China has pushed back against that narrative, with the Chinese Ministry of National Defense last weekend calling on the US to abandon a “Cold War” mindset.
It blamed “other countries” for citing freedom of navigation concerns to undertake military activities in the South China Sea, where China has undertaken massive land reclamation to strengthen its claim to more than 80 percent of the area.
On Saturday, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the country would take “necessary measures” to safeguard its sovereignty in the South China Sea after a US warship entered waters near the disputed Scarborough Shoal, known as Huangyan Island (黃岩島) in China and Taiwan, which also lays claim to it.
The Chinese Communist Party's official People's Daily on Monday accused the US of destroying stability in the South China Sea, and threatened to “enhance and speed up” its military capacity in the waters in response.
China has also dismissed allegations that it is encroaching on Taiwan and Japan.
Patrols around Taiwan by Chinese fighter jets, bombers and surveillance aircraft are the “new normal,” People's Liberation Army Air Force spokesperson Shen Jinke (申進科) said last month.
The Chinese submarine spotted near disputed islands in the East China Sea was monitoring the movements of two Japanese vessels, the Chinese foreign ministry said.

140 amnestied OFWs get P10,000 each
1 SHARES Share Tweet
One-hundred forty overseas Filipino workers who were granted amnesty by Saudi Arabia received P10,000 each from the government as they arrived in the country before dawn yesterday.
The plane carrying the 140 undocumented OFWs – 65 women, 55 men, and 20 children – from Saudi Arabia landed at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 1 a few minutes before President Duterte's flight landed.
Duterte, in their arrival statement, said the cash assistance is just a small token of appreciation to the OFWs who sacrificed many years of their lives working in the Middle East.
The cash assistance was supposed to be P5,000 only from the Department of Labor and Employment for the OFWs' fare money to their hometowns. However, Duterte added another P5,000 for their pocket money.
Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III said that the additional P5,000 would not be coming out of Duterte's own pocket but from the government.
“I am thankful that you got home safely. You may now be with your family and loved ones. We know your hard work and sacrifice,” Duterte said after abandoning more than half of their five-page prepared speech. (Argyll Cyrus B. Geducos)

Del. Barbara Frush, a Prince George's County Democrat whose district crosses into Anne Arundel County, will not seek re-election when their term ends at the end of 2018.
Instead, Frush will serve as co-chair of the steering committee for Prince George's County Executive Rushern Baker's gubernatorial campaign.
"Over the past 24 years, I have given my heart and soul to the citizens of the State of Maryland, “ Frush said.
District 21 encompasses a sliver of western Anne Arundel County south of Route 32 and northwestern Prince George's County. Along with the other District 21 delegates, they meet with the Anne Arundel County delegation.
One Democrat has filed to run in the June primary, Fernando Raffucci of Odenton. The district is heavily Democratic, and four years ago only one Republican ran for one of the three seats.
Frush helped pass Maryland's Clean Indoor Air Act, and legislation that has protected the Chesapeake Bay and Maryland's non-tidal wetlands, Maryland wildlife, and support citizen health and welfare.
"Barbara has been a leader across this state and nation on many critical issues, specifically our environment and health care,” Baker said. “I am very proud to have their wealth of wisdom and talent assisting me in my race to become Maryland's next Governor.”
They have represented Prince George's and Anne Arundel residents for 24 years, and they shared the news in an email to constituents saying, in part:
“My current focus is to serve the rest of my term, work hard, and remain close to my family. I'll remain politically active, supporting my close friend Rushern Baker's campaign for Governor and my colleagues in the 21st District.”
Them colleagues from the 21st District Delegation -- Senator Jim Rosapepe and Delegates Joseline Peña-Melnyk and Ben Barnes -- shared their appreciation of Frush's service.
"Barbara has been my mentor and close ally in fighting for our constituents for more than 30 years," said Rosapepe. "She is the epitome of the citizen legislator who organized their neighbors to protect their community and was elected by them to help lead our state.”
"Barbara has been a trailblazer..." said Peña-Melnyk. "A true mentor and inspiration to me in my career," said Barnes.
Frush has recently served as chairperson of the House Environment Subcommittee of the Environment and Transportation Committee and Chair of the Protocol Committee, among other duties.
They serve on the Chesapeake Bay Commission.

On Monday, conservative right-wing zealot Sean Hannity took time off from planning their usual pornographic programming, paused their public fellation of Donald Trump and explained why it was totally cool that they received millions of dollars in government assistance and personally benefitted from the “big government” and “welfare state” they publicly rail against.
“It is ironic that I am being attacked for investing my personal money in communities that badly need such investment and in which, I am sure, those attacking me have not invested their money,” Hannity wrote on their website. “The fact is, these are investments that I do not individually select, control, or know the details about; except that obviously I believe in putting my money to work in communities that otherwise struggle to receive such support.”
Hannity was responding to a report by the Guardian that showed they used government-insured mortgage loans to purchase some of the 877 properties valued at more than $90 million. Despite earning a reported $36 million per year, over the past decade, Hannity repeatedly used government assistance to purchase real estate and rent housing to people who live in low-income areas.
Let there be no mistake: This is welfare.
Take Hannity's two properties in Georgia, for instance. In 2014, Hannity bought properties in Perry and Brunswick, Ga. for $22.7 million. hannity borrowed $17.9 million of the money through a program under the National Housing Act created by the Obama Administration. As part of the program, the Department of Housing and Urban Development guarantees the loans up to a certain amount. If the owner rents the properties out to low-income families, the government guarantees a larger percentage of the loans. Since the Trump Administration took office, HUD has increased the loan guarantees.

But of course, someone as rich as Sean Hannity wouldn't need those guarantees, right?
Yet, since Ben Carson became the HUD secretary, Hannity took out new loans for higher amounts (22.9 million) through the Department of Housing and Urban Development for the Georgia apartment complexes. More interestingly, Carson now has the right to personally allow Hannity to convert the low-income apartments to luxury condominiums. Apparently Sean Hannity's greed is bigger than their head or their ego. Well ... maybe not their head, but you catch my drift.
You know that thing I just said about “more interestingly?” Forget about that. Here is the most interesting part: Hannity used a collection of shell companies that listed them as 100 percent owner but concealed their name to purchase these properties. Many of the properties were bought at a discount because Hannity capitalized off the foreclosure crisis while publicly blaming Obama for it.

While incentivizing rich people to invest in poorer communities sounds like a logical way to use taxpayer money, Hannity has long cast the idea of using taxpayer money or big government to help the poor in racist terms. Like the time they asked a black caller if they were voting for Obama so they could get an “Obama phone.”
Advertisement
But nothing highlights Hannity's hypocrisy like this clip from their show in 2012.
When discussing people with an entitlement mindset, Hannity told a caller:
I have a responsibility in my life to take care of my business and that means I've gotta pay my bills. And I'm not going to change my mindset. I don't want a thing from the government. Nothing... I would never want to be on a government housing program. I would never want to be on food stamps. I would never want the government to step in so I could keep my home.

Sean Hannity is a liar.
But this is par for the course for conservatives. They are quick to disparage big government and entitlements, except when it benefits them personally. They never refer to farm subsidies or corporate tax exemptions as “welfare.” They don't disparage tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations.
Conservatives' discussions of entitlements are always focused on immigrants and minorities, but when it comes to all government benefits, white people are the biggest beneficiaries. a 2017 study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that the percentage of white people lifted out of poverty by government programs is 44 percent, while the percentage is 35 percent for non-white minorities.

There is no such thing as “welfare.” A government subsidy is a government subsidy. And when it comes to big government money, white people are the ones who benefit.
97 Percent of USDA disaster payments go to white farmers. Even in counties where people of color are the majority, researchers estimate that at a minimum, almost 95 percent of agriculture subsidies go to white farmers. Blacks receive fewer small business loans than equally-qualified white borrowers. Black businesses get fewer government contracts than white-owned businesses.
And while a larger percentage of black people receive poverty assistance, whites make up 40 percent of the population of food stamp and SNAP recipients, while blacks are 25.7 percent.

Contrary to what Hannity and Fox News would have you believe, the typical recipient of government poverty assistance is poor and white. In fact, according to the Atlantic, a larger percentage of whites also want more government assistance and people who get government dollars are more likely to vote Republican.
So, despite the negative stereotype, the welfare state is largely white people. People who voted for Trump are more likely to recieve welfare. People like Sean Hannity. Which leads to the most important question:

Stocks Fade, Treasury Yields Jump After Report
NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks faded a bit from their record highs in early trading Friday, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index was on pace to snap its longest winning streak in four years. Treasury yields climbed after the government's monthly jobs report showed wages rose more than expected last month, which should keep the Federal Reserve on pace to continue raising interest rates.
The jobs report, often the most anticipated economic data of each month, was unusually difficult to parse after damage from recent hurricanes affected hiring from Texas to Florida, economists say.
KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell nearly 3 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,549, as of 10:00 a.m. Eastern time. If it stays there, it would be the first loss for the index in nine days.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 8, or less than 0.1 percent, to 22,767, and the Nasdaq composite was close to flat at 6,586. All three indexes closed at records on Thursday.
WASHOUT JOBS REPORT: Employers cut more jobs last month than they added, the first time that's happened in seven years. It's a sharp turnaround from earlier this year, when the strengthening job market was encouraging investors to push stocks higher and higher.
Economists had been warning of a particularly weak figure and cautioned not to take too much away from the report. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma meant the closure of thousands of businesses, and drops in employment at restaurants and bars were a big driver of last month's decline.
Other recent economic data have been more encouraging, including particularly strong reports on the nation's manufacturing and services sectors earlier this week.
Friday's jobs report contained some encouraging signs. Average hourly wages jumped 2.9 percent from a year earlier, more than economists expected. Some of that may be due to how many lower-wage jobs were lost following the hurricanes, but the government also revised up its figure for wage growth in August.
YIELDS RISE: Stronger wage growth could push up inflation and keep the Federal Reserve on its course to slowly raise interest rates off their record lows.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 2.39 percent from 2.35 percent late Thursday and touched its highest level since May.
The two-year yield climbed to 1.52 percent from 1.49 percent, and the 30-year yield rose to 2.94 percent from 2.89 percent.
FINANCIALS UP: Banks benefit from higher interest rates because they can mean bigger profits from making loans. Financial stocks in the S&P 500 rose 0.3 percent.
DIVIDENDS DOWN: Higher interest rates make bonds more attractive to investors looking for income, and that undercuts demand for stocks that pay relatively big dividends.
Telecom stocks in the S&P 500 fell 1.6 percent, by far the largest drop among the 11 sectors that make up the index. Other traditional dividend payers were also weak. Real estate stocks fell 0.9 percent, and utilities dropped 0.6 percent.
WAREHOUSE WEAKNESS: Costco Wholesale fell the most in the S&P 500 despite reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than expected. Analysts pointed to a slight drop in its membership renewal rates, among other factors.
Costco lost $9.11, or 5.5 percent, to $157.98.
COMMODITIES: Higher interest rates tend to mean less demand for gold, and the metal's price dropped $9.30 to $1,263.90 per ounce.
Silver fell 24 cents to $16.40 per ounce, and copper lost 2 cents to $3.03 per pound.
Benchmark U.S. crude sank $1.41, or 2.8 percent, to $49.38 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost $1.09 to $55.91 per barrel.
MARKETS OVERSEAS: The FTSE 100 in London rose 0.1 percent, France's CAC 40 fell 0.3 percent and Germany's DAX was close to flat.
Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.3 percent, and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 0.3 percent.
CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 113.38 Japanese yen from 112.85 yen late Thursday. The euro fell to $1.1696 from $1.1708, and the British pound fell to $1.3035 from $1.3116.
On April 3, 2017, a local junior curler got the experience of a lifetime. 11 year old Rayel Piquette, of the Cold Lake Curling Club, along with another junior curler from Leduc, escorted Team Japan onto the ice at the Ford World Men's Curling Championship as an Honorary Team Member.
At every curling event on the Season of Champions schedule, junior curlers associated with clubs in the region can apply to be a Junior Star, a program run in conjunction with Curling Canada. For this event applicants were required to answer, in 50 words or fewer, a simple question “Why would you like to be an Honorary Team Member with one of the teams at the Ford World Men's Curling Championship?
Rayel, along with 23 other junior curlers from across the Northern Alberta Curling Association, was chosen to be an Honorary Team Member of one of the twelve world qualifier curling teams. The prize package included a chance to meet the team, observe their pre-game practice from ice-level and take part in the pre-game ceremony.
According to Rayel, meeting Team Japan and being able to watch the pre-game practice was the best part of the experience. Other highlights were the tour of TSN's production area beneath the curling rinks and the souvenirs which included a Team Japan jersey from their skip, Yusuki Morozumi, and a new, autographed curling broom.
CANTON, Ohio (AP) — Police in Ohio say a woman whose body was discovered over the weekend was likely killed days earlier in a hit-and-run crash.
Sheriff's deputies in Stark County say the body of 44-year-old Kimberly Thompson, of Plain Township, was discovered alongside a road Sunday morning. They believe they were hit by a vehicle Thursday night.
Thompson had been reported missing on Friday.
Police continue to investigate.
MOSCOW: A meeting is planned between Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on the sidelines of a gathering of G20 foreign ministers in Germany, Russian Foreign Ministry's spokesperson said on Wednesday.
It will be the first time Lavrov meets their newly appointed counterpart and comes as U.S.-Russia relations are under particular scrutiny following the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, who pledged to improve ties with the Kremlin.
"A meeting is planned and being worked out," Russian Foreign Ministry's spokesperson Maria Zakharova told journalists in a briefing.
Prospects for better relations with Washington have suffered setbacks since Trump's inauguration including the resignation on Monday of national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was seen in Moscow as a leading advocate of softer U.S. policy on Russia.
Zakharova did not say what Lavrov and Tillerson planned to address in their meeting, but earlier comments from the foreign ministry suggested Syria would be a topic of discussion.

Zidane stuns Real Madrid by stepping down as coach
France goes through with history-making Mbappe too much for Peru
Real Madrid has denied reaching an agreement to sign France forward Kylian Mbappe from Paris Saint-Germain.
The Spanish club released a statement Wednesday calling reports of an agreement between Madrid and PSG "completely false."
Madrid says it "has not made any offer to PSG or the player and condemns the spreading of this type of information that has not been proven by the parties concerned."
The denial comes two days after Madrid dismissed a report that it had offered to buy Neymar from PSG for a world record transfer of 310 million euros ($360 million).
It said the report by Spanish public broadcaster TVE was "absolutely untrue."
PSG is under pressure from UEFA to raise cash from selling players. The French club needs to comply with "Financial Fair Play" rules which monitor overspending on transfers and wages.
PSG spent a record 222 million euros ($260 million) last year to buy Neymar from Barcelona.
UEFA warned the French champions three weeks ago they will "remain under close scrutiny" when they submit accounts for the financial year, which ended last Saturday.
Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo hinted after the Champions League final that they may leave the Spanish club. They have not talked about their club future since joining Portugal for the World Cup.

The U.S. women's hockey team owns Olympic gold for the first time in 20 years, after breaking Canada's remarkable streak of success in a gripping final at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. The only previous U.S. win had come in the tournament's first year, in 1998.
When the American women finally received their gold medals, they were placed on their necks by former player Angela Ruggiero — who was on the last U.S. Olympic team to win it all.
This game was far from easy — for the players on either side, and for their fans. Regulation time had ended with a 2-2 tie — and when a 20-minute overtime didn't produce a sudden-death goal, a penalty shootout also ended in a 2-2 tie. That sent it to a sudden-death shootout to decide who would wear gold.
Tweet
Canada had taken the first shot in the first round of the shootout — and to lead off the second, the U.S. sent Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson skating out.
"The last shootout against Canada, I looked like an idiot," Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson said after the game.
But since that past failure, the American said, she's been working on their penalty shots — and it showed on Thursday.
Starting from center ice, Lamoureux-Davidson used some artful stick handling to get the puck around and past Canada's goalie, changing directions several times. It confounded Canada's goalie Shannon Szabados, who had shone in this game.
Tweet
That left it to U.S. goalkeeper Maddie Rooney, 20, to withstand the pressure and make one last save — against one of the most adept scorers in the game, in Canada's Meghan Agosta, a veteran who began their Olympics career in 2006. When Rooney foiled Agosta's shot, both the game and the U.S. gold drought were over, after three hours of intense and physical play and tension at the Gangneung Hockey Center.
"We worked on this a lot. I was basically trying to do the same thing [as on their first, successful try in the shootout], but they were out too far," Agosta said later. "It just so happened it didn't work out the way I wanted it to."
"I just reacted to them and then everything kind of went into a blur," Rooney said, "When they cut across like that, a lot of people tend to go five holes so I kind of anticipated it."
After they made the save, Rooney said, "Everything got into a blur, seeing my teammates sprinting at me. It's an indescribable feeling."
Them teammates were scrambling over the bench wall; gloves were flying all over the ice as the Americans finally celebrated at the end of an Olympic tournament. When they reached Rooney, they piled on.
Tweet
"It was all black," the goalie said when asked to describe it. "I was on the bottom."
In shootouts, teams can choose any player to take the penalty shots. U.S. coach Robb Stauber said later, "We picked some of the right players because our players did well in the shootout. Certainly one better — and that's all it took."
U.S. forward Hilary Knight, who now has a gold medal to go with their two Olympic silvers, said, "This is an outstanding team. I think I'm sort of bittersweet right now that the journey is over just because these women are incredible and I really wish that you could be in the locker room to experience what we experienced. It's a dream come true."
For the first time in this millennium, the dream of gold died for Canada, and the pain of losing their way into a silver medal was evident on the faces of many players, who wept during the post-game ceremony. Most notably, Canada's Jocelyne Larocque took their silver medal off of their neck almost as soon as they received it.
"We were going for gold," the Canadian defender told reporters later. "We were chasing a gold medal."
OKEECHOBEE — Nine butterfly sculptures were unveiled in downtown Flagler Park on Saturday, June 30, by Okeechobee Main Street and the Arts and Culture Alliance of Okeechobee.
The sculptures were placed in Flagler Park No. 6 (across from Jersey Mike's), and mark the conclusion of the “Butterfly Sculpture in the Park” project that began in January to help bring awareness to the Hamrick Butterfly Garden as well as provide a free public work of art for the Okeechobee community.
The butterflies were painted and designed by local artists, Okeechobee High School students and residents at the Grand Oaks assisted living facility.
Arts and Culture Alliance Director Bridgette Waldau thanked everyone who helped put the project together at a ceremony before the unveiling.
“I have to thank Angie Griffin and Jonathan Holt at Main Street for keeping things together the past six months,” said Ms. Waldau. “Also the people at Grand Oaks and Adele Salas and their students at Okeechobee High School, as well as all the sponsors who donated time and money to make this possible.”
Randy Kelly, administrator at Grand Oaks, described the process of the high school students painting with residents at their facility.
“Seeing the residents paint butterflies twice a week has been absolutely amazing,” Mr. Kelly said. “Our residents had a great time interacting with the students as they painted. The students were very patient and made our residents feel at ease. It gives our residents a sense of accomplishment and dignity to be included in such a special project for our town.”
Grand Oaks residents George Corbin, Sam Smith, Jean Wallace, Ruth Durham and Doris Minton all contributed to the butterfly sculpture project.
Okeechobee High School students Chelsea Burgos and Rodolfo Juarez IV worked with the Grand Oaks residents and designed two of the butterfly sculptures.
The other butterflies were designed by Okeechobee artists Dana Vines, Kathy Scott, Diane Hall, Fawn Barr, Angie Griffin and Ms. Waldau.
Mill Iron Metalworks provided the metal templates for the butterfly sculptures.
The unveiling was attended by many Okeechobee government officials, including Mayor Dowling Watford, County Commissioners Bryant Culpepper,
Terry Burroughs and David Hazellief, City Councilman Noel Chandler and Okeechobee County Sheriff Noel Stephen.
“Bridgette has done a remarkable job in bringing in culture to this community,” Commissioner Burroughs said. “Some of us understand that bringing in culture can be very difficult sometimes. For example, I had to explain to my classmate, Dowling, what culture exactly was. Sooner or later they were able to understand it, though. But I think Bridgette has done an extraordinary job, and we all owe them our thanks.”
Mayor Watford was impressed with the sculptures and the great turnout for the event. They also took Commissioner Burrough's jabs about culture in stride with a smile.
“Like Terry said, I don't know a lot about culture,” explained Mayor Watford. “I thought culture meant you watched PBS every once in a while. But I appreciate everyone for coming out to support this. This just shows you what Okeechobee is all about. I don't know about you, but I am so proud to be a part of the City of Okeechobee.”
The City of Okeechobee Public Works Department helped to prepare the butterfly garden with concrete pads for the sculptures to be placed on, as well as trimming, mulching, clearing and installing benches.
Okeechobee Main Street is hopeful that the new sculptures will help bring visitors into the downtown area.

RIYADH: Saudi Arabia said on Monday (Dec 11) it will trim crude exports to Asian customers in January to help accelerate the rebalancing of the international oil market.
An energy ministry spokesperson said state-owned Aramco will maintain "steady supplies to the United States and Europe while exports to Asia will be reduced by more than 100,000 barrels per day" from December's production levels.
"This is in line with our continued demonstration of keeping to, and in fact, exceeding, our commitments under the declaration of cooperation," they said in reference to the deal by producers to cut production by 1.8 million bpd.
The agreement was last month extended until the end of 2018 in a bid to remove a supply glut from the market that has sent oil prices crashing.
About 24 producing countries, including all 14 members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC Russia, the world's top producer, are signatories to the deal.
"We hope that by leading by example, our partners from OPEC and non-OPEC will do the same in order to keep conformity levels above 100 percent and accelerate the rebalancing of the market," the spokesperson said.

The deal has helped oil prices to rebound from below US$30 a barrel at the start of last year to more than US$60 a barrel currently.

The Colts announced they signed free agent tight end Eric Ebron on Monday. Adam Schefter of ESPN reports it's a two-year deal worth up to $15 million.
Ebron, 24, gives the Colts a pass-catching complement to Jack Doyle. Doyle caught 80 passes last season, while Ebron caught 53.
Ebron also visited the Panthers.
The 10th overall choice in 2014, they started 37 games and made 186 receptions for 2,070 yards and 11 touchdowns. The Lions cut them rather than pay them $8.25 million this season.
The Lions, meanwhile, continue to search for tight ends after losing both Ebron and Darren Fells.

The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) says it will appeal Monday's ruling of the Court of Appeal which held that the agency lacked powers to investigate or prosecute serving judicial officials.
The Lagos division of the court delivered the judgment in a case between the EFCC and a judge of the Federal High Court, Hydiazira Nganjiwa.
The appellate court held that only judicial officers that have been dismissed by the National Judicial Council could be tried or investigated by the commission.

In a statement on Monday, spokesperson of the EFCC, Mr Wilson Uwujaren, said the commission considered the ruling as a “dangerous precedent that has no basis in law”.
Uwujaren said the EFCC was confident that the Supreme Court would upturn the judgment.
“Criminal trial takes precedence over administrative procedures and it is strange that the Court of Appeal wants to put the cart before the horse.
“This is ridiculous! The appellate court simply wants to confer immunity on public officers from prosecution for corruption; it will not stand,” they said.
Cannabis Energy Drink is on sale right now in Connecticut and raising some eyebrows in Enfield.
The Mobile on King Street is displaying a bright green Cannabis Energy Drink can sign at the station and some say it is the first they have ever seen or heard of the product.
“I didn't even know there was a Cannabis Energy Drink,” Jamie Burnside of Enfield said.
According to its website Cannabis Energy Drink contains hemp seed extract, caffeine, taurine and a “bunch of B vitamins.” It does not contain THC and causes no narcotics effect.
Kyle Norris has tried the drink before and agrees.
“It doesn't give any effects or anything like that it is just an energy drink,” said Norris.
Despite their assessment, Norris says they aren't sold on the idea of their own daughter drinking it.
“You don't want 7 to 12 year olds running around drinking Cannabis (saying) ‘try this man','' Norris said.
While Burnside believes the word Cannabis is a now a “common place” word, but says they would still want to look into the product.
“If my kids were younger I would definitely dig in and found out what it's all about,” they said.
Video Evacuation Lifted for 200K Threatened by California Dam
The Cannabis Energy Drink website tries to clear up any questions people might have. It reads:
The confusion (and concern) can be attributed to the fact that hemp seeds/oil is derived from the Cannabis Sativa plant which is linked to marihuana. Marihuana contains large amounts of THC. The amounts of THC in hemp seeds and oil are so small they can be considered non-measurable.
The product is 100 percent legal, but parents are not completely sold.
“Promote if you need to, but I think it's the parent's choice to watch what they give their children,” Norris said.
NBC Connecticut has reached out to Cannabis Energy Drink headquarted in the Netherlands.
0 Abby Lee Miller confirms battle against cancer
Former “Dance Moms” reality TV star Abby Lee Miller finished their federal prison sentence, but now they have a much tougher trial ahead.
Miller, who was released on Friday from a federal reentry center after serving most of a 366-day sentence for bankruptcy fraud, was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma last month, according to People magazine, which also reported they needed emergency spinal surgery.
In an Instagram post this weekend, Miller confirmed that report.
“Now I have to handle the aftermath/ treatment/ physical rehabilitation of 10 hour emergency spine surgery to remove a mass from strangling my spinal cord and the horrible severity of what that mass turned out to be!” they wrote.
TRENDING NOW:
Two days later, they posted again, this time appearing in a photo in a hospital room, where they were joined by JoJo Siwa, who appeared on “Dance Moms” with Miller and is now a singer and Nickelodeon star.
“So glad @itsjojosiwa came to visit me today! The whole fam was there to wish me well! Thank you to the Siwa Family for all the beautiful gifts and real popcorn from the movie theater too!” they wrote.
Siwa posted similar photos the same day, including one of Miller holding an oversized check for $10,000.
“When I went to visit Abby I gave them lots of surprises, But the best surprise there was happened with the help of @imadanceragainstcancer. We gave Abby a donation of $10,000!” Siwa wrote.

SINGAPORE: The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) will sound the "Important Message" signal through Public Warning System (PWS) sirens islandwide at 6.20pm on Wednesday (Feb 15) as part of Total Defence (TD) Day.
"Do not be alarmed by the minute-long sounding exercise," SCDF said in a media release on Wednesday.
The signal will also sound on all smartphones with the SGSecure mobile app that are not on silent or vibration mode. The signal will stop after 20 seconds or once the message is acknowledged, and the user will receive a brief text on the PWS sounding, SCDF added.
The PWS siren is sounded at 6.20pm on Feb 15 to mark the time of the British's surrender to Japanese Imperial Forces in 1942.
"(This) serves to give due significance and remembrance to this historical moment. It also underscores the importance of emergency preparedness and for Singaporeans to defend our homeland," SCDF said.
Touching on the siren sounding in a Facebook post yesterday, Minister for Defence Ng Eng Hen had said that the sirens were sounded on Feb 15 every year to declare Singapore's resolve for Total Defence and signal the important role every Singaporean play in building up the pillars of Total Defence.
Members of the public can find out more about the PWS signals at the SCDF website.
Saudi Arabia is preparing to outlaw sexual harassment, officials said Tuesday, less than a month before the conservative kingdom lifts its decades-long ban on women driving.
The kingdom's Shura Council, which advises the cabinet, approved a draft law on Monday which would introduce a prison term of up to five years and a penalty of 300,000 riyals ($80,000).
The draft bill “is a very important addition to the history of regulations in the kingdom”, Shura Council member Latifa al-Shaalan was quoted as saying in an information ministry statement.
“It fills a large legislative vacuum, and it is a deterrent,” they added.
The kingdom's driving ban on women is slated to end June 24, as part of a highly publicised liberalisation drive launched by powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who styles themselves as a progressive reformer.
The prince has also lifted a decades-long ban on cinemas, allowed mixed-gender concerts and clipped the powers of the long-feared religious police.
But the social reforms appear overshadowed by the recent arrests of at least 11 activists, mostly identified by rights groups as veteran women campaigners for the right to drive and to end the conservative country's male guardianship system.
Authorities have accused the activists of “suspicious contact with foreign parties”, providing financial support to “enemies” and attempting to undermine the kingdom's “security and stability”.
Reports in state-backed media branded some of the detainees traitors and “agents of embassies”.
At least four detained activists were released last week, campaigners including Amnesty International said, but the fate of the others remains unclear.
“Given the significant loosening of certain restrictions on women's activities in Saudi Arabia… it is perplexing why both women and men engaged in campaigning for such positive developments are now being targeted by the authorities,” the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement.
“If, as it appears, their detention is related solely to their work as human rights defenders and activists on women's issues, they should be released immediately.”
Saudi authorities have so far not commented publicly on the detentions.

LATEST UPDATE:>>
STATEMENT BY THE COUNTY POLICE COMMANDER KERICHO FOLLOWING ALLEGED HARASSMENT OF A LADY MOTORIST BY A FEMALE POLICE OFFICER.
My attention has been drawn to video clips circulating in social media showing a lady motorist being physically harassed by a female police officer. Upon receipt of the same, I instituted investigations into the incident. The initial information is that the incident occurred on 1/1/2017 at about 3.00pm near Brooke area, a short distance from Kericho town.
The lady motorist had been flagged down by our traffic officers for exceeding speed in an area with a designated speed of 50kph.

An inquiry file has been opened to clearly establish the circumstances of the incident and our findings will be made public and appropriate action will be taken against anybody found to be on the wrong.
Meanwhile, the concerned officer has been interdicted from duty in order to pave way for investigations. I can also report that the concerned lady has been traced and is cooperating well with the investigations team….

BRITAIN is set to be hit by a megastorm today – unleashing rain, hail and dangerous lightning strikes.
The two-day deluge brings with it a government “danger to life” warning as powerful downpours and wind threatens to close roads and cause travel chaos. It will hit this morning at rush hour amid warnings to stay indoors during lightning strikes. Numerous inches of rain will be dumped on the UK in minutes with homes and businesses expected to face flooding.
GETTY/WEATHER OUTLOOK DELUGE: Huge storms are set to hit the UK today

HONOLULU (AP) — The ex-Hawaii employee who sent a false missile alert last month says he's devastated about causing panic, but they believed it was a real attack at the time.
The man in their 50s spoke to reporters Friday on the condition they not be identified because they fear for their safety after receiving threats.
They say the on-duty call they received on Jan. 13 didn't sound like a drill. However, state officials say other workers clearly heard the word “exercise” repeated several times.
They said it felt like they had been hit with a “body blow” when they realized it was just a drill and they have had difficulty eating and sleeping since.
The agency fired him.
Donald Trump has accused bosses at the FBI and Justice Department of ‘politicising' investigations in favour of the Democrats.
It comes as they were set to approve the release of a controversial memo which is likely to inflame tensions further between the President and the bureau.
The confidential memo, drafted by the Republicans, accuses the FBI of abusive surveillance tactics in its investigation into alleged links between their White House campaign team and Russia.
The four-page document is also said to allege FBI misconducts in the initial stages of its inquiry.
But the bureau says it has “grave concerns about material omissions of fact” in the memo which could be released on Friday.
The President claimed leading investigators were biased against their Republican party.
They tweeted: “The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans – something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago.”
They added: “Rank & File are great people!”
Democrats and critics in the intelligence community say the planned release of the memo is a stunt.
They claim it uses very selective information that cannot be countered publicly without revealing more secrets about government intelligence operations.
They say the ultimate goal of the memo, with the President's support, is to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Moscow.
There is speculation that if the document is released, it could lead to high-level resignations in US law enforcement agencies, including FBI director Christopher Wray.
They were appointed by Mr Trump after the President fired predecessor James Comey.
Anne Arundel County Health Officer Dr. Jinlene Chan has accepted a permanent position with the Maryland Department of Health after serving as acting deputy secretary since May 2017.
Chan accepted an assistant secretary position, meaning they are officially leaving behind their role as county health officer. They have served as the county's health officer since 2012.
“Anne Arundel County has been blessed to have such a dedicated health professional like Jinlene serving our citizens,” County Executive Steve Schuh said in a statement. “We will miss their dedication in the fight against the opioid epidemic and their passion for improving the health of all our residents.”
Fran Phillips has served as the county's acting health officer since Chan took the temporary and now permanent position with the state. In December, the Anne Arundel County Council approved a resolution extending Phillips' time as health officer from December 2017 through 2018.
Phillips previously served as the county's health officer from 1993 to 2008, when they left to take a position with the state.
The county's health officer position has been in the spotlight while Anne Arundel battles rising opioid overdoses and deaths. While health officer, Chan chaired the county's Opioid Senior Policy Group and Fatal Overdose Review Team.
The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, Alaska's premier wilderness challenge, begins this weekend mired in scandals.
There's fallout from a dog doping fiasco, a musher mutiny, and unprecedented pressure from protest groups. All of which, according to a leaked report, are putting the event's future in dire jeopardy.
Saturday marks the "ceremonial start" of the race, when the streets of downtown Anchorage fill with more than a thousand yapping sled dogs. Looking on from the snowy sidewalks are tourists, townies, and mushing fans outfitted in their finest furs. The festivities arrive at the tail end of the city's annual Fur Rondy, a week of events harkening back to a yearly rendezvous among fur trappers, where pelts and antlers are sold openly in the streets. By the time the Iditarod kicks off, the vibe is somewhere between a parade and a dog pageant, with notes of a folksy rural carnival.
The next day, dozens of competitors set out on the grueling journey over snowy mountains, icy rivers, and frozen tundra toward the tiny town of Nome on the Bering Sea coast. As the race has grown increasingly competitive in recent years, top teams make the trek in between eight and nine days.
But this year's race is up against extra challenges, as multiple controversies have crashed down with near simultaneity.
The most high-profile one involves mushing star Dallas Seavey who has been embroiled in the sport's first doping scandal after it came out that some of their dogs tested positive for a banned painkiller at the end of last year's race.
Seavey vigorously denies that they drugged their team, and faults the Iditarod's board of directors for mishandling the investigation, hurting their reputation in the process.
The scandal drove Seavey to post a 17-minute video on YouTube lashing out at race leadership.
"The Iditarod can try to run me over, they can try to throw me under the bus," said Dallas Seavey, a musher wunderkind who won the race four times before they were 30 years old. In the Oct. 23 video they speak directly into a camera. "They're going to find out I don't fit under the bus."
"There is part of this race that is a cancer right now," Seavey says in the video, alluding to the Iditarod Trail Committee's board. "There is a corruption in this race."
Seavey snubbed this year's Iditarod, and is competing in a Norwegian race that runs at the same time. They have also pushed back on the damning doping narrative by hiring a public relations firm, casting doubt on science behind the drug tests, and aggressively defending their record in the press.
So how did high levels of Tramadol, a widely prescribed opioid, get into four of Seavey's dogs within hours of their arrival in Nome last year?
Theories abound.
"I believe this was given to my dogs maliciously," Seavey says. "I think that's the most likely option."
The idea that a saboteur drugged Seavey's dogs is accepted by many in Alaska's mushing community. Some believe it could have been an unintentional accident. Some think it might have been a rival competitor. And others point to animal rights activists, who have done more in recent years to take down the Iditarod's public image. Leading that charge is People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA. The group says it did not have any personnel in Alaska last year, and condemns dogs being given banned substances. But the group is escalating its tactics by leaning harder than ever on corporate sponsors to drop their support for the event.
"One of the biggest lies that the Iditarod community has tried to sell the public is that these dogs aren't like the dogs we share our homes with, and it's not true," says Colleen O'Brien, a spokesperson for PETA.
The group wants the Iditarod to become a race without dogs, saying too many animals have died as a result of competition, and that mushing is inherently abusive. It claims that sponsor flight is taking a toll on the Iditarod's financial health. And this year, for the first time ever, they are sending protesters to Alaska, with demonstrations planned in Anchorage and at the finish in Nome.
On top of all that, earlier in February a prominent group of race veterans called for the president of the board of directors to resign immediately. Members of the Iditarod Official Finisher's Club sent a letter alleging their mismanagement and conflicts of interest they say are jeopardizing the whole sport.
The demand came on the heels of a confidential report commissioned by the race's main sponsors leaked to the press. It pointed to many of the same problems, saying the board needs major reforms for companies to remain comfortable financing it. Following a closed door meeting, ITC board members voted unanimously to leave president Andy Baker (who's brother, John Baker, is a champion Iditarod musher) at the helm for the time being.
"Everybody wants the race to do better," Baker told reporters after the meeting. "Our whole focus is we want to have a safe race. We want dogs to be safe, we want mushers to be safe, and we want a successful race that's good for Alaska."
Baker says the board is planning to revise its governing rules in the spring, once this year's race is over. That opens the door for reforming leadership practices that have been recently criticized.
Many in the mushing world are pining for the old days, when the Iditarod was more like a weeks-long wilderness adventure than a race.
"There's a big part of me that feels that way," says Stan Hooley, Iditarod's CEO. "Unfortunately I'm in the business, and in the role of working to grow this race."
Some people say that means the Iditarod isn't as fun anymore — that the race doesn't resemble the state-wide celebration it used to be. But others say the global audience and increase in corporate money that it has drawn could be what carries dog mushing on into the future.

The second installment of Blade Runner , in theaters now, is set in Los Angeles, 30 years after the original film. It's 2049 in a space-like, industrialist world that looks like Mad Max: Fury Road set in the Soviet Union, and older versions of humanoid robots are being hunted by Blade Runners like K ( Ryan Gosling ), who's one of the new humanoid models. Yet where flying cars and holographs thrive, many things of the past remain wholly intact—especially the patriarchy.
I was so busy melting into Gosling's sad puppy eyes that I nearly missed the futuristic—and yet, archaic—displays of misogyny present throughout the film. But not only is misogyny alive and well in 2049, it's a burgeoning, profitable business. (Warning: Major spoilers ahead, including the ending.)
You see, 20 years earlier Niander Wallace, a corrupt industrialist scientist (played by Jared Leto), engineered technology in genetically modified food that ended the global crisis. Now, in 2049, he's the scientist and business tycoon responsible for the new model of humanoids. They have bigger, creepier goals, though: Wallace dreams of a return to humanoid slavery and enlists Luv, their strongest female model, as a henchwoman.
Their other patents hold less gravitas but are just as sinister. Wallace owns a product line of objectively perfect female holographs that can be used for sexual entertainment or—like the one K owns—as household helpers, cooking in '50s-style aprons and speaking obsequiously to their owners. These holographs exist to serve men, but the objectification and gratuitous female nudity doesn't end there: Unnecessarily naked women also monopolize entertainment in futuristic L.A. The city is riddled with pornographic holographs, and gigantic advertisements are projected on skyscrapers all over town. In one scene a 10-story-high, glowing pink holograph speaks seductively to K; she's completely naked for no foreseeable reason. Sex workers and scantily clad K-Pop gogo dancers decorate the streets, all for the purpose of male pleasure.

At one point, K ventures into a deserted city that appears to have been some sort of Las Vegas-like entertainment hub—it's a ghost town adorned with Sphinx-sized sculptures of nude women in high heels. Inside an empty nightclub, a broken holographic entertainment system is stuck in an endless, buffering loop—and yet it still finds ways to show Elvis, fully dressed in all their glory, alongside promiscuous, feather-laden showgirls.
But seedy entertainment is actually the most innocuous display of female nudity in Blade Runner 2049 ; violent female deaths are run-of-the-mill in this movie. The most disturbing scene is a man-meeting-his-creation moment between Wallace and their new female model. It's tough to watch as a fetal, naked woman smothered in synthetic amniotic fluid falls brutally out of their suspended packaging and Wallace tells them to stand. The shaking, frightened woman obliges, and they proceed to fondle their abdomen—which visibly upsets them They forcefully plant a kiss on the model while Luv watches, silently shedding a tear at the horrifying mistreatment of their kind. In all the naked woman's fear and vulnerability, Wallace viciously stabs them in the stomach and watches them bleed out on the floor, even drawing pleasure from the moment. Their behavior sends a clear message: In this world, women are nameless, faceless, disposable beings, able to be used, murdered, or subjugated.
In fact, every female protagonist in the movie is met with a violent death. Most notably, Luv is strangled for what feels like forever. The scene is meant to evoke triumph and satisfaction, but it felt unnecessarily graphic and dragged out. (Female strangulation is ubiquitous in action films, though—see: Mystique in X-Men: Apocalypse , both Black Widow and Maria Stark in Captain America: Civil War , and Bridget von Hammersmark in Inglourious Basterds —so, it wasn't shocking.)
Too often, female characters function as plot devices to motivate the male protagonists, and the majority of the women of Blade Runner 2049 are used and disposed of as such. Even the sex scenes in Blade Runner 2049 get weird. Take the ménage à trois between K, their holograph Joi (Ana de Armas), and sex worker Mariette (played by Mackenzie Davis). In order to synthesize real intercourse with K, Joi recruits a sex worker to “sync” with—like a poltergeist, Joi possesses Mariette and takes their human form. However, the effect isn't perfect: Joi and Mariette merge into a version of a woman that resembles both of them. When Mariette moves quickly, Joi lags behind, thus leaving the effect of having sex with two women at once. This eerie display of the male gaze was gauche and left me feeling sticky.
Pinterest PHOTO: Warner Bros.
I know what you're thinking: "What about the men in this movie?" Not one male protagonist dies in this film—though, to be fair, there was one shot that panned past an unfinished humanoid model's penis. Literally one.
But hope is not entirely lost. The most badass character of the movie is Luv, who wears Google Glass–like shades that allow them to lead a remote missile strike. Using voice commands like, “fire” and, “do your fucking job,” Luv sat comfortably in their lair while apathetically getting a manicure. Total villain goals.
And while many parts of Blade Runner: 2049 felt timely and reflective of modern-day America (like the corrupt, kleptocratic business tycoon), the most striking parallel was the female-led revolution. Freysa, a rebel robot, and their squad of undercover sex workers (including Mariette) form a Resistance against Wallace, which I'm assuming we'll see play out in the third installment of the series. So while this installment may have been exhaustingly chauvinistic, I have a feeling the next will seek retribution. Now that is a future I look forward to.
BEIJING: A court in northern China on Tuesday jailed for 20 years a former senior provincial government official who bribed a now disgraced former aide to retired president Hu Jintao, state news agency Xinhua reported.
The court in Tianjin found that Pan Yiyang abused their positions as vice governor of the northern region of Inner Mongolia and Communist Party boss of Ganzhou in the eastern province of Jiangxi and took bribes, the agency said.
Between 2000 and 2013, Xinhua said, Pan "many times" offered bribes totalling 7.6 million yuan (US$1.10 million) to Ling Jihua, a close aide to former president Hu, who retired in 2013, to be succeeded by President Xi Jinping.
Ling was jailed for life last year after being found guilty of taking bribes, illegally obtaining state secrets and abuse of power, at a secret trial, where their wife testified against him.
The Tianjin court found that Pan had cooperated in the investigation against him, admitted their guilt and had repented, meaning they were given a lighter sentence, Xinhua added.
It was not possible to reach a legal, or family, representative of Pan for comment. Courts are controlled by the party and generally do not challenge party accusations of corruption against senior former officials.
Xi has launched a sweeping war against deep-seated corruption since taking office more than four years ago, warning, like others before him, that the problem is so bad it could affect the party's grip on power.
Dozens of senior officials have been jailed, including the feared former state security chief, Zhou Yongkang.

When it comes to new vaping regulations, the Ontario government is not ready to inhale.
The Doug Ford government has hit pause on changes to the Smoke Free Ontario Act that were to have come into effect on July 1.
“The government will work with the public, experts and businesses to re-examine the evidence related to vaping as a smoking cessation tool to ensure that any changes are in the best interests of everyone and protect Ontarians' health and safety,” Simon Jefferies, a spokesperson for Ford, said in an email Wednesday.
“The current provisions in the Smoke Free Ontario Act and the Electronic Cigarettes Act remains in effect and will continue to be enforced.”
Vapor Advocates of Ontario (VAO) issued a statement praising the Ford government's actions.
“The provincial regulations need to align with Health Canada's stance on vaping as a less harmful alternative to smoking to ensure the industry is clear on the legal expectations from both levels of governments,” Shaun Casey, president of the Canadian Vaping Association, said.
The previous provincial Liberal government, under former premier Kathleen Wynne, had planned to replace the Smoke-Free Ontario Act and Electronic Cigarettes Act with a single new version of the Smoke-Free Ontario Act covering both tobacco and vaping.
The new legislation would have banned vaping everywhere smoking is disallowed, and expanded the prohibition zone to outdoor restaurants, bar patios, and around schools or children and youth recreational facilities.
The same strict rules for selling tobacco would have applied to vaping products, according to Smoke-Free Ontario.
Vaping advocates, including PC MPP Randy Hillier, have challenged the new rules, arguing vaping is an effective and safe way for smokers to quit.
Both sides in the debate have said they do not want to encourage youth to take up vaping, although many of the flavours available are similar to candy or other treats.

The temporary pilot project has the support of the Nelson Police Department and Interior Health

An overdose prevention site pilot project that operated in Nelson for four days earlier this month will return for another four days in June.
ANKORS ran the site in the parking lot of its 101 Baker St. location from May 22 to 25. Fourteen people used the service a total of 40 times during that time span, in which there were no overdoses.
The project, which is endorsed but not funded by the Interior Health Authority, was made public Tuesday during a meeting of the Nelson Fentanyl Task Force.
Chief Paul Burkart said the site also has the support of the Nelson Police Department.
“When (ANKORS) first came to me, I had a shocked look on my face, the same that most people do,” said Burkart. “But when I looked into it, it just made sense.
“We're dealing with the people who are already downtown, the site is downtown, the people are coming from mere blocks away from the site itself. If they weren't doing the drugs there, they are doing it behind your business or in the bathroom of the restaurant you and your kids are in. Or they are doing it in the park nearby. So they are here and they are doing it. We're just giving them a place to do it.”
Ten volunteers worked two shifts a day, with one paramedic or nurse onsite at all times. One volunteer also stayed overnight at the location as a security measure.
Alex Sherstobitoff, the Rise Up Community Engagement project co-ordinator at ANKORS, said the organization decided to move forward with the site after an overdose death two months ago they described as the final straw.
“People die here,” they said. “I've worked in this field for 18 years here in the Kootenays and I can't count how many people who have died from overdose and in particular over the last few years. Then when you hear about somebody who is 20 years old … it just kills me. We need to do something more about this.”

Unlike safe injection sites such as Vancouver's Insite, overdose prevention sites like the one in Nelson aren't permanent. There are 27 such locations in B.C., including ones in Kelowna and Kamloops.
Burkart said they initially sought out advice from police in Victoria where overdose prevention sites exist.
“The first word out of the inspector's mouth was fantastic,” said Burkart. “He talked about their four sites that they have down there. They didn't do a lot of the things that people were worried about, that they would attract crime, a bunch of drug addicts sitting around in their community, that there would be overdoses happening outside. None of that happened. There wasn't drug dealing going on outside these places.”
It's unclear how long ANKORS will continue with the project.
Currently the site is scheduled to re-open June 26 to 30. Sherstobitoff said the ANKORS will require core funding to ensure it continues. An estimated $60,000 to $100,000 is needed to run the site per year, according to ANKORS executive director Cheryl Dowden.
Burkart, however, said they expect the site will be in Nelson for the foreseeable future.
“The bottom line is hopefully in the future once these other measures, treatment and education, go on we might not need these overdose prevention sites. But the reality is we do now.”

Quarterback Kirk Cousins got the franchise tag again this year, but they lost a couple of their most frequent targets during free agency.
Wide receivers DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garçon each left the Redskins to sign with other teams, taking 135 catches, 2,046 yards and seven touchdowns with them. Terrelle Pryor has arrived as a free agent and the team has high hopes that 2016 first-round pick Josh Doctson can be healthy and productive, but the changes may have some wondering if the team can duplicate its offensive success from the last two seasons.
Wide receiver Jamison Crowder believes that they could be even better this time around.
“It can still be very explosive, like the previous years I've been here,” Crowder said, via ESPN.com. “Pryor put up big numbers with the Browns, and Doctson, everyone is anxious to see what they bring to the table. I have faith in them that he'll be a huge weapon, and [tight ends] Jordan Reed and Vernon Davis. The offense can still be explosive, if not more than it was last year.”
The Redskins were third in yards last year and 12th in points, so closing that gap would be a step in the right direction. Explosiveness is one way to do that, but scoring touchdowns on more than 45 percent of their trips to the red zone would also be a pretty good place to start showing that things remain well on offense.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has decried the lack of a single radiotherapy machine for cancer treatment in 28 African countries.
Yukiya Amano, Director-General of IAEA, said millions of people continued to suffer from cancer in developing countries, due to lack of access to effective prevention, screening, early diagnosis and treatment.
Mr. Amano, at an event commemorating World Cancer Day, called for continued efforts to ensure greater access to vital cancer services to prevent millions of people from cancer deaths annually.
“Twenty-eight African countries do not have a single radiotherapy machine”, they said. They did not identify the countries.
“The IAEA will continue to work hard to change that, and to improve facilities in other regions of the world where the need is also great.
“We will strive to continuously improve the services we offer our Member States so they can provide better care – and hope – for their people,” they stressed.
They noted that addressing the challenges confronting the developing world would remain a priority for the agency.
Globally, cancer is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with approximately 14 million new cases and eight million cancer-related deaths annually.
There are concerns that the number of new cases could rise by about 70 per cent over the next 20 years.
Observed every year on Feb. 4, World Cancer Day aims to raise awareness on the broad class of disease which can affect any part of the body.
It also increased global burden that cancer inflicts on people – both poor and rich.
This year, the observation includes a discussion on applications of nuclear techniques in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer, as well as one on importance of multidisciplinary team for optimal cancer care.
The commemoration also includes a “health fair” showcasing a variety of information and services including detection of various types of cancer, including breast, prostate, colon, and skin cancer.
It is being held at the Vienna International Centre Rotunda.
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), between 30 to 50 per cent of cancers can currently be prevented by avoiding risk factors and implementing existing evidence-based prevention strategies.
These risk factors include tobacco use including cigarettes and smokeless tobacco; being overweight or obese; unhealthy diet with low fruit and vegetable intake; and lack of physical activity alcohol use.
Others are sexually transmitted Human papillomavirus (HPV)-infection; infection by hepatitis or other carcinogenic infections; ionizing and ultraviolet radiation; urban air pollution; and indoor smoke from household use of solid fuels.
Tobacco use is the single most important risk factor for cancer and is responsible for approximately 22 per cent of cancer-related deaths globally, WHO said.
The cancer burden could also be reduced through early detection of cancer and management of patients who develop cancer.
Some prevention strategies, according to WHO, could include increase avoidance of the risk factors listed above; and vaccination against HPV and hepatitis B viruses.
Others are controlling occupational hazards; and reducing exposure to ultraviolet radiation and ionizing radiation, while many cancers have a high chance of cure if diagnosed early and treated adequately.
“When identified early, cancer is more likely to respond to effective treatment and can result in a greater probability of surviving, less morbidity, and less expensive treatment,” WHO said in a fact-sheet.
The global health agency noted that significant improvements could be made in the lives of cancer patients by detecting cancer early and avoiding delays in care.
HONG KONG: Asian teams weren't expected to make an impact at the World Cup but a record points haul and some stunning performances against top sides have lifted their hopes for Qatar 2022.
South Korea's 2-0 dethroning of defending champions Germany could have been viewed as a one-off, if not for Japan's heartbreaking defeat to star-studded Belgium days later in the last 16.

Iran also came desperately close to beating Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal, the European title-holders, in another sign that smaller teams may be closing the gap on the game's traditional powers.
None of the Asian Football Confederation teams reached the quarter-finals, extending a barren run which stretches back to the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea.
But Japan, South Korea and Iran departed Russia with their heads held high and positive expectations for Qatar 2022, when the World Cup returns to AFC territory for the first time in 20 years.
"The AFC nations can take great encouragement from this year's World Cup," Andy Jackson of FourFourTwo magazine told AFP.

"(They) can look forward to 2022 and an AFC-hosted World Cup in Qatar with the hope of being one of the nations causing some of the famous upsets we've seen so far in Russia."
AFC teams amassed 15 points in Russia, their best showing yet - and overshadowing Africa's representatives Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Tunisia and Senegal, who went home after the group stage with 11 points between them.

'STAND WITH THE WORLD'S ELITE'
However, Saudi Arabia, another AFC side, never recovered from their 5-0 spanking by Russia in the tournament's opening game, and Australia - the Asian champions - also had a World Cup to forget.
Despite looking competitive in their group games against France, Denmark and Peru, the Socceroos failed to win a game and they went home without scoring a goal from open play.
Out of the Asian teams, Japan emerged with the most credit after they reached the last 16 and were 2-0 up against Belgium with 21 minutes to go - before the Belgians launched one of the great World Cup comebacks, clinching a 3-2 win in injury time.
"Japan showed great quality and character to battle bravely with one of the best teams in the tournament," said AFC president Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa.
"Their success exemplifies the great progress of Asian teams to stand proud with the world's elite."
Japan's image was also burnished by images of their fans tidying up stadiums after games -- while a picture of Japan's spotless changing room, with a thank-you note in Russian, went viral after the Belgium defeat.
"This Japanese team and its supporters left with their heads held high and their standing and respect in world football greatly enhanced," Jackson said.
Sometimes change comes so slowly it's almost impossible to notice. But the second I stepped onto the red carpet at Sunday night's 90th Academy Awards, it was easy to spot how quickly the Oscars have evolved.
The array of awards presenters, nominees and winners has for decades looked nothing like the country or the world: The Academy Awards have been dominated by white men. But last night, the ceremony was populated by women, people of color and from underrepresented groups. And they were celebrated loudly. Much of the biggest applause along the red carpet went to the black men and women from the cast of “Black Panther,” which could be a player at next year's Academy Awards.
And it wasn't simply who was in attendance: among the people either not invited or unwilling to attend were four men linked to purported sexual abuse and harassment: Harvey Weinstein, James Franco, Kevin Spacey and Casey Affleck. What's more, only a smattering of prominent female nominees and presenters stopped to talk with Ryan Seacrest, from “E! Live From the Red Carpet,” because he, too, is facing allegations of sexual harassment.
Once the show began, the Time's Up and Me Too movements were as prominent across the evening as was the best picture and director winner “The Shape of Water.” From where I sat, the most emotional moment of the ceremony had nothing to do with a winning film or nominated song performance. Instead, it was when alleged Weinstein victims Ashley Judd, Annabella Sciorra and Salma Hayek took the stage to talk about Hollywood's treatment of women and minorities. Mira Sorvino was prominently featured in a video montage the three actores introduced — a notable inclusion as Sorvino's career was essentially killed when they reportedly wouldn't indulge Weinstein's predatory behavior.
Ultimately, Oscar voters didn't make a lot of history with the films and filmmakers they honored. Yes, Mexican writer-director Del Toro won the top two filmmaker awards: directing and best picture. And African-American filmmaker Jordan Peele won the original screenplay Oscar for “Get Out.” Plus, Chile's "A Fantastic Woman," about a trans woman played by trans actor Daniela Vega, was picked as best foreign language film.
But Rachel Morrison, the first woman ever nominated for cinematography, didn't win a statuette for shooting “Mudbound.” (The trophy went to Roger Deakins for “Blade Runner 2049.”) Yance Ford, the trans filmmaker behind ”Strong Island,” lost in the documentary feature category to Bryan Fogel's “Icarus.” And “Lady Bird's” Greta Gerwig, one of only five women ever nominated for directing a feature, watched as del Toro took home that statue.
Among the presenters and winners, there were frequent and impassioned calls for action. Frances McDormand, who was awarded the best actor Oscar for “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” ended their acceptance speech by pushing for an “inclusion rider,” a contractual term that could help bring about male-female parity in movie crews and casts. I asked McDormand at an Oscar after-party what number she'd like to reach with such a clause, and they laughed and said, “Fifty-fifty, of course.”
Even if the optics looked different on Sunday, real and meaningful change will not come easily or quickly. White men in the business have said for months that they are listening to what women and people from unrepresented groups have been spotlighting. But only until those men alter their biased hiring preferences will the statistics move.
As McDormand said in their acceptance speech: “Look around, ladies and gentlemen, because we all have stories to tell and projects we need financed. Don't talk to us about it at the parties tonight; invite us into your office in a couple days — or you can come to ours, whichever suits you best — and we'll tell you all about them.”

A month after the Florida shooting
2 SHARES Share Tweet
A MONTH after 17 were killed in a school massacre in Parkland, Florida, students of some 3,000 schools all over the United States took to the streets in their towns and cities last Wednesday to carry on their protest against gun violence in American schools.
After a former student had gunned down 14 students and three teachers of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the nation's officials engaged in the usual debate on what to do about these incidents involving automatic weapons that properly should be only in the hands of soldiers in battle. President Donald Trump said it was primarily a mental health issue. They came up with a number of proposals, including arming faculty members to protect their classes. They also spoke of raising the age limit to 21 years for those allowed to purchase guns.
But, as in all the previous school shooting incidents, the month passed without any significant action in Congress.
The House of Representatives passed legislation authorizing federal grants totaling $50 million a year to provide assistance to schools and local police for training, reporting systems, threat assessment, intervention teams, and school-police coordination. But nothing on gun control; nothing on banning the sale of automatic weapons to civilians; nothing on the suggestion to limit gun purchases to 21-year-olds.
The Florida State Legislature did push forward with state legislation to raise the required for anyone to buy a firearm and this was signed by the state governor. But the Florida state government was immediately sued by the National Rifle Association, a powerful organization opposing any effort to restrict the right to bear arms in the US.
Students held protest rallies in various cities of the US this week, from Los Angeles to New York to Boston to Washington, DC. They were joined by their parents and their teachers as they voiced their grief over the death of so many young people over the years and their outrage at government inaction.
The student rallies a month after the Florida massacre could indicate a developing change in Americans' attitudes on gun violence and gun control. But it is highly unlikely that the US Congress will be enacting legislation restricting gun acquisition any time soon.
There may be another mass shooting – possibly in three to four months, if past incidents are any indication – and there will again be rallies and demonstrations. But any real change does not seem likely.

Kristen Bell is notorious for being unafraid to "go there" when it comes to giving interviews on controversial topics. The Bad Moms actor and mother of two IRL candidly shares hilarious/borderline gross parenting stories, expresses their opinions on politics, and tackles topics many celebs wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole. But honestly, that's probably why so many parents (and non-parents alike) love them so darn much. It was recently revealed that Kristen Bell uses a "controversial" bedtime trick with their 3-year-old daughter, and their honesty is like a breath of fresh air.
Over the weekend, Bell was at the premiere for the upcoming IMAX movie, Pandas — for which they are the narrator — when they dished on the trick that helps their youngest daughter to fall asleep. "Look, I'll get controversial. My 3-year-old [Delta] decided to stop sleeping about nine months ago," Bell told press on Saturday while on the red carpet, according to Parents. "And every night, when we put them to bed, they turn the lights on, which annoys the 4-year-old [Lincoln], and they will move furniture, and they bang on the door with different, hard toys. We switched the door knob. We turned the lock on the outside." They continued:
I'm sorry, I know that's controversial, but we lock it when they get in there, and we stand outside and say, "We love you, we will talk to you in the morning, but now, it's time for sleep." And after about 10 minutes, she'll wind themselves down. And then, before we go to bed, obviously, we unlock it.

Bell seems to be well-aware of the fact that getting kids to sleep is a hot-button issue. There's the camp that's firmly planted in co-sleeping and/or bed-sharing, no-crying-at-all-costs methods. And then you have parents who swear by sleep training from the get-go. What's worse? Not all, but many at either end of the spectrum think their way is the magical answer for every child. Here's the thing, though: Every kid is different. What works for one child might not do anything for the next — within the same family, even.
Other topics that parents have strong opinions about that Bell has tackled head-on? Vaccinations, as they told The Hollywood Reporter back in 2015. "When Lincoln was born, the whooping cough epidemic was growing, and before they were 2 months old, we simply said [to friends], 'You have to get a whooping cough vaccination if you are going to hold our baby,'" Bell said, adding:
It's a very simple logic: I believe in trusting doctors, not know-it-alls.
Something else that Bell feels strongly about: public breastfeeding. More specifically, the mom has an issue with people who seem to think that breastfeeding in public is a shameful act — even breastfeeding mothers, themselves, as they told Babble. "When it comes to breastfeeding your baby, if you are too nervous to do it in public I think you are part of the problem,” Bell told the outlet. “Women should own the fact that we are superheroes for the first however many months of your child's life. It is your opportunity and your duty to feed your baby should you choose to breastfeed and be proud of it." According to Babble, they continued:
I'm not saying you need to shove your boobs in everybody's face, but there are tons of cover cloths. Breastfeed your baby with pride. If somebody is uncomfortable, that's their problem. If someone sees an inch of your boob or areola and they can't control their disgust or shock or sexual desire that's on them.
I don't know about you, but I love the fact that Kristen Bell isn't afraid to give them two cents about topics many might consider controversial. (Because sorry, the benefits of vaccines are a proven fact. And breastfeeding is just feeding a hungry baby, for Pete's sake.) Struggling to get your kids to go to sleep when they're supposed to is something most parents can relate to. Even if Bell's methods don't resemble your own, it's nice to know that you're not alone in this wild shared experience of parenthood, isn't it?

Real Housewives of New York star Bethenny Frankel is suing their ex-husband for custody of their 7-year-old daughter after they were charged with stalking and harassing the Skinnygirl mogul.
Frankel reopened their 2013 divorce case against former hubby Jason Hoppy on Dec. 6, according to court records.
They're due in court in January.
Lawyers for the parties did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment.
Hoppy was arrested in January for showing up to their daughter's school and warning Frankel, “I will destroy you, you can get all the lawyers you want, you've been warned,” according to an NYPD spokesperson.
They denied the claims.
They settled their bitter custody battle in 2014 by agreeing to co-parent their daughter Bryn. They reached the deal after Frankel called Hoppy “white trash” from the witness stand.
The first good video game movie may be coming next year, and it has just started filming. Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's Rampage, which is based on the classic arcade game of the same name, has officially started principal photography. The movie is set for release next year and with the power of The Rock and a fun premise, we may finally have a video game movie on our hands that people actually want to see.
Dwayne Johnson's frequent producing partner Hiram Garcia confirmed the news on Twitter that Rampage has officially started principal photography, which is taking place in Atlanta. The producer posted a photo that shows Malin Akerman (Watchmen, Children's Hospital), who is playing the villain in the movie, and Jake Lacy (Girls, Miss Sloane) on set shooting a scene in an office building. Here is what Hiram Garcia had to say.
"Principal photography kicks off today on our #Rampage movie. @MalinAkerman & #JakeLacy bringin' the thunder!"
While we don't see Dwayne Johnson in this photo, rest assured, they are the star of this movie and there will be plenty of them to go around. Or one of the many clones they may or may not have, because he's somehow working more than any other actor in Hollywood. They just finished filming the Jumanji sequel and is diving right into Rampage. They also have the action flick Skyscraper, the Black Adam and Shazam movies for the DCEU, The Jungle Cruise for Disney and a sequel to San Andreas, among other things, on their schedule currently. But with the consistent box office success their movies have, it is no wonder everyone wants to work with him.
If history has taught us anything, it is that video game movies simply don't work. But if anyone can break that curse, it is The Rock. Just last year, both Warcraft and Assassin's Creed failed miserably to live up to expectations on every level, proving that Hollywood is still having trouble cracking the code on adapting video games for the big screen. However, Rampage is a different story. Mostly because the game doesn't have much story to speak of. In case you haven't played the game, it revolves around several giant monsters who make their way across the globe destroying city after city. It is just about as mindless and ridiculous as it sounds. That said, the creative team behind the Rampage movie will be able to craft their own story around the very simple premise, which could take some of the pressure off.
Rampage is being directed by Brad Peyton, who Dwayne Johnson worked with on San Andreas and Journey 2: The Mysterious Island. Other cast members for the movie include Joe Manganiello, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Marley Shelton and Naomie Harris. Rampage is set for release on April 20, 2018. Be sure to check out Hiram Garcia's production announcement tweet for yourself below.
A post shared by Golnesa "GG" Gharachedaghi (@gg_golnesa) on Jan 3, 2017 at 3:48pm PST
Golnesa “GG” Gharachedaghi is off the market.
On Tuesday, the “Shahs of Sunset” starlet announced they and fiancé Shalom secretly tied the knot last month.
“January 25, 2017 We walked into a courthouse just to see what type of paperwork is needed for getting married. They sarcastically told us there's a small chapel we could go to and do it right then,” Gharachedaghi explained in a since-deleted Instagram post, captured by E! News.
“An hour later, we walked out of that chapel as husband & wife. We clearly weren't dressed for it and I couldn't stop laughing from shock … but f–k it … we're not like ordinary people,” they continued.
Though Shalom has yet to share snaps of the impromptu nuptials with Gharachedaghi, 35, on social media, it appears they hinted at their wedding vows last week with a sly Instagram post.
“I love you until death, and then some.❤️️,” Shalom wrote of their bride.
Shalom proposed to Gharachedaghi in Times Square in December.
“In the middle of Times Square… they asked… and I said… HELL YESSSSS!” Gharachedaghi gushed on social media. “So happy to spend my life with him. I love you @shalom310”
A rep for Gharachedaghi and Bravo did not immediately return requests for comment.
TV personality-model Katie Price has reportedly been asked to take a lie detector test by husband Kieran Hayler.She first raised concerns over their four-year marriage after posting cryptic messages on social media about cheating - before deleting them.The model then seemed to add fuel to the fire when they were pictured without their wedding ring.According to the Sun newspaper, Hayler wants their wife to take the test to prove nothing happened between Price and DJ Tom Zanetti.She worked with the musician on their recent solo material, and Hayler voiced their disapproval at their close relationship on reality show "My Crazy Life".The insider said: "Things have been tense for a while between them but recently everything came to a head and they had a row - Kieran wants Katie to take a lie detector test to prove they didn't cheat on them with Tom, but she's refusing to do it."She's taken their ring off as a show of protest. They don't see why they should do it - they were the one who cheated on her!"

Scammers have been targeting landscapers out of money and Norwalk police are issuing a warning to help landscapers spot the scam.
The scammer contacts a landscaping company, requests services and agrees to pay for services but also asks if they can pay additional money, police said.
Then, the caller asks that the landscaper pay the additional funds to a subcontractor, such as a plumber or an electrician, who will also be doing work at the location.
After the landscaper pays the alleged subcontractor they or they discover the check or credit card are fraudulent and the landscaper loses money and never gets paid for the services rendered, police said.
The people running the scam typically choose houses that are for sale as the locations for the alleged project.
Police said the type of fraud has been attempted on several landscaping companies recently and they are warning all landscapers to be aware and to meet with their customers face to face before starting work.
They advise that landscapers avoid accepting work by text message only.
Anyone with any information about the scam is asked to call detectives at 203-854-3011 or leave a tip on the Norwalk Police Tip Line at 203-854-3111.
You can also leave anonymous Internet tips or text tips by typing "NPD" into the text field, followed by the message, and sending it to CRIMES (274637).
REUTERS: Paul Clement will become Premier League strugglers Swansea City's third manager of the season and will be officially unveiled on Wednesday, British media reported on Monday.
The Bayern Munich assistant manager will replace American Bob Bradley who was sacked by the Welsh club last month having taken over from Francesco Guidolin in October.
There was no immediate word from Swansea but Sky Sports and the BBC said Clement had agreed a 2-1/2 year deal.
Swansea are bottom of the table after a dreadful run of form and face fellow strugglers Crystal Palace on Tuesday when caretaker manager Alan Curtis will take charge of the team.
Clement was formerly assistant manager at Chelsea and Real Madrid and was in charge of Derby County for eight months before they were sacked by the Championship club in February last year.

Orlando Scandrick spent the past decade clashing on-field with the Washington Redskins. Now he's joining them.
The 'Skins on Monday landed the former Dallas Cowboys cornerback with a two-year pact worth up to $10 million, a source told NFL Network's Mike Garafolo.
Scandrick joins Washington just two days after the Cowboys granted their requested release following nine seasons in Dallas.
The 31-year-old Scandrick started 11 games last autumn before a back injury put them on the shelf. They finished as the 106th-ranked player at their position, but Scandrick brings game-day experience to a group led by Josh Norman ahead of Quinton Dunbar, Fabian Moreau and Joshua Holsey.
Scandrick's addition makes plenty of sense after the Redskins traded away slot man Kendall Fuller to the Chiefs before waving farewell to free-agent cover man Bashaud Breeland.
As for the Cowboys, the team saves approximately $1.4 million against the salary cap by moving on from Scandrick, their fifth-round pick from the 2008 NFL Draft.

City officials concerned about repeated power disruptions at Los International Airport introduced a new plan this week to build a $120 million power station that would serve the airport exclusively.
The current power station that serves LAX and surrounding homes and businesses was built in the 1960s. It's been upgraded since then, but its overhead power lines, power poles and the station equipment itself are vulnerable to vandalism, damage from vehicle crashes, even bird strikes and animals interference.
A squirrel got into a transformer in Westchester on Thanksgiving Day 2015, triggering a power outage to some 9,000 homes. The outage also caused problems at LAX, causing systems that require a steady supply of power to shut down.
"We had moving walkways, elevators, escalators, screening equipment, baggage screening equipment, that just stopped," Jeffrey Smith, chief airports engineer, told the airport's governing board in December.
Those systems can take hours to restart, they said.
More than 100 power interruptions have affected operations at LAX since 2013. Most are short blips or dips in voltage that can bring people and baggage moving systems to a halt. The airport has backup generators, but those don't keep people and baggage-moving equipment running.
None of the outages has completely shut down the airport, Smith said.
However, a catastrophic power outage that stalls air traffic or interrupts airport security could be costly and dangerous, City Councilman Mike Bonin said Tuesday at a joint meeting of the council's environment and tourist committees.
They referred to the December shutdown of Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta airport An 11-hour outage grounded about 1,300 flights and interfered with the travel plans of some 35,000 passengers.
"Just because it hasn't happened with a constantly weakening infrastructure doesn't mean it's not going to happen," Bonin said.
The proposed new power plant is a long-term solution, taking several years to build. Short-term and intermediate strategies, like adding uninterruptible, battery-like power supplies to some equipment to keep them running, are also included in the plan and some are already being put into place.
An agreement to build the new power station, to be co-funded by Los Angeles World Airports and the Department of Water and Power, could be approved by their governing boards at a joint meeting in April.
Unless you're actually using just one brand for all your smart home devices, syncing them all together and under just one control. Chances are you really have to use different apps to sync them and make them function as they should. Google is trying to solve that problem, and it looks like they have come up with a partial solution at least. A new command for Google Assistant will allow you to refresh and sync all your smart home services.
Well, in order for this to work of course, you will need Google Home as well. Simply by saying “sync my devices”, it will do a digital spring cleaning of sorts, as it will tell Google to check all your Home-linked apps and services and see if there's anything new that needs to be synced. You can also be more specific about what category you want to sync, like “sync my lights” or “sync my security cameras” or what other smart home devices you have.
So if you have Philips Hue Lights and then you buy WeMo outlets, and even after you've set things up, your Google Home doesn't seem to recognize it. Just saying the “sync my lights” command will supposedly fix that problem, especially if your products were not made by Google or Nest. You don't have to disconnect and reconnect your new lights, which was previously the only solution to this problem.
We still long for the day when your smart home will really be smart enough to keep track of all the other devices in your house, even if they're not “related”. But for now, this temporary solution from Google should work.

Humberside Police has issued their most wanted list for Scunthorpe and North Lincolnshire in the run up to Christmas.
Police are looking for four people in relation to crimes such as blackmail, burglary, fraud by representation and theft.
The list gives the opportunity for the individuals to hand themselves in to the police as they step up operations over the festive period.
In total, the force said there have been 35 arrests made across the Force area so far on both the North and South Banks in just one week and that they are working hard to increase that number.
Detective Superintendent Gary Hooks said: “Our commitment is to find and arrest those individuals that think they can avoid us and think that we've forgotten about them. We want to remind them that we haven't forgotten about them.
“Our patrols are out and about actively looking for these criminals. We're also inviting them to contact us first to hand themselves in before our officers knock on their doors. This can be done by simply walking in to any police station or by approaching an officer.
“We are also appealing to the public to contact us with any information about the whereabouts of such criminals. We are making every effort to ensure that these wanted individuals are caught and will face any charges they may have against them.
“The safety and protection of our communities is our priority and with this in mind we are committed to getting these suspects into custody as soon as we can.
“Any information can be passed on by contacting us by calling 101, or anonymously on the Crimestoppers number of 0800 555 111.“
Scunthorpe's most wanted
Anthony Abbot, 24, Isle Of Axholme. Burglary and theft.

Jordan Peele's "Get Out" won best film and best director on Saturday at the 33rd Independent Film Spirit Awards, a day before the horror sensation will vie for top honors at the Academy Awards.
The wins for Peele's directorial debut gave the Spirits, a celebration of indie filmmaking, something unusual: a box-office behemoth. Made for just $4.5 million, "Get Out" grossed $255 million worldwide.
"We are in the beginning of a renaissance right now, where stories from the outsider, stories from the people in this room, the same stories that independent filmmakers have been telling for years are being honored and recognized and celebrated," Peele said.

Peele was presented the award for best director by Spike Lee, whom Peele said paved their way. "Let's make no mistake," they said. "I wouldn't be standing here if wasn't for this man."
"Get Out" is only the second horror film to win best picture at the Spirits. The other was 2010's "Black Swan."
"This project didn't start as a statement," said Peele. "It began as me wanting to make a film in my favorite genre. I sat down and would smoke a little weed and try to write a mind-bending horror film, my favorite genre and at some point I followed the truth and I realized there are people locked up for smoking less weed than I smoked writing the movie."
Held in a beachside tent on a floor soaked through from rain earlier in the day, the Spirit Awards are the dressed-down, boozy prelude to Sunday's Academy Awards.
But as the Oscars have gravitated toward honoring indie films, the two have come closer to mirroring each other. The last four Spirit winners for best film ("Moonlight," ''Spotlight," ''Birdman," ''12 Years a Slave") have won best picture at the Oscars.
"It's Saturday," Peele said backstage of their Oscar expectations. "Tomorrow's tomorrow. That's what's up."
The Spirits are also a party to mark the (almost) end of a long and sometimes repetitive awards season.
"I continue to be amazed that you let me get to the microphone. What are you crazy?" said Frances McDormand, who again won the best actor for their performance in "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri." ''Do you know how hard it's been not to swear over the last couple of months? Because this awards convention goes on for (expletive) forever."

Allison Janney likewise continued their sweep of the best supporting actor awards for "I, Tonya." The supporting actor Oscar favorite Sam Rockwell ("Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri") added to their string of awards.
Timothee Chalamet, the "Call Me By Your Name" breakthrough star, took the best actor, a category that at the Spirits didn't include the Oscar favorite Gary Oldman. The 22-year-old said they were trying to savor the moment.
"I don't know if this kind of thing is ever going to happen again," said Chalamet.
Returning hosts John Mulaney and Nick Kroll opened with a lively monologue that managed to touch on everything from Donald Trump, Harvey Weinstein and Brett Ratner to the pronunciation of Saoirse Ronan's name ("Sour Shoes Ronan," Mulaney said) and Mulaney's wife's infatuation with "Call Me By Your Name's" Timothee Chalamet.

Mulaney said they once had a meeting with Weinstein where the fallen mogul proclaimed that their legacy, and what would be written on their tombstone, wouldn't be for the films he's done, that it'd be for "Project Runway."
"Your tombstone isn't going to say 'Project Runway.' It's going to say double XL unmarked grave," Mulaney said.
Kroll and Mulaney joked about separating the artist from the art for some of the men accused of misconduct.
"Like with Kevin Spacey: Can we still love 'K-PAX?" Kroll pondered.
Added Mulaney: "Or Woody Allen and their last 21 unwatchable films? Can we still not watch them?"
"Lady Bird" writer-director Greta Gerwig won the best screenplay for their partly autobiographical family drama.
"Thank you to my parents for watching the plays that I put on in the living room and thank you to my brother and sister for acting in them," said Gerwig.

Dee Rees' "Mudbound" received the Robert Altman Award, an ensemble honor given to one film's director, casting director and cast. In an impassioned speech, Rees celebrated each element of the film, a Netflix release, and concluded by pronouncing: "'Mudbound' is cinema."
Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon won the best first screenplay for "The Big Sick," which they based on the real-life drama of the beginning of their own relationship. They are also up for the original screenplay award at the Oscars. They both thanked their parents, who provided some of the inspiration for the parents in the film, with some artistic license.
"My dad never cheated on my mom," said Gordon. "That was something we made up for the movie."
"That we know of," quipped Nanjiani.

The social-media satire "Ingrid Goes West," starring Aubrey Plaza and Elizabeth Olsen, won the best first feature. Sebastián Lelio's "A Fantastic Woman," from Chile, won the best international film. The film, about a transgender woman whose partner has died, is up for best foreign picture at the Academy Awards.
"I thought the film was going to encounter, to say the least division, and that hasn't been the case," Lelio said backstage. "What surprises me most is that the film has been understood."

"The Rider" director Chloe Zhao was given the inaugural Bonnie Award, for a mid-career female director, which includes a $50,000 grant. Agnes Varda, the 89-year-old French filmmaking legend, won the best documentary with their co-director JR for their "Faces Places," also a nominee at Sunday's Oscars.

Winners are chosen by Film Independent, which includes critics, filmmakers, actors, festival programmers, past winners and nominees, and members of its board. The Spirit Awards cap nominees at a budget of $20 million or less, which eliminates some bigger-budget awards contenders like "Dunkirk."
But the film many consider the Oscar front-runner — Guillermo del Toro's modestly budgeted "The Shape of Water," up for a leading 13 nominations Sunday — was completely overlooked by the Spirits.
MONTREAL — The dean of McGill University's Schulich School of Music says professor Eleanor Stubley, whose body was found after they had been missing for about one week, was utterly devoted to their students.
Stubley, 57, was last seen Aug. 7 in southwestern Montreal and police confirmed their body was found in the same neighbourhood Sunday night.
Police said their disappearance and death are not connected to a criminal act but they refused to provide further details.
Music school dean Brenda Ravenscroft said Stubley “was well-known and highly respected by a variety of people in the musical community.”
Stubley suffered from multiple sclerosis but Ravenscroft said it was their music that was front and centre in their life.
“She was such a big contributor to their work,” Ravenscroft said. “Utterly devoted to students and such an excellent conductor and any issues with physical challenges were just in the background.
“It's a big loss for us.”
McGill University principal Suzanne Fortier said in a statement Monday that Stubley's MS informed them work.
“Professor Stubley was critically acclaimed as both a scholar and an artist, conducting ensembles in Canada, England, Finland and the U.S,” Fortier said.
“She lived with multiple sclerosis, and much of their work explored the physicality of music.”
Stubley was the associate dean in the graduate studies department at Schulich. They taught music education, musicology, and performance.
They were also the recipient of the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal, in recognition of their “decades of outstanding contribution to the arts,” said Fortier.
The Lagos State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Adeniji Kazeem, has expressed dismay at the increasing number of cases of domestic violence leading to fatalities in the State.
While briefing the press on the case of alleged murder of Symphorosa Otike Odibi by their wife, Udeme Otike-Odibi, at their Diamond Estate, Sangotedo, Ajah residence, the Attorney-General said the duplicate case file forwarded by the Police to the Ministry of Justice revealed components of domestic violence.
According to Kazeem” “This, to the State government is very disheartening as it appears that there are increasing cases of domestic violence leading to fatalities. The couple allegedly had several domestic issues which grew worse over time. People around the couple were allegedly aware of this acrimonious nature of the relationship but encouraged the couple to endure and resolve their issues.
“On the 3rd of May, the situation degenerated to the point that their wife (the suspect in this case) allegedly threatened them with a knife and eventually stabbed them to death and went further to mutilate their body.”
Kazeem stated that following the Nigeria Police investigation into the case and subsequent review of the case file by the Directorate of Public Prosecutions, the available facts established a prima facie case of murder contrary to section 223, punishable by death.
It also established misconduct with regard to a corpse contrary to section 165(b) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015, and punishable with five years imprisonment and section 165 (b) particularly creates an offence of Felony for cutting up or mutilating a human corpse just as it is in the case of the deceased person.
The Attorney-General stated that the trial of Odibi for the murder of their husband and mutilation of their corpse will commence before the High Court of Lagos State as soon as the case is assigned by the Chief Judge.
Kazeem enjoined citizens of the State to promptly report cases of domestic violence to the Police, the Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team or any other relevant authority to avoid unnecessary loss of lives.
They urged residents to dial the short code 6820 or 08137960048 to report such incidents and that of rape and child abuse.
The Attorney-General also assured Lagos residents that the Family Support Units of the various Divisions of Lagos State Police Command have been equipped with the requisite knowledge and skills to handle incidents of domestic and sexual violence.
I have just returned from a two-week European vacation, and I am wiser for it. Not only did I spend some time at Oxford University, and learn how to make a towering soufflé in the home of Julia Child herself, but I also learned that overalls are the key to preventing pickpocketing.
As you may or may not know, I am a big fan of bib overalls, and wear them almost constantly. However, on my flight from Portland to Paris, I thought I would be more comfortable in sweatpants, so decided to carry my wallet in a cross body bag, which I wear in front of my body, kind of like a necklace. This was stupid. In my I've-been-traveling-many-hours trance, the bag swung slightly behind my person and, within minutes, I was short a wad of cash.
Luckily, whoever took the cash dropped my wallet, but all of this could have been prevented if I had been wearing my bib, and stashed my stuff in the chest pocket. Though I am rarely aware of what's going on behind me, I will always notice someone making moves towards my chest, especially if they are unzipping something. Learn from my mistake, is what I'm saying, and stash the important stuff in a bib.

BUTCH COMEGYS / TIMES-SHAMROCK Alexia Rose Carela was the first baby born in Lackawanna County in 2017. Them parents are Michel Perez and Felix Carela, both of Kingston. DAVE SCHERBENCO / THE CITIZENS' VOICE Arriving at 1:28 a.m., Ryan Louie Siam was the first baby born in Luzerne County in 2017. Posing for a photo with the New Year Baby are their uncle, Adam Siam, dad, Louie, brother, Rashid and cousin, Akram.
WILKES-BARRE — Rula Siam did not expect their second son until Jan. 18, but the baby had other plans.
Them water broke on New Year's Eve before 5 p.m. while they and their family were grocery shopping, and by 1:28 a.m., only a couple of hours into 2017, Ryan Louie Siam arrived.
“It wasn't planned,” they said. “I couldn't wait to meet him, I've been waiting for the moment for so long.”
The baby boy dozed in bed while family buzzed around the room at Wilkes-Barre General Hospital, all eager to meet the new addition to the family. Ryan's 10-year-old brother, Rashid, had already started planning how to celebrate their little brother's first birthday when New Year's Day arrives in 2018.
“He's baby New Year,” Rashid said, smiling at their new brother. “Every New Year we'll have a birthday party.”
As aunts, uncles and cousins came by to visit, Rashid planned all the things they would do with their new sibling.
“I'm going to teach them how to walk, talk,” they said. “I'll teach them about learning before they go to school and stuff like that.”
Rula Siam and their husband Louie Siam have been married since 2004, and had Rashid in 2007. With Ryan arriving in 2017, Rula Siam said seven might be their lucky number.
Even though Ryan came early, Rula Siam said everything is ready at their Dallas home for the new baby.
They said they had originally planned to spend New Year's Eve at dinner with family.
“We were planning for a family night,” they said. “We still had a family night, the best family night we'll definitely remember.”
Lackawanna baby
The first Lackawanna County baby of 2017 sure took their time to arrive.
After 26 hours of labor, Alexia Rose Carela finally appeared at 5:06 a.m. Sunday.
It must have been quite a struggle.
“Trust me,” said their exhausted mother, Michel Perez, 24, as they lay in their hospital bed at Moses Taylor Hospital in Scranton later in the afternoon. “It was.”
Wearing a big pink bow on their head, little Alexia slept soundly in their mother's arms while their father, Felix Carela, 24, smiled proudly beside them.
This isn't the first time the Kingston family has been blessed with a holiday baby. Carela's other daughter, 5-year-old Yarianny, was born on Halloween. Yarianny welcomed the baby with the rest of their relatives.

“Liverpool take on Roma in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final tonight”
Jurgen Klopp's side take on the Italian outfit in the first leg of their last-four clash tonight.
They had to get past Premier League champions Manchester City in the previous round, with three goals inside the opening 30 minutes of the first leg proving too much for Pep Guardiola's side in a 5-1 aggregate thrashing.
Roma produced a stunning three-goal comeback against Barcelona to reach the semi-finals, recovering from a 4-1 defeat away from home in the first leg by winning 3-0 in the second and going through on away goals.
Ahead of the big match this evening, Klopp and their Reds men were spotted arriving at Anfield to put in their final preparations.

CHARLOTTE, Mich. (AP) - A distraught father seething over sexual abuse suffered by three daughters tried to attack former sports doctor Larry Nassar in a Michigan courtroom after a judge rejected their request to confront the "demon" in a locked room, a stunning rush that reflected the anguish felt by parents who trusted them with their children.
Randall Margraves was blocked by an attorney, tackled by sheriff's deputies and hauled out of court Friday. They later apologized, saying they had lost control. Eaton County Judge Janice Cunningham said there was "no way" they would fine them or send them to jail under their contempt-of-court powers.
"I don't know what it would be like to stand there as a father and know that three of your girls were injured physically and emotionally by somebody sitting in a courtroom. I can't imagine that," the judge said.
Nonetheless, they added, it is "not acceptable that we combat assault with assault."
The incident occurred during the third and final sentencing hearing for Nassar, who has admitted to sexually assaulting girls under the guise of medical treatment. This case focuses on their work at Twistars, an elite gymnastics club southwest of Lansing.
Nassar, 54, already will spend the rest of their life in prison. They were sentenced last week to 40 to 175 years in prison for assaults at Michigan State University and their home and was ordered in December to spend 60 years in a federal prison for child pornography crimes.
Nassar pleaded guilty to molesting nine victims in Eaton and Ingham counties, but the courts have been open to anyone who says they were assaulted during their decades of work at Michigan State, Twistars and USA Gymnastics, which trains Olympians. More than 200 accusers so far have spoken or submitted statements in the two counties, and at least 80 percent have agreed to be publicly identified.
Margraves' dramatic move occurred after they listened to two of their daughters speak in court for 10 minutes. Lauren Margraves, a college student, said their parents were "filled with regret" because they took three daughters to see Nassar for sports injuries.
"I see the look in their faces and I know they want to be able to do something but they can't," they told Nassar. "The guilt they have will never go away. All this is because of you."
Them father then stepped up and asked the judge if they would grant them "five minutes in a locked room with this demon." Cunningham declined and also turned down their request for "one minute." That is when Randall Margraves rushed toward Nassar.
There were gasps and tears in the courtroom. Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis turned to the gallery and told families to "use your words," not violence.
"This is letting them have this power over us," they said. "We cannot behave like this."
During a return to court, Margraves told the judge that they just snapped. They said they had not known what exactly their daughters were going to say about their abuse.
"I look over here and Larry Nassar's shaking their head, no, like it didn't happen. ... I'm embarrassed," Margraves said of their conduct. "I'm not here to upstage my daughters. I'm here to help them heal."
About 30 more people spoke in person, by video or had statements read after the incident. The case will end Monday with final remarks from the prosecutor, defense and Nassar, followed by the judge's sentence. Nassar faces a minimum of 25 to 40 years in prison.
At a news conference, Margraves repeated their apology and insisted he's "no hero."
"My daughters are the heroes, and all the victims and the survivors of this terrible atrocity," they said.
Melissa Alexander Vigogne, who traveled from France to speak, said they were surprised that an attack had not been attempted earlier.
"It's not that that's how we should respond. But it's truly understandable - the amount of pain that we've all gone through," Vigogne said outside court.
Sheriff Tom Reich said their officers will investigate what happened in court and send a report to the local prosecutor.
The judge started the day by addressing comments made by a Nassar lawyer who said they had doubts about the large number of women and girls who say they were assaulted by Nassar. Cunningham called Shannon Smith's remarks "unfortunate" and said Nassar did not authorize them.
Smith told Detroit radio station WWJ that it is "really unfortunate" if some people stepped forward only because of all the recent attention. Nassar released a statement saying Smith's comments were a distraction and that their accusers' remarks "have pierced my soul."
Many of Nassar's accusers have blamed Michigan State, USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee for not doing earlier to stop him. The USOC announced Friday that it hired a law firm to conduct an independent investigation. And the coordinator of the women's national team for USA Gymnastics, Valeri Liukin, said they were stepping down.

The Municipal District of Bonnyville Council approved a $120,267,552 balanced 2017 budget (excluding non-cash depreciation) at its meeting on April 12. Although municipal tax revenues have declined, Council held mill rates at 2016 levels and continued to fund both operating and capital budgets with no change in service levels or community support.
The 2017 budget will be funded through $64.1 million in municipal taxes, $7.5 million in government grants and contributions, $18.1 million from General Revenues, such as fees, equipment replacement program, and reserves. A further $15.8 million will come from transfers from surplus (reserve funds carried over from projects and funds remaining from previous years' budgets).
To cover the requisitions for school taxes and seniors housing, the M.D. is required to collect an additional $14.7 million through property taxes. The school requisitions are up $950,000, representing a 7.2% increase over last year's requisition. Any savings found in property taxes as a result of keeping mill rates flat over 2016 will be offset by the increase in provincial education taxes. The Lakeland Lodge and Housing requisition increased from $299,703 in 2016 to $491,738 in 2017. The increase was due to the loss of 52 units while new construction is being done in Bonnyville and Cold Lake for additional housing. The requisition will be reduced in 2019 when all the new units are completed. Both the school and lodge requisitions are uncontrollable costs to Council, as they are passed on to the M.D. by other orders of government to collect and remit.
In 2017, Council is again directing the majority of the budget to key infrastructure projects including roads, water lines, and trail systems. New in 2017 is $1.4 million for the Cold Lake Water Line and $1.0 million has been earmarked to continue work on the M.D. trail system. As in the past, Council's focus is to improve and maintain our largest assets – roads. “Council plans on continuing to pave and oil as many roads as possible, while ensuring, especially in this economy, that the municipality is able to maintain its staffing levels,” said Reeve Ed Rondeau.
The Ardmore Underground and Road Replacement Project will continue in 2017 with $2.1 million in funding. The paving of Gurneyville Road is scheduled to go ahead with a $6.4 million price tag.
Additionally, Council agreed to continue to fund the Seniors Transportation Grant at $60,000, while Community Halls and Societies will have access to $575,000 for capital and operating costs.
The M.D. has again set aside $5 million for the Inter Municipal Cooperation Program for collaboration with our urban neighbours, based on a per capita, equalized assessment model. The approximate distribution is; Village of Glendon $767,000, the City of Cold Lake $645,800 and the Town of Bonnyville $3,600,000 (this includes some $800,000 for the Bonnyville and District Centennial Centre). These government transfers will be adjusted when final population breakdowns are available.
Council continues to support the regional community's quality of life. In 2017 the Bonnyville Golf and Country Club will receive $150,000 for sprinkler system improvements, while the Walsh Football Field and Extreme Mudfest will see support of $240,000 and $8,000 respectively.
“Council agreed to support these three projects because they are a benefit to the region, both economically and recreationally. The golf course draws an incredible number of tourists to the area to play recreationally and in tournaments. Walsh Field will serve over 1,000 youth locally and will build on our Sport Tourism initiatives. Extreme Mudfest doubled its gate numbers last year and is projecting to do the same in 2017. These tourists bring a lot of money into the area,” Rondeau says.
The M.D. continues to provide funding support for the Bonnyville and Cold Lake museums, Beaver River Regional Waste Management Commission, Family and Community Social Services (FCSS) in Bonnyville and Cold Lake, the Bonnyville Regional Fire Authority and libraries in the two major urban communities.
“This is my tenth, and last budget, as the Reeve of the M.D. of Bonnyville,” Rondeau says. “Throughout those years Council has been financially prudent, using our resources in a responsible manner. We lived within our means. The 2017 budget continues to maintain our service levels to residents without raising the Residential and Non-Residential mill rates. We have upgraded our critical infrastructure, roads and buildings, while also supporting community organizations to improve the region's quality of life. As a Council, we have established a long standing and ongoing legacy for our municipality.”

The bankruptcy of Sears has had a significant impact on Regina's retail vacancy rates, according to Colliers Regina's latest report.
With the stores closure, it has added 266,000 square feet of additional retail vacancy onto the market increasing 4.59 per cent, the highest point in recent memory.
“Generally speaking, we have a fairly healthy retail sector here in Regina,” Regina & District Chamber of Commerce CEO Johns Hopkins said. “We've seen Sears close here as well as across the country and that's had an impact and added a lot of space.”
“Yet beyond Sears, the city's retail market has remained strong with new growth and stable rates. In fact, without Sears, the vacancy rates would have dropped to rates lower than 2016,” the report said.
“When you look at the marketplace, Regina continues to do very well and we continue to draw people from the southern part of the province,” Hopkins said.
South Regina continues to grow with increasing new development over the past year. In total Grasslands added 70,000 square feet of new retail or 64 per cent of the total new construction for the city.
While north Regina has seen less momentum, the northwest continues to have the lowest vacancy in the city. The area is currently seeing the development of Capital Crossing, a large-scale retail and mixed-use development.
“The east has remained the single most important site for national and international retailers looking to locate in Regina,” the report said.
However, the vacancy rate has risen to 4.58 per cent, 32 per cent of which can be attributed to Sears Home leaving their site and the closing of Home Outfitters has added some vacancy as well.
In total over 130,000 square feet is available to tenants in the east, which according to the report is expected to be absorbed in the next 12 months. Future development includes a 68 acre shopping centre with 678,000 square feet of retail space.
Even though the downtown has the highest rate of retail vacancy, 75 per cent of that can be attributed directly to Sears.
“Some of the restaurants that have closed or the businesses that have closed do have new tenants and are in the process of doing some fit outs within the space,” Executive Director Regina Downtown Business Improvement District Judith Veresuk said. “So while it looks vacant now, there are plans for the space.”
Going forward, Regina will begin to absorb the extra space left behind by Sears. New stores like H&M are already scheduled to open and it is expected that will attract even more new tenants in 2018.

Little Common Football Club is three points clear at the top of the table having scored a remarkable 40 goals in its first nine league games.
The Commoners have picked up 25 Macron Store Southern Combination League Division One points from a possible 27 and their goal difference is an amazing +36 having conceded only four times.
Player-manager Russell Eldridge said: “It has been a very good start. I couldn't really have asked for much more from the boys and it's a real collective effort. We have individuals that have those special moments that can win games, but everyone plays their part.
“I guess the difficult thing is to keep it going. When you're doing well, teams try a bit harder and want to be the team to beat you. We can't take anything for granted and we have to be fully focused every time we go on the pitch.
“We don't get over-excited when we win and don't get too down when we lose. We're in a good position, but we'll take each game as it comes.”
Common, who have scored the most goals in the division and conceded the fewest, will seek a ninth straight league win when they host mid-table Oakwood today (Saturday).
Eldridge expects to welcome back a few players who missed the midweek cup defeat to AFC Uckfield Town, although Wes Tate will serve the final game of their suspension. Kick-off is 3pm.

PARIS: Security forces cleared more than 1,000 people from a sprawling migrant camp in the French capital on Wednesday (May 30), the latest in a series of episodes that have thrust the issue of illegal immigration back into the spotlight.
About 1,700 people, mainly from Sudan, Somalia and Eritrea, were living in the "Millenaire", or Millennium, camp underneath the main Paris ring road near the Porte de la Villette in the northeast of the capital.

But regional prefect Michel Cadot later said that just 1,016 migrants had been removed, since many residents had fled after learning the dawn operation was imminent.
They will be housed temporarily at more than 20 sites across the Paris region while the authorities check their identities, Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said in a statement.
The operation came just days after a young Malian was honoured with fast-track citizenship following their daring rescue of a child hanging from a balcony.
It also coincided with the trial of a 72-year-old woman in the Mediterranean city of Nice for helping two Guinean teenagers cross into the country from Italy.

Three other people will face trial Thursday for helping migrants enter France illegally, even as Grenoble this week honoured a farmer convicted of guiding migrants across the Alps by bestowing them with the city's official medal.
MIXED MESSAGES?
Two similar camps migrant camps in the capital, one along the Canal St Martin, which houses 800 mostly Afghan migrants, and another of 300-400 at the Porte de la Chapelle, are set to be evacuated soon, Cadot said.
The authorities said the operation Wednesday was the 35th such evacuation in Paris in the last three years as thousands of migrants have arrived seeking a better life, hoping to settle in France or reach Britain.
"We don't know if we're going to be allowed to stay in France. I would like to stay, I know that I could build a life here," a Sudanese man at the site who gave their name as Ibrahim told AFP.
Many migrants may have taken hope from the accolades showered on Mamoudou Gassama, the 22-year-old Malian "Spider-Man" captured on video as they scaled four storeys of an apartment building to rescue a dangling four-year-old.
President Emmanuel Macron hailed the heroic act, saying Gassama - who entered France illegally in September via Libya - would be granted citizenship.
But in a warning to other African migrants, they said they "can not give (papers) to all those who come from Mali or Burkina Faso" - two of the countries from where thousands of migrants set out each year for Europe.
The 40-year-old centrist is pushing ahead with a new immigration law, decried as too hardline by some but which they see as essential to separating genuine asylum seekers from so-called economic migrants.
"Behind a few symbolic gestures there remains a policy of repression and expulsions," said Michel Rousseau of Tous Migrants (We're All Migrants), a pro-migrant aid group in southeast France.
France expelled 18,000 people last year, interior ministry figures show, compared with 100,000 asylum requests.
Rousseau and other activists will be demonstrating outside the courthouse in the Alpine town of Gap on Thursday, when two Swiss nationals and an Italian go on trial for aiding a group of migrants crosses into France last month.
They risk up to 10 years in prison.
TENSIONS
On Wednesday a 72-year-old Amnesty International volunteer was facing similar charges in Nice, after helping two Guinean adolescents return to France after authorities sent them back to Italy.
France granted 32,000 people asylum last year, official data shows, far fewer than other EU countries such as Germany, yet immigration remains a key voter concern.
The far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen won a third of votes in last year's presidential election.
Rather than Gassama's heroics, however, some far-right activists have highlighted a different case involving migrants this week: that of two Afghans arrested for allegedly harassing a woman they judged to be inappropriately dressed on a train.
They also point to outbreaks of violence among the migrant groups, most recently the stabbing death of a Somalian after a fight in Paris on Monday.
CRESTVIEW, Fla. — A Florida man arrested for destroying a liquor store under construction told police they were Alice in Wonderland and that a “hookah-smoking caterpillar” ordered them to attack the site.
Crestview police said in a post on Facebook that Matthew Horace Jones is accused of breaking into a fenced-in area and using a forklift to cause more than US$100,000 in damage. They face grand theft felony and other charges.
Witnesses called 911 and police went to the site. The police report says Jones aimed the forklift toward officers, who stopped them at gunpoint.
Police quoted Jones as identifying themselves as Alice in Wonderland, blaming the attack on “a hookah-smoking caterpillar” and saying that they had a problem with “building a place to sell alcohol.”
No lawyer is listed for him.

A BRITISH football fan has been fined by Russian authorities for writing “England” on a monument of a revered Soviet-era player at the World Cup.
The supporter responsible for vandalising the statue of Fyodor Cherenkov, a legendary Spartak Moscow midfielder under the USSR, was arrested on Tuesday night.
On the statue, the fan scrawled “England” in bright red on the chest of Cherenkov, who died in 2015 aged 55 after making a record number of appearances for Spartak.
Russian police detained the fan, who was in Moscow to watch England play Colombia in the last-16 of the World Cup.
Photos showing the the defaced statue and claims the culprit had got away circulated on social media ahead of the game at the Spartak Stadium.
The supporter, named as 20-year-old Rufus Hall by Russian media, was taken into custody after England's dramatic win 4-3 penalty shoot out win over Colombia.
GETTY/TWITTER SELEMENEVE7 DEFACED: The England fan was fined for writing on a statue of Fyodor Cherenkov
They today apologised to Spartak and their fans before they were hauled before a court. “I'm so sorry, I feel embarrassed,” they said in a video, wearing a Three Lions top. "I've loved this country for the two days I've been here. Your people have been welcoming, so I would never disrespect this country. "I respect the history, and had I known this would offend people I would never have done it, and I wholly apologise."
The young man who arrived in Russia from England has apologised to police officers for vandalizing the statue of Fyodor Cherenkov," a Moscow police source told Russian news agency TASS.
Hall then admitted their guilt in court and was slapped with a 3,000-ruble (£35) for their offence.
"Rufus Edward Hall was present at the court hearing, admitted their guilt and apologised to Russia," a court spokesperson said.
TWITTER MEA CULPA: Hall apologised to Russia in a video
“Hall admitted their guilt and apologised to Russia” Russia court spokesperson Cherenkov, who played for Spartak between 1977 and 1994, is widely seen as the team's best player ever.
As the photo of the desecrated statue spread online, Russians responded angrily on social media.
One called on Russians to “beat him” while another sinisterly said “we are waiting”.
But Russian politicians and the media called for calm and warned against making “a mountain out of a molehill”.
MOSCOW 24 VANDALISM: The England fan was arrested after the last-16 clash in Moscow
Russian MP Igor Lebedev said: "This is not some political act, it's just the doing of a hooligan, which every country has.
“England fans are not the most disciplined in the world, but at the same time we have had no special problems with them here.
“Perhaps for every fan of Soviet football, a monument to an outstanding footballer has been desecrated, but it is just an act of hooliganism.

Jamiroquai frontman Jay Kay has said they are "distraught" at having to postpone the band's two forthcoming London shows due to complications with theirs back.
They were due to perform at London's O2 Arena on June 23 and 24, but due to the singer's rehabilitation following a recent operation the shows have been moved to December 3 and 6.
Kay, 47, said they are feeling "very low" at having to delay the concerts and their "inability to perform properly".
In a statement on the band's official Facebook page, they said: "It is with great regret that again I have to disappoint people due to the ongoing problem with my back.
"I have never felt so frustrated with a situation as I feel now, and I am desperate to get back to form.
"After two operations I am only marginally more active, and I know I could never give the 125% energy I need to give to you good people a super show."
They said they are a "proud man" and is "asking for people's patience".
"I am distraught at this and am I feeling very low."
Referring to the recent deaths of friends including the band's original keyboardist, Toby Smith, Kay said: "2017 is turning out to be a tough year, with the loss of several close friends in quick succession and the inability to perform properly in the way I've been doing, and the only way I know how to, since I did my first gig at 17 years old.
"I want to thank all of you for the messages of support you have sent me. I can't quite believe how kind you all are. A thousand thanks."
The singer apologised to fans who had made plans to travel to the band's shows in Paris, Athens and London, and promised they would return to perform the shows as the fans "deserve".
They s igned off their message "from a very wounded Buffalo".
A statement from the acid-jazz band's team confirmed that all tickets for the June shows will be valid for the rescheduled dates, but refunds are also available from the point of purchase.
The statement said: "Jay Kay is currently recuperating and in rehabilitation after their procedure last week and as a result has been advised to postpone the two shows later this month at the O2 Arena, London, which will now take place on Sunday the 3rd and Wednesday the 6th of December 2017.
"Please note that tickets for the postponed O2 show on Friday 23rd June will only be valid for the rescheduled show on Sunday 3rd December. Tickets for the O2 show on Saturday 24th June will only be valid for Wednesday 6th December."
In May, Kay told their fans in a post on Instagram that they had undergone a "stunningly painful" surgical procedure on their back, involving injections into their spinal discs.
Jamiroquai, known for tracks including Virtual Reality, Space Cowboy and Cosmic Girl, recently released their eighth album, Automaton.
LACKAWANNA, N.Y. (WIVB)- People living in Lackawanna are digging out after more than a foot of snow fell Sunday. City officials extended a travel advisory, asking drivers to stay off the road until 8 a.m. Tuesday morning so plows can clear the roads.
Michael Wlodarczyk spent hours behind a snow blower on Monday, clearing their driveway, their grandmother's driveway and their 93 year old neighbor's driveway.
“Just helping people out, doing the best we can and being good Buffalonians,” they said.
They told News 4 the snow accumulated quickly.
“Yesterday morning I had my coffee and there was about half an inch of snow on the ground, I could still see the grass,” they explained. “Then I came home late that night and there are two feet!”
On other streets, neighbors shoveled out their driveways and sidewalks creating snow banks more than two feet high along city streets.
Some side streets still have a couple of inches of snow on them.
“I think the City of Lackawanna is looking a lot better than it was,” said Bill Geary, the Erie County Commissioner of Public Workds.
Sunday night, three of Lackawanna's seven plows went out of commission.
Geary told News 4 the county was called in to help early Monday morning. Three county plows were able to clear about 20 roads in the city by 5:30 p.m. Monday, when they were called off
“We're going to back them up through the night and tomorrow on the main thoroughfares like Abbott Rd.,” said Geary.
Lackawanna Mayor Geoffrey Szymanski said late Monday night two of the three plows out of commission are up and running again.
Meanwhile, Geary told News 4 they've scaled back crews across the county since the snow has lightened up. Over the weekend, there were more than 22 crews out on the roads. They're now down to about 10.
“To try to get everyone rested,” said Geary. “The crews have been working around the clock actually since last week.”
The county has used up about 5,000 tons of salt, a quarter of the 20,000 tons it started with this season. Geary said they plan to replenish their supplies after the next storm.
They remind everyone to drive slow and pay attention to the road conditions.
People living in Lacakwanna told us they're ready for the next round.
“We're Buffalonians, we get through it, it's not too hard,” said Wlodarczyk. “Stay warm, don't hurt yourself and if you don't have a snow blower yet, get one.”
Sussex voters are set to head to the polls in June as Prime Minister Theresa May has announced a snap general election.
The Conservatives under David Cameron won a narrow majority in the House of Commons back in 2015, with the SNP making massive gains in Scotland, while the Lib Dems losing all but eight of their MPs.
In Sussex the Tories comfortably held on to all their seats, apart from Hove, snatching both Lewes and Eastbourne from the Liberal Democrats.

The Ravens practiced without cornerback Jimmy Smith on Wednesday and Thursday, but it doesn't look like they're going to be playing without them on Sunday.
Coach John Harbaugh said at their press conference that Smith is “good” despite the Achilles issue that led the team to keep them out of practice for two days. Smith is listed as questionable after returning for a full practice on Friday, but Harbaugh's response suggests there's not a lot of concern that he'll miss the matchup with the Raiders.
Defensive tackle Brandon Williams will miss the game, however. Williams is out for the third straight week with a foot injury and the first two games haven't gone well for the defense, so the Ravens will be hoping that's just a coincidence.
Wide receiver Jeremy Maclin, tight end Benjamin Watson and safety Lardarius Webb are also listed as questionable for Sunday and, like Smith, they were full participants in Friday's practice.
Well here we are, 2017! Crazy.
I hope you all had a wonderful end to 2016 and start to 2017 no matter what you ended up doing.
Wanderer and I haven't gone out for a NYE since a few weeks before we ended up moving to Bendigo. It's funny to think that on that night as we kissed at midnight and watched the fireworks, we were standing but a couple blocks away from the house we ended up renting.
As it was our last NYE in Bendigo (living here, anyway), we decided that it was worth going out (albeit early) for a couple drinks. We ended up being talked into a pizza (the things you do for free pints haha) as well. It was a lot of fun, and I'm glad we did it – all with getting back at a decent hour (before too many people arrived and set off my anxiety) to watch the fireworks on the TV at midnight.
A new year usually begins with new goals and the best of intentions. Dreams and plans for what to do in our careers, for our health, so on and so forth. I'm no exception to that. All my planning has extended to getting into better health along with everything else. It's not so much a matter of ‘because it's the new year' as the timing of my ‘last straw' worked out well.
Zine-wise, I want to have clear, concise goals, but I don't know much beyond wanting to get into making YouTube videos as well as getting organised enough to easily create more zines as well as review more than two per week.
Views very nearly quadrupled while visitors nearly tripled.
The difference in statistics between 2015 and 2016 is absolutely amazing. Of course I absolutely want to keep that momentum going and build on it to create a ‘hub' of sorts for all kinds of zine things. I feel like I'm fumbling around pointing out the fun things I like (awesome job to have, to be sure), so to have a positive response is an awesome thing.
So while I may be lacking in specificity, I'm not lacking in energy or love when it comes to zines and this blog. Here's to even more zine goodness in the new year.
Zeb Dalton's desk holds a 12-inch stack of manuals and books brimming with regulations for the Bureau of Land Management pastures their cattle graze. "And that is just for our local district, it's not the BLM as a whole," they said.
Dalton's point is this that even though President Trump reduced the size of the Bears Ears Monument, they did not remove it from federal management.
President Donald Trump, in typical Trump fashion, stunned America by announcing that they are, by Executive Order, re-drawing the borders of the monument to make it smaller. About 85 percent smaller, in fact — reducing it from the 1.35 million acres designated by President Barack Obama in January of 2016 to two monuments totaling just a hair over 200,000 acres. The southern monument, which includes the actual Bears Ears formations is named Shaash Jaa, while the northern monument is the Indian Creek Monument.
Trump also shrunk next door Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument to about half its original 1.7 million acres. The Escalante Monument was put in place by President Bill Clinton.
"Some people think that the natural resources of Utah should be controlled by a small handful of very distant bureaucrats located in Washington," Trump said, speaking at Utah's State Capitol beneath a painting of Mormon pioneers. "And guess what? They're wrong."
"Together," they continued, talking about the shrinking of the monuments "we will usher in a bright new future of wonder and wealth."

STILL FEDERAL LAND
Dalton's cattle graze both BLM and U.S. Forest Service land in what was the Bears Ears Monument in southeastern Utah, up against New Mexico, Arizona and Colorado. While some of the land is no longer under "monument" designation, it remains federal land and will continue to be managed by the overseeing agency — BLM, U.S. Forest Service or National Park Service.
Some media sources have reported that the area will now be "privatized" or that oil companies will soon begin digging wells. But the land itself remains under federal management, just as it has been for decades. In fact, the Antiquities Act, which gives presidents the authority to create monuments, specifies that all monument designations be done on federal land.
Dalton appreciates Trump's announcement and hopes the area can continue to be available for multiple use.
"San Juan County is at least 92 percent federal land," said Dalton of the monument's home county. Of the 700,000 acres their cattle graze, almost half were already being managed as wilderness, one of the most restrictive management strategies for federal lands. The wilderness designation doesn't change with the monument shrinkage. "Some of this land has as many as 12 layers of protection," they said, referring to "roadless," "wilderness," and other federal designations meant to restrict use and preserve the landscape.
"A lot of environmental groups put out narrative that it wasn't protected and that we needed to protect it," they said. "That wasn't true." For example, in the wilderness and wilderness study areas, no motorized vehicles were allowed, even before Obama's monument designation, they explained. This will not change, even though some of the wilderness now lies outside of the boundaries of the monument.
Dalton's cattle graze BLM permits in the summer and U.S. Forest Service land in the winter months. Although most of their grazing allotments are now outside the monument borders, they trail them between the Bears Ears to get from one allotment to the other. They fear their access, even on the remaining monument, will one day be restricted.
Depending on which pastures their cattle are grazing at the time, their trail from summer to winter range or back again can be up to 100 miles.
Because the federal agencies have had just two years to draft new plans under President Obama's designation, management within the Bears Ears Monument had so far not been much different, Dalton said."They never really got any bylaws finalized. The regulations that were coming never got put into place," they said, and explained that the biggest change they had seen in the last two years was an increase in visitors by about three-fold.
Visitors will have the same rights and abilities to enjoy the federal land, even without the monument designation.
Some conservatives believe the Antiquities Act has been abused by several presidents. The act, which gives presidents the authority to create national monuments, says the limits of the monuments shall "in all cases be confined to the smallest area compatible with proper care and management of the objects to be protected."
LOCAL SUPPORT
Utah's Sen. Orrin Hatch and Reps. John Curtis and Chris Stewart, all Republicans, supported Trump's move, as did San Juan County Commissioner Rebecca Benally, a member of the Navajo Nation and a Democrat.
"Thank you for not being a typical politician and passing us over. Thank you for caring about San Juan County. We may be only 15,000 strong, but we matter. We appreciate you being willing to take the backlash from the special interest groups as you stand for the people and the economy of San Juan County," they said in a public address. "Brothers and sisters, I stand here before you as a Native American woman, the first elected woman in San Juan County. So here, I'm here today to tell you that my constituents do not want another monument in San Juan County because it is just another federal overreach with empty promises," they said.
Bloomberg reported that five lawsuits were quickly filed in response to Trump's actions. One president can't "trump" another's actions when it comes to monuments, they said.
The Navajo Nation, Hopi Tribe, Zuni Tribe, Ute Indian Tribe and Ute Mountain Ute Indian Tribe consider much of Bears Ears to be religiously and historically valuable, though the land is owned by the federal government, said The Hill.
Local rancher Gail Johnson said the sentiment of the local Native Americans is generally supportive of the monument shrinking, as evidenced by county commissioner Benally's comments.
While five tribes are suing over the action, only two tribes reside in the county, the White Mesa Utes and the Navajo, they said. "But no one will listen to our local Native Americans unless they are in favor of what Obama did."
According to the Associated Press, Earthjustice, The Wilderness Society, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club and several more environmental groups challenged the reduction of the Escalante monument, saying the president's action was "unlawful" and it "exceeds their authority under the U.S. Constitution and the Antiquities Act."
No stranger to controversy, apparel maker Patagonia also jumped in the fight, filing suit to challenge President Trump's authority.
Elko, Nev., attorney Travis Gerber said they can't guess how the courts will rule on the lawsuits.
"One principle I know, under the Antiquities Act, the declaration must be confined to the smallest area compatible with proper care and management," they said.
"Our position is that if designating 1.3 million acres, which is similar in size to the whole state of Delaware, is considered the 'smallest area compatible,' there could be no limit on the federal government's power to declare all federal land as a monument."
CONFINED TO THE WEST
Similar designations would not be welcome or acceptable in the east, Gerber believes, and said that people who reside outside of federal lands states don't understand the unintended consequences of such actions, which negatively affect the economies of local communities. Encouraging prosperity with economic drivers such as ranching and logging actually encourages positive land management, they said, pointing out that America is cleaner and "better managed" than developing countries. "When people grow more wealthy, they reinvest back into the environment."
"The philosophy behind these designations assumes that it will benefit the land but actually the results are the opposite. We see catastrophic wildfire and forest fire on federal lands in much more frequency than private lands," Gerber said.
Local ranchers Sandy and Gail Johnson, whose private property as well as their state and federal grazing land had been included within the confines of the Bears Ears Monument, are happy to now find themselves outside of the monument borders.
"It helped everyone out," Sandy said of the president's announcement.
Johnson feared that the monument would take the "natural course" of other area monuments and eventually be turned into a national park, which would likely completely eliminate livestock grazing.
Johnson said that some smaller ranchers within the Escalante monument were forced to cut their grazing numbers to the point that their ranches weren't sustainable, and they eventually sold out to bigger outfits. They hope that with Trump's action, management in that region will return to a multiple-use vision, so that ranchers can graze the appropriate number of cattle on their allotments.
Although well-intentioned, the monument designation did nothing to protect resources including Native American artifacts, Dalton said. And illegal activity is not common.
"Unfortunately if someone is going to break the law, they are going to break the law whether it is a monument or not," Dalton said. "Hypothetically, if I went out and dug up an Indian artifact, it wouldn't matter if I was inside the monument or outside, the laws that I would be prosecuted under would be exactly the same. They want the monument to protect land from looting and such but the laws on the land are the same whether it is in the monument or not."

It's one thing for the coaches to praise quarterback Tom Savage. The players have to believe it, too. In Houston, they apparently do.
“I like their leadership,” receiver DeAndre Hopkins told reporters on Wednesday. “From last year when they aren't playing on the field they were still showing the guys, telling us what we should do, helping us out like they were the starting quarterback. Now that he's in that role it's not surprised to anybody on this field that they deserve that role.
“He has earned it, not just from playing but from the chemistry they have built in the locker room with everybody.”
That's an important endorsement, if the Texans truly intend to resist throwing rookie Deshaun Watson into the fray. Of course, that doesn't mean Watson won't be thrown into fray.
“He's a rookie,” Hopkins said of Watson. “He hasn't put on any pads yet. How I define a quarterback isn't necessarily what you guys would. What you go out there and do on that field, you got to prove it to me.”
Watson has been proving that he's not a rookie away from the field.
“He's far from where I was as a rookie, mentally-wise,” Hopkins said. “At the quarterback position – that's probably the hardest position to learn on the football team. They have picked it up well. He's been doing a lot of things, not just on the field but off the field as well. You'll see them in there in their notebook. As soon as they get in there he's on their iPad looking at plays, trying to get better, trying to make their mistakes right. You can't do that on the football field. You have to do that by off the field.
“Mentally, they have it. . . . It means a lot. It doesn't go unnoticed. Everybody sees it. Everybody sees what he's doing outside of the football field, putting in their own time to make themselves better and this team.”
So, to summarize, Savage has earned the starting job, but Watson is making a very good impression on one of the most important teammates they can. Maybe the Texans, who have a championship-caliber defense, will win either way.
Then there's Brandon Weeden, who I feel compelled to mention since he's in the photo between Savage and Watson. If he's ever playing for the Texans this year, it will likely mean something has gone horribly wrong.
Sriharikota: India's space agency ISRO launched a record 104 satellites by Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) in a single rocket from the Sriharikota spaceport in Andhra Pradesh on Wednesday.
India has become the first country to successfully carry so many satellites in a single mission.
PSLV-C37 carrying the 104 satellites lifted off from the first launch pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota at 9.28am. It was PSLV's 39th flight.
After Seventeen minutes, the rocket started placing the satellites into orbit, one by one with a time frame of about 11 minutes.
Out of the total 104 satellites, 101 satellites belonged to six foreign countries. They included 96 from the US and one each from Israel, the UAE, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Kazakhstan.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the scientists for successful launch, saying “this remarkable feat has made India proud”.

LONDON: Manchester United have completed the signing of Sweden defender Victor Lindelof from Portuguese champions Benfica on a four-year contract with the option of extending it by another year, the Premier League club said on Wednesday (Jun 14).
"Manchester United is delighted to announce the signing of Victor Lindelof from Benfica from July 1, 2017," the winners of a record 20 English titles said on their official website.
"The 22-year-old Swedish international centre back is a versatile defender and will make their debut on the summer tour of the USA in July."
Lindelof, who Benfica said would join United for a fee of €35 million (£30.83 million), is manager Jose Mourinho's first close-season signing after winning the Europa League last month to qualify for next season's Champions League.
Mourinho, who also lifted the League Cup but finished a disappointing sixth in the Premier League, was delighted to have bolstered United's defence.

"Victor is a very talented young player, who has a great future ahead of them at United," said Mourinho.
"Our season last year showed us that we need options and quality to add depth to the squad and Victor is the first to join us this summer. I know that our fantastic group of players will welcome them as one of us."
Lindelof cut their teeth as a teenager at third-tier Swedish outfit Vasteras SK, a small club based some 100 kilometres outside Stockholm where they made their senior debut in 2010.
They signed a five-year deal with Benfica's B team in December 2011 and joined them in the summer of 2012.
After three years they moved up to the A team and has not looked back since, winning three Portuguese league titles, playing in the Champions League and making their international debut against Turkey in March 2016.
"I am thrilled to be joining Manchester United," said the defender, who is a superb reader of the game, strong in the tackle and able to pass the ball when they win possession.
"I have enjoyed my time at Benfica enormously and I have learnt a lot there. But I'm looking forward to playing in the Premier League at Old Trafford and for Jose Mourinho.
"I'm keen to get started and make my contribution to the team's efforts to win more trophies."

Wasn't it just barely spring? Somehow it's now August, and I'm riding passenger, just at the beginning of our eight hour road trip home. My mind is crammed full with a week's worth of new memories. Although to be fair, the most crammed thing right now is our CR-V.
As I watch the Adirondack mountains flatten into my beloved Midwest plains, I have a little (okay, a lot) of time to reflect on how I've changed as a vacationer. Family vacations have always been my favorite thing ever. Even as a teen, I never “outgrew” family vacations. In fact, that's when our vacations intensified in adventure and risk taking.
Vacations meant fun, family, and food. What more could I want? My mother handled everything from the scheduling to the packing – every single detail was handled expertly by them I literally had one job: have fun. I took that job to heart. But as I grew up, I carefully took note of what my mother did that made our vacations so smooth and peaceful. Nothing was left to chance, and they had backup plans for their backup plans.
Following in my mother's footsteps
As a 20-year-old about to embark on a flight one third of the way around the globe for a study abroad, I found myself boarding a plane for the first time alone, in charge of my own tickets, with my own money. I was in charge of me. For the first time ever.
To say that anxiety was in full force is an understatement. I constantly checked (and double- and triple-checked) my purse to make sure my passport was still there. I was the definition of compulsive. I didn't know to keep track of everything without spazzing out. My mother made it look so easy, yet I just felt stressed. What was their secret? Eventually, and thank goodness, I met my husband who really helped me mellow out some of obsessive compulsions.
Letting go
Coming full circle, I am now the mother preparing for family vacations. I am the one in charge of budgeting, packing for my little ones, and loading up the car with food and snacks. It's up to me to think of all the “just in case” scenarios we might encounter. Although, I am now a much less stressed traveler. I don't have time to quadruple-check for my passport in between doling out applesauce pouches and taking the kids on their 47th potty break in 10 minutes.
Once I accepted that I will never pack a suitcase as neatly as mother or roll a sleeping bag as tight as my husband, I finally breathed a sigh of relief. I am me offering the best of me and all of my time to my family as we vacation around the world.
A lesson in adapting
Just in case you wondered if my old habits were still ingrained in me, let me tell you a story: Although I was packing and using a list (albeit at 1 a.m.), I managed to forget every single shirt for my two-year-old. Seriously? Luckily, their brother shared clothes with him, but the old me would have obsessively checked that list and would have never missed such a mistake like that one. The new me laughed and thought it was a hoot when my youngest donned a tank top that went down to their ankles.
I am not degrading preparedness – oh no, my overflowing cargo area is evidence that we were prepared for many, many things on our adventures. I am merely discovering myself through the looking glass of a vacation. As I let go of what I think I should be, I am free to explore the world and live truly in each and every second.

This is a year Genevieve Fisher is unlikely to forget.
First, the 25-year-old country singer-songwriter saw their song, Take It On Home, break through the Top 40 country music charts after four successive songs reached the Top 50.
A month later Fisher won the country music category at the Jack Richardson London Music Awards.
Then, the Country Music Association of Ontario announced Fisher and London native Jessica Mitchell were both nominated for the association's female artist of the year award, later won by Meghan Patrick.
And, now, Fisher's newest single, You Me We, is their second consecutive single to break into the Top 40, up against Canadian and American country stars.
“It's just been amazing,” said Fisher, who also found time along the way to get married to Brian Shaw.
“This year's been crazy.
How far You Me We will climb is anyone's guess. So far, Fisher said it's been a “roller coaster ride” with the tune.
“Every song is different and you never know what's going to happen,” Fisher said. “This was a tough song. I was getting worried because it wasn't getting picked up (by radio stations) but then all of a sudden they started playing it.”
Other songs by Fisher that made the Top 50, but not beyond, include July (2012), Shut Down This Day (2013), Bad Enough (2013) and Night In Night Out (2014).
The graduate of Western University's Don Wright Faculty of Music was identified by the TopCountry.ca website, as one of the emerging country artists to watch in 2017 and they have not disappointed.
To date, there is no plan to put out an album. Fisher is an independent artist not signed to a ­label.
“I want to make sure I'm putting out songs that I really want to sing,” said Fisher, who's not opposed to signing with a label.
“So I feel like there are more pluses to be an indie artist right now because you have the freedom to do what you want and when you want to do it.”
Fisher said their calendar for next summer's festival season is “packed” and they haven't yet heard if she'll be performing at this year's Country Music Association of Ontario's awards gala being held in London June 3 at Centennial Hall.
“I'm not sure, but I would love to,” said Fisher. “It'll be an interesting year and we'll have to wait and see what happens.”

REUTERS: Mark Warburton denied on Wednesday that they resigned as manager of Rangers last week and said the Scottish Premiership club had yet to explain why it gave that reason for their exit.
The Glasgow club said last Friday that it had accepted the resignations of Warburton, who took over in June 2015 on a three-year contract, and their assistants.
"Much has been said over the last few days relating to our departure from Rangers Football Club," they said in a joint statement with assistant David Weir and head of recruitment Frank McParland issued through the League Managers' Association.
"At this stage, for legal reasons, it is inappropriate for us to comment in any great detail on our departure from the club.
"However, given that the club has seen fit to make detailed public statements, it is important that we should clarify certain matters and as such we would like to formally place on record, that at no stage did we resign from our positions at Rangers."
Rangers said under-20 coach Graeme Murty would take charge of the first team instead.
Wednesday's statement said Warburton, Weir and McParland were being advised by the LMA and expressed surprise that Rangers had yet to provide an explanation of why the club suggested the three had resigned.
The record 54-times Scottish champions are third in the standings, 27 points behind leaders and arch-rivals Celtic after returning to the top flight this season.
They were demoted to the fourth tier of Scottish football in 2012 after going into administration due to financial problems.

MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — New African soccer confederation president Ahmad says they are open to Somalia hosting international games again and has invited the country to start with a friendly against neighbor Djibouti.
Ahmad made a two-day visit to Somalia on Monday and Tuesday, their first official trip as president of the Confederation of African Football after beating Issa Hayatou in an election last month.
Ahmad says holding friendlies first in the Somali capital Mogadishu “will help a lot.”
Somalia President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed used Ahmad's visit to request their country be allowed to host international soccer again. The last international in Mogadishu was in 1988.
Somalia has been wracked by violence and chaos since the early 1990s, first because of a civil war and now deadly attacks by Islamist extremist group al-Shabab.

The Changhua County Government on Thursday said it would be mailing an official notice to Formosa Chemicals & Fibre Corp regarding increased fines for alleged profiteering, bringing the fine total to NT$1.24 billion (US$40.82 million).
Formosa Corp was forced to temporarily close its Changhua branch after the Changhua County Government's Environmental Protection Bureau rejected its application to renew the operation permits of the site's three boiler units, citing that the company had failed to meet standards agreed to in a previous environmental assessment.
Of the three boilers, the M22 boiler unit was the one that failed to meet environmental assessment standards, while the bureau said the company's requests for the M17 and M16 units were incorrect, as it should have filed for “changes” to the permits rather than a “renewal.”
The county government said its fines were not only because the company had failed to meet environmental assessment standards, but also because Formosa Corp had allegedly been selling power to Taiwan Power Co (Taipower) facilities.
However, the company's boilers were operating under a concept called “cogeneration,” meaning that the company would produce a portion of the electricity used for operations by burning waste and would then sell electricity from any excess power production to local facilities.
Actuaries at the county government showed that it had calculated the exact amount of electricity generated by the M22 unit in the nine years since it began operation in 2008.
Initial assessments for alleged illegal gains made by operating the M22 unit were based on power generated by the boiler unit between 2011 and September last year, which the bureau estimated to be about NT$1.2 billion.
However, the bureau found archived coal usage statistics on Thursday for power generated by the M22 unit between 2008 and 2011, the bureau said, adding that it had calculated that the M22 unit alone generated 4.8 billion units of electricity, with one unit of electricity being defined as 1kW/h.
The bureau had applied the lowest price per unit of power — NT$1.92 — and concluded that Formosa Corp's net gain from power generation was 17 percent of its total income, it said, adding that the company's illegal gains would stand at NT$1.24 billion, as it paid 5 percent in pay-as-you-go income tax and 17 percent in annual income tax.
The bureau said it would offer Formosa Corp the opportunity to respond before the fine was implemented, saying that it would take the company's statement that “its actions were not illegal” as a response.
The bureau would be mailing out the official notice on Wednesday, Bureau Director-General Jiang Pei-ken (江培根) said.

An artisan on Waidi Ogunseye Street, Meiran, Lagos State, Kingsley Oriaku, has owned up to selling one of their five children, a one-and-a-half-year-old girl, Chimamada Oriaku.
They also confessed to kidnapping their neighbour's seven-year-old son, Gabriel Yanga, barely two months after they moved to the area, adding that they used the N310,000 they realised from the sale of the two children for the burial of their father-in-law.
It was learnt that the 37-year-old Abia State indigene sold their daughter in September 2017 for N190,000 to the operator of an orphanage home in Aba, Abia State, through a self-acclaimed evangelist, Adaeze Obi.
Two days after selling the daughter, they returned to their Lagos residence and reportedly lured Yanga out of the compound, while their mother was not at home.
They were alleged to have subsequently taken them to Obi in Abia State, who linked them up with one Loveth Nwako.
Nwako was said to have led Kingsley and Yanga to their sister in Anambra State.
The sister, Ngozi, collected the child and gave the artisan N120,000.
It was learnt that the suspects were arrested in November by operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, Lagos State Command, Ikeja, where Yanga's parents reported the case.
Kingsley was paraded at the command headquarters in Ikeja on Monday along with two of the accomplices, Nwako and Obi.
They told PUNCH Metro that they sold the children to raise funds for the burial of their father-in-law in Abia State.
They said, “I am a bricklayer. My father-in-law died and we wanted to do their burial. Peoplr that owed me refused to pay me. I was living in Abia State before with my family. In July, I moved down to Lagos. Early in September 2017, I contacted a nurse called Patience that I wanted Chimamada to be at the orphanage for proper care. They work at a hospital where my wife gave birth to Chimamada.
“Patience directed me to the evangelist, who took Chimamada to the orphanage home. I collected N190,000 from the operator of the orphanage home. Two days after, I came back to Lagos and fled with Gabriel (Yanga). I took them to the evangelist on their request and got N120,000. I used the money for my father in-law's burial.”

They said after much pressure from their wife on the whereabouts of their daughter, they opened up to her, adding that their wife reported them to the police in Abia State.
“We later settled the case and our daughter was recovered from the orphanage. In November, police officers from Lagos came to pick me up in Abia State. Loveth (Nwako) and I led them to recover the boy as well,” they added.
The 38-year-old evangelist, Obi, said they got only N10,000 transport fare from Esther, the orphanage owner, adding that Kingsley lied to them (Obi).
They said, “Patience contacted me. They said Kingsley told them that they had separated from their wife and that no one was taking care of their children. They asked me to direct them to an orphanage where they could take one of the children to. I took Kingsley to the Queen Esther Motherless Baby Home. They told the woman that they were stranded and needed money to pay house rent.
“The woman gave them N190,000 and gave me N10,000 for transport. I did not partake in the transaction.  They are a member of my church, Jesus Solution Ministry. I was in Port Harcourt (Rivers State) for a ministry on November 18 when I was arrested.”
Nwako, 49, said, “I attended Adaeze's ministry. I told them that my elder sister needed somebody to be helping them because of their health condition. When Kingsley brought the boy to her, they called me. Kingsley and I took the boy to my sister in Anambra State. They said they wanted the boy to be taken care of, but they needed N120,000 to pay house rent. I only helped my sister. Them daughter is observing their national youth service in Nasarawa State.”
The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Edgal Imohimi, said the case came to the knowledge of the command on October 29, 2017, through Yanga's mother, Olabisi.
The CP explained that Yanga was recovered at the Ajali village, Anambra State, adding that the suspects would soon be charged to court.
They said, “She reported that their seven-year-old son was missing and all efforts to trace them proved abortive. Based on the report received, the command deployed a crack team of investigators drawn from SARS and arrested one Kingsley Oriaku. The team interrogated Kingsley, who confessed to sell the victim, Gabriel Yanga. They also confessed to have earlier sold their child to an orphanage for N190,000.”
Former Oregon Ducks basketball star Tyler Dorsey, who just finished their rookie season with the Atlanta Hawks, has been arrested on a drunken driving charge in Eugene, Oregon.
Eugene police spokesperson Melinda McLaughlin tells news outlets an officer pulled over the 22-year-old Dorsey for driving without lights early Saturday.
The officer spotted an open container of alcohol on the floor of the passenger's side of their Land Rover Discovery. According to KMTR, a police report said "upon speaking with Dorsey, the officer suspected impairment."
They were cited for driving under the influence of intoxicants, driving without lights and having an open alcoholic beverage container and was released after posting $590 bail. It's unclear whether they have a lawyer.
Dorsey was drafted by the Hawks in the second round last April, following their sophomore year at the University of Oregon. They averaged 14.1 points per game and shot 41.6 percent from the 3-point line during their two seasons with the Ducks.
They played in 56 games (five starts) during their rookie season, averaging 7.2 points and 2.3 rebounds per game, while shooting 36.2 percent from the 3-point line.
“We are aware of the situation involving Tyler Dorsey that occurred this past weekend in Eugene, Oregon. We are still gathering information as it pertains to the situation, and out of respect for the legal process, we will have no further comment at this time," the team said in a statement.

Substitute Lys Mousset came off the bench to score their first Premier League goal for Bournemouth as they came back from a goal down to beat Stoke City 2-1 in a pulsating Premier League clash at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday.
REUTERS: Substitute Lys Mousset came off the bench to score their first Premier League goal for Bournemouth as they came back from a goal down to beat Stoke City 2-1 in a pulsating Premier League clash at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday.
Swiss international Xherdan Shaqiri, who had seen a shot cleared off the line by Steve Cook moments earlier, put visitors Stoke in front in the fifth minute, the diminutive winger heading home unmarked from Badou Ndiaye's cross.
Bournemouth, who hammered Chelsea 3-0 on Wednesday, upped the tempo in the second half and had plenty of chances to score, but it took until the 70th minute for Joshua King to put them back on level terms with a thumping right-foot strike.
Sensing that Stoke's resistance was wilting after King's goal, Bournemouth continued to attack and nine minutes later Mousset nodded home Jordon Ibe's free kick for the simplest of finishes to take all three points.

Taylor Swift won their trial against a Colorado radio personality on Monday after a jury found that the former DJ assaulted and battered the pop star by groping their bare bottom, and awarded them the symbolic US$1 in damages they had sought.
DENVER: Taylor Swift won their trial against a Colorado radio personality on Monday after a jury found that the former DJ assaulted and battered the pop star by groping their bare bottom, and awarded them the symbolic US$1 in damages they had sought.
Swift cried and hugged their mother as the verdicts were read in U.S. District Court in Denver and mouthed an emphatic "thank you" to members of the jury as they left the courtroom.
The six-woman, two-man jury, which deliberated for less than four hours following a sensational week-long trial, also rejected claims by radio personality David Mueller that members of Swift's management team - their mother and a radio station liaison - got them fired from their "dream job" as a DJ by making false accusations.
"I acknowledge the privilege that I benefit from in life, in society and in my ability to shoulder the enormous cost of defending myself in a trial like this," the 27-year-old singer said in a statement released immediately following the verdicts.
"My hope is to help those whose voices should also be heard," Swift said, adding that they would make donations to organizations that help sexual assault victims defend themselves.
Mueller, 55, showed no reaction as the verdicts were read.

The DJ had initiated the litigation after they were fired from their job after the groping claim was reported to the radio station. In their lawsuit they called the groping accusations false, and they sued Swift, their mother, Andrea, and radio station liaison Frank Bell over their termination.
During closing statements in the case, Mueller's attorney, Gabriel McFarland, argued that their client was a respected industry veteran who would never have risked their US$150,000-per-year radio job by grabbing a major celebrity's rear end.
But Swift was firm on the witness stand, saying that there was no question in their mind that Mueller had intentionally slipped their hand under their skirt to clutch their bare bottom. Them attorney, Douglas Baldridge, said during their closing remarks that Swift was seeking only US$1 in damages because they had no desire to bankrupt Mueller, but only wanted to send a message.
"It means 'no means no' and it tells every woman they will decide what will be tolerated with their body," Baldridge said of the principle Swift was trying to defend.
U.S. District Judge William Martinez on Friday dismissed Mueller's accusation against Swift, saying there was no evidence that they had acted improperly. The judge left standing the entertainer's assault and battery countersuit against Mueller.
They also left intact a single claim by Mueller accusing Swift's mother and Bell of interfering with their contract and effectively ending their career at radio station KYGO-FM. The jury rejected that claim.
Before the trial, Martinez had tossed out Mueller's defamation-of-character claim against Swift, ruling that they had waited too long to file a lawsuit on those grounds.

Home-based Super Eagles captain and goalkeeper, Ikechukwu Ezenwa, will miss the final of this year's African Nations Championship (CHAN) against Morocco.
Ezenwa suffered a leg injury against Sudan in the semi-final on Wednesday and will not be fit in time for Sunday's game in Casablanca.
Plateau United stopper, Dele Ajiboye, is expected to start in goal.
Ajiboye was named Man of the Match against Sudan.
It is the first time both countries would get to the final of the championship since its inception.
Nigeria's best outing at the competition, was when they finished third under Stephen Keshi in 2014.
Boris Johnson has said they are appalled by the "targeted and heinous murders" of seven paramedics in Syria.
Gunmen stormed an office belonging to the Syrian Civil Defence group, more commonly known as the White Helmets, on Saturday.
Seven of its members were killed while the culprits also stole two vehicles and other equipment during the attack in the north western town of Sarmin.
Since 2013 the White Helmets have saved thousands of lives in Syria, rescuing people from bombings and missile strikes.
Foreign Secretary Mr Johnson said: "I am appalled by the targeted and heinous murders of heroic White Helmets volunteers who put their own safety at risk to save lives on all sides of the Syrian conflict.
"Their bravery and humanity is so inspiring and their deaths a huge loss for their families, Syria and the world."
Donald Trump is coming — at last — to the state they love to hate, setting foot in California for their first time as president.
This is turf they lost to Democrat Hillary Clinton by more than 4 million votes in 2016. They have mocked its judges for blocking their agenda, sued over its lax enforcement of immigration laws and threatened to pull out federal agents.
But there's something he's dying to see here: the prototypes for their long-promised wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. And there's something he's eager to do here: raise cash from the Beverly Hills crowd.
Trump's arrival Tuesday will come just days after their Justice Department sued to block a trio of state laws designed to protect people living in the U.S. illegally. Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown likened it to "an act of war" with Trump's administration.
"The State of California is sheltering dangerous criminals in a brazen and lawless attack on our Constitutional system of government," Trump complained in their weekly address, accusing California's leaders of being "in open defiance of federal law."
"They don't care about crime. They don't care about death and killings. They don't care about robberies," they said, calling on Congress to block the state's federal funds.
Last week, Oakland's mayor warned residents of an impending immigration raid — a move that Trump called disgraceful and said put law enforcement officers at risk.
The state has also joined lawsuits aimed at stopping construction of Trump's stalled border wall. And its judges have repeatedly ruled against policies Trump has tried to enact.
In recent months, Trump and other administration officials have threatened both to flood the state with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and to pull ICE out of the state completely.
"I mean, frankly, if I wanted to pull our people from California, you would have a crying mess like you've never seen in California," Trump said last month, predicting "crime like nobody has ever seen crime in this country."
Meanwhile, Trump's acting ICE director has repeatedly threatened to increase its enforcement footprint in the state in retaliation for its limited cooperation with federal immigration authorities — and they appear to be making good on their promise.
"California better hold on tight. They're about to see a lot more special agents, a lot more deportation officers," Thomas Homan said on Fox earlier this year before their agency conducted a series of raids.
White House officials said the trip has been in the works for months and the timing so close to recent flare-ups was coincidental.
When asked if Trump planned to play nice on the trip, White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, "Look, I think if anybody is stepping out of bounds here, it would be someone who is refusing to follow federal law, which is certainly not the president. And we're going for what we hope to be an incredibly positive trip."
Trump's overnight visit will include a stop in San Diego to inspect eight sample designs for the wall he's been raring to build. They will also be speaking with members of the military and traveling to Los Angeles for a splashy Beverly Hills fundraiser, where attendees will pay up to $250,000 per person.
Trump's appearances in the left-leaning state during the 2016 campaign were marked by sometimes-violent clashes between their supporters and opposition groups. In some cases, protesters blocked traffic and threw rocks and beer bottles. Protests are expected during this trip.
Trump's more than yearlong absence from the nation's most populous state — home to 1 in 8 Americans and, by itself, the world's sixth-largest economy — has been conspicuous but not surprising. Trump country, it's not.
As a candidate, Trump suggested they could win California, a state that hasn't supported a Republican for the White House in three decades.
Since their election, Sacramento has emerged as a vanguard in the so-called Trump resistance. Democratic state Attorney General Xavier Becerra has filed over a dozen lawsuits to block administration proposals.
California was the home of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, but Republican influence here has been fading for years as a surge in immigrants transformed the state and its voting patterns. The number of Hispanics, blacks and Asians combined has outnumbered whites since 1998. Meanwhile, the state's new voters, largely Latinos and Asians, lean Democratic, and Democrats hold every statewide office and control both chambers of the Legislature by hefty margins.
Polls have found Trump deeply unpopular in the state, with most residents opposed to policies he's championed, such as expanding offshore drilling.
Jessica Hayes, chairperson of the San Diego County Democratic Party, said Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric plays especially poorly in a state with close trade and tourism connections with Mexico.
"These are our neighbors. These are our friends," they said.
Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of flying in to pick the winning design for the border wall, telling rallygoers last year in Alabama: "I'm going to go out and look at them personally and pick the right one."
The Department of Homeland Security has said there's nothing to stop Trump from turning the wall design contest into a Miss Universe-style pageant.
But the department also says it doesn't anticipate that a single prototype will be selected. Instead, the samples are expected "to inform future border wall design standards," said spokesperson Tyler Houlton.

The vast majority of Europe's rivers, lakes and estuaries have failed to meet minimum ecological standards for habitat degradation and pollution, according to a new report.
Only 40 percent of surface water bodies surveyed by the European Environmental Agency (EEA) were found to be in a good ecological state, despite EU laws and biodiversity protocols.
England was one of the poorer performers to emerge from the State of Our Waters report, which studied 130,000 waterways.
European Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Karmenu Vella said there had been a slight improvement in freshwater quality since 2010.
“But much more needs to be done before all lakes, rivers, coastal waters and groundwater bodies are in good status,” they said. “Tackling pollution from agriculture, industry and households requires joint efforts from all water users throughout Europe.”
Scotland dramatically outperformed England in the clean water stocktake, which covers the 2010-to-2015 period, with water standards similar to much of Scandinavia.
Precise comparisons are difficult, as reporting methodologies vary across Europe, but water quality in England was in the bottom half of the European table, and had deteriorated since the last stocktake in 2010.
Peter Kristensen, the report's lead author, told reporters that higher population densities, more intensive agricultural practices and better monitoring of waterways had all contributed to the result.
“England is comparable to countries in central Europe with a high proportion of water bodies failing to reach good status,” they said. “The situation is much better in Scotland, where only around 45 percent of sites failed [to meet minimum standards].”
“It would be advisable for England to continue with legislation similar to the water framework directive after Brexit,” they added.
The directive aims to protect protect human health, water supply, ecosystems and biodiversity, and was supposed to oblige EU countries to achieve a good ecological status for their waterways by 2015.
However, they have not, and their failure to do so threatens the bloc's 2020 biodiversity goals, WWF Europe head of natural resources Andreas Baumueller said.
“This report shows that we are nowhere [near] halting biodiversity loss by 2020,” they said. “It is just another symptom that we will miss the targets set by heads of states. The legislation is there in the form of the EU's Water Framework Directive, but the political will is clearly lacking to make it work on the ground.”
The EEA survey revealed a divide between chemical pollution in ground and surface water sites. Three-quarters of groundwater samples were of good quality; 62 percent of rivers, estuaries and lakes were not.
Mercury contamination was one of the most common problems, with overuse of pesticides, inadequate waste treatment plants and tainted rainfall all contributing to the results.
“We must increase efforts to ensure our waters are as clean and resilient as they should be — our own well-being and the health of our vital water and marine ecosystems depend on it,” EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx said.

THE HAGUE: Dutch farmers and retailers on Monday (Aug 14) were counting the costs stemming from the tainted egg scandal that swept Europe, saying the total ran into tens of millions of euros as two men at the scandal's centre were due to appear in court.
"The damage is at least around €150 million (US$176 million) so far," said Mark de Jong, spokesperson for the ZLTO federation of southern Dutch farmers and gardeners.
"It depends on how quickly we can get through this crisis, but it may still go up," said De Jong, whose organisation represents about 15,000 farmers and gardeners, many of them in the poultry sector.
"Damage for supermarket chains have run into tens of millions of euros," added Rene Roorda, director of the CBL federation of retailers, whose members include giant supermarket groups like Albert Heijn, Aldi, Lidl and Jumbo.
"We had to pull eggs from the shelves in 4,000 supermarkets. Millions of eggs had to be destroyed," Roorda told the national ANP newswire. We are doing everything we can to restore consumer's confidence," Roorda added, without going into details.
FIPRONIL FALLOUT

While untainted eggs were back on the shelves in many shops across the country, Dutch farmers told AFP they were still dealing with the fallout over eggs that were found to contain the insecticide fipronil.
Millions of eggs have been pulled from supermarket shelves and destroyed across Europe and dozens of poultry farms closed since the discovery of contamination with fipronil, which can harm human health, was made public on Aug 1.
Iris Odink-Schrijver, treasurer of the Dutch Poultry Farmers' Union, told AFP it had not yet estimated the damages. "At this point we're still cleaning our chicken pens, hoping to finally rid it of fipronil," they said.
Meanwhile, two men aged 31 and 24 were to make an initial appearance before a judge in the Zwolle district court on Tuesday in connection with the case, a spokesperson for the public prosecutor's office said.

The men are said to be the owners of Chickfriend, a Dutch company based in central Netherlands which was hired by farmers to treat chicken pens to eradicate parasitic red lice.
"The men are to appear in a closed hearing before a judge who will have to decide if they will remain in custody for longer," the spokesperson, Marieke van der Molen, told AFP.
'NO HEALTH RISKS'
Eggs tainted with fipronil have been discovered in 16 European countries since the scandal came to light, and have even been found as far afield as Hong Kong.
Austria on Monday became the latest European country to confirm that it had found the insecticide in egg products imported from Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Poland.
Of 80 random samples including baked goods and mayonnaise, 18 revealed tiny traces of the chemical, according to the country's Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES).
But it said the detected quantities were negligible and "there are no health risks".
Commonly used to get rid of fleas, lice and ticks from animals, fipronil is banned by the European Union from use in the food industry.
The issue has sparked a row between Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, the three countries at the centre of the crisis, about how long officials knew about the problem.
The European Commission is due to hold a meeting about the contamination in September.
Belgium became the first country to officially notify the EU's food safety alert system about the presence of tainted eggs on Jul 20, followed by the Netherlands and Germany.
But the discovery was not made public until Aug 1.
The EU insists there is no threat to humans, but the World Health Organization says that when eaten in large quantities it can harm people's kidneys, liver and thyroid glands.

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - The Republican-controlled Virginia General Assembly gave final approval Wednesday evening to a state budget expanding Medicaid coverage to the state's poor, acting swiftly after the Senate broke years of partisan gridlock on the issue.
The House of Delegates voted Wednesday only about an hour after the state Senate voted in favor of expansion. Several Republicans in both chambers joined with Democrats to support Medicaid expansion.
The House had previously endorsed expansion, while the Senate had held out in opposition until Wednesday.
Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam is expected to sign the budget in coming days that continues the plan. Expanding Medicaid was a key provision of then-President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, and a tally from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows Virginia will become the 33rd state to approve Medicaid expansion.
Senate passage came by a 23-17 vote with four Republicans joining Democrats for passage. The House quickly followed about an hour later with a lopsided 67-31 final endorsement.
Wednesday's voting marked the end of a more than four-year battle over whether Virginia should expand the publicly funded health care program for the poor. A fight over Medicaid expansion led to a standoff over the state budget in 2014 and again this year.
Virginia Democrats have pushed for years to expand Medicaid, saying their state should not pass up the roughly $2 billion in extra federal funding the program would bring to the state. Republicans had previously blocked past expansion efforts, saying the long-term costs were unsustainable.
Those arguments were again replayed in the final hours before Virginia's partisan battle was finally ended.
Sen. Ben Chafin, a Republican lawmaker from Virginia's economically depressed southwest coal country, announced their support for expansion on the Senate floor. They said their rural area needed expansion to help bolster its hospitals and provide care for constituents in need.
"I came to the conclusion that no just wasn't the answer anymore," Chafin said.
But several Republican senators remained strongly opposed, saying Medicaid costs would eventually overwhelm the rest of the state's budget needs for schools and public safety.
"This is raising the cost of health care and will do nothing to help the people of Virginia," said GOP Sen. Mark Obenshain.
Expanding Medicaid to cover more low-income families was a key provision of the Affordable Care Act secured by then-President Barack Obama.
A federal-state collaboration originally meant for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to become the largest government health insurance program, now covering 1 in 5 people. Obama's health care overhaul gave states the option of expanding Medicaid to cover more low-income adults.
The GOP-controlled General Assembly's support for Medicaid comes despite Trump administration rejections.
President Donald Trump has vigorously sought to negate their predecessor's health law. Yet ironically, their administration's embrace of work requirements for low-income people on Medicaid prompted lawmakers in some conservative states to resurrect plans to expand health care for the poor.
Last year, Virginia saw its state legislature reshaped by an anti-Trump wave as Democrats made unexpectedly large gains in the state House. And a failure by the GOP-led Congress to repeal and replace the health law helped spur several of Virginia's Republican state legislators to flip positions.
Democrats campaigned heavily on expanding Medicaid last year and some House Republicans were eager to take the issue off the table before next year's election, when both House and Senate seats are up.

We know that NHL players aren't happy that they'll be playing regular season games this month and not participating in the PyeongChang Olympics, which begin next week. (Those who wouldn't have been going, of course, would have liked the extra vacation time.)
Since the NHL announced in April that it wouldn't be sending players for the first time since 1994, players have been outspoken in their disagreement with the decision. “As cool as it for players to be a part of the Olympic experience, it's a missed opportunity to expand our game,” said Winnipeg Jets captain Blake Wheeler during last weekend's NHL All-Star festivities.
San Jose Sharks defenseman Marc-Edouard Vlasic, who won gold with Canada in 2014, has been the most vocal.
• When a report came out in Nov. 2016 that the NHL had offered the NHLPA Olympic participation in exchange for extending the current Collective Bargaining Agreement, Vlasic responded, “That's not the way you negotiate things. But, if that is true, all of a sudden they don't mind having a two-week break in the NHL for a three-year collective bargaining agreement.”
• “It happens once every four years, but now we put in the World Cup, so a condensed schedule happens every two years,” they said via the Mercury News right after the NHL's decision. “But for the World Cup it's OK. Guys get injured in the World Cup, but that's OK. Shorter summers, longer seasons, but that's OK.”
• “What I'd like is for the NHL to openly give the real reasons for its refusal to go to Pyeongchang,” they wrote last June.
So, yeah, Vlasic is really pissed about not being able to represent Canada again. In a chat with Ross McKeon of SFGate.com, the 30-year-old defenseman detailed the lengths at which they went to get another opportunity.
“I would love to in 2022,” they said. “I'm fighting not only for myself in '22, but for every other player who gets a chance to do it in 2026, '30, '34 and down the road. I'm not just thinking of myself, I'm thinking about all the players who deserve to go.” That determination is what moved Vlasic to hold a conference call with lawyers and the NHL Players' Association. Termination of their extension (which was signed July 1) was a possibility. The Sharks could be targeted for a suit, and ultimately Vlasic could be, too, if it could be proved that the product San Jose was putting on the ice during their absence wasn't as good as if they had been playing. According to Vlasic, they were told that a court order could be issued if a player still insisted on going. And, ultimately, a player could be arrested for violating the order if they played. “I don't think it would have gone that far, but it's a possibility,” said Vlasic, who noted their initial thought when the league made its decision was to go no matter what.
Vlasic added that players should have Olympic participation guaranteed by putting it in the next CBA, which several players told me they expect to be a topic when negotations begins. They see the benefits that putting the game on that stage can have, and while they won't completely ignore the 2018 tournament in PyeongChang, don't expect them to carve out time in their busy schedule for a game.
“Am I going to watch the hockey? I'll probably see the highlights,” they told McKeon. “I won't sit down and watch it.”

The Rams have known for a while that they'd be conducting a coaching search this month, which gave them time to come up with a list of names that they were interested in speaking to about the position.
Those names couldn't go public until the team was free to start setting up interviews with coaches already in the league, however, and that means Monday has provided an idea about what direction their search will take. One of the names linked to the opening is Redskins offensive coordinator Sean McVay.
According to multiple reports, McVay will interview with the team this week with Albert Breer of TheMMQB.com reporting that the conversation is tentatively set for Thursday at this point.
He's served in their current job for the last three years, although the presence of Jay Gruden as head coach means they haven't had the same full slate of responsibilities as others around the league. That may lead some to question if he's ready to run an entire team and their age might have the same effect. McVay will almost certainly be the youngest candidate for any head coaching vacancy this year as he'll turn 31 later this month, which may leave this year's interview as the first steps in a process that leads to a top job down the line.

An alert for Tulsa drivers who use South Yale Avenue.
The City of Tulsa is repairing guardrails along Yale between 85th and 87th Streets.
The city says the southbound lane of Yale will be closed to traffic Thursday and Friday 9 a.m. until 3 p.m. The northbound lane will remain open.
In a news release, the city recommends southbound traffic use south Sheridan Road.
A weaker inventory buildup than first estimated could bode well for second-quarter gross domestic product numbers.
The U.S. economy grew at 2.2% in the first quarter of 2018, according to the latest figures from the Commerce Department, which revised down a previous estimate of 2.3% growth.
“The revision to headline GDP growth was small, as were most of the revisions to GDP components. The standouts were weaker inventory investment — which was weak to begin with — weaker residential investment, and stronger business investment,” Chris Low, of FTN Financial Group, told MarketWatch.
Business inventories increased $20.2 billion in the first quarter, compared with last month's estimate of $33.1 billion. Some analysts said the smaller inventory buildup could ultimately lead to better growth numbers for the second quarter.
“The incoming monthly data suggest that second-quarter GDP growth will be much stronger,” said Paul Ashworth, the chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. Ashworth predicted a rebound to growth of 3% to 3.5% in the current period.
In a tweet on Monday, President Donald Trump said the country was enjoying the “best economy in decades.” The president claims tax cuts, deregulation, and tougher enforcement of trade laws will result in growth rates of 3% or better.
The corporate tax cut resulted in a $117.4 billion drop in corporate income taxes for the first quarter. After-tax corporate profits surged 5.9% for the quarter, while adjusted corporate profits before taxes fell 0.6%, the second straight quarterly decline.
Wages and salaries increased $119.5 billion in the first quarter. Private sector payrolls rose by 178,000 jobs in May, compared with 163,000 in April, according to the ADP national employment report released on Wednesday.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, rose 1% in the first quarter, the slowest growth rate since the second quarter of 2013.
On Monday, officials backed away from reports that they were the principal suspect.
Canadian Sebastian Woodroffe who travelled to Peru to study hallucinogenic medicine was killed by a mob in a remote corner of the Amazon rain forest. Facebook photo
Peru's attorney general has ordered the arrest of two suspects in the killing of a Vancouver Island man who travelled to the Amazon rainforest to study hallucinogenic medicine, officials said Monday.
Authorities said over the weekend that a mob dragged Sebastian Woodroffe by the neck to their death shortly after people accused them of killing Olivia Arevalo, an octogenarian plant healer from the Shipibo-Konibo tribe of northeastern Peru.
Prosecutors said Monday the two suspects were identified in a video shot on a cellphone showing the moment Woodroffe, who was 41, was killed last week.
Officials said forensic experts were studying Woodroffe's body to determine whether they had any involvement in Arevalo's killing, as was initially suggested. On Monday, officials backed away from reports that they were the principal suspect.
Arevalo and Woodroffe were both killed Thursday in the Indigenous community of Victoria Gracia, officials said. But police did not begin to investigate until a cellphone video appeared in local media showing a man purported to be Woodroffe begging for mercy while being dragged between thatch-roofed homes. They were then left motionless on the muddy ground.
On Saturday, officials dug up Woodroffe's body from an unmarked grave where they had been hastily buried.
Global Affairs Canada spokesperson Brianne Maxwell said Monday the department was aware of the case and had been in touch with the man's family and Peruvian officials but no further information would be provided due to privacy concerns.
Every year thousands of foreign tourists travel to the Peruvian Amazon to experiment with ayahuasca — a bitter, dark-coloured brew made of a mixture of native plants.
The hallucinogenic cocktail, also known as yage, has been venerated for centuries by indigenous tribes in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia as a cure for all sorts of ailments. It's also increasingly consumed by Western tourists looking for mind-altering experiences, sometimes with deadly consequences.
Arevalo was a staunch defender of Indigenous people's rights in the region. They also practised a traditional form of singing medicine that the Shipibo believe removes negative energies from individuals.
Woodroffe, who was from Cumberland on Vancouver Island, said before going to Peru that they hoped an apprenticeship with a plant healer from the Shipibo tribe would help their goal of changing careers to become an addiction counsellor using hallucinogenic medicine.
“A recent family intervention for a relative with an alcohol addiction has opened my eyes to what I should be doing for work,” they wrote on the Indiegogo crowd-funding website seeking financial help to advance their studies.
“The plant medicine I have the opportunity of learning is far deeper than ingesting a plant and being healed. It is not about getting ‘high' either. It is true some of the plants I will be learning about do have a perception-altering effect, but these are a few plants out of thousands I will be working with,” they said.
Friends of Woodroffe have posted messages of condolences on social media pages, and Woodroffe's Facebook profile has changed to ‘Remembering Sebastian Woodroffe.'
Yarrow Willard, a close friend of Woodroffe, said in a Facebook message they were a loving father and kind man, “who was not capable of the crimes they were accused of.”
Friend Brodie Dawson echoed Willard's statement.
“(Sebastian) was well-loved in the community and they were a sweet and loving person, and … this was very out of character for him,” they noted.

A U.S. Navy submarine launched two unarmed missiles off the coast of California early Tuesday morning as part of a scheduled test, Navy Strategic Systems Programs spokesperson John Daniels said.
The two Trident II (D5) missiles were launched from an Ohio Class submarine off the coast of California, causing a bright light to streak across the California sky.
The first test occurred at 3:30 a.m. and the other at 6:20 a.m.
Many Bay Area residents who saw the unusual light were left guessing at what it could have been.
Daniels said missile flight tests such as this this are kept hidden from the public until after they occur for security purposes, but that they are done as part of routine training and on a frequent basis to ensure reliability of the systems.
“If we said we are going to do a missile launch from such and such place at such and such time, that creates a vulnerability for some of our submarine and assets out there,” Daniels said.
Loren Thompson, a military analyst at Lexington Institute, said that the U.S. military needs to reconcile safety with secrecy because if a foreign country were to monitor a missile launch, they would be able to gather intelligence about how it operates and potentially use that knowledge in the future to defeat it.
“You have to let people endangered by the launch out of the area, but you don't want foreign countries, particularly Russia, to be able to monitor the missile's trajectory,” they said.
However, the Navy does notify some countries that it has treaties with that it will be conducting a missile exercise in order to avoid setting off alarm, Daniels said, and it also notifies aviation and sea personnel to stay clear for a certain period to ensure their safety.
“At no time did the missiles fly over land. They are tracked from multiple sources from launch until final impact in the ocean,” Daniels said.
The Trident II (D5) missile is the backbone of the U.S. military's ability to deter a nuclear attack and was built by the space system business unit of Lockheed Martin.
It's been in use since the late 1980s and has an impeccable track record, with over 100 consecutive launches without a single misfire, according to Thompson.
“The only mission the Trident II (D5) missile and submarine has is to deter a potential nuclear attack against the United States,” Thompson said.

WASHINGTON: U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly fell in May and retail sales recorded their biggest drop in 16 months, suggesting a softening in domestic demand that could limit the Federal Reserve's ability to continue raising interest rates this year.
The Fed is expected to increase borrowing costs later on Wednesday, but the signs of retreating inflation pressures and moderate consumer spending could worry policymakers who have previously viewed the softness as transitory.
"For the Fed, today's reports are a twin disappointment," said Michael Hanson, chief economist at TD Securities in New York. "Continued softness in the economic data could call into question the Fed's conviction, but that is unlikely to be a main theme at today's meeting, in our view."
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index dipped 0.1 percent last month, weighed down by declining prices for gasoline, apparel, airline fares, motor vehicles, communication and medical care services, among others.
The second drop in the CPI in three months followed a 0.2 percent rise in April. In the 12 months through May, the CPI rose 1.9 percent, the smallest increase since last November, after advancing 2.2 percent in April.

The year-on-year gain in the CPI in May was still larger than the 1.6 percent average annual increase over the past 10 years. Economists had forecast the CPI unchanged last month and advancing 2.0 percent from a year ago.
The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, rose 0.1 percent in May after a similar gain in April as rents continued to increase moderately. The core CPI increased 1.7 percent year-on-year, the smallest rise since May 2015, after advancing 1.9 percent in April.
The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is currently at 1.5 percent.
While the U.S. central bank is expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday, its second hike this year, the weakness in inflation and retail sales, if sustained, could put further monetary tightening in jeopardy.
INCOMING DATA CRUCIAL

"Clearly officials will be mindful of incoming inflation trends in the coming months before greater confidence can be made with second half of the year policy normalization plans," said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The dollar fell to a seven-month low against a basket of currencies on the data, while prices for U.S. Treasuries rallied. U.S. stocks were little changed ahead of the Fed's interest rate decision.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said retail sales fell 0.3 percent last month amid declining purchases of motor vehicles and discretionary spending after a 0.4 percent increase in April. May's drop was the largest since January 2016 and confounded economists' expectations for a 0.1 percent gain.
Retail sales rose 3.8 percent in May on a year-on-year basis. While some of the drop in monthly retail sales reflected lower gasoline prices, which weighed on receipts at service stations, sales at electronics and appliance stores recorded their biggest decline since March 2010.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and foodservices, retail sales were unchanged last month after an upwardly revised 0.6 percent rise in April. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product and were previously reported to have increased 0.2 percent in April.
Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Despite last month's weak core retail sales reading, low inflation could translate into higher consumer spending in the calculation of GDP.
The economy grew at a 1.2 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, held back by a near stall in consumer spending and a slower pace of inventory investment.
Output increased at a 2.1 percent pace in the October-December period. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP rising at a 3.2 percent annualized rate in the second quarter.

London police have charged four people with first degree murder in connection to Monday's stabbing death of Raymond Beaver.
Police responded to a disturbance at a residence on Lansdowne Avenue on Monday at about 11:40 p.m.
Officers say they found a man who had been stabbed and a second adult male who had sustained non-life threatening injuries as a result of being assaulted.
Following an investigation police indentified seven suspects and by late Wednesday all seven were in custody.
On Friday, police announced that Daniel Cavanagh, 32, Melissa George, 34, Nicholas George, 18, and Peter Townsend, 20, all from London, have been charged with first degree murder.
The four were orginally charged with break and enter and assault with a weapon.
Another suspect, Lisa Sager, 38, is also charged with break and enter and assault with a weapon as well, two male youths are charged with break and enter.
The investigation continues.
CHR to Osmeña: Giving P50K reward to cops who can kill criminals may lead to abuses
The director of the Commission on Human Rights in Central Visayas (CHR-7) on Monday cautioned Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmeña and other local chief executives against granting cash assistance to police officers who kill criminals in legal operations.
Lawyer Arvin Odron, CHR-7 director, said the strategy may lead to human rights abuses in the long run.

“We would like to remind our local chief executives and law enforcement sector to strictly observe the rule of law in the performance of their duties and functions regardless of whether or not a financial offer will be given for the death of a suspected criminal,” they told Cebu Daily News in a text message.
Odron warned government officials or law enforcers who violate the law would face administrative and criminal complaints.
“The CHR will continue to perform its constitutional mandate as we always do in every policing that results to the death of the suspect and will recommend the filing of a case — administrative and criminal — should there be finding of abuse,” they explained.
“The CHR will definitely monitor and investigate every law enforcement, particularly, if it costs a human life,” they said. “CHR assures everybody of its continuous monitoring on government's compliance with human rights norms and standards pursuant to its treaty commitments.”
Msgr. Joseph Tan, media liaison officer of the Archdiocese of Cebu, said Osmeña may have just wanted to drive home a point.
“I presume the mayor is just emphasizing a point that all criminals should be on the watch because the police are seriously on the job,” they said in a phone interview.
“I would like to look at that statement not as something to be understood literally but to drive a point,” they added.
Tan begged off from issuing further statements, saying they had to wait for further clarifications from the mayor regarding the latter's reported policy.
Osmeña has vowed to resume a program that would give P50,000 to any Cebu City police officer who could kill criminals, saying it is “necessary and automatic” if only to show support.
The amount, they said, will be taken from the city's discretionary fund which is P7.4 million this year, and will be P7.8 million next year.
Osmeña said they could also use their own money to grant financial assistance to the police.
Cebu Daily News tried but failed to reach Senior Supt. Joel Doria, director of the Cebu City Police Office, on Monday.
In a news conference on Monday, Osmeña explained that the money isn't a reward but sort of financial assistance for police officer who will be facing a string of cases for neutralizing suspected criminals.
They said some police officers were afraid to go after and shoot criminals even in the line of duty because they didn't have the means to defend themselves should cases be filed against them.
The cash assistance, they said, would provide “peace of mind” to the police.
They maintained that their program would not promote violence.
“Promote violence? What kind of twisted logic is that? Why don't we disarm all the police officers? When police officers carry firearm, you might be promoting violence, right?” they said.
The mayor said providing cash assistance to police who could neutralize a criminal was their original idea which they implemented before President Duterte assumed office.
“No, Duterte is following me. I gave P50,000 even before Duterte was sworn in for office. Well, I can claim that they were following me. I really don't like to put it that way, but just to make it clear, ako ang nag-una (I did it first), they said.
Osmeña lashed out at the CHR and opposition councilors in the city, saying they were protecting drug lords.
Sought for comment, Cebu City Councilor Joel Garganera advised Osmeña to shut up.
“He should learn to zip their mouth because every time they make an accusing finger, three fingers are pointing at him,” they said in a text message to Cebu Daily News.
In 2004, Osmeña created the so-called Hunters' Team, a group of elite cops tasked to go after known criminals.
From 2004 to August 2006, at least 168 suspected or convicted criminals were reported to have been shot dead by motorcycle-riding men in vigilante-style killings linked to what was widely believed as a death squad operating in Cebu City.
It was stopped when Metro Cebu was preparing to host the 10th Association of Southeast Asian Nation Summit.
Shortly after being elected mayor again in May 2016, Osmeña announced that they would give financial assistance to police officers who could kill criminals, particularly those involved in illegal drugs.
Osmeña handed over a total of P625,000 to police officers.
Among those who received the cash rewards were police officers who killed Cebu's top drug lord Jeffrey “Jaguar” Diaz and their bodyguard in Las Piñas City on June 17; and Rowen “Yawa” Secretaria, third most wanted drug lord in Central Visayas.
But the mayor later withdrew their offer of cash assistance in July 2016 after the Philippine National Police (PNP) decided to reshuffle its police officers, including former Cebu City police director Benjamin Santos.
For not supporting the programs of the city police, the National Police Commission (Napolcom) stripped Osmeña of their power and supervision over the local police in August 2016.
They asked that their supervisory powers over the local police be returned which was granted in September 2016.
Osmeña's decision to reinstate their program for police officers came after President Rodrigo Duterte decided to allow the PNP to continue its anti-drugs operation last December 5.
It was the second time that President Duterte recalled their earlier orders and allowed the PNP to rejoin the war on drugs.
In January, they stopped all police units and stations in the country from conducting anti-illegal drug operations after narcotics officers were linked to the kidnapping and killing of South Korean business person Jee Ick-joo inside the PNP headquarters in Camp Crame in Quezon City.
With the PNP sidelined, the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) solely took into their hands the fight against drugs.
But barely after a month, President Duterte ordered the PNP to rejoin the campaign against illegal drugs because the drug menace reportedly became resurgent. Last October 11, President Duterte again stripped the PNP of its role in the drug war following the August killing of 17-year-old Kian Loyd delos Santos by the police that sparked public outrage.
The country's top executive again called the police back to their war on drugs, saying there was a “notable resurgence in illegal drugs” when police officers took a step back in the campaign. /With Senior Reporter Ador Vincent Mayol
COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) — Missouri forward Jontay Porter has withdrawn their name from NBA draft and will return for their sophomore season.
The school announced Porter's decision on Wednesday, the final day the 6-foot-11 forward could remove their name from the draft and return to the Tigers for next season. Porter followed the lead of their brother, Michael Porter Jr., in declaring for the draft last month, but they didn't hire an agent.
Jontay Porter averaged 9.9 points and 6.8 rebounds per game as a first-year student for Missouri, doing so after reclassifying their prep eligibility and skipping their senior year of high school so they could join their brother with the Tigers. They earned Southeastern Conference Co-Sixth Man of the Year honors and was named to the league's All-Freshman team.
The 18-year-old took part in the NBA's draft combine two weeks ago and was projected to be taken late in the first round or early in the second.
Michael Porter Jr., a 6-foot-10 forward, hired an agent and will not return to school. They missed nearly the entire season with a back injury and returned for the SEC Tournament. They had 16 points in 28 minutes in a first-round loss to Florida State in the NCAA Tournament.

WASHINGTON, July 4 (APP):”Pakistan's new ambassador to the United States Ali Siddiqui expects some large American companies to enter Pakistan as they envision a growing trade and commercial ties between the two countries, mainly in the oil and gas sector.
In their wide-ranging interviews with Bloomberg TV and Bloomberg Radio, Ambassador Ali Jehangir Siddiqui said that Pakistan and the United States have been long-time allies with more than 70 years of relationship, and said that two countries are working together in many areas, including a shared interest of restoring peace in Afghanistan.
In their first interview with any foreign news media outlet since assuming their charge in Washington last month, the Ambassador highlighted the immense potential for business and trades ties between the two countries, especially in the oil and gas sector.
“The US is on their way to become the world's largest LNG and natural gas exporter and Pakistan is at the same time on way to become one of the world's largest importers of oil and gas,” they said. “On the energy front alone, there is a huge opportunity.”
Ambassador Siddiqui said that Pakistan opened two LNG terminals in the last two years and there were others in the planning phase, and some US gas did land in Pakistan's energy system. “We hope to grow this relationship,” they added.
They said that one of the largest American oil company, Exxon, recently signed a deal with Italian energy giant ENI to do an investment in a large offshore exploration project.
Replying to a question, Ambassador Siddiqui said that the security situation in Pakistan has improved tremendously in recent years where the terror-related incidents were down 80 percent as compared to the preceding few years.
At the same time, they added, violent crime rate in Pakistan's major cities is lower than major global and emerging market cities. “We need to communicate these numbers to the US companies which are quite receptive. I think, you will hear some large US companies entering Pakistan,” they added.
On the current state of US-Pakistan ties, which have come under strain in the past months, the Ambassador said that the two countries have a long history of cooperation spanning over 70 years. “We have had very close relations and Pakistan is among major Non-NATO US ally,” they added.
The Ambassador stated that both Pakistan and the US have a big agenda item that the two countries are working on, which is to achieve peace in Afghanistan. “We had a series of discussions on that. We both are committed to finding a solution and the Afghan government.”
They said that there had also been discussions with US officials around economic and trade matters and there is a lot of growth in the bilateral relationship that can happen.
Ambassador Siddiqui said that at the moment, trade numbers were relatively small but in balance and neither country runs a significant surplus with each other. “My priority is to increase the relationship significantly while maintaining some balance and parity,” they added.
They said that the Trump administration's approach to investment and trade was on the principle of parity“ if the US is benefitting somebody, they should benefit the US in a roughly equal manner.
“I think, I have a good understanding of that and fortunately Pakistan has parity. Those numbers are small, we need to grow them dramatically “we have a good understanding of where the President (Trump) is coming from,” alluding to the administration's approach towards trade.
To a question, the ambassador said that Pakistan has seen a tremendous growth in the past 20 years and the country's economy grew by 5.5 percent last year. However, they said, the benefit of investment has largely been shared by the European and Asian companies.
They said that American companies, like Pepsi and Procter and Gamble, have a long presence in Pakistan and doing profitable business. But, they added, there has not been any new US entrant in the past 20 years.
The Ambassador alluded to Pakistan's burgeoning telecom sector and said that it was perhaps the only country where all four large mobile phone operators were foreign owned companies and conglomerates.
“At the same time, we are missing the major US operator,” they said and added that one of their major tasks here was to communicate and share with the US investors that trade relationship and investment have enormous potential.
Responding to a question, the ambassador said that trade and investment have to be a priority and, even if there were development assistance and can come of aid, a significant portion of it must come in commercial ties, commercial debt and commercial equity, and a country should be responsible to repay that.
Replying to a question, the Ambassador said Pakistan has close relationship with China and a significant development partner, but added that a country can have a multiple relationship.
On US-India ties, they said that Pakistan did not see this relationship with any specific lens, and expressed the hope that Islamabad's relationship with China was also not viewed with some other lens.
AFP, THEUNISSEN, South Africa
All 955 gold miners who were trapped underground for more than a day in South Africa following a power cut resurfaced unharmed yesterday, the mine's owner Sibanye Gold said.
“Everybody's out,” mine spokesperson James Wellsted said, adding that there were “cases of dehydration and high blood pressure, but nothing serious.”
The miners were stuck in the Beatrix gold mine, in the small town of Theunissen near the city of Welkom, for about 30 hours after a massive power outage caused by a storm prevented elevators from bringing workers on the night shift to the surface.
After several hours engineers were able to restore power, allowing the hoist to bring up the miners — who had been trapped since Wednesday evening — in batches.
The workers were all brought to the surface within two hours.
“It was stressful, there was not enough ventilation,” miner Mike Khonto said. “Thankfully, our management managed to send us food and water.”
Asked if there had been any casualties, Wellsted said there was “no indication so far that anyone has been in distress,” although it had been a “traumatic experience.”
Several ambulances arrived on-site overnight, a reporter at the scene said.
At sunrise, the workers left by bus after undergoing medical checkups.
Nervous family members had earlier gathered along the road to the shaft, kept at a distance by security guards as they waited for news.
The accident at Beatrix gold mine in the Free State province, 290km southwest of Johannesburg, has reignited safety concerns at South African mines.
The National Union of Mineworkers has called on miners to refuse to work in “dangerous conditions.”
“Major multinational corporations like Sibanye-Stillwater, which should be industry leaders in creating a safety culture, are doing far too little to prevent accidents,” the union said in a statement overnight.
A parliamentary committee on mining expressed outrage at the incident, calling for “drastic” action against the mining company.
It said it was “utterly unacceptable” that the mine had no backup plan to bring the workers to the surface.
In August last year, five mineworkers died after sections of a gold mine collapsed outside Johannesburg.
South Africa possesses rich mineral reserves and has some of the world's deepest gold mines.
Gold was for many decades the backbone of the nation's economy, but production has declined sharply due to depletion of reserves.

The Patriots are going to be missing one key target tonight, but they could be getting another back.
According to Jeff Howe of the Boston Herald, wide receiver Chris Hogan made the trip to South Florida for tonight's game against the Dolphins, and could return.
Hogan has missed the last four games with a shoulder injury, and was limited in practice last week.
If he's able to go, it would mitigate the loss of Rob Gronkowski, who is serving their one-game suspension for their elbow smash of Bills cornerback Tre'Davious White last week.
The Patriots left three players home who were on the injury report, leaving defensive end Trey Flowers (rib), special-teamer Brandon King (hamstring) and running back Mike Gillislee (illness) back in Boston.
Hogan was third on the team with 33 catches for 438 yards when they were injured in Week Eight. They were tied for the team lead with five touchdowns at the time of the injury.

Hundreds of people at rallies in Louisville on Sunday protested the violence in Charlottesville, calling for an end to white supremacy and warning neo-Nazis they cannot operate in the city without challenge.
The Lville2Cville Rally & March at the Carl Braden Memorial Center in West Louisville, and another at Jefferson Square Park, drew people from across the city.
Both ended peacefully, although protesters from the Braden Center were met by police with batons as they made their way toward East Broadway near The Highlands. Marchers carried signs with such messages as “Love, not hate,” “When your mind is your weapon, you are never unarmed,” “White supremacy kills us all” and “White folks — This is our mess and it's killing people.”

Another member of Rep. Duncan Hunter's party has stepped up to challenge them for their inland San Diego County congressional seat.
Shamroze "Shamus" Sayed, 40, announced Friday that he's joining the growing list of people hoping to unseat the five-term Republican, who's facing ongoing investigations into whether they misused campaign funds for personal expenses.
Sayed is chief operating officer of Interpreters Unlimited, a translation services company, and lives in San Diego, outside the district.
In a statement announcing their run, Sayed emphasized their business experience and pledged to "bring integrity and accountability back" to the district. They said their priorities would be cutting taxes on small business and cutting regulations.
Hunter also faces Republican Andrew Zelt, a San Diego County sheriff's deputy, and five Democrats: Pierre Beauregard, Josh Butner, Ammar Campa-Najjar, Glenn Jensen and realtor Patrick Malloy.
Daniel Casara, another Republican who initially said they would run against Hunter, changed their mind and announced a campaign against Rep. Scott Peters (D-San Diego) instead.
Hunter, who won reelection by nearly 27 percentage points last year, is considered among the safer GOP incumbents who have been targeted by Democrats in the midterm elections.
Still, Hunter faces a probe into their alleged misuse of campaign funds, and has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on legal fees this year. In August, The Times reported that the FBI seized computers and documents at the offices of Hunter's campaign treasurer. Last month, Hunter's chief of staff of 15 years stepped down.

A Canandaigua police officer who was sent to an off-duty state parole officer's apartment to check on them ended up in a shootout and shot and killed her, authorities said Thursday.

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — The driver charged with killing a woman at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville was previously accused of beating their mother and threatening them with a knife, according to police records released Monday.
Samantha Bloom, who is disabled and uses a wheelchair, repeatedly called police about their son, James Alex Fields Jr., in 2010 and 2011, telling officers they were on medication to control their temper, transcripts from 911 calls show.
Fields, 20, is accused of ramming their car into a crowd of counter-protesters on Saturday in Charlottesville, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer.
Fields, described by a former high school teacher as an admirer of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, was charged with second-degree murder.
A judge denied them bail Monday after the public defender's office said it couldn't represent them because a relative of someone in the office was injured in Saturday's protest.
Fields was assigned a local attorney, and another hearing was set for Aug. 25.
Records show that Fields was arrested and put in juvenile detention after their mother reported in 2011 that they stood behind them wielding a 12-inch knife.
In another incident in 2010, they said their son smacked them in the head and locked them in the bathroom after they told them to stop playing video games. There was no indication in the records that they were arrested.
Also Monday, a former classmate told The Associated Press that on a school trip to Europe in 2015, a teenage Fields couldn't stand the French and said they only went on the trip so that they could visit “the Fatherland” — Germany.
“He just really laid on about the French being lower than us and inferior to us,” said Keegan McGrath.
McGrath, now 18, said they challenged Fields on their beliefs, and the animosity between them grew so heated that it came to a boil at dinner on their second day. They said they went home after three or four days because they couldn't handle being in a room with Fields.
The incident shocked McGrath because they had been in German class with Fields for two unremarkable years.
“He was just a normal dude” most of the time, though they occasionally made “dark” jokes that put their class on edge, including one “offhand joke” about the Holocaust, McGrath said.
McGrath said Fields was no outcast: “He had friends. They had people who would chat with him.”
Meanwhile, under pressure to speak out more forcefully, President Donald Trump condemned Ku Klux Klan members, neo-Nazis and white supremacists who take part in violence as “criminals and thugs” and declared that “racism is evil.”
Trump's initial failure on Saturday to denounce the groups by name, and their blaming of the violence on “many sides,” prompted criticism from fellow Republicans as well as Democrats.
A teacher who taught Fields in high school said Sunday that Fields was fascinated with Nazism, idolized Hitler, and had been singled out in the ninth grade by officials at Randall K. Cooper High School in Union, Kentucky, for their “deeply held, radical” convictions on race.
Fields also confided that they had been diagnosed with schizophrenia when they were younger and had been prescribed an anti-psychotic medication, according to the teacher, Derek Weimer.
Fields later enlisted in the Army and reported for basic training in 2015 but was released from active duty four months later because of what military described only as “a failure to meet training standards.”
The violence in Charlottesville also was blamed for the deaths of two Virginia State Police officers in a helicopter crash.
Fields had been photographed hours before the attack with a shield bearing the emblem of Vanguard America, one of the hate groups that took part in the protest against the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. The group on Sunday denied any association with Fields.

I can think of worse places to vacation than Greece, and this trip package from Gate 1 Travel (in partnership with Travelzoo) makes it easy to see a wide swath of the country.
Starting at $2,400 per person (after code TZWGAC, which takes off $420), you get roundtrip flights from the U.S. to Athens, three nights accommodations in Athens, a four-night cruise around the country (with an all-inclusive drink package), and a night each in three other Greek cities, with all transfers and tours, plus a bunch of meals included in the price. That's a pretty comprehensive tour of the country, all things considered, and you'll barely have to do any of the planning yourself.
As always with these deals, prices will vary based on the dates you choose and your departure city, but you'll save a lot of money compared to building a similar trip yourself. Just don't forget to use that promo code to save $420 per traveler.
A man inspired by the Islamic State group set off a crude pipe bomb strapped to their body Monday in a crowded subway corridor near Times Square, injuring the man, slightly wounding three others and sending New York commuters fleeing in terror through the smoky passageway.
A White House spokesperson said the pipe bomb explosion in New York City's subway system shows the need for "immigration reform."
Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday that Congress should work with the president, stressing the need to "protect our borders" and calling for a "merit-based" immigration system.
Law enforcement officials say the man came to the U.S. from Bangladesh seven years ago with a type of preferential visa for people with relatives who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents.
Surveillance cameras captured the man walking casually through the crowded passage when the bomb went off at 7:20 a.m. amid a plume of white smoke, which cleared to show the man sprawled on the ground and commuters scattering to get away. Investigators said it was not clear if they set the bomb off intentionally or prematurely.
"This was an attempted terrorist attack," Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters. "Thank God the perpetrator did not achieve their ultimate goals."
The suspect, who was identified as 27-year-old Akayed Ullah, was being treated at a hospital for burns to their hands and abdomen. The others who were injured suffered ringing in the ears and headaches.
Law enforcement officials said Ullah was inspired by the Islamic State group but apparently did not have any direct contact with the group and probably acted alone. Gov. Andrew Cuomo later told the NY1 cable channel that the suspect went online to learn how to make a bomb.
"We have no evidence at this time that there were any secondary devices or it was part of a larger plan," Cuomo said.
Ullah, who lives in Brooklyn, came to the U.S. from Bangladesh about seven years ago and had been licensed to drive a livery cab between 2012 and 2015, according to law enforcement officials and NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission. They were speaking with investigators from their hospital bed, police said.
A person briefed on the investigation said Ullah arrived in the United States on an F-4 visa, a preferential visa available for those with family in the U.S. who are citizens, and that they made the bomb in their home.
The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the blast.
Investigators were searching Ullah's apartment, interviewing witnesses and relatives and looking for surveillance footage that may show their movements in the moments before the attack.
Ullah lived with their father, mother and brother in a residential area of Brooklyn with a large Bangladeshi community, neighbors said. The home was just off a shopping strip — a red two-story brick building.
Alan Butrico owns the house next door and a locksmith business two doors down.
"It's very weird," they said. "You never know who your neighbors are."
The Bangladesh Embassy in Washington condemned the attack. The deputy chief of mission, Mahbub Hassan Saleh, said the embassy had not received any information from authorities about the suspect's identity.
The explosion, which happened in an underground passageway under 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth avenues, triggered a massive emergency response by police and firefighters both above and below ground, tangling subway and bus service at the nearby Port Authority bus terminal.
It's the city's busiest subway station and a major transit hub, with 64 million subway riders passing through every year. In 2016, daily ridership on the subway was 5.7 million, a record high.
Everything around Times Square was shut down, halting what would ordinarily be a bustling rush hour at the "Crossroads of the World." But streets quickly began returning to normal, and traffic around the area was expected to be operational by the evening rush.
Authorities said the bomb was a low-tech explosive device attached to the man with Velcro and plastic ties. They were investigating how it was made.
Port Authority police said officers found the man injured on the ground, with wires protruding from their jacket to their pants and the device strapped to their torso under their coat. They said they were reaching for a cellphone and they grabbed theirs hands.
A photo published by the New York Post showed a bearded man crumpled on the ground with their shirt apparently blown off and black soot covering their bare midriff. A police officer was holding the man's hands behind their back. Another photo shown on NY1 showed the bearded suspect, wide-eyed, on a stretcher being loaded into an ambulance.
Elrana Peralta, a customer-service worker for Greyhound, said they work in the Port Authority terminal near where the blast happened but did not hear the explosion.
"All we could hear was the chaos," they said. "We could hear people yelling, 'Get out! Get out! Get out!'"
John Miles, who is from Vermont, was waiting for a bus to Massachusetts. They did not hear the blast either, but saw police react.
"I didn't know what was going on. Officers were running around. I was freaking out," they said. There was an announcement that people should take their bags and leave. "They didn't incite panic. It was fairly orderly."
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted that President Donald Trump had been briefed on the explosion. Instead of commenting on the suspected terror attack, Trump sent a tweet at 9:17 a.m. criticizing a Sunday story in The New York Times that said they watched cable news television for at least four hours a day.
The blast came just weeks after eight people died in New York when another man, also said to be inspired by the Islamic State, drove a rented truck onto a bike path near the World Trade Center.

France's Unibail-Rodamco SE has agreed to acquire Australian mall owner Westfield Corp for US$24.7 billion including debt, in what would be the biggest takeover of an Australian company on record.
SYDNEY/MELBOURNE: France's Unibail-Rodamco has agreed to buy shopping mall owner Westfield Corp for US$15.7 billion, in what would be the biggest takeover of an Australian company on record.
The deal accelerates consolidation of the global retail property sector as it grapples with challenges from online retailers led by Amazon.com Inc . It comes on the heels of world No. 2 retail real estate investment trust GGP Inc's rejection of a US$14.8 billion offer from Brookfield Property for the two-thirds it did not already own.
Westfield, which owns and operates 35 shopping centers in the United States and United Kingdom valued at US$32 billion, said the transaction was "highly compelling" for Westfield and Unibail-Rodamco's shareholders.
"Unibail-Rodamco's track record makes it the natural home for the legacy of Westfield's brand and business," Westfield Chairman and co-founder Frank Lowy said in a statement.
Unibail-Rodamco said Westfield shareholders would receive a combination of cash and shares, valuing Westfield at US$7.55, or AUS$10.01 a share, an 18 percent premium to Westfield's last trade.
Including debt, the deal would be worth US$24.7 billion.

Unibail-Rodamco said the deal would create a global property leader with US$72 billion of gross market value in 27 retail markets. It will rebadge its malls with the red Westfield logo.
RETAIL REINVENTION
Shopping center owners around the world are scrambling to reinvent themselves to keep up with rapid changes in consumer behavior and boost earnings.
The expansion of e-commerce giant Amazon.com has coincided with an explosion in online purchases of physical goods, while consumers increasingly treat malls as places for socializing.

Once dominant United States department store operators such as Macy's Inc and J C Penney Co Inc have announced plans to shut hundreds of stores in recent years, putting pressure on landlords to find new "anchor tenants" or come up with new ways to grow returns.
Westfield has been seen as a pioneer in U.S. mall redevelopment, melding traditional mall retailers with atypical mall fixtures like upscale food courts, high-end restaurants, bars, cinemas and boutique fashion outlets.
"Westfield has got assets in the UK and in the U.S. that are all in mature Amazon markets. They're already 50 percent through that online retail switch," said Morningstar analyst Tony Sherlock.
Chairman Lowy, a holocaust survivor-turned-knighted property billionaire, will retire from the company they co-founded in 1960, and their sons Steven and Peter, will retire from their positions as co-chief executives.
"This is obviously a day of mixed emotions for me although I am 100 percent comfortable with our decision," Frank Lowy told reporters in Sydney via video conference from London. They said talks to seal a deal had taken just six weeks.
"VERY GOOD PRICE"
Lowy said it made sense to sell now because it was a "very good price" for shareholders, but acknowledged that the sale partly reflected the global trend of consolidation and the pressures on retailers.
"It seems like a good strategic rationale, given the synergies, and it will create the leading mall operator globally," said Sydney-based CLSA analyst Sholto Maconochie.
"With a AUS$10 handle in front, the offer doesn't look bad," they said, adding that they were still evaluating the deal.
The offer price closed the gap between the underlying value of the company and its share price, Peter Lowy said.
The Lowys said they also chose to sell as they would rather be investors than executives now, after putting in a combined 145 years at the company.
Westfield's flagship malls include Westfield London, where it is working on a 600,000 pound (US$800,000) expansion, and Century City in Los Angeles, where it is completing a US$1 billion overhaul.
It also has stakes in 18 suburban U.S. shopping centers, three of which it wholly owns.
Shares in Westfield were halted earlier on Tuesday pending the announcement, having last traded at AUS$8.50.

The league of retired Police officers of Nigeria, Zone One chapter, comprising Kano, Katsina and Jigawa states, has reiterated the call for its members' exemption from the National Contributory Pension scheme.
Speaking on behalf of the group after its monthly meeting in Kano over the weekend, the Secretary of that Association, Sadiq Garuba (rtd), lamented that the Federal Government's initiative of paying their retirement benefit through the National Pension Commission was unfavourable to them.

According to him, numerous indiscriminate deductions from their benefits were made by PENCOM, without reason, thus resulting in a shortfall of the expected allowances.
However, they stressed that the payment of pension and gratuity should be reverted to the former system, whereby pension and gratuities were paid by state governments.
”We have been coming here for our monthly payment, but our money, which is supposed to be paid to us, was transferred to so many companies under PENCOM.”
Because of this, the group urged the Federal Government and the National Assembly to help them resolve the issue, so as to save its members from hardship during retirement.
United Nations: In a significant victory for India at the UN, international law expert Neeru Chadha has won a crucial election to a top UN judicial body that deals with disputes related to the law of the sea, becoming the first Indian woman to be appointed as a judge at the tribunal.
Chadha, an eminent lawyer and the first Indian woman to become the chief legal adviser in the ministry of external affairs, won the election yesterday to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) for a nine-year term from 2017 to 2026.
Chadha got 120 votes, the highest in the Asia Pacific group and was elected in the first round of voting itself. The candidate from Indonesia got 58 votes, Lebanon 60 and Thailand 86.
All three candidates went to a second round of voting in which Thailand won the other seat in the Asia Pacific group. Election was held for a total of seven seats.
India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin expressed gratitude for the broad support of countries that resulted in Chadha's "emphatic success" at the elections to the ITLOS.
"It reflects both an appreciation of India's global standing in matters of international law and the recognition for Chadha's expertise as a lawyer and negotiator on contemporary issues related to the Law of the Seas," Akbaruddin told PTI.
"The Tribunal is composed of 21 independent members who are elected from among persons enjoying the highest reputation for fairness and integrity and of recognised competence in the field of the law of the sea," according to the information on the ITLOS website.
Meanwhile, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson in New Delhi hailed Chadha's elections to the ITLOS saying, "Indian expertise on ITLOS stage! Neeru Chadha elected as 1st woman on Int'l Tribunal 4 Law of Seas w/ most votes in Asia Pacific Group."
The Hamburg-based ITLOS, established in 1996, is one of dispute settlement mechanisms under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) that entered into force in 1994.
Chadha has extensive international arbitration and litigation experience, having served as an agent for the Indian government in its maritime delimitation case with Bangladesh.
They were also India's agent for the case filed by Italy in ITLOS involving two Italian marines accused of shooting two Indian fishermen off the coast of Kerala in 2012.
Currently, eminent jurist from India P Chandrasekhara Rao is a judge at the tribunal. They were elected member of the tribunal in 1996 and their term will expire in September 2017.
Chadha is only the second woman to be judged of ITLOS in its two decades of existence, where there have been a total of 40 judges, the Permanent Mission of India to the UN said in a statement.
Chadha holds law degrees including PhD in law from the University of Delhi and the University of Michigan.
They were also the first woman chief legal adviser to the Indian government and has advised the government on diverse issues relating to the law of the sea involving interpretation of various provisions of the UNCLOS including determining the extent of coastal state's jurisdiction in different maritime zones, maritime delimitation with neighbouring states and legal issues relating to submissions on extended continental shelf.
Chadha has also served as an agent before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the case concerning the obligations concerning negotiations relating to cessation of nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament with the Marshall Islands.
They have represented the Indian government in various other multilateral meetings and conferences in the United Nations, AALCO (Asian African Legal Consultative Organisation), UNIDROIT (International Institute for the Unification of Private Law), UNCITRAL (UN Commission on International Trade Law).
Chadha has also represented Indian government at The Hague Conference, South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) on subjects relating to human rights, humanitarian law, international trade, international terrorism and international criminal law.
City of Marco Island seeking their own EMS services
After two years of talks on Marco Island the council will press the county to call their own shots Tuesday.
Councilman Larry Honig says the city has wanted this for years, “We're in charge of our own fire, police, building, road department, parks and rec. Why can't we have our own emergency medical services?”
But after Collier County Emergency Medical Services evacuated Marco Island before Hurricane Irma, it set off some sirens.
“During the hurricane there were incidents we would have handled differently than the county handled them, and we think we should be in charge.” said Honig.
Currently Collier County EMS has one ambulance on the island off season and two in season.
If the city of Marco Island did have its own ambulance service they would be able to keep them at the fire department, so it wouldn't require any more overhead but would create more jobs.
A consultant for the city is recommending Marco hires 12 additional persons on staff locally.
Yvette Bennaroach is with a local charity group called the marco island patriots, “It was like watching a movie, that's exactly what it was,” They stayed home during the hurricane and checked on their neighbors afterward.
They say knowing that there wasn't an ambulance on the island when it was still safe for emergency personnel to drive is terrifying, ‘If there would have been an emergency something bad could have happened.”
And that's what city council says they want to avoid – making an emergency worse. They're hoping their request doesn't flatline.
Tuesday, the city council will make its proposal in city hall at 5:30 p.m. If the county doesn't approve the request, they say they'll leapfrog to the state for approval.

Fashion week or not, Blake Lively had alternative plans Monday night — a “Galentine's Day”-themed party they were hosting on behalf of L'Oéal Paris, ahead of the February 14th holiday.
“It's all about girlfriends coming together — that is incredibly important right now more than ever,” said Lively, who was accompanied to the party, held at the West Edge event space near Chelsea Market, by their own “galentine”— their sister Robyn Lively.
A L'Oréal spokesperson divulged to WWD that the actor had yet to partake in any fashion week goings-on thus far, but was looking forward to the Michael Kors show on Wednesday morning.
“I owe Michael everything in the fashion world,” said Lively. “I had just started [‘Gossip Girl'], and no one knew or cared [about it] at that point, and they brought me to a Vogue event.”
Lively noted that particular Vogue event is where they met Anna Wintour, who has placed the actor and L'Oréal Paris spokesperson on the cover of the magazine three times. “She became a great friend and supporter of mine,” said Lively. “So anytime [Kors] has a show and I'm in town, I'm there.” Gesturing out to the crowded party, Lively got sentimental when talking about the designer. “I wouldn't be in this if it weren't for him.”
But back to the Galentine's Day — Lively, who also brought along their mom and some girlfriends, was keen to plan the party. “I took it on as if it were a personal party of mine,” they said, ticking off the full list of activities they implemented — a hair extension bar featuring pink and purple strands colored with the new L'Oréal Colorista semi-permanent color line, personalized engravings for heart-shaped necklaces by In God We Trust, and clips of the movie ‘Clueless' playing on loop.
“I'm 13,” Lively joked. “I need activities and entertainment — balloons, face paint, something like that.”

ZANESVILLE, Ohio – Stars and Stripes on the River started today at noon.
The Color Guard rose the flag July 4th, at Zane's Landing Park as the national anthem played to start the annual event. Vice President of the Zanesville Jaycees, Andrew McGee, said one of their top priorities is giving back to the children in the community.
“Everything we make from this event goes back to the kids. The biggest thing is our Christmas for Kids, but we also do little things here and there, but it's always kid related stuff,” explained McGee.
McGee said they are also giving away seven different scholarships at the event for recent graduates with the money that has been raised. They have been planning this event for quite some time and are excited to finally see it all together.
“It's a lot of work to make it happen – spent a lot of money to make it happen and it's nice to just have something in Zanesville where everyone can come,” said McGee.
Stars and Stripes on the River will be going on all evening long at Zane's Landing Park and will conclude with the fireworks around 9:45.

Solomon Dalung, the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, said President Muhammadu Buhari's victory against an incumbent in 2015 had proved that one could win election in Nigeria without having money.
Dalung, who said this, while addressing officials of the Permanent Mission, Nigeria House in New York, said there was a brewing political revolution against ‘god-fatherism' in the Nigerian political space.
Dalung said: “There is hope for Nigeria. The victory of President Buhari, up till now, not many Nigerians have understood it; it was a political revolution.
“What it has brought is that you can contest and win election even when you do not have money.''
“God-fatherism' was instituted to control elected officials so that they would not go beyond control.
“God-fatherism' is a political servitude where you are tested to determine your loyalty. The thing is that without a god father, they believe you can't be controlled.''
The minister was in New York for the Seventh Economic and Social Council Youth Forum at the UN Headquarters where they delivered a paper on: ‘The role of youth in building sustainable and resilient communities'.
They said: “The ‘Not too Young to Run' is an advocacy that is sending strong signals to political lords that they had overstayed their welcome; either they give way or they will be forced out.''
The minister blamed those they called “urban gorillas” whom they said were in charge of the country's political machinery for manipulating the system.
“At 53 years, they still call me a small boy,” they decried, saying they had contested elections several times and won but was deprived by the ‘urban gorillas'.
The minister also said that they brought the Progressives Congress to Plateau but suffered as an orphan because they did not have a god-father.
According to him, their advocacy is to liberate the young people, reorient the mindset of many Nigerian youths that have been enslaved.
They also called on young people to understand the political system they were coming into so as to better strategise.
According to Dalung, Nigeria is making steady progress in infrastructure, economy and security and called for unity.
They said: “We can refine and build a Nigeria of our dream.
“We have the best form of selfless ministers in this era. As ministers, most of us do not have houses but we live in rented apartments in Abuja.
“Some of us lived in Boys Quarters before we got apartments because people were asking for N1.5 million as rent.
“I would have even preferred to stay in Gwagwa but we were told we could not for obvious reasons.''
Dalung said Buhari had made a statement about the rampaging armed herdsmen but that the country would also need to engage its neighbours to stop giving access to the criminals to move freely into the country.
Earlier, Nigeria's Ambassador/Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambasaor Samson Itegboje commended the Federal Government for the steady progress in the areas of economy, infrastructure, fight against insurgency and anti-corruption.
The Nigerian ambassador pledged that the missions' would continue to bring their expertise to bear on the international stage so as to lift the flag of Nigeria high among the comity of nations.
0 Man picks up girlfriend in different embarrassing way every day
LAFAYETTE, La. - There's more than one way to make an impression with your girlfriend's friends and classmates. Zach Doell came up with a strange gambit -- picking up their girlfriend Brianna Garcia in unique rides.
One day they drove up to the University of Louisiana in Lafayette in an ice cream truck. Another day it was a DIY Batmobile. Then there was the pizza delivery car. But the best one was, and one that Doell doesn't think they can top, was the Oscar Mayer Weinermobile, the Daily Advertiser reported.

“I don't know if I should retire because there's no way I can top it, but then again, I graduate in May so I only have this week of school left,” Doell told the Daily Advertiser back in April.
But why start picking up their more reserved girlfriend in the strange vehicles?
“I love to see them laugh and make them smile. So I would just beep the horn excessively and yell them name,” Doell told the Daily Advertiser.
But it was a glance at a large hat in their apartment that changed their game.
They donned a sombrero and yelled, “El Papi” as they met after class, Garcia said.
So how did the Weinermobie stunt come to fruition?
Doell said they were at an area store to get a whistle for an NFL referee costume they were planning and as if by fate, the Oscar Mayer Weinermobile was at the same parking lot. So they asked the hotdoggers if they could borrow the vehicle. They said yes and the rest went down in prank history.
Garcia had a prank of their own up their sleeve. They got the help of a local radio station to have Doell picked up with horn blazing.
“At first I was scared,” Doell told the Daily Advertiser. “I had no idea who was honking. Usually, I”m the one who's doing it. But then I was so impressed with them That was the last thing I expected.”

Josh Donaldson launches a two-run homer, their eighth in 16 games, to the opposite field in the first inning of Monday night's win over the Rays at the Rogers Centre. Rene Johnston / Toronto Star ) Order this photo
John Gibbons' advice to Nick Tepesch heading into their first spot start for the Blue Jays last week was simple: Run with it as long as you can. The 28-year-old, in the mix for big-league work the rest of the way, did enough in that 11-5 loss to the New York Yankees to earn another outing. And ahead of the opener of a four-game series against the Tampa Bay Rays on Monday, Gibbons' directions had hardly changed. “Just run with it again,” the manager said. “He got that first one under their belt and I thought they did a nice job, so just keep going. Keep attacking.” Read more: Blue Jays' Aaron Sanchez hasn't nailed down return date
Article Continued Below
Rays' Hechavarria returns to synthetic field of dreams Lefty Mayza earns first Blue Jays call-up Tepesch took the words to heart, allowing just one run on four hits in six-plus innings, and throwing a season-high 96 pitches in a 2-1 Blue Jays victory.
The right-hander struggled with command, walking three, but got the job done. Josh Donaldson's two-run homer in the first inning was enough in the end. Gibbons has said starting pitching will determine if the Blue Jays have any hope of reaching the post-season, and Tepesch's performance marks the fifth straight strong start for the club. Four of the last five Blue Jays starting pitchers have allowed one run or less, lifting the club to 5-2 with three games left on a 10-game homestand.

They're four games under .500 overall at 57-61. Like in Sunday's win over the Pirates, Jose Bautista drew a leadoff walk for the Jays before Donaldson knocked one over the wall out of the two-hole. Unlike Sunday's monster shot to left field, their longest of the season, Monday's blast was an opposite-field wall scraper to right. It was also Donaldson's eighth homer in the past 16 games. The third baseman has developed a penchant for early fireworks, with 10 of their 17 long balls coming in the opening frame.
A solo homer to centre by Wilson Ramos was the only damage the Rays managed off Tepesch, Aaron Loup and Roberto Osuna, who recorded four outs for their 30th save of the season. The Rays, who squandered six innings of three-hit ball by starter Jake Odorizzi, have lost eight of their last 10. Righty Marco Estrada gets the start for the Jays on Tuesday night against Rays southpaw Blake Snell.

A disgraced former head of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland who stepped down in 2013 after a sex scandal has died aged 80, the Church said on Monday.
Cardinal Keith O'Brien, an outspoken critic of gay marriage, resigned after three priests and one former priest complained about incidents of sexual misconduct dating back to the 1980s.
O'Brien initially denied the allegations but then apologised for sexual conduct they said had “fallen below the standards expected of me”.
They quit as archbishop of St. Andrews and Edinburgh in 2013 shortly after Pope Benedict shocked the Catholic world with their own resignation.
O'Brien, once Britain's most senior Catholic cleric, promised to play no further role in the Church in Scotland and did not take part in the conclave that elected Benedict's successor, Pope Francis.
With the agreement of the Holy See, O'Brien subsequently moved to the north of England, where a statement said they had died surrounded by family.
The Catholic Church has been embroiled for years in sexual scandals, most notoriously involving the abuse of children in the United States and Ireland, which were covered up by senior clerics.
“In life, Cardinal O'Brien may have divided opinion,” said Archbishop Leo Cushley of St. Andrews and Edinburgh.
“In death, however, I think all can be united in praying for the repose of their soul, for comfort for their grieving family and that support and solace be given to those whom they offended, hurt and let down”.

British Prime Minister Theresa May will tell lawmakers Monday there is a “new sense of optimism” around Brexit talks, despite a spat with Ireland over last week's interim deal with the EU.
Updating parliament on the agreement, which will allow talks on Britain's withdrawal to move onto trade, May will say there was “give and take” on both sides.
“Of course, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. But there is, I believe, a new sense of optimism now in the talks,” they will tell MPs, according to details of their statement released by their office.
Before their statement in the House of Commons, May chaired a meeting of their cabinet ministers, many of whom are divided on the shape of Britain's exit from the European Union.
Some have viewed the agreement struck last week as a move towards a softer break with Brussels.
It holds out the prospect of Britain remaining aligned with some of the rules of the EU's single market and customs union — which May has pledged to leave — if no new bilateral trade deal is reached.
“This is not about a hard or a soft Brexit,” they will tell MPs.
“The arrangements we have agreed to reach the second phase of the talks are entirely consistent with the principles and objectives that I set out in my speeches in Florence (in September) and at Lancaster House (in January).”
Friday's deal set out Britain's financial settlement and the rights of expatriates, including the role of the European Court of Justice — two issues of concern to eurosceptics.
It also made guarantees to avoid the return of customs checks on Ireland's border with the British province of Northern Ireland.

– Lingering uncertainty –
There was lingering uncertainty about the details of Friday's agreement, however.
Brexit Secretary David Davis risked angering Dublin on Sunday by appearing to suggest the Irish border deal was “more a statement of intent than it was a legally enforceable thing”.
Joe McHugh, the Irish government's chief whip, said it would be “bizarre” to agree a deal and not uphold it, saying: “This, as far as we're concerned, is a binding agreement.”
Davis said Monday that their words had been “twisted”, and that “of course it's legally enforceable” — but repeated that if there was no final agreement with Brussels on trade, then there would be no deal on anything.
However, they told LBC radio: “We would still be seeking to provide a frictionless invisible border with Ireland.”
Under the proposed agreement, which must be signed off by EU leaders at a summit later this week, Britain will pay between £35 billion and £39 billion (40-45 billion euros, $47-52 billion) to the bloc after leaving in March 2019.
It also sets out how EU citizens living in Britain and its citizens living in the EU — as well as their families — will be able to claim permanent residency status and the right to work and receive benefits.
Leading Brexit supporter Iain Duncan Smith, a former Conservative party leader, said Monday the agreement was “not ideal” but “simply gets us through the first round”.
In an article in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, they wrote: “Most importantly, though, all of this can be torn up tomorrow because ‘nothing is agreed until everything is agreed'.”

Change is good. Unless it isn't.
In this case, it is. Former NFL quarterback Chris Simms will be joining PFT Live as a co-host next week.
Simms, who spent eight years in the NFL, entered the league as a third-round pick of the Buccaneers in 2003. They spent four seasons in Tampa Bay with Jon Gruden (I think that's one of the qualifications for sainthood). After a year in Tennessee followed by a year in Denver followed by a year in Tennessee, Simms moved on to other things, spending a year with the Patriots as an assistant coach before following their father, Phil, into broadcasting.
Chris, who also will be part of NBC's Notre Dame coverage, will appear on PFT Live three days per week, starting Monday. We could be making some more changes/enhancements/whatever down the road.
For now, let's welcome Chris to the PFT Live family in the PFT way. By insulting them in the comments.
And please try to aim higher than making spleen-related remarks. Or maybe aim lower. Like at their ankle.
Robert L. McKay, the former architect who designed the first Taco Bell restaurant and helped transform the brand into a fast-food powerhouse, has died of cancer in Santa Ana. They were 86.
It was 1964 when McKay, then a Sherman Oaks architect, was hired by Taco Bell founder Glen Bell to create a distinctive new look for the business. Bell had opened their first Taco Bell in Downey in 1962, selling hard shell tacos and other Mexican-inspired foods.
McKay took the concept and designed the California Spanish-style mission motif, arched and tiled with the rooftop bell that became the signature image of the company.
Bell decided McKay could do more than just architectural design; Bell opened the company's headquarters in Torrance and hired McKay to be president. McKay closed their architectural and contracting business and devoted their full energy to Taco Bell.
The company went public in 1969 and McKay eventually became chief executive. In 1978, Taco Bell was sold to PepsiCo and McKay stayed on as president and chief executive until 1981.
By then McKay was ready to move on.
“I wasn't ever comfortable sitting around conference tables in fancy resorts listening to presentations from the very people doing the great work of running the company every day,” they said.
In 1982, McKay turned their attention to financing and building new businesses. For the next 30 years, McKay invested in ventures ranging from technology and consumer products to real estate and fine art.
They were particularly proud of their involvement in building the National Bank of Southern California in Santa Ana into an important source of capital for local businesses. The bank was sold to US Bancorp in 1999.
In 1992, the McKay Family Foundation was formed, dedicated to social justice and community organizing work, particularly the rebuilding effort after the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
Separately, McKay and their wife, Meagan, were most proud of their work funding the creation of the Redeemer School in Jackson, Miss., for very-low-income children.
McKay, who died last week, is survived by their wife, Meagan; two sons, Rob and John; and five grandchildren.

Mayors from California's largest cities, including Los Angeles, are asking state lawmakers to provide $1.5 billion to help address what they say is a growing homeless crisis.
The mayors on Wednesday backed legislation that would require the cities to provide matching funds. That would create a $3 billion pot of money for housing, temporary shelters, supportive services and outreach.
They cited a 2017 federal estimate that the most populous state now has more than 134,000 homeless people.
The bipartisan group includes mayors from Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, San Francisco, Fresno, Long Beach, Sacramento, Oakland, Bakersfield, Anaheim and Santa Ana.
Their request came the same day that two Democratic state senators said they will seek $2 billion to house and assist the homeless and families with low and moderate incomes.

Having a child, while rewarding, comes with a steep price. The average cost to raise a child to 18 is now $230,000 for a typical family. Diapers, formula, clothing, medical and dental – the expenses often make child care, including early development programs, out of reach for many parents.
Yet, a growing body of research suggests these programs are more beneficial than previously thought – especially for disadvantaged children and their families. And it has the biggest positive effect on women's employment and pay, and the sons they raise.
According to a new study by Nobel-winning economist James Heckman and researchers at the University of Chicago and University of Southern California, early childhood development programs can deliver an annual return of 13 percent per child on upfront costs through better outcomes in education, health, employment, and social behavior in the decades that follow – a rate of return that's comparable to returns on a savings account or the stock market. In one group analyzed, mothers earned more when children were in preschool, and the effect was still there after several decades.
When boys in this group reached age 30, they had earned on average $19,800 more annually than those in the control group. They also received an additional six months of education. Girls in this group received two more years of education and earned about $2,500 more than girls in the control group.
In an interview with UChicagoNews, Heckman said, “Investing in the continuum of learning from birth to age five not only impacts each child, but it also strengthens our country's workforce today and prepares future generations to be competitive in the global economy tomorrow.”
In other words, early child development programs can make children and parents more successful.
Olga, a freelance writer and mother of three, is forever grateful to the women who ran the early child care program their children attended. “My kids started daycare at six months old (all three of them) and that allowed me to finish my thesis, and later to start my blog, not to mention that it saved my sanity,” they told me. In addition, the program taught their children their third language, giving them an advantage over other kids the same age.
Yet, a report by New America and Care.com put the average cost of child care at $16,514 a year – ranging from $10,468 for a center-based child care program to $28,905 for a nanny. With the average household income just shy of $52,000, combined with average living expenses that topple $1,500 a month, the cost of early child development programs are prohibitive for many families who struggle to balance the demands of caring for their children with working.
The Department of Health and Human Services says child care should cost around seven percent of a family's income at most. In the Care.com survey, one in three respondents said they spent at least 20 percent of their annual household income on child care. Nearly one in three parents would put themselves in debt (or even further in the hole) to pay for child care, up from 25 percent in 2016.
Sadly, it's children whose parents can least afford child care who would benefit from it the most. Children born into affluent families usually have more options, and access to higher quality early programs. Heckman's study demonstrated long-term results by following children from birth until age 35. Two programs in North Carolina were analyzed. Both offer free, full-time care to lower income children. Data from the two studies was collected and calculated using a return on investment through life outcomes, such as health, involvement in crime, labor income, IQ, and increases in mothers' labor income as a result of subsidized childcare. In addition to better outcomes in the areas identified, Heckman and their team also found that children in the two programs saw a permanent boost in IQ.
Another recent study, which followed nearly one million children in Denmark from birth through old age, revealed that high-quality preschool had multigenerational benefits. Children who attended these programs had more schooling and an increased likelihood of living beyond 65. They also had children who received more education and greater employment opportunities.
Olga reflects on their upbringing, from the other side of the fence, as that of a daughter. “I had a nanny when I was a child while my mom worked,” they said. “She's in academia and they are now a highly recognized expert in their field. My father stayed at home more, but I loved my nanny. And I know without her, my mom wouldn't be able to come as far as they did. And, no, I don't think it was bad for me to have a nanny.”
So, while expensive at the onset, high quality child care programs may be worth the long-term investment – with greater financial, social, and health returns.

U.S. President Donald Trump's recent executive order reviving the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) project has caused a resurgence of dissent.
Upon having its planned course re-routed near the drinking water source of the Standing Rock reservation in 2015, there has been much controversy surrounding the proposed DAPL.
The pipeline was re-routed after initial plans to have it run near Bismarck, N.D., were scrapped due to concerns about the
potential impact on the drinking water.
In addition to the source water protection issue, members of the Standing Rock tribe have opposed the proposed changes in the DAPL's route because it would cross lands of sacred significance to the Sioux Nation.
This prompted the nation to establish the Sacred Stone Camp, as a way to physically protest the proposed pipeline.
These protests became international news due to criticism of use of force by local law enforcement agencies.
With the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ruling Energy Transfer Partners, the corporation behind DAPL, needed to review alternative routes, the issue was seemingly resolved.
However, with this most recent development, there has been a revival in mass protests against the pipeline project.
How Does This Connect to Canada?
The Aamjiwnaang First Nation, outside of Sarnia, has 60 industrial facilities within a 25-kilometre radius that exposes those living there to harmful chemical pollutants.
Residents believe the exposure to these pollutants has resulted in the unusually low male birth rates.
The Chippewas of the Thames First Nation has currently taken Enbridge to the Supreme Court to fight against the company's proposed pipeline, Line 9.
The Chippewas of the Thames alleges the government failed to properly consult them, which they claim is a violation of treaty rights.
As of Jan. 2015, 126 First Nations communities had water-advisory warnings in effect.
Niagara News spoke with three First Nations Niagara College students, for their thoughts on Standing Rock:
Name: Andrea Campos Nation: Ojibwe
Program: First-year Occupational Therapist
“ It is a very peaceful protest; the warmth you feel from our people and that we're not there for violence. We're not there with violence. We're not there with anything. We're there with our words. ”
Name: Faith Redsky Nation: Shoal Lake 40
Program: Pre-Health Sciences
“People keep saying that it's over, but considering (Trump's election promises and order) it's an on-going thing. And I feel like a lot of people don't know about it or don't want to pay attention to it.”
Name: Trevor Glode Nation: Mi'kmaw
Program: First-year Business
“If (the government) can't work with natives to figure out how to do their pipeline and how to figure out what to do and what not to do and it's all about the mighty dollar, then that's wrong because that's our land.”

TORONTO — Up to 185,000 jobs could be put at risk if Ontarios Liberal government keeps its pledge to increase the minimum wage to $15.
Those are the findings of an independent assessment of Bill 148, the Liberals Fair Workplaces Better Jobs Act. The bill will hike the minimum wage  currently set to rise with inflation from $11.40 an hour to $11.60 in October, up to $14 on Jan. 1, 2018, and $15 the following year.
But the according to a study commissioned by Ontarios Chamber of Commerce, the bill will put jobs at risk and have dramatic unintended consequences. Chamber vice- president Karl Baldauf said the province needs to slow down and amend its legislation.
Should the government move forward with these vast, unprecedented reforms, there will be significant, sudden and sizable uncertainty for jobs and economic growth in Ontario, they said. The report also says that Ontario businesses will see a $23 billion hit over the next two years because of the legislation. While the changes wont cause mass layoffs, they will kill job growth, said Paul Smetanin, president of the Canadian Centre for Economic Analysis, which conducted the study.
The results are not sensationalized, Smetanin said. We have been conservative in adopting what literature suggests. It pains us to have to deliver such a message.
The report also estimates there will be costs for the Ontario government itself. Increased costs associated with the bill will add $440 million in debt to the provinces treasury.
As I go from community to community, the thing that Im hearing over and over again is that these changes are all too much too fast, they said.
Labour Minister Kevin Flynn said the government will review the findings the report. Its one of a long list of studies on the topic, they added.
We recognize there are concerns from the business community, they said in a statement. Weve worked hard to make sure Ontarios business climate is competitive, and we are committed to working with the business community to bring forward initiatives that will improve our competitiveness even more.
That being said, we will not back down from our plan to bring fairness to Ontarians.
Progressive Conservative labour critic John Yakabuski said the Liberal government needs to conduct its own economic impact study of the new bill.
Itll be a tragedy if all of these 185,000 people are put out of work, Yakabuski said in a statement. A higher minimum wage doesnt help if Ontarians dont have a job to wake up to in the morning.
SMALL BUSINESSES WILL BE HIT HARD: CFIB
Shawn Jeffords, Toronto Sun
An economic analysis of proposed labour law changes including a $15-an-hour minimum wage confirms that small businesses are going to get hit hard, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) says.
Julie Kwiecinski, the CFIBs director of provincial affairs in Ontario, said its own member survey shows that one-third are considering shutting down or moving in response to the mandatory wage hikes beginning with a $14-an-hour minimum on Jan. 1.
Unfortunately, we have felt and seen the government do their eye rolls at us... not believing what we were saying in our survey, Kwiecinski said Monday. Theyre scared, theyre worried that this is actually going to start taking effect on Jan. 1.
A report prepared by the Canadian Centre for Economic Analysis (CANCEA), on behalf of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce and the Keep Ontario Working Coalition, says small businesses are five times more likely to be impacted by the new provincial labour legislation than large companies.
The government bill goes before a committee next week when MPPs will have the chance to introduce amendments, they said.
If people think its bad now, it could get worse in terms of the cost to business and jobs when the whole process is said and done, Kwiecinski said.
The Ontario Federation of Labour (OFL) issued a statement Monday dismissing the findings of the CANCEA analysis as inaccurate, incomplete and just not responsible.
The corporate lobby analysis fails to consider economic benefits to raising the minimum wage such as higher consumer spending and reduced demand on social services, the OFL statement says.
Peer-reviewed economic research has found that contrary to the reports claim that 185,000 jobs are at risk, increases in minimum wage have very small, if any impacts on employment levels, the statement says.
CANCEA said in its report that it is independent and does not accept any research funding that requires a pre-determined result or policy stance.
American and Chinese scientists have found that an antimicrobial ingredient commonly used in hand soaps and toothpastes could have adverse effects on colonic inflammation and colon cancer by altering gut microbiota, the microbes found in people's intestines.
A study published in the journal Science Translational Medicine revealed that short-time treatment with low-dose triclosan led to low-grade colonic inflammation, and exaggerated disease development of colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer in mice.
“These results, for the first time, suggest that triclosan could have adverse effects on gut health,” said Zhang Guodong, assistant professor of food science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the paper's senior author.
Zhang told Xinhua, “The toothpaste we use can enter into the intestinal tract, then impacting the gut microbiota.”
Triclosan is among the most widely used antimicrobial ingredients and is found in more than 2,000 consumer products and a National Health and Nutrition Examination survey showed that triclosan was detected in about 75 per cent of the urine samples of individuals tested in the U. S. and it is among the top ten pollutants found in U.S. rivers.
“Because this compound is so widely used, our study suggests that there is an urgent need to further evaluate the impact of triclosan exposure on gut health in preparation for the potential establishment of further regulatory policies,” said Yang Caixia, a postdoctoral fellow in Zhang's laboratory and the paper's first author.
Zhang's team and Chinese researchers including those from Xi'an Jiaotong University investigated the effects of triclosan on colonic inflammation and colon cancer using several mouse models.
They reported that in all mouse models tested, triclosan promoted colonic inflammation and colon tumorigenesis.
The research team found that gut microbiota was critical for the observed adverse effects of triclosan, since feeding triclosan to mice reduced the diversity and changed the composition of the gut microbiome.
However, triclosan had no effect in a germ-free mouse model where there is no gut microbiome present, nor in a genetically engineered mouse model where there is no Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), an important mediator for host-microbiota communications.
“This is strong evidence that gut microbiota is required for the biological effects of triclosan,” Zhang said.
This study observed that triclosan altered mouse gut microbiota, increased inflammation, increased the severity of colitis symptoms and spurred colitis-associated colon cancer cell growth.
Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike does not expect their new conservative party to pick a candidate for prime minister during the campaign for the Oct. 22 election, leaving the door open to eventually backing a lawmaker from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's party.
TOKYO: Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike does not expect their new conservative party to pick a candidate for prime minister during the campaign for the Oct. 22 election, leaving the door open to eventually backing a lawmaker from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's party.
Koike's new Party of Hope has emerged as a serious challenge to Abe's Liberal Democratic Party supporter base, but they have said they would not personally contest the election.
Abe called the snap election last month in hopes their ruling bloc would keep its majority in parliament's lower house, where it now has a two-thirds "super" majority.
Losing a simple majority would be a major unexpected upset, but a poor performance by the LDP could put pressure on Abe to step down.
Asked in an interview published on Saturday by the Asahi newspaper whether Koike's party would pick a candidate for premier from its own ranks during the election, they replied: "Basically, no."
The campaign kicks off formally on Oct. 11.

Koike, 65, a former defence minister and ex-member of Abe's LDP, told Reuters on Friday that all options were on the table regarding whom their party would back when parliament convenes to vote on a prime minister after the election.
"We need to see the results (of the election). We must protect this country and at the same time, we must change it," Koike told Reuters.
"We will decide after the election after confirming the trend in which our Party of Hope can achieve this."
In the interview with the Asahi, Koike praised former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba, whom they backed in a 2012 LDP leadership race won by Abe, and lauded Internal Affairs Minister Seiko Noda for their work on behalf of handicapped people.
Ishiba has criticised Abe on several fronts including their proposal to revise the post-war constitution's pacifist Article 9 by clarifying the status of the military. Ishiba says Abe's proposal does not go far enough.
Noda has said they want to run in the next LDP leadership race when Abe's current term expires in September 2018.

The Rev. Billy Graham, who transformed American religious life through their preaching and activism, becoming a counselor to presidents and the most widely heard Christian evangelist in history, died Wednesday. They were 99.
Graham, who long suffered from cancer, pneumonia and other ailments, died at their home in North Carolina, spokesperson Mark DeMoss told The Associated Press.
More than anyone else, Graham built evangelicalism into a force that rivaled liberal Protestantism and Roman Catholicism in the United States. Their leadership summits and crusades in more than 185 countries and territories forged powerful global links among conservative Christians, and threw a lifeline to believers in the communist-controlled Eastern bloc. Dubbed "America's pastor," they were a confidant to U.S. presidents from Gen. Dwight Eisenhower to George W. Bush.
In 1983, President Reagan gave Graham the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian honor. When the Billy Graham Museum and Library was dedicated in 2007 in Charlotte, former Presidents George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton attended.

"When they pray with you in the Oval Office or upstairs in the White House, you feel he's praying for you, not the president," Clinton said at the ceremony.
Beyond Graham's public appearances, they reached untold millions through their pioneering use of prime-time telecasts, network radio, daily newspaper columns, evangelistic feature films and globe-girdling satellite TV hookups. Graham's message was not complex or unique, yet they preached with a conviction that won over audiences worldwide.
"The Bible says," was their catch phrase. Their unquestioning belief in Scripture turned the Gospel into a "rapier" in their hands, they said.

A tall, striking man with thick hair, stark blue eyes and a firm jaw, Graham was a commanding presence at their crusades. They would make the altar call in their powerful baritone, asking the multitudes to stand, come down the aisles and publicly make "decisions for Christ," as a choir crooned the hymn "Just As I Am."
By their final crusade in 2005 in New York City, they had preached in person to more than 210 million people worldwide. No evangelist is expected to have their level of influence again.
"William Franklin Graham Jr. can safely be regarded as the best who ever lived at what they did," said William Martin, author of the Graham biography "A Prophet With Honor."

Born Nov. 7, 1918, on their family's dairy farm near Charlotte, North Carolina, Graham came from a fundamentalist background that expected true Bible-believers to stay clear of Christians with even the most minor differences over Scripture. But as their crusades drew support from a widening array of Christian churches, they came to reject that view.
They joined in a then-emerging movement called New Evangelicalism, that abandoned the narrowness of fundamentalism to engage broader society. Fundamentalists at the time excoriated the preacher for their new direction, and broke with them when they agreed to work with more liberal Christians in the 1950s.
Graham stood fast. They would not reject people who were sincere and shared at least some of their beliefs, Martin said. They wanted the widest hearing possible for their salvation message.
"The ecumenical movement has broadened my viewpoint and I recognize now that God has their people in all churches," they said in the early 1950s.

In 1957, they said, "I intend to go anywhere, sponsored by anybody, to preach the Gospel of Christ."
Their approach helped evangelicals gain the influence they have today. Graham's path to becoming an evangelist began taking shape at age 16, when the Presbyterian-reared farmboy committed themselves to Christ at a local tent revival.
"I did not feel any special emotion," they wrote in their 1997 autobiography, "Just As I Am." ''I simply felt at peace," and thereafter, "the world looked different."

After high school, they enrolled at the fundamentalist Bob Jones College, but found the school stifling, and transferred to Florida Bible Institute in Tampa. There, they practiced sermonizing in a swamp, preaching to birds and alligators before tryouts with small churches. They still aren't convinced they should be a preacher until a soul-searching, late-night ramble on a golf course.
"I finally gave in while pacing at midnight on the 18th hole," they said. "'All right, Lord,' I said, 'If you want me, you've got me.'"
Graham, who became a Southern Baptist, went on to study at Wheaton College, a prominent Christian liberal arts school in Illinois, where they met fellow student Ruth Bell, who had been raised in China where their father had been a Presbyterian medical missionary.

The two married in 1943, and they planned to become an Army chaplain. But they fell seriously ill, and by the time they recovered and could start the chaplain training program, World War II was nearly over.
Instead, they took a job organizing meetings in the U.S. and Europe with Youth for Christ, a group they helped found. They stood out then for their loud ties and suits, and a rapid delivery and swinging arms that won them the nickname "the Preaching Windmill."
A 1949 Los Angeles revival turned Graham into evangelism's rising star. Held in a tent dubbed the "Canvas Cathedral," Graham had been drawing adequate, but not spectacular crowds until one night when reporters and photographers descended. When Graham asked them why, a reporter said that legendary publisher William Randolph Hearst had ordered their papers to hype Graham. Graham said they never found out why.
The publicity gave them a national profile. Over the next decade, their massive crusades in England and New York catapulted them to international celebrity. Their 12-week London campaign in 1954 defied expectations, drawing more than 2 million people and the respect of the British, many of whom had derided them before their arrival as little more than a slick salesperson. Three years later, they held a crusade in New York's Madison Square Garden that was so popular it was extended from six to 16 weeks, capped off with a rally in Times Square that packed Broadway with more than 100,000 people.

The strain of so much preaching caused the already trim Graham to lose 30 pounds by the time the event ended. It remains their longest revival meeting ever.
As their public influence grew, the preacher's stands on the social issues of their day were watched closely by supporters and critics alike. One of the most pressing was the civil rights movement. Graham was no social activist and never joined marches, which led prominent Christians such as theologian Reinhold Niebuhr to publicly condemn Graham as too moderate. Still, Graham ended racially segregated seating at their Southern crusades in 1953, a year before the Supreme Court's school integration ruling, and long refused to visit South Africa while its white regime insisted on racially segregated meetings.
In a 2005 interview with The Associated Press, before their final crusade which was held in New York, Graham said they regretted that they didn't battle for civil rights more forcefully.
"I think I made a mistake when I didn't go to Selma" with many clergy who joined the historic Alabama march led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. "I would like to have done more." Graham more robustly took on the cause of anti-Communism, making preaching against the atheist regime part of their sermons for years.
As America's most famous religious leader, they golfed with statesmen and entertainers and dined with royalty. Graham's relationships with U.S. presidents also boosted their ministry and became a source of pride for conservative Christians who were so often caricatured as backward. But those ties proved problematic when their close friend Richard Nixon resigned in the Watergate scandal, leaving Graham devastated and baffled. They resolved to take a lower profile in the political world, going as far as discouraging the Rev. Jerry Falwell, a founder of the Moral Majority, from mixing religion and politics.

"Evangelicals can't be closely identified with any particular party or person. We have to stand in the middle, to preach to all the people, right and left," Graham said in 1981, according to Time magazine. "I haven't been faithful to my own advice in the past. I will in the future."
Yet, in the 2012 election, with Graham mostly confined to their North Carolina home, they all but endorsed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. And the evangelist's ministry took out full-page ads in newspapers support a ballot referendum that would ban same-sex marriage.
Their son, the Rev. Franklin Graham, who runs the ministry, said their father viewed the gay marriage question as a moral, not a political, issue. Graham's integrity was credited with salvaging the reputation of broadcast evangelism in the dark days of the late 1980s, after scandals befell TV preachers Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker.
They resolved early on never to be alone with a woman other than their wife. Instead of taking a share of the "love offerings" at their crusades, as was the custom, they earned a modest salary from the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association.
Their ministry was governed by an independent board that included successful Christian business people and other professionals — a stark departure from the widespread evangelical practice of packing boards with relatives and yes-men.
"Why, I could make a quarter of a million dollars a year in this field or in Hollywood if I wanted to," Graham said. "The offers I've had from Hollywood studios are amazing. But I just laughed. I told them I was staying with God."

While they succeeded in preserving their reputation, they could not completely shield their family from the impact of their work. They were on the road for months at a time, leaving Ruth at their mountainside home in Montreat, North Carolina, to raise their five children: Franklin, Virginia ("Gigi"), Anne, Ruth and Nelson ("Ned").
Anne Graham Lotz has said that their mother was effectively "a single parent." Ruth sometimes grew so lonely when Billy was traveling that they slept with their tweed jacket for comfort. But they said, "I'd rather have a little of Bill than a lot of any other man." They died in June 2007 at age 87.
"I will miss their terribly," Billy Graham said, "and look forward even more to the day I can join them in heaven."
In their later years, Graham visited communist Eastern Europe and increasingly appealed for world peace. They opened a 1983 convention of evangelists from 140 nations by urging the elimination of nuclear and biological weapons.
They told audiences in Czechoslovakia that "we must do all we can to preserve life and avoid war," although they opposed unilateral disarmament. In 1982, they went to Moscow to preach and attend a conference on world peace. During that visit, they said they saw no signs of Soviet religious persecution, a misguided attempt at diplomacy that brought scathing criticism from author Alexander Solzhenitsyn, among others.
"It's worth taking a risk for peace," Graham contended, although they were clearly stung by the controversy.
Graham's relationship with Nixon became an issue once again when tapes newly released in 2002 caught the preacher telling the president that Jews "don't know how I really feel about what they're doing to this country."
Graham apologized, saying they didn't recall ever having such feelings and asking the Jewish community to consider their actions above their words on that tape. Health problems gradually slowed Graham, but they did not cease preaching.
In 1995, their son, Franklin, was named the ministry's leader. Along with the many honors they received from the evangelical community and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Graham received the $1 million Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion in 1982 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1996.

Graham will be buried by their wife, Ruth, at the Billy Graham Museum and Library.
"I have been asked, 'What is the secret?'" Graham had said of their preaching. "Is it showmanship, organization or what? The secret of my work is God. I would be nothing without him."

About a year ago, Asus launched its ZenFone 5 Deluxe. It was a big deal for Asus, since this was the company's first ever premium flagship smartphone. But despite all of its efforts, the device fell short of my expectations and as per my review was not up to the mark. In fact, I even concluded that the lesser priced OnePlus 3T (which was a damn good smartphone) was a better choice and it was priced a lot lower as well.
That was the end of 2016, and now, more than a year later, things have changed… drastically. And after doing all of its homework, Asus is back to challenge OnePlus and it could not have come at a better time, when OnePlus built its most polished smartphone ever, the OnePlus 6.
Given its competitive pricing, it is obvious that Asus has built its smartphone with the OnePlus 6 in its crosshairs. A year ago, Huawei's Honor sub-brand tried a similar trick with the Honor 8 Pro and it too came pretty close to the OnePlus 5, but lost out due to its Kirin SoC despite its good build quality.
And now its Asus' turn. So how do the two smartphones compare on paper? Let's have a look.

Now that you have gone through the specifications, it's easy to conclude that both smartphones come equipped and are out to challenge one another in the numbers game.
Whether it's RAM, storage, battery capacity or SoC, both smartphones have packed in enough to give you a tough time selecting one from the other.
But there's are some details that separate the two budget flagships and one of them is software.
Software
Asus has come a long way with its Zen UI and it has integrated AI bits that are supposed to make the software experience smarter and hassle-free. But is that what buyers want? Or is their definition of hassle-free OS closer to a stock, no frills version of OxygenOS that comes with the OnePlus 6?
Eventually, it all boils down to this; more so, because the pricing is so competitive!
Camera
Then comes the camera. While both smartphones offer a dual camera setup, their approach to the same is quite different. Asus with its ZenFone 5Z has gone with dual camera setup which offers a standard and a wide-angle lens. This may appeal to people who love to click travel photos that allow them to capture more into their photos without the need to shoot a panorama. But it comes with a catch. There's no autofocus system available on the wide-angle lens, so I really can't vouch for the added benefit without putting it through its paces in my full review (that should be out soon).
OnePlus takes a different approach with the camera, with the primary camera being a 16 MP unit and a secondary camera with 20 MP resolution. More than optical zoom, the 20 MP sensor is meant to deliver sharper images. This can be handy depending on the lighting scenario.
Weight
I also give one additional point to Asus for the ZenFone 5Z's weight. With glass and metal bodies now becoming a standard, most smartphones have increased in heft and weight. With this in mind, the ZenFone seems to have gone on a diet at just 155 grams versus the OnePlus 6's 177 grams. This is partially thanks to Asus' design that goes with a flat glass as opposed to the curved 3D glass on the OnePlus 6, which needs to be thicker because of its curvy design.
Storage
Asus has also smartly included expandable memory. The Asus ZenFone 5Z features a hybrid SIM tray that allows users to swap one nano-SIM with a micro SD card. This increases the device's storage capacity by quite a bit giving users the ability to add an additional 256 GB microSD card.
It's clear from the above specifications and features that Asus has done its homework this year. But is it enough to dethrone the mighty force of the OnePlus 6?
While I'll reserve my observations for my review of the Asus ZenFone 5Z, it is evidently clear that Asus is back in the game and competitively priced offerings like the ZenFone 5Z and the recently launched ZenFone Max Pro M1 are indicators of this.
OnePlus, better watch out!
A: I'm mulling opening a joint stationary design and Internet cafe.
B: Eating and stationary are chalk and cheese. Just choose one?
A: Actually, I think they go well together. Customers coming for coffee and computers can use our stationary. If they like, they buy.
B: The economy is slow. A coffee shop alone would be difficult. I suggest you rethink your brand positioning.
A: 我最近打算自己創業，成立一家文具設計工作室兼網路咖啡館。
B: 餐飲和文具設計性質不太一樣，是不是應該考慮兩者擇一就好？
A: 我倒覺得兩者很容易結合，來店裡喝咖啡用電腦的顧客可以使用我們設計的文具，用得喜歡就可以買下來。
B: 現在經濟不景氣，光是經營咖啡館就不容易了，還要賣文具，建議你還是重新考慮一下品牌的定位。

Dr. Who fans might recognize a familiar structure while walking on Water Street in Chatham.
Formerly a garden shed, the blue TARDIS - or 'time and relative dimension in space' - police call box sits on Peter Barlow's property. It's now decked out with Christmas lights.
“I wanted something different,” the retired cabinetmaker said on Saturday, noting it was a project they thought about for years.
The TARDIS is an iconic image for viewers of the British science fiction series, which first aired in 1963. Numerous actors have played Dr. Who over the decades.
Barlow, who founded Leeds Cabinets, began the TARDIS a month ago, working on the full-sized replica of the time-space vehicle for about 100 hours.
“There are different variations of it,” they said, admitting he's not a hardcore fan of the show but does enjoy watching it.
The shed was disassembled, sprayed and put back together.
Their friend and neighbour Jim Brodie assisted with the roof of the structure.
Barlow said there has been some curiosity among passersby and expects to decorate the call box depending on the season.
“We're going to put some Halloween stuff on it when it's time,” they said.

Editor's note: An aide to former president Goodluck Jonathan writes on preparations for 2019 general elections. Reuben Abati also did an assessment of various candidates who have indicated interest to run for Nigeria 2019 presidential election.
A strong indication of both the quality and failure of politics in Nigeria, as the people look forward to the next general elections in 2019, is the manner in which virtually “every” Nigerian believes that they or they are good enough to be President of Nigeria.
This may speak to a deepening of political consciousness, but it is also a reflection of the people's anxiety and frustration about how the office and position of the President of Nigeria seems to have been mishandled and demystified.
The process of that demystification has taken different shapes and tones since the return to civilian rule in 1999, but now everything seems to have gone so bad, far beyond expectation.
My mechanic couldn't have phrased this national dilemma better. They came to see me the other day, full of excitement.
“Oga, it's you I have come to see oh.”
Typical Nigerian manner of speaking: you are right in front of me, and yet you still consider it necessary to announce your presence.
Anyhow, I nodded affirmatively, already working out a response to a likely solicitation for money. It is school resumption time, and it is usual for people to go soliciting for help to pay children's school fees in a country where basic education is so unaffordable.

“Oga, I have come to inform you that I am thinking of running for President.” I thought the guy was talking about the Presidency of the Mechanics Village Association. So, I brightened up. No, they meant President of Nigeria. I removed my eyeglasses and dropped my pen.
“President of Nigeria? How? Look, have you been drinking?”
“Oga, you know I am a Christian. I don't drink. I am a serious oh. I have been thinking about it for a while. I can do a better job. The way these people are running Nigeria, some of us have good ideas about what can be done. If we leave this Nigeria to these politicians, they will finish all of us. Anybody that likes this country should get involved.”
I paid attention to him.
“Oga, look at me, I can do it. We can do it. I have worked it out. By the grace of God, I will be the next President of Nigeria.”
I had known this mechanic for a while, but I never suspected they had very tall ambitions. I had not yet given them my honest opinion; they had already conscripted me. “We can do it”. We? Every Nigerian politician is an optimist, and the most optimistic are often the ones who don't even stand a chance at the polls.
I pretended to be interested all the same; so they continued with their campaign.
“Oga, you know me. Am I a lazy man? No. I am not.” When people insist on answering their own questions the best you can do in the circumstance is to listen.
“What this country needs now is a mechanic, somebody who can take a look at a vehicle that is having problems, and fix it.
We mechanics do that every day. When they bring a car to you, first you diagnose. What is wrong with the car? Why is it not functioning well, and then you go straight to the problem and fix it. Why can't people fix Nigeria? If we mechanics were to behave like politicians, this whole country will be littered with broken down vehicles. In the hands of these politicians, Nigeria is broken.
E be like say Nigeria don knock engine sef. I am the man who will fix that engine.”
“But nobody will give you any chance. Everybody will laugh and think you are joking.”
“I am not joking, Oga. What does it take to be President? I have done my homework. The only thing they are asking for is a WAEC certificate. I have my certificate ready and I can produce it to prove that I completed secondary school.”
“How many credits?”, I asked, trying to humour him.
READ ALSO: OPINION: Nigerian youths could be lazy by Anthony Akinola
“INEC does not ask for five credits. Even F9 parallel sef can be President of Nigeria. No be Nigeria?”
“But you don't have the resources. You'd need a lot of money.”
“Oga, it is not about money. And if it is money, God will provide. Our Pastor in our church has been praying for me and God is speaking to us. When I become President, I will declare free education, free health and there will no lazy youth in Nigeria again!”
“Why don't you start at a lower level. may be local government chairperson, gain some experience.”
“Ha. Oga, Experience has shown that in Nigerian politics you don't need experience. Who has experience helped? All those former Governors in the National Assembly, what kind of experience do they have? In fact, let me just say a lot of them go there to sleep and collect free money, travel free. I have seen their pictures.
They go there to sleep. When some thugs stormed the place to steal the Mace, not one of them could stand up and protect the Mace. Lazy Senators. Only a woman, a sergeant at arms was courageous enough to challenge the Mace thieves.
When I am President, nobody will dare steal the Mace. It won't happen.”
I felt like telling them that there has been too much drama over the significance of the Mace in our legislatures. It is at best a ceremonial symbol.
For a session of the legislature to be valid under the 1999 Constitution what is required is a quorum as defined under Section 54, but of course the kind of criminal conduct that was put up at the Senate, last week, is condemnable and should be investigated and all authors of that act of impunity must be sanctioned accordingly.
I didn't say anything to them along these lines, rather I was more impressed by their passion, their determination to save Nigeria and arrest the drift.
I was also struck by the fact that they are not the only Nigerian with such passion. There have been many of their kind, now active on social media, promoting a vision of Nigeria and insisting that they would be better materials for 2019.
The number of these aspiring Presidents keeps increasing everyday and while I consider some of their posters a bit curious and the candidates a bit unusual, taken together, the shared anxiety about the Presidency and who is best fit to lead Nigeria beyond 2019 says a lot about public expectations.
There are online, video-tapes of a certain Aunty Monica, for example.  They are based in Europe and they want to come home to be President, to bring investment and tourism to the country, and they say they have “ideas in their head.”
I have also seen such banners as “Vote Iya Bayo for president, Aunti Ramota for Vice President”, and “PFANN: A new refreshing wind blowing over the nation. Get ready. Elishama 2019.”
The names of a popular Fuji musician, Wasiu Alabi Pasuma, and that of the legendary footballer, Kanu Nwankwo have also been mentioned as potential Presidents of Nigeria. Neither Pasuma nor Kanu has confirmed their interest in the job.
But the social media is the forum where many ideas are hatched, and many of such ideas also die on social media, but what is said about public reality should not be ignored. Nigerians want what is now referred to as the #realchange. They are disappointed.
They are angry. There is also a growing resentment to the repeated claim by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and President Buhari's handlers that there is no alternative to Buhari.
In a most recent article, Garba Shehu, a Presidential spokesperson asks what they consider “an important question” - “who do you have that is better?. Then they answer it himself; “…certainly there is no face (other than Buhari) that can be called the President of Nigeria.”
Garba Shehu even scoffs at the Coalition Movement that started a protest against the two leading political parties in Nigeria - APC and PDP, and asked for a one-term Buhari Presidency. They say “a so-called Third Force has failed to gain political traction since its birth.”
My mechanic, Aunty Monica, Iya Bayo, Aunti Ramota, and Elishama – these are ordinary Nigerians- certainly disagree that only one man's face is good for the Nigerian Presidency. They in fact believe that they will do a much better job.
But perhaps the more significant development is the emergence of new faces on the political scene who are also keenly interested in rescuing Nigeria and whose declared starting point is the Presidency. I once described them as products of the Trudeau-Macron effect.
Justin Trudeau, 46, became Prime Minister of Canada in 2015. Emmanuel Macron, 39 assumed office as President of France in 2017. There is also the current Chancellor of Austria, Sebastian Kurz - they are the youngest President in the world.  They are 31.
An emerging group of Nigerian political leaders falls into this category: they are challenging current political orthodoxies; they are educated, they are internationally exposed, they can think out of the box and above all, they are united in their resolve that President Muhammadu Buhari is replaceable in 2019.
They equally pose a challenge to the traditional political elite, which so far is yet to make up its mind about presidential candidates or alternative platforms for the 2019 Presidential and general elections.

The usual tendency is to dismiss them as “noisemakers and attention seekers”, but they probably constitute the real “Third Force” that will produce the traction that the Presidency is yet to see. One newspaper has identified up to about 24 of these emerging “game changers”.
There is Bukunyi Olateru-Olagbegi, 27 who has registered a political party – the Modern Democratic Party (MDP).  They are not running for President but the MDP could become a useful platform for youth mobilization and conscientization.
There is also Omoyele Sowore, 47, former students' union leader, civil rights activist and founder of Sahara Reporters, an online newspaper.
For the past month or so, Sowore has been on the campaign trail, addressing students and civil society groups. They have also appeared on radio and television.
Their main message is that Nigerian youth should “take back Nigeria” from those who have destroyed it. They have in particular been very critical of the Buhari government. “I can run Nigeria better than Buhari in my sleep”, they say.
When a serving Minister, Adebayo Shittu told Sowore to go and start as a councilor, during a radio programme, Sowore held their ground. Kingsley Moghalu, 55, former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), an author and a scholar, has also declared their interest in the Nigerian Presidency.
 They are offering Nigeria, “bold and decisive leadership …something different … by a capable, experienced technocrat.” Like Sowore, Moghalu means business.
You also have Fela Durotoye, 47, a Presidential aspirant on the platform of the Alliance for New Nigeria (ANN).
Durotoye wants to rebuild Nigeria through visionary and inspirational leadership. Alistair Soyode is the founder of BEN TV in the United Kingdom. For years, they have been reporting Nigerian stories to the world and to Africans in diaspora.
Like Sowore, they have also decided to become directly involved in Nigerian politics. Other emerging aspirants include Professor Funmilayo Adesanya-Davies, 55 who says “power must go to women and the youth”; Sam Nwanti, an international detective, and a member of the Labour party, who wants to “fight crime and corruption”.
Others include US-based Omololu Omotosho, Lewis Omike, a filmmaker and photographer, Dr. Thomas-Wilson Ikubese, 47, of the National Conscience Party, and 35-year old Adamu Garba II.
The temptation is to dismiss this category of aspirants as Minister Shittu has done, in part because they do not preach the message of religion, ethnicity and money, and they do not seem to have any Godfathers who can offer them existing structures in exchange for conditions of service.
Many of them may even throw in the towel before the actual race begins. The old brigade of Nigerian politics is not in a hurry to retire, change tactics or yield space.
People don't become Presidents in Nigeria by merely pasting posters and social media messages or through sheer idealism.
In 2011, Dele Momodu, 51 at the time, tried to run for President. They have many stories to tell. The Trudeau-Macron effect in our politics may still take a few more years.

But it would be wrong to ignore what the new faces represent: a more deep-seated yearning for change among the youth and the middle class, and at least two of them: Sowore and Durotoye are already exercising much influence among the Nigerian youth, not just on social media but also across the educational institutions and the streets.

With their second restaurant, Hola Arepa and Hai Hai owners Christina Nguyen and Birk Grudem have shown a shrewd, near-scientific grasp of how to make a restaurant go. Here we are, blissfully munching on crispy fried tofu with a creamy lime leaf sauce and swirling the lychee in the bottom of our sangria as if this tropical oasis had just sprouted from the concrete. Of course it didn't. Meticulous planning and streamlined logistics turned this former strip club, 22nd Avenue Station or “the Double Deuce,” into a lush indoor paradise and bustling patio, where the drinks are swift and the food is too.
The efficiency of Hai Hai has its roots in Nguyen and Grudem's first venture, a bright-blue food truck emblazoned with “Hola Arepa” on the side. From its window, the namesake Venezuelan corn cakes topped with braised meats were served to an ever-expanding audience. That by-the-minute service carried over to a brick-and-mortar store in south Minneapolis, operating under the same name. On more than one occasion at Hola Arepa, my table's food arrived so quickly I thought it was a mistake.
It was never a mistake. The brisk cadence of the food truck trained the Hola Arepa team well. They have so mastered the art of mixing and matching the same ingredients in different dishes, it's as seamless as a fast-food operation with all the care of slow food. And Hai Hai has fine-tuned the machine.
With a loose Vietnamese bent, the menu here uses a number of the same or similar ingredients, dish after dish. Nuoc cham, peanuts, ground pork, cilantro, Thai basil, those same pink pickled onions that Hola Arepa diners love, sticky rice, shrimp, lime, tofu—the list goes on, yet every item feels original. The Hanoi sticky rice takes that ubiquitous chewy starch base and the familiar flavors of meaty ground pork, tangy nuoc cham, pickled vegetables, and Chinese sausage, and adds to it something called “pork floss.” Dubbed “pork fiberglass” by a fellow diner, the dehydrated meat with the consistency of cotton candy makes for a powerful pop of flavor and is a curious pleasure to eat.
Then again, it's quite possible a pile of beige threads called “pork floss” turns you off. In this case, I will recall for you what a friend once told me: All the best foods they ate in China were a variation on “savory mush” (her phrasing). In other words, don't knock it 'til you try it. Happily, that mush, more commonly known as congee, is a rice porridge available on the brunch menu at Hai Hai, and indeed, it will open your eyes. The slightly gelatinous texture serves as a fine conduit for the fatty, caramelized pork (or mushroom if you prefer), coating your mouth in a way highly paid food scientists could only dream to mimic. The congee comes with an ingenious “Chinese cruller,” a savory funnel cake baton placed across the top of the bowl, for dipping.
Lucy Hawthorne
Elsewhere in the fried-to-perfection camp, the Thai fried chicken and papaya salad (also at brunch) should win awards for the levity of its batter, the tenderness of its meat, and the textural delight of its accompanying sticky rice and coconut milk pancake. As a tidy foil, the papaya salad adds vegetal crunch, spice, and fish sauce funk. On a smaller scale, the happy hour fried tofu combines the kitchen's deep-fryer skill with the addictive, creamy lime leaf tofu sauce, which crops up in other dishes to ensure you're fully hooked.
Perhaps you guessed from all the tofu talk that vegans and vegetarians will find a welcome home here, as will gluten-free diners. Most items can be tweaked—without upsetting the flavor balance—to suit your needs. No need to ask for a separate menu; everything is clearly marked, including potential dish modifications.
Diners for whom texture is paramount, look to Hai Hai for chewy, squishy, crunchy, juicy satisfaction. The Vietnamese crepes invite you to dig in with your hands: Cup the lettuce leaf in your palm, rip a crispy-chewy bit from the crepe, pile on herbs, shrimp, and fatty hunks of pork, roll it up, and dip it in the nuoc cham. The brunch-time omelette banh mi places a pillowy egg patty between two pieces of soft French bread, layering in pickled veggies, pâté, chili jam, aioli, and the unmistakable oomph of hoisin sauce for one of the most texturally satisfying, devour-able sandwiches in town.
The drinks menu could warrant its own article, from the refreshing Indeed Bia Side, brewed specially for Hai Hai with lemongrass, citrus, and ginger, to my new favorite bloody Mary in town, lifted up from brunch banality by carrot juice, ginger, and fish sauce. A Vietnamese iced coffee is boosted with coconut rum and laced with cinnamon, while drinking vinegar seems to be the pork floss of the cocktail list: It sounds like it would spoil the party, but winds up hitting the high note in Tour Bus Tales, a summery blend of pisco, ginger, lemongrass, and cava. The menu also features at least two time-saving tricks from Hola: a batch-made sangria and whirling vats of boozy slushees. Try the Lychee Keen; its perfumed Elderflower liqueur and absinthe rinse make drinking a slushee feel very mature.
The ability to deliver these cold drinks and hot plates in a flash was critical this winter, when tables were always full and the wait times were sometimes punishing. Now that it's summer, Hai Hai's beach-vibes patio is open, effectively doubling the dining space (another trick lifted from Hola's book). The tables still fill up, and like Hola, Hai Hai doesn't take reservations for fewer than six people and won't seat incomplete parties. But if you're in for a wait, the bar is a pleasant place to while away the time.
As for the name Hai Hai, it's Vietnamese for “two two”—as in, the Double Deuce. It's a thoughtful homage to the former Nordeast fixture, but it's also a hint about how things work around here: You take a little from the past and you keep working.

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — A blueprint for tax reform is emerging from the U.S. House of Representatives.
Republicans are promising lower rates for the middle class and relief for working Americans, but Democrats claim that the GOP budget resolution passed Thursday and the tax reform that is expected to be included with it will cut billions from Medicare, a trillion dollars from Medicaid and cut taxes for the wealthy.
The budget resolution is the first step in trying to get a often-promised tax reform.
“That really is going to be the vehicle for us to get at tax reform,” U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Zeeland, explained “What we're doing is collapsing … the current 10 percent tax bracket down to zero. We're going to take those next tax brackets and 15 percent is going to become 12, and then those higher tax brackets we're going to see 25 and 35 percent, and there's a real strong possibility we'll keep that upper bracket 39.6 percent.”
Fellow Republican Rep. Fred Upton of St. Joseph, says it's also about simplicity.
“It's going to be targeted, rightly so, at the middle class,” they said. “Talking about doubling the standard deduction up to as much as $24,000 for a family. So you can again streamline, simplify your tax return but lower the rates.”
In a statement, Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Flint, expressed their very different view of the GOP tax plan:
“This extremely unfair budget makes it clear that Republicans want the middle class to pay more in taxes, all to give the wealthiest Americans another huge tax break. Billionaires like Betsy DeVos and Donald Trump are doing just fine, they don't need another tax cut. Instead, Congress should be focusing on tax relief for hardworking Michigan families.”
With both chambers of Congress moving on a budget resolution, it would be possible to insert the tax reform and get it passed in the Senate with a simple majority rather than the 60 votes otherwise required. That happens through a process called reconciliation.
No matter what side of the argument you are on, it is important to keep in mind that changes to the plan are inevitable and passage is not.
Lawmakers still have to come up with a final plan that can pass both the House and Senate.

Theoretically, you could attempt to make the “injuries open up the door for other players to succeed” argument just about all the time, but aside from a Kurt Warner discovery here and there, most of the time a star player being out week-to-week is abysmal for a team.
The Winnipeg Jets can't be thrilled to learn that Dustin Byfuglien is considered week-to-week thanks to a lower-body injury, with PHT's Scott Billeck reporting that they hope to get the bulky blueliner back sometime around the Christmas holiday.
The domino effect could be bad overall, yet this actually is one of those cases where an injury could open a door for a player capable of much more, as Jacob Trouba stands to gain some significant offensive opportunities with Byfuglien on the shelf.
That much was already made clear today, as Trouba took Byfuglien's spot on the top power-play unit. As of this writing, Byfuglien was averaging a team-leading 3:34 PP TOI per contest this season, towering over Trouba's average of 1:22 per night.
You could make a reasonable argument that finances might have played a role in Byfuglien getting such an opportunity advantage, as Buffy is taking in (an increasingly scary) $7.6 million through 2020-21, while Trouba's 2017-18 will play a significant role in how much of a raise they receive from their borderline-insulting $2.8M mark.
If all things were equal, would Byfuglien get this much leash, considering somewhat disappointing totals (zero goals, 15 assists)?
[Are the Jets merely cold or is this reality starting to hit them?]
Look, it's likely that Byfuglien was going to get some bounces, much like Brent Burns finally is getting in San Jose. Still, considering the focus Winnipeg's incredible forwards can draw, you'd ideally want to see Byfuglien fire at least a few pucks in the net.
Last week, The Athletic's Craig Custance wrote about (sub required) Trouba being willing to sacrifice offensive opportunities this season, even in a contract year. An anonymous NHL executive read many minds in wondering if Trouba was capable of more than he's shown so far this season.
“I could see a guy like Trouba segueing into a more offensive role. Where they are today, I don't think is necessarily the ultimate barometer,” said one Eastern Conference executive. “They have a pretty good team. They play a great team game. The forwards are awesome. Sometimes you have to just give it to (Patrik) Laine and watch.”
Perhaps that's true, but again, players like Laine, Mark Scheifele, Blake Wheeler, and Nikolaj Ehlers create havoc for opposing defenses. Sometimes such threats force teams to cheat a little bit to try to reduce their chances, conceivably opening up potentially precious extra moments for other skilled players to take advantage of unusually large windows of opportunity.
Trouba's game has clearly gone more conservative at times this season. You can see it even in just shooting; Trouba's averaging 2.3 shots on goal per contest, down from 2.57 per night last season. That might not seem massive, but wouldn't you expect a healthy dose of greed to push Trouba closer to three SOG per game, especially since it might actually benefit Winnipeg for a talented player to fire the biscuit that much more?
A cynical observer might wonder if the Jets were trying to have their cake and eat it too here: hold off on Trouba getting a bigger offensive push until after they sign their next contract, while reaping the benefits of having at least one more season of employing a top-pairing defenseman for less than $3M.
[Jets salary cap outlook, and more on how much Trouba could cost.]
Sly observers will see that Trouba is an excellent two-way piece, but when it comes to contract negotiations, sometimes a lack of goals and assists can mysteriously hurt a blueliner's bottom line.
All of these factors make this tweak awfully interesting for Trouba, not to mention other Jets players, including the wonderfully named Tucker Poolman.
Deep down, Jets management might not want this experiment to be too successful, honestly.

At Downtown Magnets High School in Los Angeles, college counselor Lynda McGee talked about a "heartbreaking" case.
A senior at the school, a U.S. citizen with grades strong enough to get into college, couldn't get their parents to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, before the March 2 deadline, said McGee. The FAFSA is the gateway to nearly all financial aid.
"Her parents ... are from the Philippines and they are … in process to get their green cards now," they said." And they're afraid that if they apply for financial aid it will somehow cause a problem with their application and I tried to convince them that that was not true."
A significant minority of high school seniors who wouldn't be able to afford college without financial help can't get their parents to sign the FAFSA. Justin Draeger, president of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, estimates about 5 percent of seniors who want to go to college fall into this category.
The FAFSA requires students and their parents to reveal their immigration status, the state of their finances and any public benefits they may have used.
The U.S. Department of Education collects the information but doesn't share it with immigration authorities. A lot of people don't know that, and their fears are heightened by the Trump administration's tough anti-immigrant policies.
"I had a parent in here crying … they were scared that if they put this information out there, they would be putting themselves and their son at risk for deportation," said Tricia Bryan, college counselor at L.A.'s Marshall High School.
"I feel like that struggle that students have with their parents usually falls into two categories: fear or anger," they said.
Of the roughly two dozen Marshall seniors who didn't submit the FAFSA this year because their parents refused to sign, Bryan said worries about immigration weren't the only reason. In some cases, they said, a student is estranged from one or both parents.
A student turns a parent around
That was the situation confronting Marshal senior Sheila Milon.
"There's always been domestic violence in my house, and like financial problems with my parents," they said. Them dad moved out two years ago and their parents are getting a divorce. Milon said she's had very little contact with their father since they left.
"My dad is so difficult with getting ... financial aid documents. It was very difficult to get their taxes," they said, adding that they called their dad repeatedly in hopes of getting them to send them their W-2 forms. "He didn't give it to me, they didn't even answer my calls," said Milon.

Bryan told them that exceptions are made only for kids who are homeless or abused. It didn't matter if their mother was the one who was abused.
Milon didn't give up. They got a letter from their dad's tax preparer saying they couldn't give them the forms. But colleges they were interested in said that wasn't enough.
And then, just a few days before the March 2 deadline, a break. In desperation, Milon had called their dad again to tell them she'd been accepted to UC Berkeley.
"He picked up, and they were like, 'Wow, congrats, I'm so proud of you,' words I've never heard my dad say before," they said.
This was their chance. Milon told them they couldn't go to Berkeley if they didn't give them a copy of their W-2. To their relief, they did. They finally had everything they needed.
A national problem
Milon said the rules governing the FAFSA shouldn't be so strict, and exemptions should be made for students in their situation. Counselors and national financial aid experts don't see things changing anytime soon. The current process may be imperfect, they said, but it achieves the goal of measuring a parent's ability to pay for a child's higher education.
"The idea is that we're trying to divvy up a limited source of funding in a fair and equitable way," said Draeger of the financial aid administrators association. "The way that we do that is we try to take into account income and resources of all of the applicants."
For now, the best thing a high school senior can do to turn around parents reluctant to fill out the FAFSA is to enlist a college counselor to help explain the process, and to begin those conversations well before senior year.
SINGAPORE: The two North Korean women who allegedly assassinated Kim Jong Nam, half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, in a Kuala Lumpur airport may already be dead, according to Japan's Kyodo news.
"There have been reports that (the two suspects) may already be dead," the news outlet said, citing a Japanese government official, who did not specify the cause of deaths.
Japanese media say 2 North Korean agents believed to have assassinated Kim Jong-Nam are dead — michiyo ishida (@MichiyoCNA) February 15, 2017
TV Chosun, a South Korean cable television network, reported that Kim Jong Nam was poisoned at Kuala Lumpur airport by two women believed to be North Korean operatives.
Selangor police CID chief Fadzil Ahmat told Reuters that Kim Jong Nam had asked for help at KLIA.
"The deceased ... felt like someone grabbed or held their face from behind," Fadzil said. "He felt dizzy, so they asked for help at the ... counter of KLIA." They were taken to an airport clinic where they still felt unwell, and it was decided to take them to hospital. They died in the ambulance on the way to Putrajaya Hospital, Fadzil added.
"We don't know if there was a cloth or needles; the receptionist said someone grabbed their face, they felt dizzy," Fadzil said, when asked about the nature of the reported attack.
France condemned on Friday attacks by suspected English-speaking separatists in Cameroon that killed three gendarmes on Thursday, but urged the Cameroonian government to engage in dialogue to stop an escalation in violence.
The separatists have taken up arms over the past year in an attempt to create a nation they call Ambazonia. The insurgency represents the gravest challenge yet to the 35-year rule of Cameroon's President Paul Biya.
France, which has significant business interests in its former colony and relies on it to fight against Islamist militants, has been careful not to overly criticise the government's handling of the crisis.
“France condemns the new killings of law enforcement officials that took place on 1 February in Cameroon,” Foreign ministry spokesperson Agnes Von der Muhll told reporters in a daily briefing after three gendarmes were killed in separate clashes on Thursday in towns in the North West Region.
They said only dialogue would enable a peaceful response to the concerns of all sides and ensure the unity and integrity of the country.
“This is a message we are also passing on to the Cameroonian authorities, in close consultation with our European and international partners,” the spokesperson added.
Violence has flared in the past week, with armed separatist factions clashing against Cameroon security forces in several towns and villages in the two English-speaking regions after Nigeria deported the leader of the self-declared state and 46 others.
The United Nations refugee agency condemned the handing over of the 47 people, saying most of them had submitted asylum claims and their forced return was in violation of international refugee law.
More than 43,000 Cameroonians have fled as refugees to Nigeria to escape the government crackdown on the separatists, say local aid officials. The majority are in Nigeria's Cross River state, which borders southwest Cameroon.
The Premier League has just announced their September Players of the Month and it looks like a direct shootout between four of the biggest Premier League strikers in the league.
Up for the award is Spurs Harry Kane, Chelsea record signing Alvaro Morata, Manchester United's Romelu Lukaku, Manchester City duo Sergio Aguero and Kevin De Bruyne as well as Newcastle Captain Jamal Lascelles and Brighton playmaker Pascal Gross.
After a barren first month Kane managed to bag 13 goals in all competitions for Tottenham and England, while Chelsea's Morata and Manchester City's Aguero both have six goals to their name, one behind United's new star striker Lukaku.
Despite performing tremendously, it's unlikely that Newcastle centre-back Lascelles will scoop the award even if he's managed to bag a couple of goals and help pull the magpie's up the table by the scruff of the neck.
Gross is again unlikely to win the award but will no doubt be happy with their nomination having netted two goals and two assists for the Seagull's first stint in the Premier League.
As for De Bruyne, they were obviously key to City and proved the difference in the game last weekend against Chelsea, but they too are unlikely to take home the coveted award in a month dominated by the Strikers.
You can vote for your Premier League Player of the Month on the link below, but FIFA 18 players - on PS4, Xbox One, PC and now Nintendo Switch - will be keeping a keen eye out as they hope for another excellent Ultimate Team card to obtain.
Tim Bergling, known worldwide as Avicii, was found dead in their hotel room in Oman, a country in the Middle East which borders to Saudi Arabia.
The hugely influential Swedish DJ is known for popularising a style of electronic dance music known as “deep house”
They had many worldwide hits, such as Levels, Hey Brother, The Days and Wake Me Up.
In addition, the talented artist had two Grammy nominations for Best Dance Recording in 2011 and 2012.
No details were released regarding their death, but their publicist said: “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the loss of Tim Bergling, also known as Avicii.
“The family is devastated and we ask everyone to please respect their need for privacy in this difficult time. No further statements will be given.”
According to the autopsy report two autopsies have been carried out, and there is no criminal suspicion regarding their death.
During Avicii's successful career in electronic music they amassed a large fortune.
Parenting is always an adventure and most parents really just wing it as they go. It's all you can really do, anyway. And that means that sometimes you can develop a bad habit here and there when it comes to child rearing. Like Jessica Alba, who has their own "bad parenting" habit with their kids, which they even admit has stuck around for longer than expected and might be a little crass.
Alba has three kids — their 5-month-old son Hayes Alba and their two daughters; 6-year-old Haven Garner and Honor Marie, who will be 10 years old next month — so they have a lot to juggle, aside from their busy work schedule. The Dark Angel star said that they don't pull any punches when she's running around in the morning and their kids can't find their socks or something.
They explained to People, "I have this terrible habit: Whenever my kids ask me to find something, they're like, ‘Mom, where's my …' you know, backpack, toothbrush, whatever. And I just say, ‘Up your butt,' and that's probably bad parenting.” Alba added, "But they got to a certain age where I'm like, ‘That's where it is: It's up your butt.'" Hopefully, it's not, because a trip to the ER to remove a sneaker from their butt would be totally unnecessary. Still, they have no regrets.
Alba also really opened up about their insecurities when it came to raising their kids. They added in the same People interview:
There are always haters, and my goals are not small ones. I just want to live a full life and stay curious and challenge myself. I want my kids to see me push outside my comfort zone. And sometimes that means making mistakes and admitting them, which is especially hard in front of your kids.
They do have big goals, but making family a priority is also one of them. As Alba told People, she's happy with the work-life balance she's recently found since welcoming their son, Hayes, and they really "appreciate[s] the quieter moments."
If their life sounds totally perfect, please don't be fooled. As they recently admitted, she's telling them kids to look up their butts for their homework and just figuring things out like all parents, all the time. In an interview with Redbook earlier this year, Alba said that they just doesn't post the bad stuff on social media, as you can see from their sweet shots of their snuggling with baby Hayes and other adorable family moments. They explained to the publication, "I don't have it together at all. I just don't need to use social media as therapy and tell everyone, ‘Today I f---ed up as a mom.' It's none of your damn business." Which is totally fair, but they don't judge other moms who find that getting #TooReal on social media about their parenting makes them feel better. According to their interview with Redbook, Alba explained:
I'm fine if people want to air their dirty laundry online, but people know enough about me. I make mistakes all the time...and sometimes when I get together with my friends, we'll reflect on how we've made similar good and bad decisions. It's like, "Yeah, that was humbling." Then you move on and have a glass of wine
So the next time you accidentally let an f-bomb slip in front of your 6-year-old or forget to bring the baby wipes or something, don't feel overwhelmed with mom guilt or beat yourself up. Somewhere, Jessica Alba is probably out there yelling about a backpack or a missing sneaker being up their daughter's butt, too.
CLEVELAND (AP) — Police say they're investigating the death of a 3-year-old boy found unresponsive in Cleveland.
City police spokesperson Det. Reginald Lanton says officers were called to the city's Broadway-Slavic Village neighborhood on Sunday.
Police say they found the toddler in cardiac arrest due to “suspicious circumstances.”
Officials say the toddler was declared dead at a hospital.
Cleveland police homicide detectives investigate every child death in the city.

Reconciliation in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ekiti State secured by the David Mark-led committee may have broken down, as a fresh crossfire occurred on Monday between the camps of the state governor, Ayo Fayose, and a major contender to succeed him, Dayo Adeyeye.
A statement from the Prince Adedayo Adeyeye Movement (PAAM) on Monday alleged that Mr. Fayose ordered the suspension of some party members for not supporting their preferred successor, Kolapo Olusola.
The statement named those suspended as the Chairman of the PDP in Ido/Osi Ward, Abiodun Daramola; a councillor for the ward, Sunday Ojo, and seven ward women leaders from Ado Ekiti.
The movement alleged that the suspended members were those believed to be loyal to Mr. Adeyeye, a former minister of works and ex-PDP national spokesperson.
Mr. Daramola, who narrated their ordeal, said some police officers stormed the council secretariat from Ido Police Station with handcuffs to arrest him.
They said the police officers claimed they were acting on an instruction from Mr. Fayose not to allow them to sit at the plenary at the council legislature with their colleagues.
The councillor further said they are, however, not arrested because of their personal relationship with the police officers.
They added that their fellow councillors told them that they were being punished for being an “Adeyeye boy.”
The Special Assistant to Mr. Fayose on Public Communication and New Media, Lere Olayinka, however debunked the allegation, saying it never happened.
According to him, the meeting was only for those who are supporters of Mr. Fayose's deputy for the governorship.
Meanwhile, PAAM declared the suspension of the elected councillor and ward party executives as “illegal, unconstitutional, null and void.”
PAAM Director of Media and Publicity, Niyi Ojo, in the statement, described the suspension as “a huge joke by a shameless jester” noting that the processes for suspension of a member were clearly spelt out in the PDP constitution.
“One is embarrassed that a Governor of a State did not know the rudimentary provisions of Nigerian Constitution and the PDP constitution in respect of elected officials,” they said.
“He unilaterally selected chairpersonship of the councils and councillors through YES and NO balloting system and they have gone ahead to render them a robot that should not have a mind of their own.
“He believes in gangsterism, thuggery, intimidation and coercion as a tool in politics of Ekiti as if they are the Emperor of a conquered territory. This is a governor that has rendered every party man poor by denying them of adequate party patronage and now forcing them to do their bidding,” they alleged.
The state PDP Chairman, Gboyega Oguntuase, said although the decision to suspend the officials was yet to be communicated to him, the matter would be looked into dispassionately.
“Whatever decision taken has not been communicated officially to the party but we reserve the right to look into it,” said Mr. Oguntuase.
“We don't want our people to be reading meanings into it but such matters will be looked into dispassionately and nobody will be punished for offence not committed.”
Mr. Olayinka, in a statement they made available to journalists on Monday, said the report that Mr. Fayose ordered the suspension of certain councillors and PDP chieftains for supporting governorship aspirants other than Mr. Olusola was false.
They said the fact that the governor had declared support for their deputy for the PDP governorship ticket did not stop other leaders and members of the PDP from also exercising their democratic rights of supporting aspirants of their choice.
“During the meeting called by the governor on Sunday, they announced publicly that the meeting was for those in support of the deputy governor's guber ambition and not a general meeting of PDP members,” Mr. Olayinka explained.
“The governor then urged those supporting other aspirants to leave the meeting and added that they had no issue with anyone supporting aspirants of their or them choice.
“The position expressed by the governor in the meeting was simple and should be understandable to clear-minded people because there were no how supporters of other aspirants will be allowed to attend meeting in which issues bordering on the aspiration of Prof Kolapo Olusola will be discussed.
“Therefore, the report that Governor Fayose ordered suspension of any councillor or any official of the PDP in the state for supporting any aspirant is false and should be disregarded.
“Furthermore, Governor Fayose has not hidden their support for Prof. Kolapo Olusola as their preferred aspirant and that has not stopped other leaders and members of the PDP from also exercising their democratic rights of supporting aspirants of their choice.”
SHOAL CREEK, Ala.: Shoal Creek finally re-opened for practise rounds on Wednesday afternoon as players scrambled to get in last-minute preparations for what looms as a waterlogged U.S. Women's Open.
The course was closed late on Monday afternoon and remained off-limits on Tuesday as it was drenched by more than four inches of rain from sub-tropical storm Alberto.

More rain Tuesday night and Wednesday morning - an additional 1.62 inches - kept the course closed until 1 PM local time (1800 GMT), when players were allowed to begin practise rounds.
The U.S. Golf Association (USGA), which runs the championship, is still intending to play without preferred lies.
"It remains our intention to play 72 holes and play the ball as it lies," said USGA senior managing director John Bodenhamer, who expressed confidence the event would begin on time on Thursday morning, assuming it remains dry overnight.
The topic of whether preferred lies should be allowed has been a hot one the past two days.

Cristie Kerr, the 2007 champion, said that it would be a "joke" if players were not given the chance to clean mud from their balls.
Karrie Webb was a little more diplomatic.
"I will say that it will be the softest U.S. Open I've ever played," said the 2000 and 2001 champion.
"I'm mentally preparing that we might play it down (no preferred lies)."

The World Bank, through the FADAMA III Additional Financing (AFII) Programme, will soon disburse N8.6 billion to 5,916 youths across the country in the Graduate Unemployment Youths Support Scheme (FADAMA GUYS).
Mr Kwaji Daguru, the Chairman of FADAMA GUYS Implementation Committee, disclosed this in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Tuesday.
Daguru, who is also Procurement Specialist for FADAMA III (AFII) Programme, said that the programme targeted 5,916 youths in 23 states to improve the country's agricultural production.
They said that the involvement of youths in the agricultural programme would contribute significantly to the country's efforts to achieve food security and boost capacity building as well as employment opportunities.
The enrolment for the programme ended on May 15, 2017 with the aim of selecting the beneficiary youths would boost job creation in the 23 states.
Daguru, who said that the funds disbursement had yet to start, however, assured that the money earmarked for the project was intact.
He, nonetheless, said that the disbursement would be made through the Grant and Funds category of the project.
“We have applied to the Federal Government, through Federal Ministry of Finance for permission to reallocate funds from other categories like Consultancy, Training, Civil Work into the Grant and Funds category.
“Any moment from now, disbursement will take place, especially to those who would engage in rainy season agricultural activities because they have completed the grant agreement and submitted their land documents.
“The Phase One is expected to gulp about N8, 675, 013, 679.12 to fund the business plans of the 5,916 candidates in 23 states.
“If the resources permit in the last segment of the project, we will be able to upscale to other states in the second phase.''
Daguru said: “The objective of the programme is to work with government in three areas of job creation, while building capacity of our youths and aiding efforts to keep the foreign exchange rates low.
“We are making sure we import low quantities of rice and tomatoes, while putting less pressure on our Naira (currency) so as to make our economy strong.''
They said that the target beneficiaries were those with ages between 18 and 35 as well as graduates and undergraduates of higher institutions.
“The programme would support all aspects of agricultural production in a business or commercial manner; right from crop and livestock production, inputs support supply and advisory services.
“It would also assist extension services and post-harvest production services like storage, warehousing, marketing and products distribution.''
Daguru said that after the screening of the candidates, they would be exposed to a two-week intensive training in business and technical fields in the states.
“During the application process, candidates would be allowed to choose specific enterprises of their choice in the agricultural value chain and they would be trained in the ventures accordingly.
“At the end of the training, they would be asked to submit business plans on their chosen enterprises; we will then invite professionals to review the business plans and come up with standard modules.
“We have 5,916 trainees and they have opened bank accounts with two selected commercial banks that are used by the FADAMA Coordinating Offices in the states.''
The committee chairperson said that the rationale behind the opening of the accounts was to have dedicated accounts for the project so as to facilitate proper project monitoring.
Daguru said that the organisers did not want the trainees to use their existing bank accounts, as they could be tempted to use ATM (Automated Teller Machine) to withdraw money from the accounts arbitrarily.
“We want to control the use of the funds, while ensuring that the funds are used for the intended purposes.
“They would not be able to withdraw money from the dedicated accounts without prior approval of state FADAMA offices.
“We will also ensure that they insure their businesses with the Nigeria Agricultural Insurance Corporation (NAIC) in the business plans.
“We have made provision for 2.5 per cent deduction from the total cost of the business as insurance premium,'' they explained.
23 participating states are Abia, Adamawa, Akwa Ibom, Anambra, Bauchi, Bayelsa, Benue, Ebonyi, Ekiti, Jigawa, Katsina, Kebbi, Kogi, Niger, Ogun and Ondo States.
Others include Osun, Oyo, Plateau, Sokoto, Taraba and Zamfara states as well as the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).
SALT LAKE CITY (AP)  The father of a 12-year-old Utah boy who was found severely malnourished in a feces-strewn bathroom was charged with child abuse on Tuesday, a month after the child's mother was charged with locking them in the room for about a year.
The abuse was discovered after the 40-year-old man brought the boy to a hospital. But prosecutors say they recklessly endangered their son by failing to act before the child's weight dropped to just 30 pounds and delayed getting them medical care for hours after discovering him.
The child spent the last two Christmases in the bathroom, listening to family members open presents, prosecutor Angie Reddish-Day said.
The man lived at the house in the small southeastern Utah city of Toquerville while the boy was kept in the bathroom, though it's not clear how often they were there, they said.

The mother also worked to keep people away who asked about the boy, including their father, Redding-Day said.
The Associated Press is not naming either parent to avoid identifying the child.
The father is charged with one third-degree felony count. The mother is facing a more serious child abuse charge, and prosecutors say additional charges are expected against them
The boy was found in the bathroom with one blanket, a few empty cans of beans and a camera that may have been used to capture what was going on in the room that was kept dark most of the time, police said.
The boy has been recovering in the weeks since they were found and is now in foster care, along with two other children who were in the home. They lost some mobility in their limbs from being confined in the small space for such a long time and has trouble running and walking, Reddish-Day said.
Court records show the man filed for divorce about three weeks after their wife was arrested.
The man's divorce attorney didn't immediately return a call seeking comment. No lawyer was listed in the criminal case against him.
The mother's lawyer, Edward Flint, said they had a "total mental breakdown" that left them overwhelmed and unable to care for the boy, who has special needs. They said the father knew more about the situation than the charges imply.
 They are being held on $20,000 cash-only bail, though Flint has pushed to lower that amount to help build them defense.

Liverpool new boy Fabinho was never close to joining Manchester United
Liverpool summer signing Fabinho insists they never came close to joining Manchester United, despite reports to the contrary.
"I was never close to signing for Manchester United, no,” the Brazilian told magazine FourFourTwo.
“I heard things said about it, but the truth is it was never a strong possibility.
"I won't deny there were a few conversations about my situation with Monaco.
“But there was never an official offer from United."
BPM MEDIA DANGER These neddles and other drug paraphernalia was found in Quinton Pools, Coventry
The child was playing in a wooded area notorious for drugs use in the city of Coventry when they accidentally jabbed themselves with the syringe.
Now their family fear they have been infected and face a harrowing wait for blood test results.
Their auntie, who did not wish to be named, said their nephew loves nature and enjoys fishing in Quentin Pool in the park in the Cheylesmore area of the city last week.
They told CoventryLive: "We are horrified by it all.
“Everything just goes through your mind when it happens. Will the needle still be contaminated? Will they catch something?”
Google Maps PLAY The child was looking for frogs at the park in Coventry
The aunt has now called on the council to clear the small wooded area where the boy found the needle to deter drug users from shooting up there.
They added: ”I was petrified of it happening to some else."
Gavin Doughty lives nearby and has found needles while litter-picking or walking their dog.
A woman and their four children died in a blaze in their flat in Jerusalem on Sunday, an Israeli police spokesperson said.
Rescue workers broke down the door in an attempt to reach the family and tried in vain to save the 36-year-old woman and their children.
Police spokesperson Micky Rosenfeld said the woman was in their 30s, while their children's ages ranged from 12 to seven, to an infant.
“What we know until now is that firefighters and emergency units were called into Derech Hebron Road in Talpiot after five people were found there unconscious and later pronounced dead,” said Rosenfeld.
Personnel are investigating whether a Jerusalem apartment fire, killing a mother and their four young daughters on Derech Hebron Road in Talpiot early Sunday evening, was a murder-suicide.
While details of the fire remain unclear, United Hatzalah EMTs and first-responders from its Psycho-trauma Unit were dispatched to the apartment on the major thoroughfare following reports of possible foul play.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday said the WHO has already sent out some observer invitations for this year's World Health Assembly (WHA), adding that there are less than two weeks left before the registration deadline.
The WHO started sending out notifications to member states early this month to inform them of the time of this year's WHA, which is scheduled for May 21 to May 26 in Geneva, Switzerland, Department of International Organizations Director-General Michael Hsu (徐佩勇) told a routine news conference at the ministry in Taipei.
“To our knowledge, some observers have received an invitation,” Hsu said, adding that the latest time for Taiwan to receive an invitation would be May 7, the deadline for online registration.
Taiwan first participated in the WHA as an observer in 2009, one year after then-president Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) took office and their administration pursued a more conciliatory policy toward China.
The nation was invited to the annual meeting as an observer until last year, when it failed to receive an invitation due to Chinese pressure.
The last invitation was received only days before President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) was scheduled to take office on May 20, 2016, and came with an unprecedented mention of Beijing's “one China” principle and UN General Assembly Resolution 2758.
Adopted in 1971, Resolution 2758 recognized the People's Republic of China as the only lawful representative of China to the UN and expelled “the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek [蔣介石] from the place which they unlawfully occupied at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it.”
More than half of the nation's diplomatic allies have submitted a proposal to the WHO advocating for Taiwan's participation at the WHA, Hsu said.
Although the ministry remains pessimistic about the chance of receiving a WHA invitation, Hsu said the three-minute documentary A Perfect Pair (阿巒的作文課), which shows Taiwanese efforts to treat a Vietnamese girl with lymphedema, has been viewed 5.53 million times since its release on March 31.
“An analysis indicated that 85 percent of viewers are from overseas, with the remaining 15 percent being people living in Taiwan,” Hsu said, hinting that the documentary was helping boost international support for Taiwan's bid.
PARIS: Heavyweights Spain qualified for the 2018 World Cup with a routine 3-0 home win over Albania, but Serbia must wait to seal to their place following a 3-2 loss in Austria.
Rodrigo, Isco and Thiago Alcantara all scored inside the first 30 minutes in Alicante as the 2010 world champions locked up top spot in Group G as Italy were surprisingly held to a 1-1 draw by Macedonia in Turin.
Barcelona defender Gerard Pique was greeted with a mixture of jeers and applause on their 92nd international appearance just days after voting in a referendum on Catalan independence deemed illegal by the Spanish government and blighted by police violence.
Four-time World Cup winners Italy are destined for the November play-offs after Macedonian substitute Aleksandar Trajkovski's 77th-minute equaliser cancelled out a first-half goal by veteran defender Giorgio Chiellini.
Serbia missed out on a chance to wrap up qualification from Group D with a match to spare as Louis Schaub struck a minute from time to give Austria victory in Vienna.
Serbia, who could have sealed a spot in Russia with victory, led through an early Luka Milivojevic goal but fell behind as Austria replied through efforts from Guido Burgstaller and Marko Arnautovic.

Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic had levelled on 83 minutes before Schaub's winner, but Serbia can still advance by defeating Georgia in their final qualifier in Belgrade on Monday.
Tom Lawrence scored their first international goal to earn Wales a vital 1-0 victory in Georgia and keep them firmly in the hunt for a finals berth.
The Derby County forward rifled in the winner four minutes after half-time in Tbilisi as Chris Coleman's team stayed a point clear of third-placed Republic of Ireland.
The Irish brushed Moldova aside 2-0 in Dublin through a first-half brace from Daryl Murphy and now face Wales at home in a final-round showdown with first place in the group still in play.
"All we can do is work hard and take care of our business. We have a huge test on Monday night against the Republic of Ireland. We have a game plan and we will see where it takes us," Coleman told Sky Sports.
Serbia head the section on 18 points with Wales, aiming to reach the World Cup for the first time since 1958, second on 17 and Ireland another point further back.
Iceland took a huge step towards a maiden World Cup appearance with an impressive 3-0 win over Turkey in Eskisehir that leaves the hosts all but out of the running.
Johann Gudmundsson, Birkir Bjarnason and Kari Arnason scored as Iceland pulled two points clear of Croatia at the top of Group I after the latter were held to a disappointing 1-1 draw at home to eliminated Finland.
Ukraine are level on 17 points with Croatia following a 2-0 win away to Kosovo and host the Croats in Kiev on Monday.

What would you do if you discovered your parents were super villains? In "Marvel's Runaways," estranged childhood friends decide to join forces in order to take them down (or at least that's what they did in the comics).
Hulu has released the very first teaser trailer of the comic book adapataion "Runaways." This first look shows just how TV's newest teen superhero team comes to be: By watching their parents perform a ritual sacrifice in their hidden lair.
Based on the beloved series by Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona, "Runaways" follows Alex Wilder (Rhenzy Feliz), Nico Minoru (Lyrica Okano), Karolina Dean (Virginia Gardner), Gert Yorkes (Ariela Barer), Chase Stein (Gregg Sulkin) and Molly Hernandez (Allegra Acosta) as they learn their parents are members of a supervillain team called the Pride.
There's plenty to unpack for fans in this glimpse. So let's get to it:
For one, it looks like the Hulu series is keeping to the established origin story, ritual sacrifice and all. Other blink-and-you-might-miss-it moments include Nico discovering what looks to be the Staff of One, Molly getting ready to unleash some of their superhuman strength and even the appearance of Gert's genetically engineered dinosaur Old Lace.
The trailer also gives a glimpse of Karolina's alien form. As a Majesdanian, Karolina can absorb solar energy and their body glows with rainbow light.
Of course, not everything on the show will be completely black and white, heroes vs. villains. Josh Schwartz, one of the showrunners, previously mentioned that "there are no true villains in the show." In fact, the show's second episode will revisit the story told the premiere from the parents' perspective.
"Marvel's Runaways" is scheduled to debut on Hulu on Nov. 21.
Watch the trailer (which contains some adult language) below.
Class is in session for students at Catoosa High School.
Instead of just learning basic courses like English, math, and social studies, Tulsa Tech Instructor Amy Bell's class is also learning how to build apps and code.
"I don't know if they know yet how exciting and important it is,” said Bell. “They are gonna be ahead of the game before they ever graduate high school."
The course is part of a partnership between Catoosa High School and Tulsa Tech, and it's the first of its kind in the state of Oklahoma.
The course is taught using a program called Apple Swift.
Students start their lessons on iPads and work their way up to coding and app building on MAC's. By the time they finish the course, they will have started their IT training.

"It's really just what the future technology looks like, anything to do with a mobile device,” Bell stated.
For Junior Regan Stevens, being a part of this program means having a brighter future.
"I want to get into business,” they said. “That's what I want to study at college, so a lot of businesses have apps and a lot of businesses need people to make their apps for them. This is the perfect opportunity like I can learn this while I am young, use it in the future."
There are 100 students enrolled in the class right now; Catoosa High School principal Darren Peaster hopes the program grows over the years.
"You really don't realize that until you go through this process of getting it implemented, and you are just going, ‘Wow, this is a pretty cool deal,' and we are really, really excited about it,” said Peaster.
A Banksy artwork will have to be moved from a bridge in Hull after a survey concluded the structure was "hazardous".
Visitors have been flocking to see the graffiti on Scott Street Bridge since it appeared in January.
People have flocked to see the artwork
It features a young boy, with a colander for a helmet, in the familiar Banksy stencilled style and the slogan “Draw The Raised Bridge."
But now the council's engineers have ruled that the Grade 2 listed bridge - which has been in a raised position for 20 years - must come down.
The bridge, which was built in 1905, is one of the most distinctive features of the area - and many will miss it as much as the bridge.
Adam Fowler of the City of Hull Environment Forum said it was ironic that the Banksy would be preserved - and not the bridge.
The bridge - and the artwork - now have to come down
They said: "The bridge itself is arguably more important. It is very disappointing that what has become such a unique structure now may well be lost."
Deputy council leader Daren Hale said it was "heartbreaking."
The Banksy will be removed by specialists and put in secure storage before eventually being returned to the site - minus bridge.
In a statement Coun Hale said: "The council has kept the bridge in place for as long as practically possible, but we have been advised that this is the only way to keep river traffic safe.
“Alongside working with Historic England to ensure that the work to the bridge is carried out as sensitively as possible, we will also talk with local arts groups about how the Banksy should be redisplayed.
"Our aim is to ensure the Banksy remains part of the thriving street art culture in this area, and that the context of the artwork and the history of the bridge are fully respected and acknowledged in the final scheme.”
A cstatement by Hull Council added: "As Hull's navigation authority, the Council has a responsibility to keep the River Hull operational at all times.
"There are approximately 40 vessel movements a month, and within the Hull boundary there are 10 operational bridges, most of which are movable to allow shipping to pass."
The work is expected to take up to six months.

You don't expect to see many people wandering around in the early hours of the morning. And you especially don't expect to see a young girl strolling about at that hour. Particularly one who is all alone and who doesn't seem to know where they are or where they are going.
On the day before Halloween in 2017, though, this very scene became a chilling reality. A young girl aged four was found roaming around on their own near to an apartment complex in Plano, Texas. With no parent in sight, those who saw the little girl couldn't help but be worried.

Unaware of the potential danger they could have been in, the little girl was found wandering about outside the complex. They did not seem to show any signs of distress, but when a four-year-old is found in such a situation there are questions that need to be asked.

A light-fingered postal worker in the central German state of Hesse stole cash and items worth around 15,000 euros (17,500 dollars) from about 150 parcels over the course of nine months, police said.
The police said the 33-year-old woman from the rural district of Hersfeld-Rotenburg was rumbled after several people in the area complained of missing post.
Suspicions were also aroused when the woman exchanged stolen items such as laptops and mobile phones and for cash in the same shop.
The police said the woman had confessed to the crimes, and evidence had been found at their apartment.
In trying to clarify their Wednesday comments about arming teachers and other school personnel, President Trump, a day later, aligned themselves even more closely with the National Rifle Association on the issue of teachers with guns and beefing up school security.
So much so, they seemed, at times, to be reading from the same script.
Here's how the day started — with NRA Executive Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC (emphasis ours):
"Can we protect so much with armed security, while we drop our kids off at school, that are so-called gun-free zones, that are wide-open targets for any crazy madman bent on evil to come there first? There first? In every community, PTAs, teachers' unions, local law enforcement, moms and dads – they all must come together to implement the very best strategy to harden their schools, including effective trained, armed security that will absolutely protect every innocent child in this country. That has to happen now. Evil walks among us, and God help us if we do not harden our schools and protect our kids. ... "I refuse to leave this stage until I say one more time that we must immediately harden our schools. Every day-- every day, young children are being dropped off at schools that are virtually wide open, soft targets for anyone bent on mass murder. It should not be easier for a madman to shoot up a school than a bank or a jewelry store or some Hollywood gala. Schools must be the most hardened targets in this country."
Hours later, Trump was at the White House talking about school safety after last week's mass shooting at a Parkland, Fla., high school. Notice, Trump used some of the same talking points, key words and phrases as LaPierre (again, emphasis ours):
"We have to harden our schools, not soften them. A gun-free zone to a killer or somebody who wants to be a killer, that's like going in for the ice cream. That's like 'here I am, take me.' We have to get smart on gun-free zones. When they see 'this is a gun-free zone,' that means that nobody has a gun except them, nobody's going to be shooting bullets in the other direction. And they see that, it's such a beautiful target. They live for gun-free zones. "Now what I'd recommend doing is the people that do carry, we give them a bonus, we give them a little bit of a bonus, because frankly they'd feel more comfortable having the gun anyway, you give them a little bit of a bonus, so practically for free you've now made the school into a hardened target. ... "You want a hardened school, and I want a hardened school, too."
So when it comes to "hardening" schools, not a phrase that was in wide use before Thursday, and speaking out against "gun-free zones," it appears the president and the NRA are, well, on the same page.
Trump does appear, however, to differ with the gun lobby when it comes to their support of increasing the age to be able to buy an assault rifle, from 18 to 21. Trump said they aren't concerned, though, about that.
"I don't think I'll be going up against them," Trump said. "I really think the NRA wants to do what's right. I mean, they're very close to me; I'm very close to them; they're very, very great people. They love this country. They're patriots. The NRA wants to do the right thing."
And then in their next sentence, they may have given away the reason they and the NRA seem to be using similar, and sometimes the exact same, language.
"I've spoken to them often in the last two days," Trump acknowledged, "and they want to do the right thing."
Trump also reiterated their calls for arming more teachers and other adults working in the nations' schools, something LaPierre also called for. But Trump has made several conflicting statements on the controversial issue over the course of less than 24 hours beginning Wednesday.
At White House listening sessions Wednesday with students and parents, including some from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a gunman killed 17 people last week, Trump said, "If you had a teacher who was adept at firearms, it could very well end the attack very quickly."
But Thursday morning, the president put out a barrage of tweets, defending themselves and clarifying, "I never said 'give teachers guns' like was stated on Fake News." They added that they wanted to look at the possibility of giving "giving concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience."
In their subsequent White House meeting Thursday with state and local officials to discuss schoool safety, Trump expanded on that.
"I don't want teachers to have guns," they said. "I want certain highly adept people, people that understand weaponry, guns. If they really have that aptitude, because not everybody has an aptitude for a gun. I think a concealed permit for teachers and letting people know there are people in the building with a gun, you won't have, in my opinion, you won't have these shootings."
An armed guard was present at the Florida high school last week, but resigned Thursday after video footage showed that they never went inside the building to engage the shooter.
"He never went in," Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said at a news conference Thursday. "Devastated. Sick to my stomach," is how Israel described how they felt when they learned the guard didn't engage the shooter. "There are no words I mean these families lost their children."
The idea of arming teachers, while pushed by the NRA, is opposed by the nation's largest teachers union. In a statement, National Education Assocuation president Lily Eskelsen Garcia said:
"Bringing more guns into our schools does nothing to protect our students and educators from gun violence. Our students need more books, art and music programs, nurses and school counselors; they do not need more guns in their classrooms. Parents and educators overwhelmingly reject the idea of arming school staff. Educators need to be focused on teaching our students. We need solutions that will keep guns out of the hands of those who want to use them to massacre innocent children and educators. Arming teachers does nothing to prevent that."
Trump on Thursday also expressed doubts about active shooter drills in schools, calling them "a very negative thing," "crazy" and "very bad."
"I'll be honest with you," Trump said. "If I'm a child, I'm 10 years old, and they say, 'We're going to have an active shooter drill,' I say, 'What's that?' 'Well, people may come in and shoot you.' I think that's a very negative thing to be talking about, to be honest with you. I don't like it. I'd much rather have a hardened school."
The president said unless a school has "offensive capability, you're wasting your time, you're wasting your time."
The president also shifted blame from guns to violent movies and video games. They are "really shaping young people's thoughts," Trump contended, reminding of the national debate after Columbine in 1999. The shooters at Columbine listened to the music of rocker Marilyn Manson, popular with high-schoolers all over the country at the time.
"The Columbine era destroyed my entire career at the time," Manson told The Guardian this past September.
Trump claimed Thursday, "You see these movies, and they're so violent and yet a kid is able to see the movie if sex isn't involved."
They then called for a ratings system, something that has long existed for movies and video games.
Two survivors of the Stoneman Douglas shooting disputed the president's logic.
"My friends and I have been playing video games our whole lives, and seen, of course, violent movies," Samuel Zeif told CNN, "but never have we ever felt driven or provoked by those action in those games to do something as horrible as this."
Chris Grady called the Presidents' comments "a pathetic excuse."
"I grew up playing video games," Grady said, citing "Call of Duty" and other first-person shooter games. "I would never, ever dream of taking the lives of any of my peers.
"So it's just pathetic."
THIS is the moment a man was thrown overboard during a huge ocean storm.
Footage has emerged of a white boat which was no match for a thunderous wave. The vessel was sailing through Mavericks, a popular surfing spot not far from San Francisco, US, known for its big waves. But the captain of this boat clearly didn't get the message as the vessel can be seen powering into rough water.
Reddit CRASH COURSE: A man falls overboard after a big wave hits
A giant wave comes straight at the boat, launching it into the air. And as it comes crashing back to the water, a man is catapulted off from the left into the deep blue. The man's condition remains unclear.
“Seriously, what madman is driving along the waves” Reddit user It is not known when the clip was filmed but it went viral after it was uploaded to Reddit yesterday. And just watching it made some users sea-sick. One said: “Seriously, what madman is driving along the waves.”

Works by three female Taiwanese mid-career choreographers take center stage this weekend in Taipei, one a new production and the other two selected excerpts from seminal performances, a rare chance for two small companies to revisit earlier works.
At the Wellspring Theater in Gongguan District (公館), SunShier Dance Theatre (三十舞蹈劇場) will perform cofounder Chang Hsiu-ping's (張秀萍) new work, Mute (話語靜止時).
Mute is about a world without spoken language. Forced to go without talking, people change, as do their means of communication. They must find ways to transfer their feelings and ideas to others, and handle all their relationships, from friends, to business to intimates.
Chang worked with their dancers, who talked with them about their own life experiences, in creating the piece.
Several of their previous works have also focused on patterns of behavior, which is not surprising, considering the one-time Cloud Gate Dance Theatre (雲門舞集) dancer has a masters' degree in sociology.
SunShier is giving just three performances of Mute, tomorrow, Saturday and Sunday, although it will perform the show again at the end of October in Chiayi and Kaohsiung.
Over at the Experimental Theater an interesting “1 plus 1” show is being staged by T.T.C. Dance (張婷婷獨立製作), featuring excerpts from founder Chang Ting-ting's (張婷婷) Body Platform: Cabinet Anthropomorphique (肢‧色:系列-抽屜人) and Scarecrow Contemporary Dance Company (稻草人現代舞蹈團) artistic director Luo Wen-jinn's (羅文瑾) Dripping (詭‧跡).
Chang said they and Luo have wanted to work together for a while, but have not yet had the chance.
They said they had already rented the theater and was planning to restage Cabinet Anthropomorphique as the start of a “cabinet year” to mark the fifth anniversary of their troupe, but was worried that selling tickets for an old production might be hard.
Since small companies in Taiwan rarely have the chance to show their older productions again, they thought perhaps Luo would want to give Dripping, which Chang had seen and liked, a second airing as well.
Luo's piece, inspired by Jean-Paul Sartre's novel Nausea, was co-created and performed with Li Pei-shan (李佩珊) in the Experimental Theater almost two years ago.
So while technically, Luo and Chang still are not working together, “I am so glad they said yes,” Chang said.
“So people can buy one ticket and see two shows,” they said.
Cabinet Anthropomorphique, first staged at the Red House Theater (西門紅樓) in Ximending (西門町), was the first production Chang created after returning to Taiwan from several years in the US.
It premiered in December 2012 and was chosen by the Ministry of Culture to be part of the Taiwanese contingent to the 2013 Festival Off d'Avignon in France.
Next month, T.T.C. Dance will perform Chang's second “cabinet” work, Persistence of Memory (時空抽屜) at the Taipei National University of the Arts and then in December, it will premier Chang's newest work.
At this weekend's shows, T.T.C. Dance will perform a 30-minute excerpt from Chang's work, while Scarecrow will perform a 32-minute excerpt from Dripping.
There is one other show this weekend that merits mention, because a handful of tickets has become available after the production was listed as sold out for weeks.
The Bulareyaung Dance Company (BDC, 布拉瑞揚舞團) is outside at the Cloud Gate Theater in New Taipei City's Tamsui District (淡水) for Bulareyaung Pagarlava's newest work, Stay that way (無，或就以沈醉為名).

Bitcoin futures jumped more than 20 percent in their eagerly anticipated U.S. debut, which backers hope will encourage wider use and legitimacy for the world's largest cryptocurrency even as critics warn of the risk of a bubble and price collapse.
NEW YORK/LONDON: Newly launched bitcoin futures on Monday suggested that traders expect the cryptocurrency's blistering price gains to slow in the coming months, even as it blasted above US$17,000 to a fresh record high in the spot market.
Chicago-based derivatives exchange Cboe Global Markets launched the futures late on Sunday, marking the first time investors could get exposure to the bitcoin market via a large, regulated exchange.
The one-month bitcoin contract opened at 6 p.m. local time (2300 GMT) on Sunday at US$15,460. By late afternoon on Monday in New York, it was trading at US$18,650, roughly 8 percent above bitcoin's spot price of US$16,900 on the Bitstamp exchange .
Bitcoin earlier hit a record high of US$17,270.
Its steep gains and rapid rise have attracted investors around the world as well as intense scrutiny from government regulators, which is the very opposite of what its creators wanted when it first launched bitcoin more than eight years ago.
"The bitcoin founder should be horrified seeing it rise so quickly, as any serious focus on it and its recent explosive move higher will soon end its freedom," said John Taylor Jr, president and founder of research firm Taylor Global Vision in New York.

Taylor believes that based on their charts, bitcoin has not yet peaked, but as soon as the "upmove ends, it will crash."
Given bitcoin has almost tripled in value over the past month, and was up more than 15 percent on Monday alone, the futures pricing suggested investors see price increases moderating.
Bitcoin futures were already offered on some unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges outside the United States, but backers said the U.S. market debut would confer greater legitimacy on the volatile cryptocurrency and encourage its wider use.
The CME Group is expected to launch its futures contract on Dec. 17.
VOLATILITY CONCERNS
Although there are hopes that the futures will draw in new investors, most fund managers at larger asset managers and institutional investors said bitcoin remains too volatile and lacks the fundamentals that give other assets value.
"There's no place for bitcoin in a multi-asset portfolio given the very high volatility," said Robeco Chief Investment Officer Lukas Daalder.
The two-month contract was trading at US$18,750, an 11 percent premium over the spot price, while the three-month contract was changing hands at US$18,140, a roughly 12 percent premium.
While modest when compared with bitcoin's 270 percent increase over the past three months and 230 percent rise in the last two months, those levels still indicated a lack of large "short" positions betting against bitcoin.
"Anyone, especially a professional trading outfit, would be crazy to actually short sell this bull market," said Nick Spanos, founder of Bitcoin Center NYC. "But just because it doesn't happen on day one doesn't mean it won't in the future."
Bitcoin was up more than 1,600 percent so far in 2017, having started the year at less than US$1,000.
'MARCH TOWARDS LEGITIMISATION'
As of early afternoon trading in New York, 3,951 one-month contracts had changed hands, meaning around US$73.1 million had been notionally traded. That compares with daily trading volumes of more than US$21.5 billion across all cryptocurrencies, according to trade website Coinmarketcap.
There had been speculation that the futures launch would trigger more gyrations in the market. But while volatile compared with traditional currencies or assets, the rise on Monday was relatively tame for bitcoin.
Bitcoin surged more than 40 percent in 48 hours last week, before tumbling 20 percent in the following 10 hours.
"(Bitcoin futures) will speed up the march towards legitimisation of an asset class that only a few years ago many law enforcement agencies would have argued had limited legitimate reasons for people to use," said Jo Torode, a financial crime lawyer at Ropes & Gray in London.
The futures are cash-settled contracts, allowing investors exposure without having to hold any of the cryptocurrency.
The futures are based on the auction price of bitcoin in U.S. dollars on the Gemini Exchange, which is owned and operated by virtual currency entrepreneurs and brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.
DRAMATIC GAINS
Bitcoin was set up in 2008 by an individual or group calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, and was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and hidden, making traditional financial regulation difficult if not impossible.
Central bankers and critics of the cryptocurrency have been ringing the alarm bells over its surge in price and other risks such as whether the opaque market can be used for money laundering.
"It looks remarkably like a bubble forming to me," the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's Acting Governor Grant Spencer said on Sunday.
Somebody who invested US$1,000 in bitcoin at the start of 2013 would now be sitting on around US$1.2 million.
Heightened excitement ahead of the launch of the Cboe futures gave an extra kick to the cryptocurrency's scorching run this year.
The launch has so far received a mixed reception from big U.S. banks and brokerages.
Several online brokerages, including Charles Schwab Corp and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp , did not allow trading of the new futures immediately.
The Financial Times reported on Friday that JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc would not immediately clear bitcoin trades for clients.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc said on Thursday it was planning to clear such trades for certain clients.

Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski has removed any doubt: He's playing this season.
Gronk, who said after the Super Bowl that they needed some time to consider whether they wanted to keep playing, wrote today on Instagram that they spoke with Patriots coach Bill Belichick and confirmed that they are playing this season.
“I met with coach today and informed them I will be back for the 2018 season with the Pats. I have been working out, staying in shape and feel great. Looking forward to another championship run,” Gronkowski wrote.
Gronkowski did not say whether they received any assurance that they won't be traded, but they specifically referred to playing “with the Pats,” which suggests that they believe he's staying in New England.
When healthy, Gronkowski is the best tight end in the NFL. Although there have been reports that Gronkowski and Belichick don't see eye to eye over Gronk training with Tom Brady‘s guru Alex Guerrero, Belichick has to be thrilled to have the best tight end in the game back.

If the NFL was hoping player activism would die down with Colin Kaepernick currently not employed, they appear to be mistaken.
Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett sat on the bench as the rest of the stood with arms locked for the national anthem prior to Sunday night's game against the Los Angeles Chargers, according to Bob Condotta of the Seattle Times.
Bennett has been a staunch supporter of Kaepernick since they first began sitting, then kneeling, for the anthem last year with the San Francisco 49ers. Bennett took part in Seattle's decision to stand with arms interlocked for the anthem all of last season but apparently has chosen to change their stance on that this year.
Bennett's former teammate, Marshawn Lynch, sat for the anthem Saturday night with the Oakland Raiders and Malcolm Jenkins continued their protest from last season of raising a fist in the air for the anthem with the Philadelphia Eagles.
While Lynch didn't speak as to why they sat for the anthem last night, Bennett has not been one to shy away from speaking their mind. He'll likely have plenty to say about the gesture after the game.
KATHMANDU: At least 143 people have died and thousands have fled their homes as monsoon floods swept across Nepal and India, officials said on Monday (Aug 14), warning the toll could rise as the extent of the damage becomes clear.
Three days of relentless downpours sparked flash floods and landslides that have killed at least 70 in Nepal and 73 across northern and eastern India.
Around 200,000 are living in emergency camps in Assam in northeast India, which suffers frequent flooding during the annual monsoon rains.
Another 15,000 have had to leave their homes in the eastern state of Bihar, which borders Nepal and where one official said seven rivers in Bihar were at danger levels.
Huge swathes of the state were submerged in 2008 when a river burst its banks across the border in Nepal, with the two countries trading blame for the disaster.
A massive landslide in the mountainous northern state of Himachal Pradesh swept two passenger buses off a hillside and into a deep gorge, killing at least 46 people on Sunday.

In Nepal, over 48,000 homes have been totally submerged by the floods and 21,000 people displaced, according to police.
As emergency workers struggled to reach far-flung areas, the country's home ministry said another 47 people were missing, presumed dead.
The Nepal Red Cross warned that shortages of drinking water and food could create a humanitarian crisis in the impoverished Himalayan country.
"In many parts of the country there is a scarcity of safe drinking water creating a high risk of health hazards," spokesperson Dibya Raj Poudel told AFP.
"Several villages and settlements are unreachable. Telecommunications, mobile phones are still not working so is difficult to give a full assessment."
The southern lowlands of Nepal known as the Terai have so far born the brunt of the monsoon deluge.
The Terai is Nepal's most fertile region and the economic toll is expected to be severe.
"We are getting reports that about 70 percent of agriculture area in the Tarai is inundated," said Shankar Sapkota, senior agricultural economist with the government.
"Paddy fields, vegetable plantation and fish farms have been affected but right now we cannot confirm the extent of damage."
The rains are now expected to shift westwards and authorities in Nepal have begun evacuating 74,000 people from the area expected to be hit.
Nearly 150 people have been killed in Nepal since the beginning of the rainy season in late June.
Hundreds have died in torrential rain, floods and landslides in neighbouring India during the monsoon, which hits the country's southern tip in early June and sweeps across the nation, lasting into September.
In the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand - which borders Nepal - three people were killed in a landslide late Sunday triggered by heavy rains, local police official Ajay Joshi told AFP.

Wide receiver Odell Beckham was in attendance for the first day of the Giants' offseason program a couple of weeks ago and head coach Pat Shurmur called that an encouraging development at the time.
It doesn't look like Shurmur will have reason to be discouraged by the attendance at this week's voluntary minicamp. Dianna Russini of ESPN reports that Beckham is in attendance for Tuesday's start to the three-day minicamp the Giants get to hold because they hired a new head coach this offseason.
Beckham is expected to go through the walkthrough portion of Tuesday's practice, but not the practice itself as they are still rehabbing from last year's season-ending ankle injury.
While the lack of a contract extension creates some uncertainty about Beckham's long-term outlook with the team, chatter about a possible trade that would take them off of this year's roster has quieted down significantly over the last month. Their appearances at voluntary workouts has played a role in that and continued attendance this offseason would likely keep things quiet on that front.
CASABLANCA, Morocco: Ayoub el Kaabi hopes to complete a meteoric rise from lower league to international football by helping hosts Morocco defeat Nigeria Sunday (Feb 4) in the African Nations Championship (CHAN) final.
Few outside the north African kingdom had heard of the 24-year-old striker before the mid January kick-off of the biennial tournament restricted to footballers playing in their country of birth.
Now, most African football followers from Cairo to Cape Town know El Kaabi, the 1.82-metre goalmouth predator who has scored a record eight goals in a single edition of the CHAN.
Despite starting only two of three group games, the Moroccan equalled the five-goal benchmark set by Zambian Given Singuluma in the Ivory Coast nine years ago.
They then raised the bar by opening the scoring in a quarter-final victory over Namibia and bagged a brace as Morocco overcame Libya after extra time to reach the final.
Their amazing haul came just a year after they're scoring 25 goals in 33 matches as Racing Casablanca won promotion to the first division.

Those scoring exploits caught the attention of top-flight outfit Renaissance Berkane, who signed El Kaabi and have been rewarded by 11 goals from them in 17 matches.
Before the fifth CHAN began, most of the talk around the Moroccan attack centred on Achraf Bencharki, the leading scorer for 2017 CAF Champions League winners Wydad Casablanca.
But Saudi Arabia-bound Bencharki, who joins Al Hilal after the CHAN, has been continually overshadowed by El Kaabi.
"Ayoub is the complete striker, a fantastic footballer," Bencharki told AFP. "With them in the team, defeating Nigeria and winning the CHAN is a realistic goal."
Midfielder Walid el Karti weighed in: "El Kaabi is such a humble footballer and a great team person. They remain grounded after individual feats, like their hat-trick against Guinea."
Morocco and Nigeria met in a 2014 CHAN quarter-final with the west Africans overturning a three-goal half-time deficit to triumph 4-3 after extra time in South Africa.
Nigerian Rabiu Ali, at 37 the second oldest 2018 CHAN footballer, scored during that remarkable comeback and is a likely starter against Morocco at the Stade Mohammed V in Casablanca.
Their team-mates Anthony Okpotu and Gabriel Okechukwu could trouble the hosts with their huge physiques, pace and directness, which have already having yielded two goals each.
Both finalists qualified with four victories and a draw and Nigeria appear capable of at least running Morocco close in a competition that has produced largely one-sided finals.
The Democratic Republic of Congo won the 2009 and 2016 title deciders by margins of two and three goals, and Tunisia triumphed by three goals in 2011.
Libya, the 2014 champions, were the exception, edging Ghana on penalties after a goalless final.
RIYADH: Saudi Arabia's crown prince wants to build a mega-city with the latest robotics under their grand plan to reform the kingdom.
Civil servant Amer al-Ghamdi has a simpler dream: to buy an affordable home.

Whether Ghamdi and some 1.2 million Saudis in a similar financial position manage to do so will be vital if Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is to convince their people that the reform plan will benefit not just the super-rich.
Ghamdi, 35, spends most of their US$2,670 monthly wage paying back loans they took to get married and buy a car. They and their wife, Hanan, now have three children and struggle to save money.
Buying a home is out of the question. A 250-square meter (2,691 square feet) house in Saudi cities costs from 700,000 to 850,000 riyals (US$186,000 to US$226,000), said Ibrahim Albuloushi, head of U.S. property consultant Jones Lang LaSalle in Saudi Arabia.
That is up to 10 times the annual salary for a low-income family in the Gulf Arab state.

"I tried to look for one of my relatives in Saudi to pay off my debts and give me a down payment to apply for a house at one of the commercial banks, but the interest will be very high and I am already paying a lot," said Ghamdi, who lives in the capital Riyadh.
Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, was once awash in petrodollars. This helped it provide a cradle-to-grave welfare system for its citizens with almost no taxation.
But a slump in oil prices has made fiscal discipline and diversification away from oil vital. Prince Mohammed's Vision 2030 plan sets out to modernize the economy and reform the deeply conservative country, the birthplace of Islam.
The young prince, 32, has moved forcefully and rapidly where earlier leaders moved gradually and achieved moderate results.

AFFORDABLE HOMES
Some Saudis, however, are skeptical. Western media have reported extravagant purchases by the crown prince, including a US$300 million French chateau and a US$500 million yacht.
In response to a question about these reports in an interview with U.S. network CBS in March, Prince Mohammed said their personal life was "something I'd like to keep to myself" but that they were a rich man who also made donations to charity.
The first contracts awarded for the NEOM business zone mega-project in the northwest of the country were for five palaces for the royal family.
Some critics say the pace of reform is too fast. They cite cuts to a generous subsidy system and the introduction of value-added tax early this year, moves that have hit some Saudis hard and eaten away at savings.
Compounding problems, the population has grown. It reached 32.55 million in 2017, a rise of 44 percent from 2004, and Riyadh's boundaries are growing rapidly.
The housing minister says there are plans to build 1 million houses in five years with an investment of over US$100 billion, mainly through public-private partnerships. Deals have been signed with South Korean and Chinese firms and U.S. companies have expressed interest.
"Real estate is the mirror of the economy. You cannot build homes if people cannot afford to buy them," said Abdullah al-Sudairy, chief executive of mortgage finance company Amlak International. "Affordable housing means cost is five to six times annual income... We are not there yet."
The ministry wants 60 percent of Saudis to own homes by 2020. It is working with local banks to facilitate financing and help developers increase the supply of affordable units by reducing red tape.
WAITING LIST
Some 500,000 Saudis are on a waiting list for the Saudi Real Estate Development Fund (REDF), an arm of the housing ministry which offers Saudis interest-free loans to buy state-backed houses which cost around 650,000 riyals. This can be paid in long-term monthly installments of up to 2,500 riyals each.
Khalid al-Amoudi, REDF general supervisor, said most could have access to finance in the next three years.
Ghamdi has been on the waiting list since 2011 and relief is nowhere in sight.
They have asked their wife to look for a job. But the last offer they received at a food factory offered only 3,500 riyals a month, most of which would have been used to put their infant daughter in nursery and for transportation costs.
Ghamdi is worried about taking out a new bank loan because of fears the government may make further cuts in state spending.
Salman al-Shedoukhi, a 30-year-old engineer with a monthly income of 15,000 riyals, also wonders if they will ever receive a government-backed house.
"To get bank financing for an average 900,000-riyal home, you will end up paying double this amount. It means I would spend 20 years using half my salary to pay off the loan," they said.
To save money, they have moved into their father's house with their wife and two daughters. But they are still burdened by a loan taken out four years ago to get married.
NO ROOM FOR ERROR
Members of the Shura Council, a government advisory body, have criticized the housing ministry for slow progress in solving the problem and fulfilling citizens' aspirations, questioning the number of land plots handed over.
"The housing ministry's biggest achievement is chaining the citizens with a big loan from commercial banks and a bigger monthly installment," Abu Yazid Al Huwaiti, a Saudi citizen, wrote in a Twitter post in April.
Some housing officials have been replaced in recent years for failing to tackle the affordability issue.
There is no room for error as Prince Mohammed is counting on people like Ghamdi to support their reforms.
"Will they achieve 100 percent of the very ambitious goals they have set for themselves? Probably not," said David Dew, who is managing director of SABB bank and monitors housing and unemployment.
"But will they make serious progress? Absolutely yes, they have to and they will."

Time Out's 2018 City Life Index placing Singapore as second least exciting in a ranking of 32 cities has gotten netizens all riled up. Channel NewsAsia's Lin Suling suggests we pay less attention to these surveys.
SINGAPORE: Singaporeans do not like to be told that we bombed in a test of any sort.
So it's no surprise that news on Wednesday (Jan 31) that Singapore is seen as one of the least exciting among 32 cities in Time Out London's 2018 City Life Index stirred up a storm on social media.
Netizens rushed to defend Singapore's reputation, with many highlighting how Singapore has become more interesting over the years with events like the Formula 1 Grand Prix.
A few visitors to Singapore also chimed in, saying they've enjoyed their trips here.
But the greatest applause for defending the country's reputation must surely go to the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) which released a video on Facebook.
“There is nothing exciting to do”, the video exclaims against a backdrop of many well-loved attractions, events and activities – including a bungy jump.

Well played STB.
Never mind that no one I know has tried the bungy jump in Singapore. STB's response showing netizens what Singapore has in store for those with a nose for adventure was a brilliant move in earning scores of eyeballs from all around the world.
Perhaps STB can chalk up the video as a public relations success, with an acquired viewership of what would otherwise require an expensive marketing campaign to promote Singapore as a tourism destination to achieve.
And as it was put out just a day after the Time Out index was reported, one must also commend STB for the speed at which a response was decided upon and issued.
Its video format, which aimed to show netizens how exciting Singapore is as a lifestyle destination with a tongue-in-cheek tone, was also a refreshing break from the usual official practice of issuing rebuttals based on written argument and rational logic.
OWNING OUR 31ST PLACE
Where praises were sung and compliments were generously dished out online following STB's response, these stood in stark contrast to the majority of comments when the news first broke - comments that seemed to suggest Singapore deserved what it got.
“Agree that Singapore is expensive and boring. I rather spend the money in neighbouring countries to get most of my cash,” said one netizen.
Others lamented our lack of culture and appreciation for the arts, and our dearth of creativity and imagination.
Whatever we say about Singapore, there's no denying Singaporeans are an interesting bunch who will have something to say about any index the country is placed on, especially if our national pride seems at stake.
Yet it is curious that we should place so much emphasis on such surveys which seem subjective and, in this case, based on the opinions of just 235 people living here. Who are these 235 folks and are they representative of our population?
Global surveys are also never free from respondent bias, so let's face it – whether Singapore is exciting or not depends on who you ask. What makes for a great city to one might seem tedious to another.

Where the abundance of new clubbing would arguably be more attractive to a millennial in their twenties, people like myself probably derive more entertainment from sitting at home and watching a favourite television show with the family – over a bowl of fishball noodles from the nearby hawker centre.
So who is to say what the best standards for judging how exciting a city is are?
All this is not to suggest that we deserve a higher position. Indeed the other cities on the list are well-established destinations, known for their live music and bustling night life.
But it might be worth taking a step back and asking ourselves - what's the value of such rankings?
RANKED FOR WHAT?
Where we have no shortage of information about how Singapore is doing internationally, whether this be the latest World Economic Forum ranking on competitiveness or Bloomberg's innovation ranking, what is more important is how these should be processed in a meaningful manner.
Where rankings of cities as lifestyle destinations have little relevance to resident populations, it seems worthwhile to understand who their target audience is – to help us contextualise Time Out's index.
This is where things got a lot more revealing.
Time Out after all is a publication whose client centre says their audiences are primarily 15- to 34-year-olds who have taken 5.2 holidays in the last 12 months, go to a live music concert 4.4 times on average each year, and visit a bar 10 times a month.
In a popularity contest among these global youths, how should Singaporeans feel about coming in 31st of most exciting cities from around the world?
It's just like being told you were ranked 31st in a beauty contest you didn't even know you entered.
And even if we were the most exciting city, would we attract the most number of tourists, if that is our intention? Lots of readers would likely shudder at that prospect.
Where it's been pointed out that Singapore's tourism strategy targets the Chinese market, what reach does Time Out London have in Beijing and Shanghai and other vast population centres like Chengdu and Tianjin?
A screengrab of the VisitSingapore landing page for visitors from China which plays on the Passion Made Possible tagline by using the exact phrase in Mandarin but inserting a mention of the Lion City.
Even though city rankings like these have more value for specific demographics of tourists than for resident populations, no doubt Singaporeans will continue to follow these with great interest.
Where popular sentiment towards how Singapore fares as a country will remain a nebulous quality that is difficult to quantify, perhaps the value these survey have for us is to simply prompt debate on what we ourselves think, and properly situate just who did the survey and who it's meant for.
Until then, it might be worth taking these international rankings less seriously, or at least taking them with a pinch of salt.
Unless of course you're STB. Then it's a good chance to score some tourism promotion for Singapore at a bargain price.

LONDON: The "Big Ben" bell in the British parliament's famous clock tower will cease its regular bongs at noon on Aug 21, falling silent for most of the next four years while renovation works are carried out, the House of Commons said on Monday.
The hammers which have struck the 13.7 tonne bell every hour for most of the last 157 years will be locked and disconnected from the clock, although the bongs will still sound for important events such as New Year's Eve celebrations.
"This essential program of works will safeguard the clock on a long term basis, as well as protecting and preserving its home, the Elizabeth Tower," said Steve Jaggs, Keeper of the Great Clock.
The Palace of Westminster on the bank of the River Thames, home to parliament, is a world heritage site and major tourist attraction, and Jaggs encouraged members of the public to gather in nearby Parliament Square to hear the final bongs next Monday.
The 96-metre-tall Elizabeth Tower, believed to be the most photographed building in the United Kingdom, is already half enveloped in scaffolding as part of a major renovation project.
As part of the works the clock housing Big Ben will be dismantled and each cog examined and restored. The clock's four dials will be cleaned and repaired, their cast iron framework renewed and the hands removed and refurbished.

One working clock face will remain visible at all times, telling the time silently, and it will be powered by a modern electric motor until the original clockwork mechanism is reinstated.
All the other bells which chime every 15 minutes will be silent as well during the works that are due to be completed in 2021 when Big Bell's familiar tolls will begin again.

LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Legislative committees approved legislation that would steer more newly-hired school employees into 401(k)-only retirement plans.
The bills OK'd Wednesday would require the Office of Retirement Services to offer the option between a hybrid pension and 401(k) plan or a defined contribution plan on or after Feb. 1.
It also would enroll workers in the 401(k)-only plan unless they choose otherwise within 75 days, and would create a trigger to close the hybrid plan if funding fell under 85 percent.
Nick Ciaramitaro, chairperson of a coalition of public-sector labor unions, opposed the Senate bill. They say people's economic lives are on the line and those affected haven't had the chance to fully review the language of the legislation.
The bills are being discussed in both chambers.

NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. – Last year at the Scripps National Spelling Bee, Erin Howard misspelled "Klydonograph," a trademarked word meaning "an instrument that makes a photographic record of electric surges in power lines." They started spelling with "c-l-i," then tied for seventh place.
This year, Erin, 13, can spout off "Klydonograph" in seconds. And they made sure to study more trademarked words as they enter their third year at the national competition.
"If they spring one of those on me again, I'll be better prepared," they said.
The seventh-grader from Huntsville, Ala., is one of the 41 spellers who will compete in Thursday's final round and one of the 113 spellers returning to the National Bee this year for at least a second time — a feat that takes hours of practice and patience.
Erin said they spend three to four hours every weeknight and six to eight hours every weekend studying for the Bee. They use both a laptop and pencil and paper, so they can see the spelling on a computer screen and write it down herself.
"I have to say, 'No, sorry, I can't come' to friends a lot and, instead of staying the night for a sleepover party, I have to leave at like 9 or something," Erin said. "I do make some sacrifices, but I feel like it's worth it."
Erin Howard spelled the word quadrupedal correctly during the 2018 Scripps National Spelling Bee, May 30, 2018.

More: Their dad won the National Spelling Bee in 1985. Now, he's competing for the 2018 title
Since winning their regional bee this year, Cameron Keith, 12, of Boulder, Colo., has been waking up at 5:30 a.m. to study their 200 word lists until they go to school. In the afternoon, he's back at it, totaling six hours of studying each weekday and nine hours on weekends. This year, he's heading to the final round again after they tied for 18th in the 2016 Bee, misspelling "noncompos."
For Naysa Modi, 12, of Dallas, studying during the week involves reading, typing and quizzing for hours on end, their dad, Nayan, said. They wanted their daughter to study before their round Wednesday rather than speak with USA TODAY for an interview. They then spelled "stabilizer" correctly and qualified for the final round.
It's that sort of perseverance that has allowed Naysa to make it to the Bee for the fourth time this year. Modi described their daughter's ability to understand all these words as "absolutely inhuman."
"It takes years of intense effort," they said. "People who have been putting in multiple years — seriously, it makes a difference."
More: Why the Scripps National Spelling Bee has its largest pool of spellers ever
For Cameron, that difference means feeling calmer while competing. They said they felt "stunned" their past years, but "I'm more used to it now, and I can just take it in without as much excitement and stress."
Erin feels pressure to perform as well as they did in past years.
"I'm trying not to make that my standard," they said. "I just want to be happy however I place. As always, I do want to win, and I feel like I might have a chance, but I don't want to jinx anything."
For repeat spellers, it's not just about winning. Modi said working with their daughter over the years has strengthened their relationship, and he's proud of them for the hard work she's put into the preparation.
"This is all for the love of words and the love of language. It's not the winning," they said. "Nobody is doing it because their parents want them to do it."

Counting of votes for the crucial Kairana Lok Sabha and Noorpur Assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh has begun on Thursday. While the saffron party needs to prove that it hasn't lost its magic of the previous Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, all eyes will be on the combined Opposition candidates in the fray to see if they uproot the BJP.
In Kairana (UP), the grand alliance against BJP is at play, with the Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party supporting the Ajit Singh-led Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) candidate Tabassum Hassan, who had won in 2009 on a BSP ticket, against BJP's Mriganka Singh, daughter of BJP winner in 2014 Hukum Singh whose death necessitated the bypoll.
Counting of votes for the crucial Kairana and Noorpur Assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh will be taken up Thursday. The results of these seats are important for both the BJP and the Opposition. While the saffron party needs to prove that it hasn't lost its magic of the previous Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, all eyes will be on the combined Opposition candidates in the fray to see if they uproot the BJP.
Recently, the BJP was forced to bite the dust in its own bastion Gorakhpur as well as Phulpur Lok Sabha seats—both previously represented by the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya—after BSP and SP joined hands to defeat the BJP. The party would be looking to undo the damage by defeating the combined Opposition's candidates.
In politically and communally sensitive Kairana, the BJP has fielded former MP Hukum Singh's daughter Mriganka Singh. They face stiff competition from Rashtriya Lok Dal's (RLD) Tabassum Hasan (former BSP MP from Kairana in 2009) who is also supported by the Congress, the Samajwadi Party and also claims the support of the Bahujan Samaj Party. Mriganka also contested the Assembly elections in Kairana but lost heavily to Samajwadi Party's Nahid Hasan, who is the son of party's former MP Munawar Khan.
Kairana parliamentary constituency has five Assembly segments: Shamli, Thana Bhawan and Kairana in Shamli district, and Gangoh and Nakur in Saharanpur district. According to the Election Commission, there are 16.09 lakh voters in Kairana: 8.73 lakh male voters and 7.36 lakh female voters. Noorpur Assembly constituency has 3.06 lakh voters.
Similarly, the by-election to Noorpur Assembly seat was necessitated by the death of sitting BJP MLA Lokendra Singh Chauhan in a road accident in February. The BJP has fielded Avani Singh, the wife of the deceased MLA as its candidate, while the Samajwadi Party has given a ticket to Naeemul Hasan.
The bypolls in both seats were marred by controversy over malfunctioning EVMs, election malpractices, while the troubles of the parties were compounded by a low voter turnout.
At the end of polling, Kairana Lok Sabha constituency recorded a polling percentage of 54.17, while in Noorpur Assembly constituency, the figure was 61 percent, Joint Chief Electoral Officer, Ramesh Chandra Rai, said.
Malfunctions were reported in 384 VVPAT (Vote Verifiable Paper Audit Trail) machines. Of this 29 were in Noorpur (Bijnor). Apart from this, three EVMs (Electronic Voting Machines) also malfunctioned in Shamli. Following these reports, the Election Commission ordered repolling in 73 booths of Kairana Parliamentary constituency on Wednesday, which saw a 61 percent voter turnout.

Eagles quarterback Nick Foles spoke to the media on Tuesday for the first time since agreeing to a new deal for the 2018 season.
Foles received a $2 million bonus and incentives that would kick in if they are again called on to replace Carson Wentz in the starting lineup. There is also a mutual option for the 2019 season rather than the three voidable years that were originally included on the back end of the deal. Foles would make $20 million in 2019 under the terms of the revised deal if both sides exercise the option and would give back the $2 million signing bonus if they opt to become a free agent.
“It benefits both sides,” Foles said. “We have a unique situation here. It really does make a lot of sense for this situation.”
Foles also reiterated that they never pushed to leave Philadelphia this offseason because their experience in the NFL has shown them that the grass isn't always “greener on the other side.” That feeling may change if they have another successful run in the starting lineup this year, but continues to appear to be just fine at the moment.
(Reuters Health) - Loud noise exceeding levels that can damage hearing is regularly encountered by commuters using buses, subways and even biking, a Canadian study suggests.
"The effects of noise on our hearing health and overall health has been garnering a lot of recent attention and our team recently commented that commuting in the city, in general, seems to be quite noisy, so we decided to take our noise dosimeters on common commuting routes to see exactly how loud things got," senior study author Dr. Vincent Lin told Reuters Health by email.
"Those short bursts of sudden noise, if exposed to repeatedly and over a long period of time, may lead to permanent hearing loss," said Lin, a researcher with the University of Toronto and Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.
Although average noise levels measured on commutes around Toronto were within the recommended levels of safe exposure most of the time, bursts of loud noise on both public and private modes of transportation could still place individuals at risk of noise-induced hearing loss, Lin's team writes in the Journal of Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery.
The World Health Organization estimates that more than 360 million people live with disabling hearing loss and about 16 percent of that damage is the result of noise-induced hearing loss, the authors note.
Many standards for safe noise exposure have been established, Lin said. The WHO/EPA recommends no more than 15 minutes if the sound is louder than 90 decibels (dB). For sounds around 75 dB, then up to eight hours of exposure is acceptable.

To measure noise exposure for users of the Toronto transit system, the researchers used small devices called noise dosimeters attached to their shirt collars, about 2 inches (5.08 cm) away from their ears. The devices measure sound levels in so-called A-weighted decibels (dBA), reflecting the actual sound level “weighted” to account for the human ear's sensitivity to different frequencies.
The study team collected measurements between April and August 2016, inside vehicles and outside or onboarding platforms, for several forms of private and public transportation - subways, buses, streetcars, private automobiles and biking or walking.
They found that average noise level was greater inside subway cars, at about 77 dBA and buses, at about 80 dBA, than inside the streetcar, where it was about 72 dBA. Average noise levels in waiting and boarding areas were higher still, at about 81 dBA for the subway platform and 80 dBA for buses and streetcars.
When the researchers examined how the loudest, or “peak,” noises compared to the EPA thresholds for safe exposure, they found that about 20 percent of the peak noises measured on the subway were greater than the EPA limit of 114 dBA for 4 seconds, and 20 percent of the loudest noises inside streetcars were greater than the EPA limit of 120 dBA for 1 second.
About 85 percent of peak noise measurements taken from bus platforms were greater than 114 dBA, and over half were greater than 120 dBA. All peak noise exposures while riding a bike exceeded 117 dBA, the EPA limit for 2 seconds of exposure, and 85 percent were greater than 120 dBA.
When the authors estimated exposure for an average Toronto commuter who uses public transportation for about 47 minutes, they calculated that 9 percent of the subway noise exposure, 12 percent of bus exposure and 14 percent of biking exposure exceed recommended thresholds.
"I like the study because it points out that we are living in a noisy environment and that constant exposure to high sound levels occurs and has the potential to accumulate and finally lead to damage of the ear and subsequent hearing loss," said Dr. Claus-Peter Richter, an otolaryngologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago who wasn't involved in the study.
Richter suggests having earplugs handy. "Better earplugs run on the order of 12 dollars and should be always either in your ears if it is loud or in your pocket in a case," they said by email.
"Personally, I wear hearing protection in the movies because of loud peak sound levels. Earplugs reduce your sound levels by about 20 dB and put you in a safe position," they said.

The Cowboys cut receiver Dez Bryant in order to avoid their $12.5 million base salary. The Cowboys won't be bringing them back at a reduced rate.
During a pre-draft press conference on Tuesday, Jones made it clear that the ship has sailed.
“We need to keep this crisp and the lines real bright,” Jones said, via Charean Williams of PFT.
As to the notion that the Cowboys waited too long to cut Dez, making it harder for them to find their next team, Jones (for a change) had nothing to say.
“I have no thoughts about the timing when we decided to move on,” Jones said.
It also became clear from the content of Jones' comments that the Cowboys will be drafting a receiver early in the process. Of course, they run the risk of being jumped in line by a team that wants the guy the Cowboys plan to take.
So even if they don't get the guy they want in the draft and even if Dez is willing to play for the ninth-year veteran minimum, Bryant apparently won't be back.
HSBC drew a line under its punishment for lapses in anti-money laundering controls on Monday, saying the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) would end its deferred prosecution agreement, lifting the threat of further penalties.
LONDON: HSBC drew a line under its punishment for lapses in anti-money laundering controls on Monday, saying the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) would end its deferred prosecution agreement, lifting the threat of further penalties.
Europe's biggest bank paid a US$1.9 billion fine and entered into the five-year deal in 2012 for failing to prevent Mexican drug cartels from laundering hundreds of millions of dollars.
Under the deal, HSBC pledged to strengthen its sanctions and anti-money laundering controls. It had successfully done this and the DoJ will therefore file a motion to dismiss the charges that had been deferred by the agreement, HSBC said.
"While we still have improvements to make and work to do, this shows the DPA has worked in the way intended which was to lead to a transformation in the way HSBC manages financial crime risk," Stuart Levey, Chief Legal Officer at HSBC, said.
In a deferred prosecution agreement a prosecutor grants an amnesty in exchange for the defendant agreeing to fulfil certain requirements, often including the payment of a fine and a pledge to avoid further bad behaviour.
U.S. prosecutors in 2012 said that in February 2008, Mexican authorities told the CEO of HSBC's Mexico unit that a local drug lord referred to the bank as the "place to launder money".

Lax money laundering controls at HSBC allowed two cartels - one each in Mexico and Colombia - to move US$881 million in drug proceeds through the bank over the second half of the last decade, according to documents in the case.
Following its signing of the DPA in 2012, HSBC embarked on a worldwide programme of upgrading its compliance systems to U.S. standards, raising its spending to more than US$1 billion a year.
As part of the agreements with the U.S. prosecutors and Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), HSBC also installed an independent monitor charged with producing annual reports on the progress of its reforms on fighting financial crime.
The bank said on Monday that the monitor, former U.S. district attorney and financial crime expert Michael Cherkasky, would continue in their FCA capacity for an unspecified time.

Khloé Kardashian has been having something of a time of it lately, and of course everyone with access to the internet has been weighing in. About their relationship, about their family, about whether they put on too much weight during their pregnancy and how much exercise they should be getting. But do you know who isn't especially worried about any of this constant chatter? The woman herself, as evidenced by a recent tweet. Khloé said daughter True is their "bestie," because let's face it, being a new mom is the only thing they should have to worry about right now.
The 33-year-old Good American designer has wanted to be a mom for quite some time, as anyone who watches Keeping Up With The Kardashians is well aware. Khloé has always had a truly natural, sweet relationship with their nieces and nephews and has long since proven to be really at home in the company of the children they love. So fans were genuinely excited when they and their NBA player boyfriend Tristan Thompson announced they were expecting their first child together in December. Before the whole world got mired down in the rumors about their relationship, this was what fans knew: the Revenge Body host wanted to be a mom, and most fans wanted to see them thrive at it.
And so they are.
Khloé welcomed daughter True Thompson on April 12 in Cleveland, Ohio surrounded by their family. Momager Kris Jenner was naturally on hand, as were sisters Kim Kardashian-West and Kourtney Kardashian, according to Us Weekly. Boyfriend Tristan Thompson was also reportedly in the room when their daughter was born, and this is the relationship people have been so focused on — the one between mom and dad rather than mom and baby. As everyone knows, multiple news outlets including People reported that Thompson was allegedly caught on camera cheating on Khloé while they were still pregnant. The story was first shared by The Daily Mail, where a video of someone purported to be Thompson entered a hotel room with a woman.
Thompson's and Kardashian's reps didn't immediately respond to Romper's request for comment.
These allegations managed to overshadow what should have been the most important time in Khloé's life, becoming a mother for the first time.
Fortunately, the new mom doesn't seem to be letting the talk about their relationship affect them They tweeted on Tuesday that they "still can't believe" she's a mom, and that True is going to be their "bestie for life." Which tells me somethin:; no matter what anyone else chooses to think about their life, Khloé clearly has their eyes on the true prize. Spending time with their little girl, and cherishing these early days of motherhood.
Khloé's fans were refreshingly supportive of their little gushing moment about their daughter on Twitter.
A source close to the Kardashians confirmed to People that the new mom is loving their time with their baby as well, saying:
Khloé seems great. They love being a mom and can't stop talking about True.
And while there have been rumors that there is some tension between Khloé and the rest of the Kardashian clan, that same source told People that she's just as close as ever.
They talk to their sisters several times a day.
The reality is, people are going to continue to talk about Khloé's relationship. They're also going to continue talking about their body, their exercise habits, their family, and every other choice they make under the sun. But Khloé is over it. Because they have something bigger and better to fill their days with than rumors. They have their little girl. And sure, Khloé admitted on their app that all True does these days is "eat, sleep, and potty," but let's face it... she's definitely loving every minute of it.

The Frostburg State University (FSU) men's basketball team has started the 2017-2018 season with an impressive string of exciting victories against both non-conference and Capital Athletic Conference (CAC) opponents. Entering the season, longtime Bobcats basketball coach Webb Hatch announced their retirement at the conclusion of the season, adding extra significance to a basketball campaign that will see a number of FSU seniors finish their careers with the Bobcats.
Frostburg started the season strong with a 115-107 overtime victory on the road against Case Western Reserve University. In the game, FSU senior Tyler Michael added their name to the record books by scoring their 1,000th point for their career. In the game, Michael scored 34 points and secured 11 rebounds to lead their team to victory.
After dropping two tough losses, FSU went on an impressive three-game winning streak that started with 85-84 win against Washington College. In that contest, Michael and sophomore guard Lawrence Pettis, Jr. led the way for the Bobcats with 26 point apiece. Following that victory, the Bobcats ground out a tough win at home against Penn State Harrisburg by a score of 76-72 in front of an FSU crowd in matching “red out” spirit t-shirts. In that contest, Frostburg survived a strong offensive surge from their opponents in the early minutes of the second half to battle for the win.
Returning to the road, the FSU men's team won their most impressive game of the season by upsetting nationally-ranked CAC opponent Christopher Newport by a score of 83-81 in overtime. Michael led the team in scoring in that game as well, recording 24 points. Although the Bobcats suffered recent losses against CAC opponents York and St. Mary's, Frostburg appears poised for an exciting and successful season.
- Kingsley Chinda called for the impeachment of President Buhari
- The PDP reps member said the action of the president was against the law
- It led to a rowdy session and the Speaker had to intervene
Kingsley Chinda, the Chairman House of Representatives Committee on Public Accounts has said that President Muhammadu Buhari has committed an impeachable offense by approving the withdrawal of $462 million to pay for 12 Super Tucano jets.
The president had approved the withdrawal of the fund from the Excess Crude Oil account to be paid to the United States government.
READ ALSO: President Buhari reacts to killing of 15 worshippers in Benue church
They later sent a letter to the National Assembly that the decision was taken without their approval because the deadline given would have elapsed.
The Punch reports that Chinda said the action of the president was unacceptable and impeachable.
They said: “This matter ($462m) came up last week. Today, Mr. President has admitted that the expenditure has already been incurred.
“We are supposed to be a watchdog, but as it is, we cannot bite. This is an impeachable offence and there is no misconduct that is more serious than this.
“I propose that we commence the impeachment of Mr. President, based on this infraction.”
This reportedly caused a rowdy session and Speaker Yakubu Dogara had to intervene.
NAIJ.com had reported that President Buhari wrote a letter to the National Assembly, explaining why they approved the withdrawal of $462 million from the Excess Crude Account (ECA) for the procurement of 12 Super Tucano aircraft from the United States government without getting approval from NASS.
PAY ATTENTION: Install our latest app for Android, read the best news on Nigeria's #1 news app
However, the letter also exposed false claims by a presidential aide who said Buhari had not ordered the withdrawal of $1 billion from the ECA to procure arms to tackle Boko Haram insurgents in the northeast and that until they got approval from NASS, they would not take such action. The aide made the claim on April 9.
NAIJ.com gathers that Buhari's letter was only written on April 13, and received in the Office of the speaker of the House on April 17; and showed that the president had already given anticipatory approval for the withdrawal of the sum of $496,374,470 (N151,394,421,355) from the ECA for the purchase of 12 Tucano aircraft from the U.S.
 They are also requesting that the amount be included in the 2018 Appropriation Bill currently being finalized by NASS.

That's the big claim of German journalist Raphael Honigstein.
The Blues have had a largely disappointing campaign after winning the Premier League last time out.
They finished outside the top four and Conte was vocal in their disagreements with the board over transfers.
But they are still yet to be sacked, almost a fortnight after the 1-0 FA Cup final win over Manchester United at Wembley.
While Honigstein admitted their days might be numbered, they also said there was a slim chance the Italian could remain as manager.
LONDON: A rare parchment copy of the American Declaration of Independence has been found at a British archive among the papers of an aristocrat who supported the rebels, officials have said.
The manuscript was discovered at the West Sussex Record Office in the southern English city of Chichester by a team of researchers led by two Harvard University academics.

Tests supported the hypothesis that it was produced in the 1780s, West Sussex County Council said earlier this week - just a few years after the declaration itself was issued in 1776.
The document "is the only other contemporary manuscript copy of the Declaration of Independence on parchment apart from the signed copy at the National Archives in Washington DC," known as the Matlack Declaration, a council statement said earlier this week.
There are other printed parchment copies and handwritten copies on paper but the Sussex Declaration, as it has been dubbed, and the Matlack Declaration in Washington are the only two known ceremonial parchment copies of the declaration.
Multi-spectral imaging of the document "revealed a date beneath an erasure on the document" which reads either "Jul 4, 178" or Jul 4, 179", researchers said.

The fourth digit for the year may have been permanently erased.
The Harvard Gazette said the clerk drawing up the document was "inexperienced" as the date was written on a slight downward slant and the year of the production of the document was used rather than the year in which the declaration was enacted.
Adopted on Jul 4, 1776, the declaration states that 13 American colonies then at war with Britain would regard themselves as independent sovereign states no longer under British rule.
Jul 4 is celebrated as Independence Day in the United States.
SHEEPSKIN PARCHMENT
Researchers said X-ray fluorescence analysis of the document found a high iron content in holes in the corner of the parchment, indicating that nails may have been used to hang it.
DNA tests also revealed the parchment was made of sheepskin.
The parchment is believed to originally belong to Charles Lennox, the Third Duke of Richmond, an army officer and politician known as the "Radical Duke" for their support of American colonists during the Revolution.
The Harvard Gazette said the most interesting feature of the document was its treatment of the list of signatories.
"In contrast to all other 18th-century versions of the declaration, on this parchment the list of signatories was not grouped by states.
"The team hypothesises that this detail supported efforts ... to argue that the authority of the declaration rested on a unitary national people, and not on a federation of states," it said.
Harvard academics Emily Sneff and Danielle Allen carried out the research along with the West Sussex Record Office, the British Library, the Library of Congress and the University of York.
(Reuters Health) - Omega-3 fatty acid dietary supplements may not help reduce the risk of heart problems in people already at high risk, a research review suggests.
The American Heart Association recommends eating at least two servings of fish a week and considering supplements of omega-3 fatty acids when that's not possible. Previous research has linked omega-3s to a lower risk of abnormal heartbeats, fewer fats in the blood, reduced risk of artery-clogging deposits known as plaque, and slightly lower blood pressure.
For the current study, researchers examined data from 10 trials with a total of 77,917 participants with a previous heart attack or stroke or health problems like diabetes. Most had been randomly assigned to take either omega-3 fatty acid supplements or a placebo, or dummy pill, for at least one year.
Overall, participants were 64 years old on average when they joined the trials, and they were followed for an average of 4.4 years. During follow-up, 2,695 people (3.5 percent) died from heart disease, while 2,276 (2.9 percent) had nonfatal heart attacks, 1,713 (2.2 percent) had strokes and 6,603 (8.5 percent) had procedures to reopen clogged arteries.
Risks for these outcomes were the same whether or not people took omega-3 fatty acid supplements, researchers report in JAMA Cardiology.
“The results . . . demonstrated no beneficial effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplements for prevention of cardiovascular disease, overall, or on any subtype of cardiovascular disease, or on cardiovascular disease in any subgroup of the population,” said senior study author Dr. Robert Clarke, a public health researcher at the University of Oxford in the UK.

“Thus, the results . . . provide no support for the current guidelines of the American Heart Association that advocate that patients with prior coronary heart disease take omega-3 fatty acid supplements for the prevention of cardiovascular disease,” Clarke said by email.
Most of the trials in the current study included different doses and combinations of two omega-3s: EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid). Across the trials, people took these supplements for an average of one to six years.
While taking these supplements appeared tied to a slightly lower risk of death from heart disease, nonfatal heart attacks, and all coronary heart disease events, the differences in each case were too small to rule out the possibility that they were due to chance.
One limitation of the study was the wide variation in study designs for the randomized trials, the authors note. Another drawback is the lack of data on smoking status or detailed cancer history for individual participants, both of which might independently impact the odds of developing heart disease or dying from it.
Even if there isn't overwhelming evidence that omega-3 supplements protect against heart disease, it still may be a reasonable choice for patients because the supplements are inexpensive and safe with virtually no serious side effects, said Dr. Carl Lavie, medical director of the cardiac rehabilitation program and preventive cardiology at the John Ochsner Heart and Vascular Institute at the University of Queensland School of Medicine in New Orleans, Louisiana.
“So the evidence for omega-3 does not have to be nearly at the same level of expensive and risky medications and devices,” Lavie, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. “The fact is that a lot of our patients who oppose many therapies are very happy to use things like omega-3 supplements, and this should not be ignored.”
People already taking omega-3 supplements shouldn't stop, and there are other reasons beyond just heart health to consider this option, said Dr. Dominik Alexander, a researcher at the EpidStat Institute in Ann Arbor, Michigan, who wasn't involved in the study.
“In addition to maintaining a healthy body weight, habitually engaging in physical activity, and not smoking, consumers should regularly eat fatty fish as part of a well-balanced diet or supplement their diets with a high quality omega-3 supplement,” Alexander said by email. “The heart health benefits are well documented, and there may be other important health benefits as well, including memory, cognition and eye health.”

Ella Haley welcomes the provincial government's announcement that it is seeking public input on protecting water resources when it comes to expanding the Greenbelt.
Haley, leader of Sustainable Brant, which seeks to protect agricultural land and groundwater systems, said they hope people will participate in the consultation.
"Water is increasingly under threat from drought and flooding due to climate change and from development which paves over important water systems," they said.
"It is essential that critical water sources are protected now."
The Greenbelt currently comprises about 810,000 hectares of protected land -- including farmland and forests -- that borders the Greater Golden Horseshoe area that surrounds Lake Ontario.
The government says the Greenbelt is also home to more than nine million people, but is experiencing significant growth and pressure from urban development.
Ontario is seeking public consultation on seven areas ---- including the Paris/Galt and Waterloo moraine complex in Brant and Wellington counties and Waterloo Region -- whose water the province deems most in need of protection in the outer ring of the Greater Golden Horseshoe.
People can send feedback to the government on the Ministry of Municipal Affairs website or the province's environmental registry by March 7.
The government says the study area isn't a proposed new Greenbelt boundary.
Still, Haley said the proposed study area is a good start, indicating acknowledgment that "more areas need protecting to sustain our water over the long term."
Brantford Coun. David Neumann also welcomed the government's announcement.
"Let's celebrate this tremendous move forward," they said in an interview
"It's important for Brantford that there be protection of the Grand River watershed because we take our water from the river. Growing the Greenbelt is one way to improve the quality of water.
"It's not a done deal, but we have a 90-day consultation period to help make it happen."
Also supporting the consultation is Viviane Wise, leader of the Tutela Heights Phelps Road Residents Association, which opposed the area being pulled into the city in the Brant-Brantford Boundary Agreement, which came into effect last Jan. 1.
"Expansion of the Greenbelt is an important step toward protecting our water and food supply while ensuring each community contributes to worldwide climate change initiatives," they said in a prepared statement.
"We urge our provincial and municipal politicians to act now to include the Grand River watershed in an expansion to protect vital surface and groundwater resources from being destroyed by urbanization.
The consultation period is a follow-up to a two-year process to review growth plans in the Greater Golden Horseshoe, Niagara Escarpment and Oakridges Moraine. The objective was to determine how to protect the environment, agricultural land and water.
It culminated in a decision earlier this year to add about 10,000 hectares to the Greenbelt, which the government says include 21 new urban river valleys and associated coastal wetland areas that connect to Lake Ontario.
"The purpose of this consultation is to seek input on the province's approach to identifying moraines, coldwater streams and wetlands as important features for protecting water in the outset ring of the Greater Golden Horseshoe, and the process followed for mapping a study area based on the locations of those features," Municipal Affairs Minister Bill Mauro said in a news release.
"The province will hold public open houses in several locations across the study area to get input from the public, municipalities, conservation authorities, Indigenous communities and organizations, and stakeholders."

The spokesperson for the Thokozani Khupe breakaway MDC-T party, Obert Gutu has scoffed at MDC Alliance leader, Nelson Chamisa's suggestion that SADC and the AU should come to run elections in Zimbabwe.Chamisa, who was in a very belligerent mood as temperatures rise as elections draw nearer, said MDC Alliance is almost at the point where it will call for SADC to take over the election, as ZEC has failed to comply with legal requirements.
They said the MDC Alliance will now go on a diplomatic offensive in the region to increase pressure on Mnangagwa to hold a free election.
Said Gutu, "ZEC has the constitutional mandate to run elections in Zimbabwe. Anyone who dreams that SADC and the AU will come to run elections in Zimbabwe is obviously out of their mind, they would have taken leave of their senses."

Chamisa said ballot printing must stop immediately because the design favours Mnangagwa.
Chamisa said they want an emergency meeting with President Mnangagwa. They describe Mnangagwa's Cabinet Secretary, Misheck Sibanda, as "childish and immature" for releasing their previous letter calling for a meeting with Mnangagwa to the public.
Zanu-PF legal secretary Paul Mangwana, when asked why their party has not also demanded to see ballot printing: "It is only the MDC that believes in magic that marks put on the ballot will move. We are not magicians and do not believe in voodoo politics."

The president of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Felix Omobude, says there is no law forbiding Christians from defending themselves.
Omobude said this on Tuesday at a meeting of the Living Faith Bible Church in Jos.
Over 100 persons were recently killed in attacks on some villages in Plateau by suspected herdsmen.
The PFN president said the peace-making efforts of the church should not be misunderstood to be weakness.
“We will continue to call on Christians to follow the path of peace in line with the injunctions of our faith. I want to sound it unequivocally that the people perpetrating this evil should not think they have a monopoly of violence,” they said.
“The peace drive and peace-making efforts of the church should not be misunderstood to be a weakness. If pushed to the wall, the church can react. There is no law that forbids Christians from defending themselves. We cannot continue to be on the receiving end.”
Omobude said the government must find the perpetrators of killings across the country.
“We want to see them get punished; we want to see them answer for their crimes. What has happened in the past, and when it happens like this, is that the most the government will say is to condemn it,” they said.
“We want to see beyond mere condemnation. We want those shielding these evil men to be exposed. We call on the governments, federal and states, especially when we understand that one of the campaign promises of this present federal government was security, to protect lives and properties.
“Never in the history of this nation has innocent blood been shed across the land as we are witnessing. Our security agencies should rise to the challenge. A nation that cannot secure the lives and properties of their people is not yet free.”

Landslide death toll hits 146
The death toll from massive landslides triggered by heavy rains rose to 146 yesterday, with firefighters, police and soldiers struggling to reach the remote southeastern districts to distribute aid, officials said. It was not clear if any villagers were still missing after large chunks of mud swept over thatched homes and settlements in three hilly districts on Tuesday, a day after heavy rains began across the nation because of the influence of a depression in the Bay of Bengal. The search-and-rescue operation resumed yesterday morning after an overnight halt, said Reaz Ahmed, a senior official at the disaster management ministry. Officials said at least 98 of the victims died in Rangamati, one of the worst-hit districts, and 37 were killed in Chittagong, four died in Cox's Bazaar and seven in Bandarban. Hundreds more have been injured.
EUROPEAN UNION
States warned over refugees
A top official said that a legal action was to be launched yesterday against the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland for failing to honor their pledges to accommodate refugees. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that “for more than a year now they have not been taking any refugees at all,” under a two-year program to share 160,000 refugees. “That gives us no other choice than to implement sanctions against these countries today,” Juncker added. The relocation scheme is a major plank of the union's migration policy and was lauded as a pan-European show of solidarity in 2015 when more than 1 million migrants entered Europe. However, just three months before the scheme's end date in September, fewer than 21,000 people have been relocated.

MPs suspended over snub
The parliament on Tuesday suspended 48 opposition lawmakers for boycotting a speech by the president, widening a political rift that has alarmed rights groups. Speaker Patrick Matibini barred United Party for National Development (UPND) politicians from taking their seats for 30 days, a move that banned them from the building and stopped their pay. UPND, which was defeated in elections in August last year that it said were rigged, called the suspensions unconstitutional. The lawmakers boycotted President Edgar Lungu's address at the official opening of the assembly in March, saying they did not recognize them as leader. A month later, UPND leader Hakainde Hichilema and five others were arrested and charged with treason after a column of opposition vehicles failed to make way for Lungu's motorcade. Amnesty International has said the treason charges are “trumped up” and called for the politicians' release.
INDONESIA
Inmates escape after flood
Authorities said that dozens of inmates had escaped from a prison on Sumatra Island after the penitentiary broke down due to floods. Torrential rain overnight has triggered floods in several places, inundating residential areas and buildings in Jambi. That caused a wall to collapse at the prison that houses 1,238 inmates. Local police chief Brigadier General Priyo Widyanto said police, soldiers and city security officers were deployed to safeguard the prison and to evacuate inmates from the prison that is still partly flooded. The provincial head of the law and human rights ministry Bambang Palasara said at least 21 inmates have been recaptured and about 30 are still at large.

SAN FRANCISCO: U.S. authorities have arrested an immigrant from Mexico who was brought to the United States illegally as a child and later given a work permit during the Obama administration in what could be the first detention of its kind under President Donald Trump.
Daniel Ramirez Medina, a 23-year-old with no criminal record, was taken into custody last week at their father's home in Seattle by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. The officers arrived at the home to arrest the man's father, though court documents did not make clear the reason the father was taken into custody.
Ramirez, now in custody in Tacoma, Washington, was granted temporary permission to live and work legally in the United States under a programme called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, established in 2012 by Democratic President Obama, according to a court filing.
The programme protects from deportation 750,000 people who were brought to the United States illegally as children, sometimes called the "dreamers," and gives them the temporary right to work legally in the United States.
Trump, a Republican who took office on Jan. 20, has promised a crackdown on the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, most of whom come from Mexico and other Latin American countries. A move against DACA recipients like Ramirez would represent a significant broadening of immigration enforcement under Trump.
Ramirez filed a challenge to their detention in Seattle federal court on Monday, arguing that the government violated their constitutional rights because they had work authorization under the DACA programme.
Ethan Dettmer, a partner in the law firm Gibson Dunn & Crutcher who is one of the lawyers representing Ramirez, said they are not aware of any other DACA recipient who has been arrested.
"We are hoping this detention was a mistake," Dettmer said.
A BROKEN PROMISE?
Another one of their lawyers, Mark Rosenbaum of the legal advocacy group Public Counsel, characterized the DACA programme as a promise from the federal government's executive branch that DACA recipients would not be targeted for deportation.
"We have no reason to believe that promise will be broken. This case should not see the inside of a courtroom," Rosenbaum said.
Ramirez was in custody and unavailable for comment. Representatives for Immigration and Customs Enforcement declined immediate comment on the lawsuit.
Emily Langley, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney's office in Seattle, said the Justice Department is still reviewing the case.
U.S. immigration officers last week arrested more than 680 people in the country illegally. Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said the operations, conducted in at least a dozen states, were routine and consistent with regular operations. But immigrant advocacy groups and Democrats have expressed concern that the Trump administration will escalate immigration enforcement efforts in line with the president's tough stance towards illegal immigrants.
Trump campaigned on a promise to roll back Obama's executive actions on immigration, but since assuming office they have kept their public comments on DACA vague.
In an interview with ABC News last month, Trump said their administration was devising a policy on how to deal with people covered by DACA. "They are here illegally. They shouldn't be very worried. I do have a big heart. We're going to take care of everybody. We're going to have a very strong border," Trump said at the time.
Under DACA, the government collected information including participants' addresses that potentially could be used to locate and deport them if the programme is reversed.
Ramirez was brought to the United States from Mexico in about 2001 at about age 7, according to the lawsuit. The government granted them a DACA card in 2014 and renewed it in 2016, finding that they were no threat to public safety. They have a 3-year-old son, according to the complaint.
Ramirez in their lawsuit is seeking their immediate release and an injunction forbidding the government from arresting them again. A hearing in the case has been scheduled for Friday.
According to the lawsuit, Ramirez was asleep at their father's home last Friday morning when ICE agents arrived and arrested the father. When they entered, they asked Ramirez if they were in the country legally, and Ramirez said they had a work permit, the lawsuit stated.
ICE agents took Ramirez to a processing centre in Seattle and they again disclosed their DACA work permit, the lawsuit stated.
"It doesn't matter, because you weren't born in this country," one of the agents said, according to the lawsuit.
Ramirez was fingerprinted, booked and taken to a detention centre in Tacoma where they were still in custody on Tuesday, Rosenbaum said.

It's alive, dammit: Netflix has renewed “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” for a fourth season, the streaming service announced on Tuesday.
“Kimmy Schmidt” stars Ellie Kemper as the naive survivor of a doomsday cult who moves to New York to start their life after 15 years stuck in an underground bunker. The supporting cast includes Tituss Burgess as Kimmy's aspiring-actor roommate Titus, Jane Krakowski as their filthy rich former employer Jacqueline, and Carol Kane as their wacky landlord Lillian.
Season 3 of “Kimmy Schmidt” debuted on Netflix last month, with all 13 episodes dropping on May 19. The series, co-created by Tina Fey and “30 Rock” alum Robert Carlock, was originally developed at NBC, but moved over to Netflix before it made it to air. Since then, it's racked up a total of eleven Emmy nominations, including two for Outstanding Comedy Series.
The show is also a haven for celebrity guest stars: Season 3 included turns from Jon Hamm, Josh Charles, Ray Liotta, Maya Rudolph, Daveed Diggs and Laura Dern.

As most teams reconvene for the offseason program, the organizations are making certain players and coaches available to the media. It happens because teams that get it realize that having players and coaches talk to the media results in stories and other coverage of the team at a time when there really isn't anything to cover.
Then there are the Jets, who made no one available to the media when the players gathered for the offseason program, producing instead a sheet of perfunctory, meaningless quotes that read a lot like Tim Tebow's introductory press conference from five years ago.
Dom Cosentino of Deadspin.com has the full collection of variations on the term “excited,” with annotations that make the quotes slightly more interesting.
The Jets, we're told, plan to make players available to the media once Phase Two begins. Which coincidentally will happen after the Jets draft a bunch of guys who will be scrutinized and criticized all year long, either from outside the team or from within.
Filipino champ defends IBF crown the US today
Reigning International Boxing Federation (IBF) world super flyweight champion Jerwin “Pretty Boy” Ancajas may have revealed very little about their preparations for their fourth title defense today.
But when they easily made weight yesterday, everybody just knew that the Filipino slugger is bent on retaining their crown against the equally determined Israel Gonzales of Mexico at the American Bank Center in Corpus Christi, Texas.
ADVERTISEMENT
The 26-year-old Ancajas of Panabo City, Davao del Norte, tipped the weighing scales at 114.75lbs. Their Mexican opponent meanwhile, weighed in at 114lbs, as the two fighters went below the contracted fight weight of 115lbs, an ominous sign that both are primed and prepared to wage a bloody war.
This is Ancajas' debut fight in the United States promoted by Bob Arum's Top Rank Promotions, and the Filipino vowed to make an impressive show.
Ancajas is one of only two remaining Filipino world boxing champions, and they know they are carrying quite a load on their shoulders.
The other reigning Filipino champ is IBF flyweight world champion Donnie “Ahas” Nietes who is also currently in the United States to prepare for their February 24 title defense against Juan Carlos Reveco of Argentina in Inglewood, California.
Ancajas stunned the boxing world in 2016 when they dethroned the favored and erstwhile IBF world super flyweight champion McJoe Arroyo via unanimous decision in Manila. They went on to defend the title three times in just one year against Jose Alfredo Rodriguez where they won by a seventh-round technical knockout (TKO), Japanese Teiru Kinoshita via another seventh-round TKO and Irish prospect Jamie Conlan whom they stopped in the sixth-round by TKO.
Ancajas holds a fearsome record of 28 wins, with 19 knockouts, with one defeat and a draw.
Gonzales of Baja California Sur, Mexico has a record of 21 wins including eight knockouts and one loss.  They are unbeaten since 2016 and is riding on an eight-fight winning streak.
Just like Ancajas, this is also Gonzales' debut fight on US soil.
British police said on Wednesday they suspected two people found in a critical condition near the English city where a former Russian spy was poisoned earlier this year may have been exposed to an unknown substance.Police in Wiltshire, where ex-double agent Sergei Skripal and their daughter Yulia were poisoned with a nerve agent in March, took the rare step of declaring a major incident after a man and a woman were found unconscious on Saturday in Amesbury.The pair is now in hospital in a critical condition."They are both currently receiving treatment for suspected exposure to an unknown substance," Wiltshire Police said in a statement. "Based upon the number of casualties affected, it is not believed that there is a significant health risk to the wider public."The pair, both in their 40s, were initially believed to have taken heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs. They are being treated at Salisbury District Hospital, which remains open as usual, police said.The Skripals spent weeks in a critical condition in the same hospital before slowly recovering and being discharged.More than three days since the two people were found, tests are still being conducted to ascertain what substance made them ill.Amesbury lies seven miles (11 kms) to the north of Salisbury, where the Skripals were found slumped unconscious on a bench on March 4.Police said sites in both Amesbury and Salisbury that they believed the man and woman found in Amesbury had frequented would be cordoned off as a precaution.A Public Health England (PHE) spokesperson said there was not a significant risk to the wider public.Britain blamed Russia for poisoning Skripal with Novichok nerve agent, the first known offensive use of such a nerve agent on European soil since World War Two.Moscow denied any involvement and suggested Britain had carried out the attack to stoke anti-Russian hysteria.Russia has said it does not have such nerve agents, did not develop Novichok, and President Vladimir Putin dismissed as nonsense the notion that Moscow would have poisoned Skripal and their 33-year-old daughter.The attack prompted the biggest Western expulsion of Russian diplomats since the Cold War as allies in Europe and the United States sided with Prime Minister Theresa May's view that Moscow was either responsible or had lost control of the nerve agent.Moscow has hit back by expelling Western diplomats, questioning how Britain knows that Russia was responsible and offering its rival interpretations, including that it amounted to a plot by British secret services.
The fast food chain – which was forced to close stores last month after a chicken shortage – has aded the Ultimate “Big” Cheese Burger to its menu. And as the name suggests, it's filled with cheese. And more cheese. The burger itself has the usual signature chicken, which is seasoned with a tasty cheese and mozzarella patty, cheese sauce and a classic cheese slice. “It's not often we do a cheeseburger, but when we do, we go all out,” KFC's Annabel Fribence said.

"Enter, triple cheese.” But before you rush out to try one, there is a catch. The burger is currently only available in Australia.

While another begged: “Please bring this the the UK, least you could do after the delivery sham.” Chicken lovers were plunged into misery last month when a delivery crisis at KFC's giant warehouse in Rugby saw branches temporarily close. The chaos followed the company's decision to ditch its existing delivery company Bidvest Logistics in favour of DHL. A failure in its computer system meant that deliveries out of its vast delivery hub went into meltdown.

A gang of masked men broke into Sainsbury's in Beaconsfield and stole cigarettes, computer games and money.
Three people, wearing dark clothes and balaclavas, forced their way into the shop on Maxwell Road in the early hours of Monday (Feb 13), at around 3.25am.
Thames Valley Police have now launched an appeal for information following the burglary.
Investigating officer, PC Lee Jeffries from Local CID based at Taplow police station, said: “I would like to speak to anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious in this area at this time.
“Anyone with any information can contact me via the Thames Valley Police enquiry centre on 101.
“If you do not want to speak directly to the police you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
No personal details are taken, information is not traced or recorded and you will not go to court.”
Police have been contacted for further information.
More as we get it.
Call it a cow-beaver.
Ranchers northeast of Regina are shaking their heads after watching a herd of curious bovines slowly follow a beaver across one of their pastures.
Adrienne Ivey and their husband Aaron were out checking their 150 cattle near Ituna, Sask., on Good Friday when they noticed something odd.
The cattle were gathered together and walking slowly behind a beaver, with some of the heifers lowering their heads to get a closer look at the furry cowboy with a funny-looking tail.
When the beaver stopped, the herd would stop, and then follow again when the rodent resumed its stroll.
Ivey says they are used to herding their cows with horses or quads, but nothing like this.
They say young cattle are naturally curious, while the beaver seemed to ignore all the attention.
“We knew that people would get a great chuckle out of it because you cannot get more Canadian than that,” said Ivey, who posted a video of the beaver-bovine cattle drive on Facebook.
“We talk about how awesome our Canadian beef is, but a beaver leading cattle around? It's the most Canadian thing ever!”
Ivey said the beaver was probably looking around the pasture for a place to build a dam.
Video of the beaver and cattle can be seen at:
Commuters are again being urged to leave extra time to travel today after Britain shivered through its coldest night of the year.
Main routes are open today but side roads and backstreets are icy.
A Met Office yellow warning remains in place for the entire North East coast until 11am today.
It says: "Ice is expected to form on some surfaces from mid-afternoon Monday, and overnight into Tuesday morning.
"Wintry showers may also bring some fresh snowfalls, mostly to higher ground.
"Accumulations of 2-5 cm area possible, again mostly above 100-150 m in places in eastern Scotland and eastern England. Some roads and railways are likely to be affected with some journey times taking longer.
"There will probably be icy stretches on some untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths with some injuries from slips trips and falls."
Britain had its coldest night of the year as vast swathes of the country fell below freezing - with -13C (8.6F) recorded in Shropshire.
Clear skies overnight saw temperatures plummet below -12.4C (9.6F) on Saturday night - with the Met Office recording a new low in Shawbury, north east of Shrewsbury.
Yellow weather warnings for snow and ice are in place until 11am on Tuesday, covering vast swathes of the country, including London and the South East, much of the Midlands, Northern Ireland and Wales, as well as the eastern coast of England and parts of Scotland.
In parts of Gloucestershire, 36 homes were without power for a second night after ice and snow caused disruption across the country over the weekend.
Western Power Distribution said the outage was caused by the weather and engineers were expecting to have the power restored by 7.30am on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, dozens of schools in the South West, West Midlands and Wales will keep their gates closed for a second day following the bitterly cold conditions.
The AA said it had its busiest day of the year on Monday with around 25,000 calls from motorists - and was preparing for a deluge of calls on Tuesday.
AA president Edmund King said: "We expect Tuesday to be extremely busy as temperatures plummet overnight, causing even more hazardous conditions on already wet and slippery roads.
"All of our patrols are working hard throughout the country to help those broken down or stuck in ice and snow and we have plans in place to ensure our call operators can travel to and from work safely to answer emergency breakdown calls."
After snowy and freezing conditions brought problems to road, rail and air on Monday the threat of delays and cancellations lingers today.
At Heathrow, where dozens of flights were shelved on Monday, 16 departures are listed as cancelled for Tuesday with the airport advising passengers to check the status of their flight before travelling to the airport.
Cancellations are also reported at Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh airports. Airlines had previously said the re-positioning of aircraft and crews from previous days was adding to the problems.
National Rail is not reporting any major disruption to train journeys owing to the weather - but added services running to and from London Waterloo could be disrupted until 10am following a line-side fire on Monday.
Scores of schools are set to be closed for a second day as the cold weather continues to cause disruption.
All council-run schools in Birmingham were shut on Monday following the hazardous conditions, but the blanket closure is not in force for Tuesday.
Nearly 80 schools are listed as closed in Staffordshire, with many citing untreated paths and fears that snow will have compacted into ice as reasons for keeping the gates closed.
Gloucestershire, which saw around 200 schools closed on Monday, will have 80 schools closed on Tuesday, while more than 90 will be closed in neighbouring Herefordshire.
Pupils at 123 primary schools and 25 secondary schools in Shropshire will have a second day off owing to the weather, while in Wales hundreds of schools will be shut on Tuesday, with Caerphilly and Powys particularly affected.
The TUC has called on employers not to force staff to make hazardous journeys into work, saying firms in areas of the country affected by the snowy conditions should have put out advice to their staff on what they should do when snowed, ice and a lack of public transport prevents them getting in.
Policies should also cover what parents should do if schools close and they have no alternative childcare, said general secretary Frances O'Grady, adding: "It is essential that employers don't force staff to make dangerous journeys for the sake of presenteeism.
"For many employees the bad weather will have made their commute virtually impossible, but thankfully many bosses now have 'bad weather' policies so staff know what is expected of them."
South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said on Monday it had extended the deadline for President Jacob Zuma to submit arguments on why they should not be prosecuted for corruption.
JOHANNESBURG: South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said on Monday it had extended the deadline for President Jacob Zuma to submit arguments on why they should not be prosecuted for corruption to the end of next month.
The 783 charges against Zuma relate to a 30 billion rand (US$2.20 billion) government arms deal arranged in the late 1990s. They were filed but then dropped by the NPA shortly before Zuma ran for the presidency.
South Africa's High Court reinstated the charges last year and the Supreme Court upheld that decision in October, rejecting an appeal by Zuma and describing the NPA's decision to set aside the charges as "irrational".
It then fell to Abrahams, appointed by Zuma as chief state prosecutor in 2015, to decide whether or not the NPA would pursue a case against Zuma.
Abrahams gave Zuma until the end of November to make representations to prevent the charges being brought against him. Abrahams has not commented on whether Zuma presented any submissions of what decision they have taken on the matter.
"They must submit their representation on the 31st of January," said NPA spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku, referring to Zuma's lawyers who requested an extension from the Nov. 30 deadline.

Last week the High Court ruled that Zuma's appointment of Abrahams as state prosecutor was not valid and should be set aside immediately. Zuma said they would appeal the court's ruling.
Mfaku said Abrahams would remain in office until the appeal is determined.

macOS: It's important to know how to fine-tune your wireless router, because not every router can just auto-adjust your wireless network's settings to give you the highest quality connection. That, and a great wifi-analysis app can help you figure out the areas of your house or apartment that might need a little more wireless support—either by adding another access point or adjusting your existing configuration.
This App Is Worth It
Though it's pricey, the $20 macOS app WiFi Explorer is worth the price of a few burritos. It does a perfect job of showing you every wireless network your laptop can find in a particular area. More importantly, it drops these all onto two handy graphs—one for the 2.4GHz band and one for the 5GHz band—to show you which channels might be saturated with competing networks.
Screenshot: David Murphy
Why is this important? Where possible, you want your wireless network to be on a channel that's as free from interference from other wireless networks as possible. If you run your wifi network on a channel that's packed with other wifi networks, your speeds can suffer. As MacWorld described in a 2013 article:
“To test this theory, I brought that same outdoor suburban distance test indoors to a long hallway in our seven-story office building in San Francisco's South Park neighborhood. At my home, the MacBook detected 25 networks; at the office it saw 150. At a distance of 6 feet from the Time Capsule, our average throughput was 489 mbps, 11 percent less than the suburban network speed. At 26 feet, the office speed dropped to 305 mbps, 33 percent less than the suburban test result from the same distance. At 54 feet, the indoor test was 44 percent slower than in my quiet neighborhood. And at 78 feet, the speeds in my office were down 51 percent from the speed I got in front of my house at the same distance.”

Choose Channels Manually
If your router can't pick the best channel for you, or its selection is terrible, then you should manually adjust your wifi network's settings within your router's interface. Try sticking to channel 1, 6, or 11 on 2.4GHz—the three non-overlapping channels—and one of 5GHz's 23 different non-overlapping channels. (You have a lot more flexibility there.)
If You Don't Want to Pay
And if you truly don't want to shell out $20 for a lovely app, you can sort-of accomplish the same channel scanning in macOS itself. In Spotlight, type in “wireless diagnostics” and load the app that pops up at the top of your results. Ignore its on-screen prompt; instead, click on Window, and then click on “Scan.”

While you won't get any pretty graphs, you can sort all the found wireless networks by channel to get a sense of what's crowded and what isn't—remember, lower RSSI numbers indicate a weaker signal, so a channel with a lot of weak wireless networks might be a better choice for your wireless network than a channel with one or two strong, competing networks.
Accept challenge, CJ, Morales told

Chief Justice Maria Lourdes P.A. Sereno and Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales should accept the challenge to resign and open their bank records if they are not really corrupt, President Duterte said last Thursday.
The President said they and two other government officials should “go quietly into the night” after working in government for so long.
“If you are really honest, tutal you have been there for several years, including me. Why don't we just resign?”Duterte said during an agribusiness expo in Pasay City.
“Kung talagang hindi kayo salbahe, hindi kayo magnanakaw… hindi, you are qualified to hold the job, you should accept my dare,” they added.
Sereno and Morales have refused to heed the President's challenge to resign with them despite allegations of corruption and partiality.
Sereno's camp claimed the Chief Justice has done nothing unlawful to merit their resignation. Morales said they would not be baited into abandoning their constitutional duties.
The President issued the resignation challenge amid the controversial inquiry into their alleged hidden wealth by the Ombudsman.
In their remarks last Thursday, Duterte said Sereno and Morales should resign with them since they “bug the Filipinos everyday with so many issues.”
They said they should go to Congress with their bank records for scrutiny and simultaneously sign their resignation letters.
“If you want them, convince them ‘accept Duterte's challenge.” Then we go quietly into the night,” the President told the crowd gathered at the Agrilink/Foodlink/Aqualink 2017 Festival at the World Trade Center Metro Manila.
The President said they were ready to lose the presidency after having been in public service for more than two decades.
They said they were grateful for having the chance to render public service but is already “beyond adulation” of the public.
“I never lost an election, including the presidency. What more do I want from God and the people? Tapos na ako,” they said.
“I am beyond ‘yung adulation, ‘yung ganun na palakpak ‘Duterte, Duterte.' It does not appeal to me at all. Do not be offended pero I do not find any fulfillment there. All I have to do is I want to do my job,” they said.
The President has stepped up the attacks against Sereno and the Ombudsman, threatening to pursue their impeachment in Congress.
Duterte has accused Sereno of allegedly failing to declare their true wealth and using public funds to finance their lavish lifestyle.

Kurt Warner has just been elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and they have a story unlike any other Hall of Famer: Warner wasn't just undrafted and overlooked, but they were a guy in their late 20s just trying to make it in Arena football, and they doubted the NFL would ever give them a chance to show what they could do.
Warner said this morning on PFT Live that they didn't doubt their own abilities, but they did doubt that anyone in the NFL would recognize their abilities for long enough to give them a real chance.
“I wasn't ready to give up playing football. I probably would have kept playing Arena football for a while because it was fun and it was a great living and I was taking care of my family,” Warner said. “But it was like, who's really going to give a 28-year-old rookie a chance to play in the National Football League? It's hard enough to develop a quarterback the way it is, so when you're that late in the game, who's going to do that? So I had moments like that when I thought I'm just not ever going to get that true opportunity.”
Warner admits that they asked himself, “Why me? Why can't I get a shot?” But they didn't quit, and now he's glad they went down the path they went down.
“You're thankful that you're the one who did it this way and no one will ever have a story like you have,” Warner said.
It really is a unique story, unlike any other in the history of American sports: From the guy who famously stocked grocery store shelves to the Hall of Fame.
Sami Aawar, a professional hotelier with 20 years' experience in the region, has been appointed as General Manager of the Mövenpick Hotel Doha.
Aawar's career with Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts started in 2002 as Front Office Duty Manager in Beirut. First they were promoted to Assistant Front Office Manager and later filled the Front Office Manager position at Mövenpick Resort Al Bidaa Kuwait in 2007, where they gained extensive exposure in the housekeeping department. In 2011, Aawar was appointed as Rooms Division Manager at Mövenpick Hotel West Bay Doha.
An enriching experience as Director of Operations at Mövenpick Hotel Jumeirah Beach Dubai followed in 2014. This was a catalyst for their rise to the role of Task Force General Manager of Mövenpick Hotel Al Aziziyah and Mövenpick Hotel Doha in 2016. The formal appointment to general manager is a result of their successful six-month Task Force assignment in Doha.
“My main goal is to target outstanding guest satisfaction and great relationships among team members,” said Aawar. “It is an extraordinary time to be based in Doha and there is a tangible feel of excitement in the air with future events like the football World Cup to plan for and look forward to.”
Aawar started their hospitality career in their native Lebanon, where they joined the food and beverage department of the Al Bustan Hotel in 1997. In the following years, they transferred to front office and worked in independent boutique hotels before joining Mövenpick 15 years ago.
Aawar holds a Bachelor of Business Administration Degree in Business Management and is fluent in English, Arabic and French.
 They are joined in Doha by their wife and three young children.

Both sides issue terse statement as contract deadline looms.
As May 1 draws ever closer, the Writers Guild Of America (WGA) and Alliance Of Motion Picture And Television Producers (AMPTP) called off talks for the second time since contract negotiations began on March 13.
On Monday the WGA and AMPTP issued a terse statement that read: “The WGA and the AMPTP have agreed to resume negotiations on Tuesday, April 25, 2017.”
Both sides returned to the table last Monday and went into recess on Friday ahead of the long weekend.
Film and TV writers want higher payments and a health plan bailout that would amount to an extra $178m from the AMPTP.
WGA officials will poll members for strike authorisation this week, in a move that would grant the Guild the green light to call for industrial action should an impasse extend beyond the May 1 expiry date.
MELBOURNE: Women's world number one Lydia Ko has never been more excited to kick off their LPGA season after changing their caddie, coach and clubs as they seek their way back to the winner's circle.
The 19-year-old New Zealander headlines the Australian Open in Adelaide this week, where they will hope to grab their first tournament win in seven months following a barren second half of 2016, their first mini-slump of a stellar career.
They have been working with new coach South African Gary Gilchrist on their swing for about a month since parting ways with David Leadbetter last year.
New caddie Gary Matthews, former bag-man to Sergio Garcia, will carry their new set of PXG clubs after they signed a multi-million dollar deal with the equipment maker to part ways with Callaway.
"Even though there have been a lot of changes, I don't think I have ever been this excited to come off a break in December and get back into training and into preparing for the season," Ko told reporters at the Royal Adelaide Golf Club on Wednesday.
Twice major champion Ko has not tasted victory since the Marathon Classic in July and finished outside the top 40 in three of their last six LPGA starts.
They have held the world number one ranking for 69 consecutive weeks, however, and said they never felt pressure from the chasing pack to hold onto top spot.
"I try and not think of it as 'hey, everyone is trying to chase me'," Ko, who won the 2015 tournament and was runner-up last year, added.
"When we're out there, we're not thinking about what ranked player they are to me, or what I am.
"That is important to not get carried away about the awards, the rankings. Because at the end of the day, we're all golfers trying to make as many birdies as we can and hopefully hold the trophy at the end of that week.
"That is the mindset I have been trying to take. I feel more self-pressure rather than pressure from others."

The current cold snap that has sparked “risk to life” weather warnings is about to end, but not for much longer.
Another blast of cold air from Siberia and Scandinavia is set to slam into the country again on the Easter weekend – the third in weeks.
And with it will be plummeting temperatures, snow and ice that could leave an already fragile Britain crippled.
BBC weather presenter Simon King confirmed every Brit's worst fear this afternoon, confirming the “Beast from the East continued”.
In some organizations, general accounting processes run like well-greased machines, and when adjustments to the process model are needed, the changes are not unwieldy. In others, it seems there's always the need to call in a mechanic to keep the gears moving smoothly. Constantly “fixing” things can get expensive. Toss in business model changes and sizable product line extensions and workflows can get all gummed up, sending costs soaring.
So, who's in a position to win and who's not? According to APQC's Open Standards Benchmarking data on general accounting, top-performing organizations spend just one quarter of what the poorest-performing organizations spend on total process cost.
In a sample of 915 companies, the top performers spend 47 cents (or less) per $1,000 in revenue compared to the $1.98 (or more) per $1,000 in revenue shelled out by the laggards. That expenditure includes personnel, systems, overhead, and other items, internal and external, involved in the process. Think of it this way: an organization with $5 billion in annual revenue could save at least $7.55 million per year if it can make it from the bottom-performance group into the top-performance category.
Sample definitions: The top performers represent the best 25% of organizations in the test; the number stated for them indicates the percentile level above which all the winners operate. The bottom performers do worse than 75% of all other survey takers. The median is the middle of the range captured.
It's Tough to Make Progress
In a complex organization, cost-reduction in general accounting is already a tough nut to crack. Multinationals are typically plagued by a crazy quilt of systems, processes, and data definitions as they wrestle with multiple legal entities. The situation is worsened when strategy-driven change is introduced. All too often, the result is more humans doing more manual data entry.
Some corporate controllers embrace the view that one must never rest when it comes to cutting accounting process costs. But beyond maintaining a constant cost vigil, it's vital to figure out why you're burdened by the specter of expensive people doing menial tasks and convoluted work flows that slow things down.
Try studying the accounting process by assessing the manual journal entry line item percentage. The bottom performers in the APQC metric tend to do nearly one-third of all such entries by hand, which requires an army of FTEs. Among top performers, the percentage is 10% or less.
In this case, a high level of manual processing opens the door for error and fraud, and it's expensive: Labor-related costs can consume two-thirds of the total costs of running a basic financial process.
Worse, manual accounting tends to become a self-perpetuating cycle of paper-based processes and poorly designed work flows, which lead to even more manual interventions. Manual interventions will never go away, but they should be the exception rather than the heart of your general accounting process.
If your finance organization is trapped in a manual accounting rut, how best to break out? The use of a standardized process framework, common data model, a streamlined chart of accounts, regular process measurement, and automation can go a long way. Ultimately, the CFO may need to bear down and overhaul the infrastructure of general accounting.

Anker's best known for its small and portable SoundCore Bluetooth speakers, but the larger and louder SoundCore Pro+ is great for backyard barbecues and parties.
The Pro+ puts out 25W of sound through four drivers, both double what you'd find in the original SoundCore. It's also IPX4 water resistant, so it can stand up to rain, and runs for a very respectable 18 hours on a charge. It typically sells for $89, but Anker's marked it down to $66 this week.

The Best FIFA Football Awards is the premier annual awards celebration held by football's world governing body.
The men's panel also include legends Ronaldo, Fabio Capello and Frank Lampard, while stars Mia Hamm, Sun Wen and Maia Jackman form part of the women's panel.
The judges will shortlist ten candidates for each category, which will be unveiled on 23 July 2018 – with a public vote opening on the same day. Football fans, national team captains, head coaches and more than 200 media representatives will then cast their votes to decide who will be crowned the best players and coaches in the men's and women's games from last season.
With the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ currently showcasing the finest footballing talent on the planet, the race for the Best FIFA Football Awards is even more intense and the showpiece event will take on added significance when it returns to London for a second time on 24 September 2018.
At last year's awards, Cristiano Ronaldo picked up the Best Men's Player Award, the Netherlands' Lieke Martens was crowned Best Women's Player, French icon Zinédine Zidane was named Best Men's Coach and the Netherlands' Sarina Wiegman was Best Women's Coach.
Separate panels will shortlist candidates for the Best FIFA Goalkeeper Award, the FIFA Puskás Award and the FIFA Fan Award, with the winner of the Best FIFA Goalkeeper Award chosen by a panel of FIFA Legends.
In recognition and celebration of the essential role played by football fans in the game, the FIFA Fan Award, an appreciation of memorable moments created by fans, is voted for by supporters.
The FIFA Puskás Award, handed out to the player judged to have scored the best goal of the year, is also determined by fans' votes.
The voting process for the men's and women's awards will open on 23 July and close on 10 August.
FIFA will announce the final lists of the three nominees for each of the four categories listed above – as well as for the FIFA Puskás Award, the FIFA Fan Award and the Best FIFA Goalkeeper Award – in September.

Newcastle United have completed the permanent signing of Slovakian goalkeeper Martin Dubravka from Sparta Prague after a successful loan spell last season, the Premier League club said on Wednesday.
REUTERS: Newcastle United have completed the permanent signing of Slovakian goalkeeper Martin Dubravka from Sparta Prague after a successful loan spell last season, the Premier League club said on Wednesday.
The 29-year-old arrived at St James' Park in January and made 12 league appearances as Rafa Benitez's side finished 10th in the top flight.

Dubravka becomes Newcastle's first signing in the close season, on a contract until June 2022, after the club activated the option to sign him.
"Ever since they arrived with us on loan they have shown a fantastic attitude and great work ethic, and of course we have been very impressed with their performances for us on the pitch last season," Benitez said in a statement.
"This was one of the key positions we had identified we needed to strengthen and had been concerned about, so it is excellent news that we are able now to sign them on a permanent basis."

HANOVER TWP. — About midway through the first quarter with the game still scoreless, Northwest was looking for a spark offensively.
The Rangers had gained a good amount of yardage and converted two fourth downs on their opening drive, but failed to put any points on the board.
The spark came from the special teams unit.
After forcing the Hanover Area offense into a three-and-out on its first possession, Brandon Hardiman fielded the ensuing punt at Northwest's 46-yard line and returned it 54 yards for the game's first score.
That play seemed to propel the rest of the Northwest offense, as the team put up a flurry of points on its way to a 55-22 victory.
“We moved the ball, but we didn't score,” Northwest head coach Lon Hazlet said. “We were sputtering a little bit, but then we responded on special teams. Any time another team makes a stop, any type of special teams play always electrifies a team.”
Running back Jake Anderson rushed for 131 yards and a touchdown and had a kick return of their own. Quarterback David Piestrak threw for two scores — both to Connor Hazlet — and rushed for another.
David Fedorczyk led the Hanover Area rushing attack with 235 yards and two touchdowns.
Following Hardiman's punt return, Hanover Area responded with a Fedorczyk 36-yard score.
However, Northwest scored on five of its next seven possessions to take a commanding 41-9 lead into halftime.
The second half saw more of the same, as the Rangers forced a fumble and converted on a four-play, 27-yard drive to expand the lead.
Northwest put one more touchdown on the board, and a late touchdown pass from Aaron hummer to Sean Coleman was the last score of the night for either team.
“We let a couple games get away from us early (this season),” Hazlet said. “But the kids have worked hard. They've responded to some hard coaching and we've really pushed them the last couple of weeks.”

The Pakistani opposition party led by former cricket star Imran Khan appears to be gaining ground ahead of a July 25 general election, with one new poll showing it pulling ahead of the outgoing ruling party and another showing it only slightly behind.
ISLAMABAD: The Pakistani opposition party led by former cricket star Imran Khan appears to be gaining ground ahead of a July 25 general election, with one new poll showing it pulling ahead of the outgoing ruling party and another showing it only slightly behind.
A survey by Pulse Consultant showed Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI, or Pakistan Justice Movement) ahead with 30 percent of the respondents nationwide, compared to 27 percent for its main rival, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N). The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) was at 17 percent.

A separate nationwide poll by Gallup Pakistan had PML-N on top with 26 percent, PTI with 25 percent and the PPP at 16 percent.
Both polls were commissioned by Pakistan's Jang Media Group and were published on Wednesday in its affiliated newspaper, The News. They each surveyed about 3,000 people, with a margin of error of 1.6 percent for the Pulse survey and 2-3 percent for Gallup.
The new polls indicate a swing towards Khan's party compared to similar nationwide polls in 2017, which put the PML-N 8-9 percentage points ahead of PTI.
The Gallup poll showed most of the PML-N's losses were to voters who responded "undecided" in the most recent poll, conducted between May 1 and June 6, while the Pulse poll indicated that most of PML-N's losses went directly to PTI.

Khan's political fortunes have improved since PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif was removed as prime minister by the Supreme Court last year over undeclared assets.
Sharif, who was disqualified from politics for life, now faces a verdict in an anti-corruption court on Friday along with their daughter Maryam, who is running for parliament. The case, which involves the purchase of luxury apartments in London, could see Sharif jailed and Maryam disqualified.
Sharif's has accused the military and courts conspiring to oust them and using legal cases and intimidation to help Khan's PTI party, accusations denied by Khan, the army and the judiciary.
Khan, a former cricket captain of Pakistan, has portrayed the legal cases as a long-overdue corruption crackdown on the PML-N, which they have labeled a graft-ridden "mafia".

SYDNEY: Alastair Cook has "no idea" when they will be retiring and is completely focused on beating Australia in their 150th test this week to keep the Ashes series alive, the former England captain said on Tuesday.
Cook, England's most prolific test run scorer, has made 62 runs in four innings as the tourists have gone 2-0 down in the five-match series and some former players turned pundits have suggested they might be about to call time on their career.
"I haven't made any decision on anything. All my focus is on this game, the biggest of our lives coming up," Cook said in Perth.
Cook captained England on their last Ashes tour Down Under when spinner Graeme Swann retired mid-series with the tourists 3-0 down and headed for a 5-0 whitewash.
Former Australian paceman Mitchell Johnson and England batsman Kevin Pietersen have suggested that Cook had the look of a man who might be ready to hang up their bat.
"For the people who are saying that, they've had no contact time with me," Cook, who is 33 later this month, said. "They wouldn't know the extra nets I've been doing behind closed doors.

"I was with (my batting coach) yesterday for an hour-and-a-half in the morning, desperate to keep working on my game.
"That's probably not a guy who's given in. To be honest with you, I have no idea (when I'll retire). And I've said that since I gave up the captaincy."
The opener said retirement might not end up being their own choice if they continued to fail to make runs and said becoming the first England player to play 150 tests was "quite special", especially as the last 147 have been consecutive.
Cook has enjoyed an Ashes triumph in Australia in 2010-11 as well as the 2013-14 debacle and said the current party would not fail for want of trying.
"I will say this about this England side, I've never seen a side a work as hard as this side," they said.
"Win, lose or draw, whether we play well or we play rubbish, the effort from the guys is unbelievable. There's a group of men in there, 16 or 17 of them, desperate to do well."

FABINHO has revealed how fellow Brazilian Roberto Firmino helped convince them to join Liverpool.
GETTY Liverpool transfer news: Fabinho arrived on a £40m deal from Monaco
The Reds landed the midfielder from Monaco in a £40m deal last month. Kop boss Jurgen Klopp was keen to bolster their options in that position after Emre Can's exit this summer on a free transfer. And the Brazilian got some encouragement from their compatriot to leave Ligue 1 for the Premier League. “Firstly they (Roberto) sent me some messages saying that Jurgen Klopp had been following me for some time and liked my style of play,” Fabinho told FourFourTwo. “Then, when we were close to finalising the deal, they started giving me some tips about life in the city.

“A club with Liverpool's history wants you? Come on, you just pack your bags and go” Liverpool star Fabinho “He told me Liverpool was a fantastic place, just a little cold every now and again!" Fabinho, who began pre-season training with the Reds this week as they were not in Brazil's World Cup squad, can also play in defence but the utility man has revealed Klopp sees them in a midfield role. They added: “He's said I might play in a few different positions but the plan is to use me in midfield and I'm available to play wherever they need me. They left the best possible impression. “He told me the calendar is demanding in England and that they need players like me.

Taxpayers will fund former president Jacob Zuma's fight to avoid personally paying an estimated R10-million in legal fees spent on their disastrous State Capture court cases.
But‚ the State Attorneys office has claimed‚ that Zuma will be required to pay back the money spent on that appeal if they lose the case.
“The State Attorney will prepare and facilitate the signing of a detailed agreement in which the former president undertakes to refund the state all fees and disbursements incurred in the event that they are not successful in the appeal proceedings‚” State Attorney Isaac Chowe wrote in a letter to Zuma's lawyers.
They added that the State Attorney would make sure that the fees would be paid “in accordance with the fair and reasonable tariffs discussed with the State Attorney's office‚ and the State Attorney will verify all accounts and invoices received in respect of this matter before processing same for payment”.
As yet‚ it remains unclear whether Zuma has actually signed the so-called “refund deal”.
The letter comes as the legality of Zuma's past and present legal funding by the state is currently being challenged by the Democratic Alliance and the Economic Freedom Fighters.
Last month‚ the Presidency stated that it had agreed to fund Zuma's fees in respect of their defense to the corruption and racketeering case against them – but stressed that the former president would need to formally apply‚ through the State Attorney‚ for funding for any other cases.

The Welsh Government is calling for a major "constitutional reconstruction" of the United Kingdom in order to meet the challenges Brexit poses for the devolved nations and the country as a whole.
First Minister of Wales Carwyn Jones will launch the Welsh Government's policy paper on Brexit and Devolution on Thursday morning, calling for the "inadequate" Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) to be replaced with a new UK Council of Ministers and for a Convention on the future of the UK.
Mr Jones is expected to tell the Wales Governance Centre event in Cardiff that, while leaving the EU has the potential to destabilise the United Kingdom, it also offers the opportunity for reinvention.
"Leaving the European Union is the biggest challenge facing the United Kingdom, a challenge thrown into even sharper relief by the outcome of the General Election," they will say.
"Decisions taken now will affect Wales for decades to come.
"Our ability to trade, travel, attract investment, determine policies, legislate, support our countryside, invest in our regions - all of these will be influenced by how we leave the EU."
The policy document sets out a blueprint for constitutional renewal and proposes replacing the current JMC with a UK Council of Ministers, served by an independent secretariat and a structured work programme.
The document says: "EU withdrawal raises fundamental questions about the JMC's role and working arrangements.
"In our view, these are inadequate for the new challenges we face.
"The JMC is a consultative body and makes no decisions - it might negatively be characterised as, effectively, a 'talking shop'."
The paper recommends a new council operated along similar lines to, but on a smaller scale than, the EU Council of Ministers, meaning the four administrations would meet regularly in a variety of formats to negotiate common rules and frameworks.
The paper also proposes a Convention on the Future of the United Kingdom, to be chaired by a respected, independent figure.
It suggests the Convention could consider major questions that will face the UK once it is outside the EU and take evidence from all political parties, civil society and all parts of the UK.
The paper concludes: "The Welsh Government appreciates that, for many in the UK, some of the ideas set out in this document may appear challenging.
"Adopting them would amount to a major constitutional reconstruction of the UK, and we do not underestimate this.
"But in our view, the UK's withdrawal from the EU represents an existential challenge to the UK itself.
"As an administration committed to both the Union and devolution, we consider that all options should be on the table, in order to preserve and foster unity for the UK while guaranteeing the diversity of its constituent nations."
Mr Jones will add that the opportunities presented by EU exit must be about the future, not the past.
Of the paper, they will say: "It represents an important step forward in the work which we must undertake together with England, Scotland and Northern Ireland - through discussion, not diktat - to map our collective future."

German fourth seed Alexander Zverev upset Roger Federer 6-3, 6-4 in the Rogers Cup final in Montreal on Sunday to join the Swiss right-hander as the most trophy-laden player on the ATP Tour this year with five titles.
The 20-year-old German, who arrived in Montreal fresh from their triumph in Washington, proved up to the task right out of the gate as they had Federer on their heels from the start on a sunny afternoon.
Zverev was poised and aggressive off the ground to create space for their power game and displayed some short-angled winners off thumping forehands and backhands to grab an early break for a 3-1 lead. They consolidated for a 4-1 cushion and ultimately closed out the opening set after a mere 30 minutes.
Federer, who entered the match 5-0 in finals this year, started to find their groove early in the second set, but appeared out of sorts while Zverev broke in the seventh game to pull ahead 4-3 and held on for a surprise win that took 68 minutes.
The victory was the second ATP World Tour Masters 1000 title of the season for Zverev, who also beat Novak Djokovic in Rome.
“This one against Roger is something so special for me because they were always a great idol growing up for me,” Zverev said during their trophy presentation. “The greatest player of all time, beating them in a final, not just any final, but in the final of a Masters 1000, is amazing.”
WOMEN'S PREMIER 5
Meanwhile in Toronto, Ukrainian Elina Svitolina on Sunday capped a remarkable week by beating Dane Caroline Wozniacki 6-4, 6-0 to capture their tour-leading fifth title of the season.
Fifth-seed Svitolina, whose run to the final included wins over Venus Williams, Wimbledon champion Garbine Muguruza and defending champion Simona Halep, used a strong return game throughout the 77-minute match to beat sixth-seed Wozniacki.
“It was an incredible week. Played against great players, I beat them, and it's just something really amazing and I am very, very tired,” said Svitolina, who was playing their third match in two days after rain pushed their quarter-final to Saturday.
The 22-year-old Ukrainian was so doubtful that they could even reach the final that they had a flight booked on Friday to the next tournament in Cincinnati.
With the win, Svitolina moved up one spot to a career-high world number four.
An investigation by the New York Daily News and ProPublica prompts changes that guarantee residents and businesses targeted in NYPD nuisance actions more due process rights.
How New York City police are using little-known laws to kick people out of their homes, even if they haven't been charged with a crime.

This story was co-published with the New York Daily News.
The New York City Council is expected to pass sweeping changes Wednesday to a law that has allowed the city's police department to force people from their homes and businesses without warning over sometimes flimsy allegations.
In October, the council introduced 13 bills called the Nuisance Abatement Fairness Act in response to a New York Daily News and ProPublica investigation that found the New York City Police Department has abused the decades-old law. The bills are scheduled for a vote on Wednesday, with some minor amendments, and are expected to pass, sources said. Mayor Bill de Blasio is expected to sign them.
The city enacted the nuisance abatement law in the 1970s to push the sex industry out of Times Square. Since then, the NYPD has greatly expanded its use, targeting businesses and homes it said were the sites of repeated criminal activity. The agency filed 2,609 of the civil lawsuits from 2013 through 2015 alone.
The Daily News and ProPublica analyzed more than 1,100 cases filed during that period, and found the targets were frequently households with one or more members accused of low-level drug charges, and immigrant-owned shops accused of selling alcohol to underage auxiliary cops. The targets were almost exclusively located in communities of color. In some instances, nuisance cases went forward even after the criminal cases that spurred them fell apart and charges were dismissed.
The NYPD's in-house attorneys began nearly every case with a request for a court order closing the location without warning, forcing people to negotiate settlements while either homeless or unable to earn a living. Hundreds agreed to undergo warrantless searches of their homes. Families had to ban loved ones, sometimes for life. Shop owners granted unfettered access to surveillance cameras and data-storing identification readers.
The City Council legislation, spearheaded by Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, with a dozen cosponsors, would mark the first time the law has been amended to add protections for the accused.
“Reforming the substance of the law ensures that we are protecting tenant and owner rights while enabling the police department to shutter problematic locations in an efficient and informed manner,” Mark-Viverito said, thanking the Daily News and ProPublica “for bringing to light this important issue.”
Councilwoman Vanessa Gibson, who chairs the public safety committee, said the nuisance law is a “powerful tool” for quickly uprooting crime, noting a 2015 council amendment that added the sale of K-2 as a closable offense. “However, it has become clear that the wide and disproportionate usage of this law has negatively impacted law abiding New Yorkers, and New Yorkers of color in particular,” they said.
The council's reforms would all but eliminate one of the most controversial aspects of the law: The city's ability to close locations without warning, pending a resolution to the case.
After negotiations with the mayor's office and the NYPD, the amended bills carve out exceptions only for cases involving prostitution, certain building code violations, and businesses that pose a significant risk of “physical harm” to the public. Businesses serving alcohol without a license could be subjected to a temporary restraining order, but not a closing order.
Misdemeanor drug and marijuana possession would no longer count as a nuisance under the law, and all drug-related cases would require at least one incident personally witnessed by a sworn officer, in order to eliminate cases with confidential informants as the sole witnesses.
The city could no longer bar people from any property for longer than a year, or three years in “unique circumstances,” which would eliminate settlements in which families barred loved ones from their homes for life. Further, the council's amendments would narrow the allowed settlement provisions to those aimed at abating a specific nuisance, “not to inflict punitive damages or more generally deter bad behavior.” The city could also no longer close a business or deprive any person of property rights if they were unaware of the nuisance.
A spokesperson for the mayor said the changes preserve an important tool for keeping communities safe “while ensuring that the rights of individuals are protected and due process is respected.”
