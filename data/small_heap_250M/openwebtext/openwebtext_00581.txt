I realize that we're in the midst of an important tax battle in Washington and that I should probably be writing about likely amendments to the Senate tax bill.
But long-time readers know that I'm bizarrely preoccupied with international tax issues (I would argue for very good reasons since global tax competition is a way to discipline greedy politicians and because I want the power of governments to be constrained by national borders).
So I can't resist commenting on a Washington Post story about the tax implications of the upcoming wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
It may seem like a modern fairy tale, but the upcoming wedding of Britain's Prince Harry to American actress Meghan Markle will come with some mundane hurdles. Perhaps most inconveniently for the British royals, this transatlantic partnership could end up involving the United States' Internal Revenue Service.
Most readers probably wonder how and why the IRS will be involved. After all, Ms. Markle no longer will be living in the United States or earning income in the United States after she marries the Prince.
But here's the bad news (for the millions of Americans who live overseas, not just Ms. Markle): The United States imposes “worldwide taxation,” which means the IRS claims the right to tax all income earned by citizens, even if those citizens live overseas and earn all their income outside of America.
…there already has been widespread speculation that the union of Prince Harry and Markle eventually could result in some British royal children wielding American passports. But there's a big obstacle in the way: American tax laws. …The United States' citizenship-based taxation system is unusual: Only Eritrea has a similar system. It's a relic of the Civil War and the Revenue Act of 1862, which called for the taxing of U.S. citizens abroad.
Here's what this means for the royal family.
Markle's American citizenship could open up the secretive finances of the royal family to outside scrutiny. If she remains a U.S. citizen, Markle will have to file her taxes to the IRS every year. And if she has more than $300,000 in assets at any point during the tax year — a likely scenario, given her successful acting career and her future husband — she will be expected to annually file a document called Form 8938 that will reveal the detail of these assets, which could include foreign trusts. …Although Markle's tax information would not become public once sent to the United States, it would leave the royal family open not only to IRS review but also the risk that the information could leak, said Dianne Mehany, a tax lawyer at Caplin & Drysdale.
So what's the solution if the royal family wants to avoid the greedy and intrusive IRS?
Ms. Markle will need to copy thousands of other overseas Americans and renounce her citizenship.
…the royal family employs some of the country's best tax consultants. …”My guess is that she'll be pressured by the Royal family to renounce [her U.S. citizenship], even if she'd rather not,” Spiro added. In many ways, that solution may be the simplest. And if Markle does give up her citizenship, she won't be alone. Treasury Department data show that 5,411 people chose to expatriate in 2016 — a 26 percent year-over-year increase and potentially a historic high — and experts expect that number to keep rising because of the increasing tax burdens placed on U.S. citizens living abroad.
And it's embarrassing to acknowledge that the United States has a very barbaric practice (used by evil regimes such as Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia) of extorting funds from Americas who are forced to give up citizenship.
She…would be subject to a potentially considerable exit tax.
This is adding injury to injury.
But Ms. Markle can be comforted by the fact that she's not an outlier. Because of America's bad worldwide tax regime (and especially because of FATCA, which makes enforcement of that bad system especially painful), an ever-growing number of overseas Americans have been forced to give up their citizenship.
Maybe as a wedding present to Prince Harry, American politicians can junk America's terrible worldwide tax regime. That doesn't require dramatic change, but why not fix a bunch of problems at once? I'll simply point out that the flat tax is based on the common-sense approach of territorial taxation (governments only tax economic activity inside national borders).
P.S. This issue also impacts America's Olympic athletes.
P.P.S. And Santa Claus as well!

You can probably point to that one girlfriend who always seems to have her period at the same time as you. The idea that periods sync has been around forever. I always saw it as one of those cool, mysterious things about women: We're so in tune with our best friends that our menstrual cycles actually align! But it turns out this phenomenon may be no more than a myth.
For a new study, the period tracking app Clue partnered with data scientists from the University of Oxford to follow the cycles of 360 pairs of volunteers who shared a close relationship—say, as sisters, roommates, or partners—for three months via the app. None of the participants were on hormonal birth control.
The researchers discovered that over time, the women's menstrual cycles were more likely to diverge than sync. After three months, almost 76% of the pairs had a larger difference in their cycle start dates than they did at the beginning of the study. And 100 of those 273 pairs actually lived together.
It's worth nothing that this study has not been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. But the findings do line up with prior research.
RELATED: 10 Things That Mess With Your Period
There have been other studies on menstrual synchrony (as it's technically called) that concluded period syncing isn't actually a thing. One from 2006, for example, tracked 186 Chinese women living together in dorms for a year, and found no evidence that their periods were lining up.
The concept of period syncing seems to have originated in a 1971 study published in Nature. The author suggested that one woman's pheromones might shift another woman's cycle. But that study has seen been criticized for its methodology.

So why does it seem like you and your bestie get your periods at the same time? Alas, it's most likely due to chance. Because our menstrual cycles vary in length, you and your friend are bound to overlap at times, and those times probably stick in your mind.
From Quanta Magazine (find original story here).
Ants are capable of remarkable feats of coordination. They can forge complex paths through the jungle, build sophisticated structures, and adapt foraging patterns to fit their environment, all without orders from a centralized source. Deborah Gordon, a biologist at Stanford University, hopes to uncover the simple rules that produce complex patterns from simple individual actions.
Ants in particular excel at collective search, automatically tailoring their search strategy to efficiently cover large areas of ground. Gordon has found parallels between the algorithms ant colonies use for foraging and the man-made ones that underlie the Internet. Given how long ants have been solving these kinds of problems, Gordon hopes that she will uncover new algorithms that will ultimately make large-scale computing networks cheaper and more efficient.
Quanta met with Gordon at a social insects conference in Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., shortly before she left for a trip to Mexico to study routing algorithms in arboreal ants. An edited and condensed version of the conversation follows.
QUANTA MAGAZINE: How did you first become interested in ants?
DEBORAH GORDON: I was originally interested in developmental biology and understanding how an embryo develops without any central control. I was looking for a system like an embryo, only one where I can see everything — it's much easier for me to understand things I can see. I chose ants for that reason. Nowadays you can see a lot in a developing embryo. But that wasn't true when I was starting out.
You've been studying the same ant colonies in Arizona for 30 years. Was that your intention from the start?
No. When I first started out, I was interested in variation among colonies, so I marked colonies so as to know when I was looking at the same one the following year. I noticed that some colonies got bigger from year to year, so I learned how a colony grows. At that point, no one knew how long a harvester ant colony could live. I went back to check the colonies every year—five years passed, then ten. Then I had no choice but to continue.
What has most impressed you about ants?
I'm impressed by the contrast between the coordinated responses of colonies and the ineffective and incomplete actions of individual ants. In other words, colonies accomplish a lot, but no ant is very competent on its own.
For example, ants are really good at collective search; a group of ants can cover the search area thoroughly without any central control. They do it through simple interactions, just touching antennae. When many ants are in a small space, they meet often and tend to take a convoluted path that keeps them stuck in one place. When few ants are in a large space, they don't meet that often. They stretch out their paths and cover more ground.
For harvester ants, we've learned that an ant decides whether to go out of the nest and forage using the rate at which it meets ants coming in with food. It's a form of positive feedback; the faster ants are coming in with food, the more ants go out. Each ant decides only when its rate of interaction is high enough to go out. Overall this system allows the colony to regulate foraging activity so that the ants don't go out unless there's enough food to make it worthwhile.
You called the harvester ant algorithm the “anternet.” Why?
I worked with Balaji Prabhakar, a colleague at Stanford, to figure out the algorithm that the harvester ants are using to regulate foraging. He pointed out that the algorithm is similar to the Transmission Control Protocol, which regulates data traffic on the Internet to make sure that data don't go out unless there's enough bandwidth. Both systems use simple, local feedback to regulate activity. I think we might be able to find other algorithms that ants use to solve engineering problems that we haven't thought of yet. I am interested in the idea that evolution might produce different algorithms in different systems to solve the same problems.
But for evolution to produce algorithms that help the colony, evolution must work at the level of groups, not just individuals.
From the perspective of evolution, the colony is really the individual, because it is the colony that reproduces. Ants don't make more ants, colonies make more colonies. So if we think about how ant behavior evolves, we have to look at colonies.
How do decisions made by individual ants alter the behavior of the colony as a whole?
In the desert, water is an important constraint. Ants lose water just being outside and meandering around. But they get their water from the seeds they eat, so they have to spend water to get water. No individual ant is making the decision to save water and stay home. But small differences in how ants respond to interactions can add up to big differences in how colonies forage, which in turn affects how many offspring colonies have. We found that natural selection favors the colonies that conserve water. I call it “the rewards of restraint.” I think this is the first study that's been able to track the evolution of collective behavior in a natural population of animals. A simple, local behavior—how ants respond when one meets another—is being selected for because of the outcome for the whole colony.
Has evolution produced any other algorithms?
I'm working with another computer scientist on the routing networks that ants use. Arboreal ant species in Mexico follow very complicated paths through the tangle of trees and vines and other vegetation that connects nests and food sources. The trails break all the time, for instance when a twig snaps or an animal crosses the path. But the highway is easily repaired. How do they find a new route so quickly—on the scale of minutes—when there are so many different choices? We think they use a strategy that doesn't take the shortest route but reestablishes the path very quickly and keeps the flow going. In some ways they have sacrificed what we think of as efficiency for resiliency. We think we have a model that makes sense, and we are testing it in field work.
How might this be important in computing?
In computing, there's a tradeoff between the amount of information available and the cost of keeping and organizing that information. We're interested in ways ants have evolved to solve this basic problem.
In this case, we are interested in the analogy to routing algorithms in computer systems where the straightest or shortest path might require a lot of information. Say you're driving somewhere unfamiliar, and the exit you want to take is blocked. You can find your way around if you have a map. But how would you do that without any information? Without an address?
Collective search faces a similar problem. In robotics, there's now a lot of interest in using the cheapest robots that require as little information as possible and that work together. A system like this is more robust to failure. Rather than sending one really complex robot to explore Mars or to search a burning building, it makes sense to send a group of cheap robots that will still work as a group even if one malfunctions. There are probably many new algorithms that ants have evolved to solve problems like this that we haven't thought of. What we need to do is go take a look.
How do ant colonies change over time?
I found that a harvester ant colony's behavior changes as it gets older and larger. Some aspects of network behavior just depend on size. In harvester ants, individual worker ants (other than the queen) live only a year, so it's not the ants that get older and wiser, it's the colony. That's a puzzle, and it got me thinking about interaction networks, because I was looking for something that the ants could do in the same way but would have a different outcome if there are more ants. For example, I'm an ant, and I follow a rule that says, if I meet another ant at a certain rate, I do x. In a large colony, I might meet more ants. The same rule might have a different outcome if the colony is bigger because the rate of interaction would change.
We're surrounded by giant networks—the Internet, our brains—so that got me interested in other systems. How does the behavior of a network scale as it gets larger?
How does it scale?
Older ant colonies are much more stable than young ones. If you create a disturbance, such as making a mess for them to clean up—I put out little piles of toothpicks—the older colonies eventually ignore the mess and get back to foraging. I think that in these colonies, with large numbers of foragers, the processes that drive them to forage override the response to the mess.
You're also exploring how ants resemble neurons.
An ant adds up its recent interactions to decide what to do. A neuron adds up its recent stimulation from other neurons to decide whether to fire. Neuroscience already has a sophisticated modeling framework for understanding how that kind of system works. I am working with theoretical neuroscientists to apply this framework to ants.
You've launched a citizen science project to encourage the public to study different kinds of ants. What's the benefit of studying new ant species?
Only 50 of the roughly 14,000 species of ants have ever been studied. It's likely that if we study new species, we will uncover new algorithms. We developed a small kit for students to see how different species of ants do collective search. If kids try this with different species, they will probably make discoveries about species that no one has ever looked at.

Why we should all support glTF 2.0 as THE standard asset exchange format for game engines By: Juan Linietsky
Introducing glTF 2.0
glTF 2.0 was introduced two months ago by Khronos, the body behind Vulkan and OpenGL.
Today, this format was added to Godot, which now supports the full specification. The reasoning behind this late feature addition is that, now that we released 3.0 alpha1, users need more content to test with the new 3D engine.
Sites like Sketchfab provide plenty of PBR-ready assets for downloading, and plugins that export scenes from other popular game engines to this format.
The surprise, though, is how good this format is for video game asset exchange. Nothing as good existed before, and it solves a problem that we, as an industry, have been struggling with for a long time.
Khronos, with glTF 2.0, has given us a fantastic chance to standardize a smooth workflow between 3D modelling software and game engines. To better understand why, a list of previous attempts will be explained and why they failed.
OBJ / 3DS
The first formats used for asset exchange were Wavefrom .OBJ and Autodesk .3DS. Both are formats from the early days of 3D computer graphics (late 80s, early 90s). Despite their popularity, they only support basic geometry, and .OBJ does not even support object transforms.
Collada
Collada (also from Khronos) was the first serious attempt to create an open exchange format, but it was not really intended to be used by the game industry (until later, at least). It was more of a tool to exchange assets between 3D modelling applications.
Despite supporting almost everything a modern game engine needs, the format fell into disuse. There are many reasons for this:
The specification was not that complex, but parsing an XML based format can be a hassle as all datatypes need to be converted from text. Implementers preferred libraries to do this work, but no good libraries existed. FCollada was discontinued, and OpenCollada turned out to be bigger than most game engines.
The specification was very ambiguous in many aspects, such as how data, skeletons, blend shapes, etc. had to be exported. It also gave exporters a lot of freedom in units used, as well as world transform specifications (e.g., which axis was up). All this resulted in a tremendous work for anyone wanting to parse the format.
Most exporters are, to this day, broken. IDs are not unique in some, the order of sections dictated by the spec is not respected, and information is often missing.
Collada is a text format, so loading large files is slow.
Autodesk (willingly or unwillingly) worked against the format adoption by including an incomplete and buggy exporter in their products. To this day, a large amount of developers believes Collada is not capable of a lot of functions that it actually is.
Blender (willingly or unwillingly) worked against the format by adopting an incomplete exporter.
While many factors worked against it, the truth is that Collada was never good enough.
FBX
One would assume (given its popularity) that FBX is pretty much the industry standard... except there isn't any standard published by Autodesk about it.
FBX is used via the FBX SDK, which has a very restrictive license. This license makes it very hard to use in open source projects (an EULA must be accepted by the user unless a special license is purchased from Autodesk).
Besides the legal issues, implementing the library is rather difficult and suffers many of the same format ambiguity issues Collada does. One could argue, though, that the main technical advantage about it (besides working with the most popular 3D modelling applications) is that the file format is binary, so parsing it is fast.
That said, as an industry, we should look for true standards to work with. As useful as FBX may be, Autodesk alone controls its future.
OpenGEX
OpenGEX was born from one of the most brilliant minds the game industry has ever produced: Eric Lengyel, who single-handedly created the C4 engine. It has a well defined specification and comes with exporter plugins for the most common 3D modelling software, as well as documentation and support libraries. It also has the very innovative approach of encoding floating point data as hexadecimal for quick and efficient parsing (despite being text based).
Unfortunately, OpenGEX did not catch up. The main reasons I can think of are:
There are no open tools where you can test and visualize your exported files, save for Eric's own commercial engine.
It's not really standard, as it's not registered in any relevant body.
Development is not peer-based, only Eric decides the future of the format.
In short, for a format not so open, it does not offer many advantages over FBX.
glTF 1.0
The first version of glTF had many good ideas, but it was clearly intended as a storage format for WebGL. In fact, materials could only be created by writing GLSL shader code. This made format unusable for anything else, as modern game engines only allow the user to create materials by customizing a small part of the rendering pipeline.
glTF 2.0: What makes it great?
By just reading the spec, the advantages should become clear. Still, I will detail the key points below:
JSON based
GLTF is a JSON based format. It's very easy to parse and the data already comes typed. This significantly reduces the need to rely on complex third party libraries to read it. Many languages (e.g., Javascript, Python) even support this format natively.
Comparing the size (in lines of code) of both Godot's glTF 2.0 and Collada importers, the result is as follows:
Collada: ~5000 loc
glTF 2.0: ~2000 loc
Godot does not even use third party libraries to parse these files. This makes it more evident how simple the format is in comparison.
Theoretically, glTF2 should be less efficient to parse than Collada, as it requires parsing the whole JSON into memory. Collada can be streamed in by using a SAX XML parser but, in practice, glTF beats Collada hands down. This is because (besides many Collada exporters not obeying the specification, so they can't be parsed as SAX anyway) glTF has yet another killer feature:
Separate binary blob for arrays
glTF allows specifying an external file for the big data, in binary format. It even supports many common GPU data types, so in practice this file can be moved in chunks directly to the GPU memory. Yes, glTF is the first of these formats that can even be used efficiently as in-engine data.
Even if engines would prefer to import to their own format, like Godot does, glTF is extremely fast to export and import. This makes it ideal for making changes to a complex file in the 3D software and updating them to the 3D engine almost instantly.
No ambiguity
glTF's file structure is crystal clear. No extra or redundant data exists. There is only one way the scene definition can be understood, which gives no room for exporters to take shortcuts. It also makes life for importers simpler, warranting that all existing scenes will work on the first implementation attempt.
Collections of objects of the same type are stored in JSON arrays and referenced by indices. No more confusing IDs.
There is also no support for different coordinate systems or units, and this is great. Quoting one of the first paragraphs of the specification:
glTF uses a right-handed coordinate system, that is, the cross product of X and Y yields Z. glTF defines the y axis as up.
The units for all linear distances are meters.
All angles are in radians.
Positive rotation is counterclockwise.
Just one simple use case to care about. No extra conversions. All work is left to the exporter. As there are usually way more importers than exporters, this is an excellent design decision.
Modern features
glTF 2.0 fully supports skeletons and morph targets, which can be parsed easily and unambiguously.
It also supports PBR based materials using the Disney/Unreal format, which is what most engines and 3D modelling applications use nowadays, with albedo, metallic, roughness, normal, emission and ambient occlusion. It also handles two-sidedness and transparent materials, including alpha to coverage.
Extensions for handling shader material graphs are in the work.
Great animation support
Animation support is also well done. glTF 2.0 supports multiple animations per file, which is ideal for exporting character actions (though be careful with some official examples, they are old and incomplete). It also supports many key interpolation types, such as Catmull Rom and Cubic Spline.
Animations are also stored in the binary file, so they can be loaded quickly.
Clean documentation
The specification is very complete, I personally found it well worded and not lacking in any area. There are many sample files to test all functions.
Flexible extension support
glTF uses the same extension system as other Khronos specifications, which is proven to be centralized and well organized.
Strong backing
glTF is developed by individuals from many companies, such as Microsoft, Unity, Google, Adobe, NVidia, Oculus, etc. in collaboration with Khronos.
Best of all, it's completely open and everyone can contribute!
glTF is an open standard and the development process is also transparent.
Support glTF!
For glTF to succeed, it needs strong developer adoption. Ask your favorite 3D modelling software or engine developer to support it!
Currently, the Blender exporter is in the works and not complete, and there is no support at all for Autodesk products (export plug-ins need to be written).
This is the best chance we'll ever have in a long time for a proper, open standard. Let's work together to make it happen!
At Twist Bioscience's office in San Francisco, CEO Emily Leproust pulled out of her tote bag two things she carries around everywhere: a standard 96-well plastic plate ubiquitous in biology labs and her company's invention, a silicon wafer studded with a similar number of nanowells.
Twist's pitch is that it has dramatically scaled down the equipment for synthesizing DNA in a lab, making the process cheaper and faster. As Leproust gave her spiel, I looked from the jankety plastic plate, the size of two decks of cards side by side, to the sleek stamp-sized silicon wafer and politely nodded along. Then she handed me a magnifying lens to look down the wafer's nanowells. Inside each nanowell was another 100 microscope holes.
That's when I actually got it. The 96-well plate was not equivalent to the wafer, the entire plate was equivalent to one nanowell on the wafer. To put a number on it, traditional DNA synthesis machines can make one gene per 96-well plate; Twist's machine can make 10,000 genes on a silicon wafer set the same size as the plate.
Josh Valcarcel/WIRED
OK, but who wants to order 10,000 genes? Until recently, that question might have been met with silence. “It was a lonely time,” says Leproust of her early fundraising efforts for Twist. Fast forward a couple years, though, and Twist has just signed a deal to sell at least 100 million letters of DNA—equivalent to tens of thousands of genes—to Ginkgo Bioworks, a synthetic biology outfit that inserts genes into yeast to make scents like rose oil or flavors like vanillin. Ginkgo is at the forefront of a wave of synthetic biology companies, bolstered by new gene-editing technologies like Crispr and investor interest.
“We're Intel and Ginkgo is Microsoft,” says Leproust, which sounds exactly the kind of rhetoric you hear all the time in startupland. But her words reveal Twist's specific ambition to be the driver behind synthetic biology innovations. Synthesizing genes in a lab allows biologists to design—down to the letter—the ones they want to test. Companies out there are already tinkering with DNA in various cells to create spider silk, cancer treatments, biodegradable plastic, diesel fuel—and Twist's founders thinks the company can become the driving technology behind that new world.

How to Make DNA in a Lab
Making DNA—writing the “code of life” can sound grandiose—but in practice, it is a tedious process of moving tiny amounts of liquid back and forth. DNA is a long molecule, and writing DNA is adding the right chemicals—sugary building blocks designated A, T, C, and G—in the right order hundreds of times over. Before cofounding Twist in 2013, Leproust had spent over a decade figuring how to scale up this process for Agilent Technologies, a laboratory tech company spun off from Hewlett-Packard.
All DNA synthesis has two basic steps: Make short fragments of DNA, called oligonucleotides or “oligos” for short, and then use enzymes to stitch the oligos together. The classic method, which has been around since the 1980s, uses the 96-well plate Leproust showed me. A machine spits out DNA-building blocks into each well in sequence, and one oligo goes into each well. (Oligos are usually 100 letters long, so a gene that is 1,000 letters long takes up one whole plate.) But because the wells are so big, you get a lot of DNA—“millions more than you need,” says Alan Blanchard, who helped developed a DNA synthesis system later licensed to Agilent. And you waste a lot of expensive chemicals.
In recent years, though, companies like Agilent have turned away from the old workhorse plate in favor of microarrays, which they can use to make tens of thousands of oligos at once, by synthesizing them on a piece of glass the size of a microscope slide, directed with a precise inkjet nozzle. Microarrays have the opposite problem of the classic method: Now you have a lot of unique oligos, but only a tiny amount of each. So you need an extra step to make more copies. This is the technique Blanchard initially helped develop, and Leproust and one of her co-founders Bill Peck perfected while at Agilent.
Leproust, Peck, and a third cofounder, Bill Banyai, realized DNA synthesis needed a middle ground between the classic method and microarrays. Thus, the holes inside the nanowells of Twist's wafer are essentially thousands of reasonably-sized test tubes. You end up with the right amount of oligos, neither too much nor too little.
Moreover, the silicon wafer is cleverly optimized for the second step of gene synthesis—the stitching of oligos together—because Twist's engineers figured out how to cut down on moving tiny volumes of liquid. Twist's proprietary machine, a small-car sized system that WIRED wasn't allowed to photograph, deposits one oligo into each of the 100 or so holes inside of a nanowell. On a 96-well plate, you'd have to suck the fluid out of 96 wells to combine it with the right enzymes. With microarrays, you'd release the oligos from the glass plates and pooling them with the stitching enzymes. But because of the nested design of the nanowells, Twist can add enzymes and then combine all the oligos already in one nanowell. Every step happens on the silicon wafers.
Josh Valcarcel/WIRED
This might not sound mind blowing, but not having to move around hundreds of tiny volumes of oligos is a big deal when you scale up to thousands of genes. “The major cost in this sort of thing is the handling of these little DNA sequences,” says Blanchard. “If you can get away from handling them individually, that's enormous cost savings.”
The DNA Business
When Twist launches its beta program in 2016, it will offer gene synthesis at 10 cents per letter with a guaranteed turnaround time of 10 days. (Twist delivered DNA sequences to 100 customers in its alpha program earlier this year.) That price puts it just ahead of Gen9, another buzzy gene synthesis startup, with a standard rate of 18 cents per letter and 20 days turnaround time.
Gen9's founders include scientific bigwigs like Harvard geneticist George Church, and in 2013, as Twist was just getting off the ground, Leproust's former employer, Agilent, put $21 million into Gen9. The twist, so to speak, is that Gen9 uses Agilent's inkjet technology to make oligos—the same technology Leproust worked on, which she is more than happy to point out.
Where Twist lags behind its competitors though—both Gen9 and more traditional gene synthesis companies like GenScript and Blue Heron—is length. The other companies offer sequences thousands and sometimes even tens of thousands letters of DNA long. Twist, the newest of these companies, is focusing on sequences below 1,800 for its beta program but says it eventually plans to go longer.
Gen9's head of R&D, Devin Leake, also points out that making DNA is not the hardest part of synthetic biology. Synthesizing a gene is chemistry; getting a gene to work in a cell is biology, and that comes with all of biology's messiness. A gene sometimes just gets never turned on in a cell—or it's only half turned on for reasons that seem mysterious. Gen9 offers a gene design service to optimize a gene's sequence, but it's still no guarantee.
That means the biggest risk is still for companies like Ginkgo, the ones actually doing the biology. If competition drives down the price of DNA synthesis—and indeed, Gen9's now running a promotion at 10 cents per letter that matches Twist's price—that still makes it cheaper for synthetic biology companies to experiment with different genes. “Our customers have more ideas than money,” says Leproust. Cheaper genes alone won't fix that, but it'll definitely help.
From the labradors we share our homes with to the legendary sea monsters of Western folklore, we've sought to understand our fellow earthlings since the beginning of humankind. Whether it's superstition, exaggeration, or just plain misunderstanding, sometimes our quest for knowledge can lead to some misguided conclusions. Here are nine widely believed animal misconceptions that don't hold up to scientific scrutiny.
1. Bears Hibernate
Ask anyone which animal comes to mind when they hear the word “hibernate” and their response will likely be a brown or black bear. It may be common to picture a burly, fattened-up mama grizzly slumbering away in her winter den deep in the woods while the white snow blankets everything in sight. This follows with the dangerous misconception that sleeping bears are nearly impossible to arouse during the winter months. True hibernation occurs when an animal drastically lowers their body temperature to nearly match their surroundings, and sleeps through the winter. Hibernating animals, like woodchucks, appear lifeless and are not easily awakened.
Bears, on the other hand, exhibit torpor, a shorter-term reduction in body temperature accompanied by lethargy. Heart rate drops, but not as much as that of true hibernators. Though less active than usual, bears in torpor can readily respond to external stimuli. So don't forget your bear spray on your next snowshoeing trip.
2. Goldfish Have a Three-Second Memory Span
Contrary to popular belief, behavioral studies show that goldfish can associate sounds with feeding times, operate tiny levers, and even recognize their owners' presence. Each of these behaviors requires a lengthier memory span than three seconds.
3. Wasps: Leave Them Alone, and They'll Leave You Alone
Although this may be the general rule for furry bumblebees, wasps such as yellowjackets have been known to sting unprovoked. Factors such as proximity to nest, season, and former unrelated injury can result in wasp aggression.
4. Bulls Are Enraged by the Color Red
A belief that originated in Spanish bullfighting is that bulls are angered by the color red. In fact, it is the swift motion of the red cloth used by matadors in bullfighting arenas that causes the bull to charge. Studies suggest that bulls, like many animals, are actually colorblind, meaning that they are incapable of distinguishing between certain colors.
5. Head Lice Have a Preference for Clean or Dirty Hair
Head lice, or Pediculus humanus capitis, were once thought to thrive primarily in oily, dirty hair. Sometime after, it was believed that the parasitic insects actually preferred cleaner hair because it allowed for easier mobility. Neither of these assumptions are true. The common louse likes your hair no matter when you last showered.
6. Touching a Baby Bird Will Cause Its Mother to Abandon It
The falsehood that mother birds will abandon their offspring if touched by a human derives from the belief that birds can pick up on human scent. In fact, most birds have a rather poor sense of smell and are unlikely to readily abandon their young. This doesn't mean, however, that you should go picking up every young chick you find. Young, seemingly helpless birds often have their mothers closeby, carefully watching. Human disturbance (rather than human touch) near a nesting site is far more likely to contribute to a mother bird stranding her young ones.

7. Daddy Longlegs Are the Most Venomous Spiders
Daddy longlegs is the nickname most commonly given to a few familiar critters—most commonly, the harvestman. How many times have you heard that daddy longlegs' are the most venomous spiders in the world? Harvestmen have no venom glands and aren't even spiders, but another type of arachnid. Unlike spiders, harvestmen produce no silk, have no fangs, and have one main body part instead of two.
8. Bats Are Blind
The common misconception that bats are blind still exists. Though some bats have poor eyesight, they are certainly not blind and many bats can see as well as humans.
9. Camels Store Water in Their Humps
Camels' large humps store fat, not water, much like the fatty tissue found under human skin. These reservoirs of fat allow camels to survive for days in the desert sun without stopping for food.

Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanBrexit and exit: A transatlantic comparison Five takeaways from McCabe's allegations against Trump The Hill's 12:30 Report: Sanders set to shake up 2020 race MORE (R-Wis.) said Thursday that Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsTrump says he hasn't spoken to Barr about Mueller report Ex-Trump aide: Can't imagine Mueller not giving House a ‘roadmap' to impeachment Rosenstein: My time at DOJ is 'coming to an end' MORE should recuse himself from any FBI investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia only if Sessions is “the subject” of that probe.
“Should he recuse himself? I think he answered that question this morning, which is if he himself is the subject of an investigation, of course he would,” Ryan told reporters. “But if he is not, I don't see any purpose or reason for doing this.”
A handful of Republicans on Thursday called for Sessions to distance himself from any Justice Department probes after new reports that the then-senator had talked twice with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. during the 2016 campaign.
That contradicted Sessions's confirmation hearing testimony when he told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had not had any contact with the Russians.
Asked whether he believed Sessions had misled the Senate panel, Ryan said he had not read the transcripts and referred reporters to the Judiciary Committee.
Tough questions about Sessions dominated Ryan's weekly news conference. On several occasions, the Speaker pointed out that there is sufficient evidence Russia did try to meddle with the 2016 presidential election to aid Trump. But he clarified that there is no evidence that anyone on the Trump team was working with the Russian government to affect the outcome of the election.
“We have been presented with no evidence that an American was colluding with the Russians to meddle in the elections,” Ryan said.
It's very common, Ryan said, for lawmakers to meet with foreign ambassadors during the course of their duties.
“We meet with ambassadors all the time. I did a reception about 100 yards that way with about 100 ambassadors. I don't remember all the ones I met with,” he said. “It's really common for members of Congress to meet with ambassadors. I met with the Indian ambassador yesterday.”
Mark Siegel, a former Democratic Party official, played a key role in drafting the superdelegate provisions, which the party adopted in response to what happened with George McGovern at the 1972 convention. In a Clinton campaign email released by WikiLeaks, he offers the campaign a plan to dupe Bernie Sanders supporters into feeling like they “won” a major superdelegate “reform” at the Democratic National Convention.
As Siegel highlights, the Democratic Party establishment went against the liberal wing of the party and added party officials. The Democratic National Committee voted on delegate selection rules and made themselves “automatic delegates.”
“Bernie and his people have been bitching about superdelegates and the huge percentage that have come out for Hillary,” Siegel writes. “Since the original idea was to bring our elected officials to the convention ex-officio, because of the offices and the constituencies they represent, why not throw Bernie a bone and reduce the superdelegates in the future to the original draft of members of the House and Senate, governors and big city mayors, eliminating the DNC members who are not state chairs or vice-chairs?”
Siegel adds, “Frankly, DNC members don't really represent constituencies anyway. I should know. I served on the DNC first as executive director and then as an elected member for 10 years.”
“So if we ‘give' Bernie this in the convention's rules committee, his people will think they've ‘won' something from the party establishment. And it functionally doesn't make any difference anyway. They win. We don't lose. Everyone is happy.”
The plan stemmed from Siegel's belief that having their issues or agenda represented in the Democratic Party platform would not be a “sufficiently tangible prize for the Bernie wing of the convention.”
Also, he maintained it was critical for “all delegates, especially those representing losing candidates, [to] emerge from the convention feeling that they have won something, achieved something tangible.”
“I think this is terribly important especially with people like Bernie's sometimes self-righteous ideologues. We want them to go home happy and enthusiastic in working their asses off for Hillary.”
The proposed plan was passed on to the campaign by Tamera Luzzatto, who was Clinton's chief of staff when she was a United States senator. She said she shared it as a favor and because of Siegel's role in the Democrats' delegate system.
If there was a response to Siegel, it did not happen via email, but the Clinton campaign and other Democratic Party officials made a meager attempt to satisfy the frustration of Sanders supporters with a “reform” of the superdelegate system.
Wellington Webb, the former mayor of Denver, told the Washington Post that this would help make sure “nobody does anything when Bernie speaks” and “nobody does anything when Hillary speaks.”
The “reform” agreed upon involved binding roughly two-thirds of superdelegates to state primaries and caucuses. A “unity commission” was created to further develop these rules after the general election.
None of the Democratic National Committee members lost any of their clout.
Because the Democrats and Clinton campaign rejected the full abolition of superdelegates, the “reform” did not do much to calm the anger of Sanders supporters. Democrats forced conformity and manufactured consent during the convention to give the public the appearance that Sanders supporters were not protesting.
In fact, as Rania Khalek reported for Shadowproof, officials confiscated signs, drowned out protest chants with counter-chants, locked down the arena during certain speeches to deter walkouts, and stationed party-appointed whips in the aisles to monitor rowdy Sanders delegates and signal to Clinton supporters when to chant and hold up pro-Clinton signs.
EPICENTER is coming to St. Petersburg!
10 teams, eight invitees and two closed qualifiers, will battle it out for their share of a $500,000 prize pool, double the typical ESL/Dreamhack event. The group stage will be held at the Yubileyny Sports Palace on October 28-29.
Two-stage open qualifiers will be held between September 2 and 10 in Europe, the CIS, America, and China. A closed qualifier stage will follow from September 11 to October 1. On October 23, qualifier winners will compete against each other for the final two spots in the group stage.
The hefty purse money and vaunted EPICENTER reputation have drawn in the best teams in the world, too. SK and Astralis are the first of eight teams to receive invites. EPICENTER released a teaser for the event yesterday, in which subtle Easter eggs in the video (team logos briefly appearing), strongly implied that Gambit and FaZe have also received invites.
The launch date for ticket prices and sales will be announced later at the tournament organizer's official website, http://epicenter.gg.

We've all seen articles devoted to the various web desing “rules” out there. In fact, they've probably been drilled into all of our heads ad nauseum. And for many, they serve as a comforting set of guidelines that make our lives easier, at least when it comes to design.
But what about those occasions when you have an idea that doesn't quite fit in the rules? Or what if you're just sick and tired of doing everything by the book and you want to challenge yourself creatively? Are the rules really set in stone?
The answer to that is of course not. For one thing, a lot of the rules are outdated. So while they might have been true at one time, they're not anymore. The other thing is that there are almost always circumstances that demand that the rules be bent or broken entirely. And as designers, we need to learn to recognize those times.
Below are a bunch of commonly-accepted web design rules, along with the reasons you might want to break them, and how to do so effectively. We've also included examples for each and the one unbreakable rule.
Your Web Page Layout and Design Should be Consistent Throughout the Site
Consistency can help make your visitors feel at home on your site right away. This makes them more likely to look around and spend more time there. Comfort is a good thing. Most of the time.
But there are two problems with this rule. First, some designers interpret it to mean that every page should be virtually identical. They use the same basic template for every page on your site, regardless of the content present. This almost always results in a site that's boring and no fun to look at.
The other problem is that different content often calls for different design treatment. Removing most of the consistency on your site can make for a much more interesting user experience. Note that I said “most” of the consistency, though. You'll want to choose one or two anchor points to keep your visitor from feeling like they're visiting a different site entirely every time they go to a different page. Consider keeping either a design element like your header or color scheme or something as simple as your logo the same on every page on your site.
Case in Point: Jason Santa Maria
Jason Santa Maria's website uses a different page design for a large number of his articles. It's refreshing and shows just how much thought he puts into the content he provides. At the same time, it's worth clicking through to multiple posts just for the designs alone. Always a good thing if you're looking for deep engagement from your visitors.
The unifying element that keeps you feeling like you're on the same site is the top navigation.
Don't Put Important Information Below the “Fold”
The “Fold” is a holdover term from the world of newspaper design. In newspapers, it referred to the area in the top half of the front page. This was the area of the paper that was visible if it was sitting at the newsstand. The most important news and headlines for the day were located there to entice people to buy the paper.
But here's the thing: websites don't really have a “fold”. It's often touted that the area visible on the home page without scrolling is above the fold, but that's not an accurate translation. With a newspaper, that above-the-fold area was important because it enticed people to purchase the newspaper. With a website, there's no decision like that necessary. Visitors are already on your site and scrolling isn't the same kind of psychological decision as handing over money to purchase something.
Case in Point: Sibley/Peteet Design
Most of the space “above the fold” is taken up by the header image. You have to either scroll down or click to see more.
Avoid Using Too Many Different Fonts
The theory behind this rule is that too many fonts make a page look cluttered and unorganized. And the improper use of too many fonts can result in an amteurish page at best, and a nearly unreadable one at worst.
But there are plenty of ways to use multiple fonts and create a gorgeous and usable website. The keys are to pay careful attention to the fonts you're using and the sizes and weights you're using them at. Use fonts that have similar weights, x-heights, and other related characteristics. Be careful about mixing too many colors or styles.
If you're not comfortable using multiple fonts, you can always cheat and use mutliple weights and styles of a single font. This is an easier technique that results in a very similar look, especially if you use a font that has a wide variety of variants (like Georgia or Times New Roman). Mixing italics, bold, small caps, all caps, and different sizes can result in a varied look that's still unified.
Case in Point: The Dollar Dreadful
The Dollar Dreadful site uses tons of fonts. There are well over twenty just on the home page. But the overall effect is impressive and works well within the theme of the site. It definitely wouldn't be as striking if limited to only one or two fonts.
Keep Everything Simple
Simplicity is overrated. I'm sure that single statement already has half of you up in arms and ready to stop reading. Simplicity has its place. But there are times when you want something to be complex. To be multi-layered. And there's nothing wrong with that. Chances are, your visitors are intelligent enough to figure things out if you still design with them in mind.
There's nothing wrong with keeping a website simple if that's what you (or your client) wants. But don't hold simplicity up as some kind of holy grail of web design. There are plenty of instances where a more complicated solution is better, and ultimately more usable, than a simple solution would be.
Case in Point: Aussie BBQ Legends
The home page for Aussie BBQ Legends is anything but simple. With plenty of content, animation, and a disorganized by easy to use navigation system, combined with a large background image, it creates a multi-layered and complex impression while still being easy and fun to use.
Put Navigation in Expected Places
Tradition tells us that navigation should be placed either in the header or the (left) sidebar of a website. Secondary navigation is often placed in the footer, but never primary navigation.
Why? People only look to those places because they've been trained to do so. But there's a lot more space available on a web page that could be used. And if done well, those places can be just as easy to use as navigation in the header or sidebar.
Case in Point: No One Belongs Here More than You
This site not only doesn't put navigation in the expected places (it's in the lower right-hand corner of the page), it also uses linear navigation. You can only go where the site's creator wants you to go.
Avoid Bright Background Colors
The idea here is that bright background colors make it difficult to read text placed over them. But with appropriate contrast and font size, text can be nearly as readable on a bright background as it is on a white or other neutral background. It all comes down to making appropriate choices for the design.
Case in Point: Helveticons
The Helveticons site has a very bright yellow background, but the use of a dark gray font makes everyone on the page easy to read.
Limit the Information on Each Page
The theory behind this one is that people don't like to read long articles. They want bite-sized information when they're online. Breaking up your content over multiple pages will supposedly help satisfy this desire.
But that's not always the case. Sometimes a visitor is seeking more detailed information. Clicking through to half a dozen different pages to find information that could have just as easily been placed on a single page is just a waste of time. Instead, break content up with headers or similar elements to make it easy for those who are just looking for one piece of information to find it without making things more difficult for those who want to read the entire thing.
Case in Point: Wikipedia
Okay, so Wikipedia might not be raking in the design awards, but it does have a huge amount of traffic and excellent user engagement. Some articles are short, but others might run a few thousand words (or longer). Wikipedia combines on-page navigation to major sections and headers, subheaders, and lists to create an excellent user experience that still puts a ton of information in a single page.
Focus on Lower Page Weight
This rule comes from the days when a large number of Internet users were connecting over a dial-up connection. Nowadays, you're going to find a lot more visitors are coming to your page over a broadband connection. And even those still using dial-up are probably used to have sites take ages to load.
Lower page weight is still important, though, to an extent. You still want your content to load in a matter of a few seconds for the majority of your users. But this can be achieved just as easily through good coding as purely by page size. Simple steps like specifying the size of images within a post or page can help make the page more usable even before it's fully loaded.
Case in Point: MWP
The Modern Web Projects (MWP) site has lots of big images, mostly in the background. But it pushes the page size well over a meg. And yet the page still loads just fine on a broadband connection and the size is well worth the effect.
Don't Use Big Background Patterns or images
This one ties closely to the previous rule about page weight. I've seen sites that advocate that your background pattern should be less than 60 pixels square. But with high-speed internet, that's not really necessary anymore.
Another argument against big patterns is that they can be distracting. That can be true of small patterns, too. Instead, just make sure the pattern you've chosen to use complements the rest of your site and doesn't detract from your content. Sometimes giving the background a bit less contrast or making it lighter or darker can help in this without changing the overall look too much.
Case in Point: McClanahan Studios
The background image for McClanahan Studios is huge. There's literally one image for the entire background of the home page. The same is true for each page on the site. And yet the background not only doesn't slow down the loading of the site, but also contributes a ton to the feel of the design.
Don't Use Splash Pages
Splash pages and intros are often created for absolutely no reason other than to show off the designer's Flash abilities. These types of splash pages should be avoided at all costs. But that doesn't mean there's never a place for splash pages.
Sometimes a splash page that's intended for a particular type of visitor is in order. Let's say you're a charity trying to get donations for a very specific project. Instead of changing your entire home page and site design, why not throw up a splash page that invites people to donate? It's simpler than changing your home page and often times it's more effective.
This rule might have been more accurate if they'd said not to use splash pages without a very good, very specific reason. (And, “because I want to” isn't a good enough reason.)
Case in Point: Kutztown University Communication Design Department
This splash page serves to simplify navigation for new visitors. Since education websites traditionally have a ton of content for many types of visitors (current students, prospective students, parents, alumni, etc.), simplifying the visitor's first experience is helpful and an appropriate use of a splash page.
Always Incorporate Social Media
This is another rule that a lot of you are probably ready to defend to the death. But the truth is, not every site is going to benefit from incorporating social media functions.
Let's say, for instance, that you're designing a site for a product that treats an embarrassing personal problem. Do you really think anyone is going to share a link or an article on Twitter? Are they going to post a link to a site like that on their Facebook wall? Probably not. So there's really no point in spending the extra time to incorporate social media options.
Case in Point: Preparation H
No one's going to share a link to this on Twitter, so why even bother giving them the option?
The Three-Click Rule
The idea that every page on your site should be accessible from your home page within three clicks is one of the most pervasive rules out there. In extreme versions, it's not even from the home page, it's from every other page on your site.
This rule was invented to make designers more carefully consider their information architecture. Which is a good thing. But that doesn't mean that visitors are never going to see a page just because it would take them five clicks to get there. The key is to use links and navigation to direct users in a way that makes them want to keep clicking.
Information should be easy to find. But that doesn't mean it needs to be instantly accessible. One tip, though, if you're going to use deeper navigation: include a prominent search box for those people who are too impatient to use your regular navigation options.
Case in Point: Barnes & Noble
Large online retailers are a great example of where the 3-click rule falls apart. If you go to the Barnes & Noble site to browse, it's virtually impossible to get to any specific category within three clicks. And unless the book you're looking for happens to be featured on one of their main pages, it's unlikely you'll get to a book within three clicks either. But B&N has excellent search funcionality, which means you can find whatever you're looking for if you're in a hurry, without sacrificing the ability to browse categories in a very intuitive and user-friendly way.
The Unbreakable Rule
Your user should always come first. Whatever rules you're thinking of following or breaking, always ask yourself if it's going to help or hinder your user. If you keep their needs and preferences in mind, no matter what rule you break, your site will still likely be successful within your target demographic.

A new Android malware has been discovered that disguises itself as Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator games. Reported by researchers at Palo Alto Networks, the malware family named "Gunpoder" was observed in 49 unique samples across three different variants.
The new malware is said to target Android users in at least 13 different countries including India, Iraq, Thailand, Indonesia, South Africa, Russia, France, Mexico, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Italy, the United States, and Spain. The researchers pointed out one interesting observation of "Gunpoder" that this malware only propagated among users outside of China.
Further, the researchers stressed that the findings highlighted the fine line between adware, which is usually skipped by antivirus software, and malware, which is hostile software with malicious tendency.
(Also see: Android Apps Connect to a Shocking Number of Advertisement Sites: Study)
The report notes that the samples of "Gunpoder" were uploaded to VirusTotal in November last year, and was marked as either benign or adware by all antivirus engines.
"While researching the sample, we observed that while it contained many characteristics of adware, and indeed embeds a popular adware library within it, a number of overtly malicious activities were also discovered, which we believe characterizes this family as being malware," notes Palo Alto Networks report.
According to researchers, the "Gunpoder" malware family can collect sensitive information from users; propagate itself through SMS message; potentially push fraudulent advertisements, and has ability to execute additional payloads.
Highlighting how the malware packaged itself into an emulator, the report adds, "Gunpoder samples embed malicious code within popular Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator games, which are based on an open source game framework. Palo Alto Networks has witnessed a trend of malware authors re-packaging open source Android applications with malicious code. Gunpoder makes use of this technique, which makes it difficult to distinguish malicious code when performing static analysis."
Detailing how the malware worked, the report added that soon after installation, the malware presented a declaring statement (when opened for the first time) explicitly notifying users that the app has ad-support and can allow the advertising library to collect information from the device. Once the app is launched, it will ask users to pay for a lifelong license of the game via a pop up dialog.

"If the user clicks the 'Great! Certainly!' button, a payment dialog will pop up, including PayPal, Skrill, Xsolla (the transaction link is no longer active) and CYPay. Users need to register a new PayPal or Skrill account or log in in to their existing account to pay $0.29 or $0.49. The CYPay supports offline gift voucher redeeming. Additionally, this payment dialog will pop up when users click the "Cheats" option within this app. In fact, the malware author added this malicious payment function into this 'Cheats' option, which is free in the original app," explains the report.
Even if users skip the payment dialog, the malware can propagate messages that will be sent out - if users pause the main activity of the malware, and second, if payment is declined then it will share a "fun game" link which will be a variant of this malware family.
"Interestingly enough, the Gunpoder sample will detect the country of the user. If the user is not located in China, this app will automatically send an SMS message, which contains a variant downloading link, to random selected friends in the background," adds report.
In recent days, Iran has conducted airstrikes against the self-proclaimed "Islamic State" (IS) terror group in Iraq, a US official said on Tuesday.
Comments from the Pentagon came after reports that American-made F4 Phantom jets from the Iranian air force had been targeting IS in the eastern Iraqi province of Diyala.
"We have the indications they have flown these missions in recent days in eastern Iraq," Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said.
Uncoordinated attacks
Iranian forces had already been active on the ground in assisting Shiite militia and Baghdad government units, but this was the first time that the US had confirmed that Tehran had launched manned aircraft from inside Iran to strike Islamic State targets in Iraq.
The strikes, however, were not coordinated with the US. "Nothing has changed about our policy of not coordinating military activity with the Iranians," Kirby said.
Iran has previously offered help to the coalition in the fight against IS, but its request was refused by the US, which has vowed it would not coordinate with Iran on military actions inside Iraq.
Washington is concerned that Iran, which backs the majority Shiite government, will provoke further resentment among Iraq's Sunni minority.
"We ask that they do those things in keeping with the idea that we don't further inflame sectarian tensions inside Iraq," Kirby added.

(CNN) Eating a Mediterranean diet may be your key to living longer. That's according to a new study led by Immaculata De Vivo , associate professor at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and Harvard Medical School.
The diet involves eating items off a menu that is rich in vegetables, fruits, nuts, beans and peas, unrefined grains, olive oil and fish. It keeps dairy, meat and saturated fats to a minimum. And you can have a glass of red wine with dinner without cheating.
It's not a requirement to drink it on this diet, but if you do drink alcohol, red wine in moderate amounts can be good for your health. Moderation means one drink for women and two for men, by the way. Studies show red wine can help protect against heart disease.

Asparagus is one of the best veggie sources of folate, a B vitamin that could help keep you out of a mental slump. "Folate is important for the synthesis of the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine," said David Mischoulon, associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. All of these are crucial for mood.

Walnuts are packed with tryptophan, an amino acid your body needs to create the feel-great chemical serotonin. (In fact, Spanish researchers found that walnut eaters have higher levels of this natural mood-regulator.) Another perk: "They're digested slowly," said Dr. David Katz, director of the Yale Prevention Research Center. "This contributes to mood stability and can help you tolerate stress."

Spinach is a great source of iron, which is a key component in red blood cells that fuel our muscles with oxygen for energy. But researchers in Sweden identified another way in which these greens might keep you charged: Compounds found in spinach actually increase the efficiency of our mitochondria , the energy-producing factories inside our cells. That means eating a cup of cooked spinach a day may give you more lasting power on the elliptical machine (or in your daily sprint to catch the bus).
Eating a breakfast high in protein is a good way to keep hunger at bay throughout the day. Eggs are full of choline, a nutrient that helps block fat from being absorbed in the liver. Choline may also help in preventing memory loss.
Beans, beans, the magical fruit; the more you eat, the more ... you lose weight. Black, kidney, white and garbanzo beans (also known as chickpeas) are good for fiber and protein. They fill you up and provide muscle-building material without any of the fat that meat can add to your meal.

Salmon is also a good source of lean protein. With this diet, doctors suggest eating fish at least two times a week. Salmon provides a high dose of omega-3 fatty acids, which studies show significantly lower the risk of heart disease. Omega-3 fatty acids fight back by reducing inflammation and slowing the rate of plaque buildup in blood vessels.

Many dieters shy away from nuts because of their high calorie and fat count. But studies show that eating a handful several times a week can prevent heart disease and ultimately help you shed pounds since they fill you up and stop you from snacking on other things. Almonds, in particular, contain lots of monounsaturated fats and fiber. (Healthy swap: Replace peanut butter with almond butter.)

Blueberries are often singled out as a kind of superfood because studies have shown they aid in everything from fighting cancer to lowering cholesterol. But all berries, including raspberries, strawberries and blackberries, contain antioxidants and phytonutrients . Worried about the price of fresh fruit? Experts say the frozen kind is just fine.
Quinoa is the popular whole-grain du jour because it also contains a good dose of protein to help build muscle. Yet including any type of whole grain in your diet -- from barley to brown rice -- will aid in weight loss by filling you up for fewer calories.

Doctors suggest using olive oil rather than butter to make your meals. A Spanish study found a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events among patients with a history of heart disease.

The Mediterranean diet is easy to find in the grocery store, contains nutrients that are known to enhance longevity and has other health benefits that are backed by peer-reviewed, scientific studies. Broccoli makes the list because it's one of nature's most nutrient-dense foods, with only 30 calories per cup. That means you get a ton of hunger-curbing fiber and polyphenols -- antioxidants that detoxify cell-damaging chemicals in your body -- with each serving.

This new research looks at data from 4,676 healthy middle-aged women involved in the Nurses' Health Study, an ongoing study tracking the health of more than 120,000 U.S. nurses since 1976.
It found women who ate a Mediterranean diet had longer telomeres.
Telomeres are part of your chromosomes, the thread-like structures that house your DNA. At the end of these chromosomes are telomeres, a kind of protective "cap" that keeps the structure from unraveling. It thereby protects your genetic information.
Even in healthy people, telomeres shorten with age. Shorter telomeres are associated with aging , lower life expectancy and age-related diseases such as artherosclerosis , certain cancers and liver disease.
Scientists believe oxidative stress and inflammation can also shorten them.
Fruits, vegetables, olive oils and nuts -- the key components of a Mediterranean diet -- have well-known a ntioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects . The team of U.S. researchers led by De Vivo therefore wanted to see whether the women who stuck with this diet had longer telomeres.
"This is the largest population-based study addressing the association between Mediterranean diet adherence and telomere length in healthy, middle aged women," they write. The study included completed detailed food questionnaires and blood tests to measure telomere length.
Each participant had a calculated diet score ranging from 0 to 9 points; a higher score signifies a closer resemblance to the Mediterranean diet. Each one point change in diet score corresponded an average of 1.5 years of telomere aging.
Telomere shortening is irreversible but healthy "lifestyle choices can help prevent accelerated shortening," says De Vivo.
This study's results provide "some insight into the underlying physiologic mechanism behind this association," indicating that greater adherence to this diet is significantly associated with longer telomeres, she says. Because of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of the Mediterranean diet, following this diet "could balance out the 'bad effects' of smoking and obesity," De Vivo says.
These findings further support "the health benefits of greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet for reduction of overall mortality, increased longevity and reduced incidence of chronic diseases, especially major cardiovascular diseases."
None of the individual dietary components was associated with telomere length. Researchers suggest that means the whole diet is an important element, rather than one item being a kind of superfood.
Dr. Peter Nilsson , a professor of Clinical Cardiovascular Research at Lund University in Sweden, who wrote an accompanying editorial, suggests that the variation in telomere length and dietary patterns may also be because of genetic background factors.
While promising, Nilsson believes that future studies "should take into account the possibility of interactions between genes, diet and sex."
With these results, De Vivo and her research team hope in the future to figure out which components of the Mediterranean diet may be having a bigger impact on telomere length.
Next they also hope to study the same thing in men.
TV Reviews All of our TV reviews in one convenient place.
The first episode of Penny Dreadful was good fun, but “Séance,” appropriately enough, takes the show one step beyond. Admittedly, on initial viewing my attention wandered a bit during the first half of the episode. Ostensible lead Ethan Chandler had already settled into a funk, and with the introduction of two new characters it felt like Penny Dreadful was still clearing its throat before getting on with the good stuff. But the good stuff arrived right on time with the bravura centerpiece that gives the episode its title and a stunning ending that had me needing to watch “Séance” again immediately. This time, almost everything clicked into place.

Let's start with those new characters. Billie Piper, who spent four seasons playing a prostitute on Secret Diary Of A Call Girl, is Brona Croft, an Irish prostitute. Given what we've learned about the other main characters, we can hope there's more to her than meets the eye. (Croft turned to flesh-peddling after her factory job washed out. Even 80 years before the Mad Men era, Sunday night TV characters lament being replaced by machines.) Croft befriends Chandler over their shared fondness for breakfast whiskey, and later serves as our introduction to Dorian Gray (Reeve Carney) when she turns up at his estate for a photo shoot that turns into the 19th century equivalent of a homemade sex tape. The fact that Croft is consumptive and coughing up blood serves as a turn-on for Gray, who doesn't look particularly worried about contracting a highly contagious, often fatal disease. (With good reason, assuming Gray conforms to his literary origins.)
Gray enters the orbit of previously introduced characters at a party thrown by Egyptologist and pretentious fop Ferdinand Lyle (Simon Russell Beale). Sir Malcolm and Vanessa are also in attendance, only because that's what they had to promise Lyle in order to secure his help to translate the hieroglyphics. Gray's chance encounter with Vanessa is all suggestive looks, innuendo, and surprisingly intimate close-talking, but before things can get too hot and heavy, Lyle interrupts with a surprise: Madame Kali will lead the group in a séance to summon the Egyptian goddess Amunet.
This is where shit gets crazy. Last week I noted the restraint in Eva Green's performance, but that's off the table as Vanessa is possessed by at least one paranormal entity (and possibly as many as three). This is Eva Green unleashed: She convulses; she assumes different personas; she speaks in tongues (or maybe Egyptian—mine is a little rusty); she bends over backwards and ululates and swears like a drunken sailor. It's a mesmerizing turn, but it's also a lot to unpack. Is Vanessa actually possessed by Sir Malcolm's son Peter, or is that merely an Exorcist-style trick performed by another demon? (Timothy Dalton's grief-stricken expressions certainly suggest that Sir Malcolm buys into it.) If it is Peter, is he suggesting an incestuous relationship between Sir Malcolm and Mina, or are his words addressed to someone else—an unseen vampire, perhaps? (There's some intentional ambiguity here as well as some dialogue that was unintelligible to me even after a couple of viewings.) Has Vanessa already been carrying another “older” demon inside her, long before Amunet takes her over?

Much of this will presumably become clear eventually, but for now withholding remains Penny Dreadful's primary narrative strategy. Sir Malcolm does finally get some answers out of Lyle regarding the hieroglyphics, which appear to portend an apocalypse brought about by the union of Amunet and Amun-Ra, another Egyptian god whose quest for perpetual life through feeding on souls suggests a strong kinship with Dorian Gray. While all this is going on, Victor Frankenstein is getting to know his new creation, who names himself Proteus by randomly choosing a page of Shakespeare. Proteus is a character from Two Gentlemen of Verona, but also the name of a sea god from Greek mythology. The name fits, as vague memories of his previous life suggest Proteus was a whaler. (The Greek Proteus was also a shape-shifter, and by the end of the episode, the creature's shape has certainly shifted.)
The relationship between Victor and Proteus is tender, even homoerotic at times, but our familiarity with the Frankenstein story lends a queasy sense of impending doom to their night on the town. This creature is sensitive and sweet-natured, making it all the more unbearable to think their walk on the waterfront will culminate with some sight or event or memory triggering the beast within. When that doesn't happen and they return safely to the lab, the relief is palpable but fleeting. What happens next is stunning and heartbreaking—literally, as a hand bursts through Proteus' chest and tears him in half. Proteus, as it turns out, was actually Victor's second attempt at reanimating life. Frankenstein's monster has returned. I hope John Logan popped a bottle of champagne after coming up with that particular reveal.
Still, I'm sorry to see Proteus go. Alex Price did an outstanding job taking the character through what turned out to be an accelerated arc, generating great sympathy with few words but deeply expressive features. Victor's hubris in tampering with the forces of nature had to be repaid, however, and I can't wait to see how the presence of his original creation tips the narrative scales.

Stray observations:
Sir Malcolm consults with the police on the recent murders (whether they want him to or not). The inspector doesn't believe the Ripper is involved and neither do I. The fact that the murders took place a month apart is a juicy clue. What fun are Frankenstein and Dracula without their pal the Wolf Man?
Lyle's “You must pay attention to me!” was hilarious and perfect.
Elsewhere in literary references, Vanessa and Victor both know Wordsworth's “Lines Written In Early Spring.” You can see why the recurring line “what man has made of man” would speak to Victor.
Chinese solar panel manufacturers are overcoming U.S. anti-dumping barriers by manufacturing in Turkey. CSUN, a Chinese company publicly traded on the NASDAQ, built a solar panel factory in Tuzla, a district of Istanbul, and entered the U.S. market with the "Made in Turkey" seal on its products.
Due to high taxes imposed on Chinese companies in the U.S., CSUN chose Turkey as an alternative manufacturing location. In turn, Turkey will be able to benefit from anti-dumping measures against Chinese panel manufacturers. CSUN is one of the companies that began production in Istanbul last year, and the company has signed an agreement with U.S.-based Suntitiy, which will allow CSUN to begin selling its products carrying the "Made in Turkey" seal, to a solar energy field in the Carolinas.
CSUN began production in 2013 in Tuzla in partnership with Sunergy and Seul Energy and is the first solar cell manufacturing plant in Turkey. The factory was built following an investment of $50 million and has a capacity of 100 megawatts. The U.S. had started to implement anti-dumping measures against China along with the EU over the past few years. According to a GTM Research analysis, the average market value of solar panels produced by Japan and EU countries is $0.83 per watt. This number is between $0.68 and $0.73 per watt among Chinese brands.
In 2011 some U.S. solar panel manufacturers requested a trade-related investigation into their Chinese rivals. They claimed that, because of the incentives provided by the Chinese government, Chinese companies are able to sell their products with lower prices. After the investigation concluded, the U.S. government began adopting anti-dumping policies, such as the U.S. Department of Commerce raising taxes on Chinese and Taiwanese companies from 10.74 percent to 165.04 percent. According to official numbers, Chinese firms exported $3.1 billion to the U.S. in 2011, but this number decreased to $2 billion in 2012 and $1.5 billion in 2013.
Because of similar obstacles within the EU, CSUN only exported panels totaling 6.4 megawatts to France from Turkey.

Nicky Maynard is bang on course for a Bluebirds return at Hull City in their last Championship match of the season after coming through a match with the club's reserves yesterday.
Cardiff City's £2.75m signing from West Ham eased through a development team encounter against Exeter City at the Vale Resort after making faster than expected progress following knee ligament surgery.
Maynard, who suffered his injury at Millwall last September led City's attack alongside Etien Velikonja, playing 75 minutes of a 0-0 draw.
Maynard won't be involved for champions Cardiff in this Saturday's Championship home match against Bolton, but could yet face Hull.
While Mackay ponders his team selection against Bolton, former Manchester United winger Chris Eagles insists he is out to wreck Bluebirds' promotion party – and prove national newspaper reports that he's on the way to Cardiff City next season are way off target.
Eagles is furious at claims he is ready to leave Bolton and sign for City, saying: “Cardiff are champions, but it would be nice to prove something to them. We were the better team when we played them at home and won 2-1.
“Congratulations to Cardiff because they deserve the title, but this Saturday I'm going out there to win.”
Eagles, 27, was angry at stories he would be leaving Bolton, saying: “People like to write these stories, but it's just a shame when they see you face-to-face and they say nothing. Behind your back they like to talk about you.
“People that know me at Bolton and fans who know me understand I'm 100% for the cause and I love it here. It's upsetting, to be honest, because these people don't know you but they have an opinion of you.”
Wanderers badly need to take something from their first-ever trip to the Cardiff City Stadium in order to keep play-off hopes in their own hands heading into the final game of the season.
“Personally, I'd like Cardiff to take their foot off the gas as champions, but we can't be too interested in that,” says Eagles. “It's their problem.
“I'm a Bolton player and no matter whether we're playing against the champions or someone who's been relegated, I want to beat them.
“We have two matches left and if our results are good enough then we'll crack on with the play-offs. You can't beat playing at Wembley and that's where we want to be. I'd be very proud to wear a Bolton shirt in the final at Wembley, but right now we are focused on Cardiff and nothing else.”
The door swings open and McKenzie Milton steps into the Florida midday sun.
While most of his UCF teammates have already stripped out of their practice gear and moved on with their day, Milton is the last to leave Nicholson Fieldhouse. His helmet and pads are heaped on his shoulders as he slowly marches toward the locker room.
It's been a little over a year since the 19-year-old first found himself on the Central Florida campus — a long, long way from his home in idyllic Hawaii. A world away from those things a teen misses most: family, the football field at Mililani High and a tasty treat from the Manapua Truck.
But those things don't bother Milton at the moment.
Right now, his only concern is leading his team onto the field at Spectrum Stadium Thursday evening against FIU during the Knights' season opener.
“I just want us to be locked in and at the end of the week, I want us to be 1-0,” Milton said.
UCF is coming off a bounce-back season, during which the team won six games following a winless campaign in 2015. But despite the positive strides the program made under first-year coach Scott Frost, Milton knew the team could do better — he could do better.
“I've been trying to take better care of my body and just be more around the team and get the team to buy into each other and be more cohesive,” he said
It's a far cry from the true freshman who stepped on campus last season.
“Every snap was a new snap. Every experience was new,” quarterbacks coach Mario Verduzco said while recalling Milton's freshman season. “Now, one year of fall camp, one year of game time and one year of spring … he's seen those things.”
Milton was rushed into the starting lineup due to injuries and accepted his coaches' critique of his performance during a tough rookie year. He devoted time to improving himself. He changed his diet, losing fried foods and adding more fruits and vegetables. He embraced the strength and conditioning program and added five pounds to his 5-foot-11 frame.
Junior tight end Jordan Franks, whose younger brother Feleipe plays for the Florida Gators, recalls his first impressions of Milton.
“Obviously, he's a fast kid but he came in about 160-170 [pounds], a real small kid but fast. He was really fast,” Franks said.
Verduzco praised Milton's offseason transformation.
“That bulk is good because it's going to help him stay healthy from snap to snap, aside from giving him more mass which allows him to put more thrust on the ball,” Verduzco said. “Those factors have helped him from a physical standpoint and it's given him more confidence.”
Milton's grasp of the offense last season was never a question. He finished the season by passing for 1,983 and 10 touchdowns while leading the UCF to a 4-6 mark in his 10 starts. But a combination of injuries and a lack of depth on the offensive line eventually caught up with the young signal caller, who struggled to get the offense moving during the final three games.
Verduzco and Frost worked with Milton this summer to improve his mechanics while simultaneously strengthening his arm.
“I think McKenzie's grown up,” Frost said. “I think his mechanics are improved and his familiarity with the offense has improved. He's made significant strides from last year. We kind of threw him into the fire last year. We had no intention of playing him last year … and he suffered through some good times and bad times last year.”
Milton admits sometimes during the season his thoughts would turn to home in Kapolei on the island of O'ahu, where he first developed his inclination to be a quarterback. But his parents, Mike and Teresa, helped ease the homesickness.
“My parents try and make it up here as much as possible and they're a very good support system for me,” Milton said.
But Milton also embraced Orlando, focusing on the life he is building at UCF.
“It's kind of a home away from home,” he said.

The genetic lineage of Europe mysteriously transformed about 4,500 years ago, new research suggests.
The findings, detailed today (April 23) in the journal Nature Communications, were drawn from several skeletons unearthed in central Europe that were up to 7,500 years old.
"What is intriguing is that the genetic markers of this first pan-European culture, which was clearly very successful, were then suddenly replaced around 4,500 years ago, and we don't know why," said study co-author Alan Cooper, of the University of Adelaide Australian Center for Ancient DNA, in a statement. "Something major happened, and the hunt is now on to find out what that was."
The new study also confirms that people sweeping out from Turkey colonized Europe, likely as a part of the agricultural revolution, reaching Germany about 7,500 years ago.
For decades, researchers have wondered whether people, or just ideas, spread from the Middle East during the agricultural revolution that occurred after the Mesolithic period.

To find out, Cooper and his colleagues analyzed mitochondrial DNA, which resides in the cells' energy-making structures and is passed on through the maternal line, from 37 skeletal remains from Germany and two from Italy; the skeletons belonged to humans who lived in several different cultures that flourished between 7,500 and 2,500 years ago. The team looked a DNA specifically from a certain genetic group, called haplogroup h, which is found widely throughout Europe but is less common in East and Central Asia.
The researchers found that the earliest farmers in Germany were closely related to Near Eastern and Anatolian people, suggesting that the agricultural revolution did indeed bring migrations of people into Europe who replaced early hunter-gatherers.
But that initial influx isn't a major part of Europe's genetic heritage today.
Instead, about 5,000 to 4,000 years ago, the genetic profile changes radically, suggesting that some mysterious event led to a huge turnover in the population that made up Europe.
The Bell Beaker culture, which emerged from the Iberian Peninsula around 2800 B.C., may have played a role in this genetic turnover. The culture, which may have been responsible for erecting some of the megaliths at Stonehenge, is named for its distinctive bell-shaped ceramics and its rich grave goods. The culture also played a role in the expansion of Celtic languages along the coast.
"We have established that the genetic foundations for modern Europe were only established in the Mid-Neolithic, after this major genetic transition around 4,000 years ago," study co-author Wolfgang Haak, also of the Australian Center for Ancient DNA, said in a statement. "This genetic diversity was then modified further by a series of incoming and expanding cultures from Iberia and Eastern Europe through the Late Neolithic."

Embed Clinton Not Impressed With GOP Debate, Calls it 'a Swing and a Miss' 0:20 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog
Hillary Clinton continues to dominate the now smaller Democratic field of candidates in the first NBC News online poll conducted by SurveyMonkey taken after Joe Biden officially declared himself out of the presidential race. With Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee also suspending their campaigns, the poll shows that while Clinton has reinforced her lead to 20 points, Bernie Sanders remains a force to consider, with strong support from younger voters and those dissatisfied or angry with the government.
With Biden no longer asked about, Clinton's numbers have inched higher, pushing her back to the 50 percent mark among voters who are Democratic or lean Democratic, for the first time since we began polling on the primary race back in April. But Sanders continues to hold onto a solid segment of the Democratic electorate, getting the backing of 30 p ercent leaned Democratic voters. Martin O'Malley and Larry Lessig, with just 1 percent support, have not been able to make a dent in their levels of support.
Caldwell, Leigh (206448258) / NBC News
The tables below show that the last two weeks have been good ones for Hillary Clinton. Following the Biden announcement and her marathon 11-hour session before the House committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks, Clinton is maintaining or building her coalition across a wide swath of voting blocs: Men, women, whites, blacks, and older voters.
But Bernie Sanders inspires younger voters and those that are angry with Washington – a key demographic in an election year where voters are embracing candidates who are considered outsiders. Among all Democratic leaned voters, less than 1 in 4 are satisfied (23%) or enthusiastic (1%) about how the federal government is working. A full 50% are dissatisfied and another 25% express anger. Among these angry voters, Sanders bests Clinton, 43% to 38%.

The NBC News Online Poll was conducted online by SurveyMonkey from October 27-29, 2015 among a national sample of 8,706 adults aged 18 and over. Respondents for this non-probability survey were selected from the nearly three million people who take surveys on the SurveyMonkey platform each day. Results have an error estimate of plus or minus 1.5 percentage points. A full description of our methodology and the survey can be found here.
The poll was produced by the Data Analytics Lab of NBC News in conjunction with Penn's Program on Opinion Research and Election Studies with data collection and tabulation conducted by SurveyMonkey.

Stipe Miocic Still Like a Kid in a Candy Store Heading into First UFC Main Event
Despite his status as a main event fighter at UFC on Fuel 5 this weekend in England and being touted as one of the top rising heavyweights in the UFC, Stipe Miocic is still like a kid in the candy store right now.
The former Cleveland State wrestler carries an undefeated record through his pro fight career, not to mention three victories inside the Octagon, but regardless of his status, he's like a big kid still soaking in the moment.
Miocic recently got his own signature walkout shirt for his upcoming fight against Stefan Struve, and admits when he got the call he was so excited that his girlfriend actually had to take the phone from him so he could pay attention and drive.
It's that true appreciation of the moment that makes Miocic a rare breed in MMA these days. He's loving every moment of every day that he gets to be a UFC fighter, and he never takes anything for granted.
It's why Miocic, in only his fourth fight in the Octagon, is so appreciative of the opportunity to fight in the main event.
“They put me in a fight, it kept going my way and now I'm in a main event, can't complain,” Miocic said.
For this event, Miocic will even have his dad in the audience who is coming in from Croatia to watch the show.
Miocic's mom will also be making the trip to England, but she's going more for moral support as she's only seen one of his fights, and it was after it was already over and her son was victorious.
“She doesn't want to see her baby boy get hurt,” Miocic said “Or watch me get punched in the face.”
Having his parents close by means a lot to Miocic, but on fight night he won't be thinking about who is in the crowd watching him, only the 6'11” Dutch fighter standing across the cage from him.
“I know it's just me and him in the cage. That's all I've got to worry about,” Miocic said recently on MMAWeekly Radio.
While there is no perfect way to prepare for a competitor as tall as Struve outside of hiring a semi-professional basketball team as sparring partners, the Ohio born heavyweight did what he could and even managed to work with a former UFC heavyweight champion along the way.
“I trained with Tim Sylvia a little bit, he's about 6'9″ so that helped out a lot. It's tough to find someone like that, but we worked up a good game plan for what we're going to do. I'm real confident,” Miocic told MMAWeekly Radio before the fight.
The preparation is all done at this point and now it's all about owning the stage he's been given to perform on, and Stipe Miocic is ready to step up to the moment.
“I know I'm coming to fight, I know he's coming to fight,” said Miocic. “So it's going to be a fun night.”
To hear the entire interview with Stipe Miocic tune into Thursday's edition of MMAWeekly Radio
For every lit author like Cormac McCarthy, who borrows science fiction themes, there are ten authors who start out writing science fiction, and then become beloved of literary hipsters. Here's a partial list.
It's funny, when you think about it, that so much attention gets paid to the McCarthys, Atwoods, Lessings and Roths of the world, who are known for their lit writing but try their hand at speculative fiction here and there. There are really just a handful of them who've made an impression, whereas there are tons of SF authors who've gone the other way - and yet, people seldom talk about it.

Mary Shelley, H.G. Wells, Jules Verne and Edgar Allan Poe are all writers whose names come up a lot when you talk about science fiction authors who have become beloved of the lit-mongers. To some extent, I think Shelley, Wells, Verne and Poe predate the genre-ification of SF, since they were writing at a time before the term was invented. In any case, they've all long since been embraced as fully literary. (Well, mostly. Of Poe, critic V.S. Pritchett famously said he was "a second class writer, but a fertilizing exclaimer.") "I get the sense that Wells in his day was a "novel of ideas" guy/polemicist who was later gerrymandered into SF," says Douglas Wolk, author of Reading Comics.
H.P. Lovecraft was clearly a genre writer in his time, thanks to his association with Weird Tales and other magazines. Nowadays, he's the subject of a book-length essay by fancy-pants French guy Michel Houellebecq, and the prestigious Library Of America has collected his stories.

Stanislaw Lem. A few science fiction authors have gotten published in the New Yorker, but Lem was a regular fixture there for years. Lem's satires, in which Ijon Tichy encounters weird time paradoxes, surrealistic societies and philosophical dead-ends, are tailor made for the lit crowd.

Gene Wolfe also got his work published in the New Yorker, as well as other fancy literary magazines. He's been compared to Proust, G.K. Chesterton and Dickens by critics in the Washington Post and other places. (I read a bunch of Wolfe's short stories the other day, and the Dickens comparison seemed particularly apt - they felt almost too 19th century for my taste, but he was clearly doing a good job of capturing a certain smoky industrial revolution feeling to his otherworldly stories.)
Ursula K. LeGuin is another author that nobody even questions the literariness of any more. Her latest book, Lavinia, has been greeted as a pure work of literature, with tons of articles about her contributions to the literature of ideas. The Cleveland Plain Dealer names it one of the best books of 2008, without regard to genre.

John Crowley is the uber-example of someone who crossed over - his earliest novels (The Deep, Beasts and Engine Summer) were pure SF and fantasy. His fourth book, the fantasy novel Little, Big, not only won the World Fantasy Award for best novel, but also praise from mega-critic Harold Bloom. He's since won a American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters Award in Literature, and he teaches at Yale.
Octavia Butler is another obvious choice. Just look at this gigantic list of journal articles about her, which appears to be outdated in any case. Including things like "Power and Repetition: Philosophies of (Literary) History in Octavia E. Butler's Kindred," from the journal Contemporary Literature.

Philip K. Dick is another one I barely feel the need to justify. Just read this disturbing excerpt from an article in Lingua Franca:
WHEN THE NOVELIST PHILIP K. DICK DIED IN 1982, THE INFLUENTIAL literary theorist Fredric Jameson eulogized him as "the Shakespeare of science fiction." At the time of this encomium, Dick was hardly famous. The author of more than fifty books, he had an enthusiastic following among science fiction fans. But he was rarely read by anyone else. These days, Dick is far better known. Vintage publishes his fiction in a uniform paperback edition. Hollywood filmmakers transform his stories of imaginary worlds and conspiratorial cartels into movies like Screamers and Total Recall. Meanwhile, academic critics laud him as a postmodernist visionary, a canny prophet of virtual reality, corporate espionage, and the schizoid nature of identity in a digitized world. Indeed, beginning in the last years of his life and continuing to the present, these critics have played a key role in the canonization of Philip K. Dick. But did Dick return the favor? Not exactly. To their considerable anguish, Dick's academic champions have had to contend with the revelation that their hero wrote letters to the Federal Bureau of Investigation denouncing them. In these letters, Dick claimed that Jameson and other literary theorists were agents of a KGB conspiracy to take over American science fiction. When he sent these messages, Dick was not in the best state of mind: He frequently heard voices and saw visions, often bathed in a mysterious pink light. Even so, the news of his surreptitious campaign against his academic admirers has left some of them deeply disturbed.

Harlan Ellison shows up in a surprising number of college syllabi, including a lot of science fiction writing classes but also a lot of generic "advanced composition" and English classes. His most commonly assigned story seems to be "Repent, Harlequin! Said The Tick-Tock Man." It's assigned often enough that there's a study guide for it. And as his bio proudly notes, he had a story in the 1993 Best American Short Stories.
Samuel R. Delany has easily become a lit-nerd must-read, thanks to his dense, challengiang narratives. It also didn't hurt, notes Wolk, that he's written smut and literary theory as well. "I've quoted him in a theory context," Wolk says. Check out this progression of Delany book covers, from lurid to literary:

William Gibson was heading for literary status for ages, thanks to his cyberpunk classics like Neuromancer and Count Zero. But when he switched to writing books set in the present, with Pattern Recognition and Spook Country, it became fashionable to talk about him as influential in his own time. The New York Times called Spook Country "the first post-post-9/11 novel." He was interviewed in the California Literary Review, and people started talking about the quality of his prose.
Kurt Vonnegut caused some debate among the people I asked about this topic. Was this literary idol ever considered a science fiction author? On the pro side, people cited the ultra-pulpy original covers of Player Piano and Sirens Of Titan, his first two books. "Where do you think [his fictional science fiction author] Kilgore Trout came from?" asks science fiction critic Mike Berry. On the other hand, his early stories appeared in Colliers and the Saturday Evening Post. If anything, one person suggested, Vonnegut is going the other way: He used to have literary cache, but now lit-snobs find him embarrassing. So it goes.

Jonathan Lethem got suggested by several people including Susan Marie Groppi from StrangeHorizons. It took me a while to remember that Lethem actually did start out as a science fiction author, before becoming a literary darling. (Check out his story collection The Wall Of The Sky, The Wall Of The Eye, which contains a bunch of stories that wouldn't be out of place in a typical issue of Asimov's or Analog. And at least one, "Vanilla Dunk," was in Asimov's.)
Ray Bradbury belongs on this list, if only for Fahrenheit 451, which is taught in college lit classes everywhere. Type the term "fahrenheit 451 sparknotes" into Google and you get 9,000 results, thanks to desperate term-paper-writing kids all over. (I didn't even type in that phrase. Google auto-suggested it.)
Weird-cyber author Rudy Rucker pops up on college syllabuses you'd expect, for science fiction writing classes. But also classes in rhetoric, and philosophy.

James Tiptree, Jr. gets on the list, if only because the male persona of writer Alice Sheldon has garnered lots of attention from gender theorists. The recent award-winning biography by Julie Phillips sparked more interest in Tiptree's life in the mainstream media, but also started people paying more attention to Tiptree's mind-bending stories, especially "Houston, Houston, Do You Read."
Neal Stephenson is another author who seems like an obvious inclusion. His latest book, Anathem, was greeted everywhere as a serious novel, not particularly as a science fiction book. Here's Pulitzer Prize-winning book critic Michael Dirda, writing in the Washington Post:
For the past 30 years I've been a zealous advocate for literary science fiction and fantasy, arguing that writers such as Gene Wolfe, Thomas M. Disch, John Crowley, Ursula K. Le Guin, Howard Waldrop and a handful of others are significant American authors, as well as artists of the first rank ... Neal Stephenson has established himself as one of these genre-transcending gods, read passionately by geeks and fans, but also admired as a novelist of ideas, a 21st-century Thomas Pynchon.

(He goes on to say that Anathem is a bit of a disappointment, actually.)
To be honest, I'd forgotten about Thomas M. Disch until I read the above quote, and then smacked my forehead. Before he died, Disch was as well known for his criticism (The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of) and poetry as for his fiction, a surefire way to get literary cache. The Telegraph even called him "excessively literary by the standards of his time."
Dan Simmons is in the process of transitioning to literary icon, according to some of my friends who monitor such things zealously. (They have a monitor board, and it lights up when a previously-tagged author starts to swim upstream towards the literary spawning grounds.) His use of literary allusions, especially Keats, probably doesn't hurt. Salon.com proclaimed him a literary master in 2002.

Howard Waldrop is as well known in lit circles as he is in speculative fiction circles. Dirda, once again, champions him as up there with Dick and other postmodern storytellers.
Carol Emshwiller won an NEA grant and a Pushcart Prize, and has had her stories in lit journals like McSweeney's and the Voice Literary Supplement.
Methodology: To some extent, this is just based on years of reading critics, and seeing who actually gets published in literary magazines and stuff. I also did a search on college syllabuses to see which authors are actually getting taught in college lit classes. And I polled my Twitter and Facebook homies.

(I'm leaving out some "urban fantasy" ish writers like Kelly Link, China Mieville or Neil Gaiman, in the interests of keeping this list from being too long. Plus once you get into magic and fantasy elements, you have to talk about the "magical realism" vogue of the 1990s and how that intersected with lit fiction and fantasy. And this is a blog post, not a book.)
Also: I'm not talking here about mainstream success, or having your books made into movies, or becoming a household name. I'm talking about acclaim from lit-nerds, a community that's just as insular as science fiction fans. As a member of both communities, I know they both have their odd grooming rituals and fetishes. An author like Philip K. Dick has long since passed the point of being "cool" for lit-nerds to discover. Now, if you're a lit-nerd and you haven't read Dick, your compadres just look at you pityingly. Ditto for Le Guin or Delany. Nobody in lit circles bothers to call them literary any more, they just are.
Finally, as I said above, this is a partial list. Feel free to suggest other people I left out.

If you only read one thing: It was an obvious trap, but “counterpuncher” Donald Trump couldn't help but take the bait. The moving speech by Gold Star father Khizr Khan about his fallen son, Capt. Humayun Khan instantly became one of the most memorable moments of the Democratic National Convention, as the grieving father called his son the “best of America” and criticized Trump for trying to keep Muslims like him out of the country, his wife standing just alongside. Trump couldn't resist his impulse to fight back, swiping at the parents of a fallen soldier in personal terms. Suggesting that Ghazala Khan “wasn't allowed to have anything to say” because of their faith, Trump was either callous toward a parent who said after that she can hardly be in the same room as photos of her dead son, or was dog-whistling toward those with anti-Muslim prejudice. Trump defended his outburst by arguing that Khan made himself a target by delivering a political speech at the DNC, which he certainly did. But what Trump missed was that it's never a good move politically, and perhaps morally, to attack those who've made that sacrifice. In a statement late Saturday, Trump argued Khan had no right to attack him or to suggest he'd never read the Constitution—seemingly neglecting the First Amendment which provides just that right. Trump briefly tried to clean up his comments, by arguing that the true issue of the campaign was not the Khans, but rather radical Islamic terror. But it was too little, too late. Republicans have spent the last three days backing away from Trump's comments, yet again, as a familiar playbook of condemnation and distancing plays itself out once again.
Trump is also facing new questions about his foreign policy knowledge after seeming confused in an interview with ABC about Russia's annexation of Crimea and operations in Eastern Ukraine. Meanwhile, his top campaign aide, Paul Manafort, is under scrutiny for his ties to Ukraine's former leader.
Hillary Clinton wrapped up a two-day bus-tour through Pennsylvania and Ohio with her new running mate as she looks to secure her position in the state's critical to a potential Trump win and full of the white working-class voters she is struggling to appeal to.
The Kochs are sitting out the presidential race. The campaigns are set to begin receiving intelligence briefings. And there are — count 'em — 99 days until Election Day.

SPETSES, Greece — A statue of Bouboulina, a heroine of the 1821 Greek war of independence against the Ottoman Empire, looks over the harbor of the island of Spetses in the Saronic Gulf. In the summer, the square where she stands usually bustles with activity. Children climb up and down her stone pedestal, and vendors sell popcorn and balloons while people sip coffee and cocktails on the terrace of the elegant Poseidonion Grand Hotel. Every so often, a horse-drawn buggy passes.
This summer is different. As Greece struggles with a debt crisis that has brought the country's economy to its knees, most of the Greek tourists who have been going to this graceful island for decades are gone. Stavros Kokkoris, 65, who has been driving his horse and buggy there since 1965, compares today's crisis to the turbulence of the military dictatorship that ruled from 1967 to 1973. Asked which was worse, he said grimly, “Now. This has been the worst.”
For Athenians, Spetses is akin to the Hamptons for New Yorkers. Its stately mansions belong to sea captains, shipowners and other wealthy Greeks. The shipping magnates of the Niarchos family own Spetsopoula, a small island covered with pine trees off the southeastern coast of Spetses. Prince Nikolaos of Greece wed there five summers ago.
But since June 29, when the government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was forced to enact capital controls limiting Greeks to 60 euro cash withdrawals daily, tourism there has slowed considerably. The Hellenic Seaways catamaran, which takes visitors from Athens' port to Spetses, is usually sold out on summer weekends, but last Friday, it was just half full. “People just aren't traveling. No money,” said Theo Mexas, a Hellenic Seaways steward. “With only 60 euros, how are they going to travel?”
Storeowners, hotel owners and restaurateurs are feeling the pinch. Many say business has been down by about 40 percent since capital controls went into effect. “The market is dead. The Greek tourists are gone,” said Pantelis Kokkoris, 64, the owner of a small clothing and trinket shop. “In the old days, money seemed to be everywhere. People came, stayed for a month, bought a ball for their child, a bathing suit. Now, nothing.”
The story is the same up and down the narrow streets. Demetrios Andriotis, 46, who sells handmade leather sandals, said the few tourists who appear aren't buying much. “Greeks used to spend a lot, but they don't anymore,” he said, sitting in the entrance of his empty shop.
Services are off too. On the island, there are few cars, so people get around mostly on rented mopeds and use small red-and-white boats as water taxis to nearby beaches or the mainland. When banks closed on June 29, those businesses began to dry up.
Water taxi owner Panagiotis Markou, 51, said he used to get about 10 fares a day at 20 euros each; now he's lucky if he gets four. Demetrios Malamos, the owner of Nautilus Moto, said he has seen a 30 to 40 percent drop in rentals. “This used to be an island for VIPs. The Greek elite would vacation here. Even the middle class Greeks who vacationed here spent money,” he said, pointing to the line of at least a dozen unused motorbikes outside the shop. “Those days are gone.”
The elites still come, their yachts lined up in the old harbor, but in smaller numbers. Last Saturday at least a dozen yachts and sailboats bobbed in the water while prominent Greeks, including Athens Mayor Giorgios Kaminis, gathered at Tarsanas, an outdoor seafood tavern. Even these Spetsiotes, as they are known, are concerned. Greece's austerity measures have included rounds of increases in property taxes and luxury taxes. “Life as we've known it is over,” said Eleni Georgi-Melissaris, who owns a home there and has been going to the island every summer since she was a child in the 1950s. “I'm worried about what's coming.”
Some things in Spetses don't change. Families still sit under yellow and white umbrellas on the white pebble beach at Agioi Anargyroi while swimmers splash in the crystalline waters. “Looking at this, you'd never know what has happened these last few weeks,” said Tassos Kiritsis, 37, who works for a German electronics retailer in Athens.
Yiorgos Kastriotis, 36, of the family-owned Armata Boutique Hotel, hopes that's the image foreigners see. This summer they accounted for about 40 percent of the hotel's guests, compared with 10 percent in previous years. With Greece negotiating a third bailout package with European lenders and facing more austerity measures, another round of belt tightening is likely.
He said he has had several inquiries about the situation from worried vacationers, but he tries to reassure them that, for tourists, all is well. “Everybody thinks we're walking around with a balls and chains,” he said. “It isn't like that.”
Cows have a secret mental life in which they bear grudges, nurture friendships, and become excited over intellectual challenges. Jonathan Leake, Science Editor, The Sunday Times
Have you ever seen a cow put her problem-solving skills to the test? Or heard of cows who like jazz? No? Then prepare to be amazed! Behind the doe-eyed gaze of these unique individuals lies a hidden depth that might surprise you.
No two cows are alike — some are bold, some timid, some curious, some affectionate. Research has shown that from a young age, calves each react very differently to stimuli in their surroundings — reflecting their individual likes, dislikes and personality.
Cows can solve puzzles. What's more, they enjoy it! When they work out the solution to a problem, one study found that young heifers would get excited, some even jumping into the air — seemingly in celebration of their Eureka moment. Researchers are finding that cattle are far more intelligent than people give them credit for – and may actually possess heightened brain function and decision-making abilities.
These are highly developed mammals that have been solving problems for a long, long time. If anything, it reflects poorly on us that we're surprised that these animals are smart. Of course these animals are smart. Dr. Daniel Weary, Animal Welfare Program, University of British Columbia
In fact, they're quite the socialites. They seek out and nurture relationships with other individuals in the herd — often forming cooperative grooming partnerships. When separated from their best buddy, they become stressed.
What do cows look for in a leader? Much the same things as us. Studies have suggested that intelligence, inquisitiveness, confidence, experience and good social skills all help to determine who will become the leader within a herd.
Like humans, a mother cow and her calf share a strong and special bond — one that can form within minutes of birth. When mother cows and their calves are left to live a natural life, the calf will suckle from his mother for several months, even up to a year. Research has shown that adult cows remain deeply affected by the emotional pain of being separated as calves from their mothers, which is standard practice in the dairy industry.
In all the best ways, calves are a lot like kids! They're cheeky, and super playful. When they want to play, they will signal to each other with their tails and a special call — so that it's clear they mean no harm when mimicking the behaviour of adult cattle.
Researchers now believe that music with a slow tempo reduces cows' stress levels. It seems that jazz isn't off the playlist just yet either though ...
Stand up for cows!
Make your choices count: Cows are intelligent, social and emotional animals, but these aren't the only reasons they deserve to be treated with kindness and respect. The fact that they are living, feeling beings capable of experiencing joy, pain and fear is reason enough.
The most effective way to help these gentle and affectionate animals is by choosing not to eat them. With so many delicious animal-free alternatives now available, it's no wonder that more people are choosing to incorporate more plant-based food into their lives. Why not give it a try?

Clinging to both “bad experiences” and “good experiences” can be a source of suffering. Because when we cling to negative feelings, we prolong their power over our thoughts and actions. Instead of letting them take their course and then letting go, we hold onto these feelings and even begin to identify with them. And when we cling to positive feelings, we also attach to them as our only source of happiness, but we simultaneously set ourselves up for suffering once those positive feelings inevitably go away.
If everything is constantly changing, then the key to living a healthy life must be embracing this change as it unfolds, rather than attaching our happiness to a certain set of conditions. When we learn how to ride out these ebbs and flow of life, we paradoxically find contentment in the present moment (because we learn to embrace whatever is as it is).
Full acceptance of the present moment also includes an acceptance of its transient nature. And full acceptance of yourself also includes an acceptance that you too are always changing. From moment-to-moment, it often feels as though we are a static entity. But when you view yourself 10-20 years in the past, or what you will be 10-20 years in the future, you'll often find that you can change drastically from one phase of your life to the next.
I find these ideas very conducive to personal development and mental health. Actually, the whole notion that “thing's change” has helped me overcome countless internal battles over the past few years.
But it takes practice. Mainly, daily mindfulness, and actual eye-witness of this change as it takes place in the present moment. Conceptions of our “static self” can only be de-mystified by daily meditation into the nature of our changing selves. Change is not just an esoteric concept, but an observable, empirical truth that can be discovered by anyone who watches their daily experiences on a consistent basis. One of the my favorite meditations in de-mystifying this fixed self is objectless meditation. It is a pure mindfulness practice where the observer doesn't try to concentrate on any one object, but instead allows their awareness to expand to the full range of their experience. During such a meditation your object of focus will shift between different sensations in your body, as well as different thoughts, emotions, memories, and imaginations. A person who has developed a strong sense of mindfulness will learn how to better engage in this process of change without clinging to any singular aspect of their experience.
And the ultimate goal of your meditation is to take this awareness into your daily activities. That means embracing change in all aspects of your life: your health, your relationships, your career, your personal habits, etc. All aspects of your being are in a dynamic state of flux. And keeping this simple truth in the back of your mind at all times can do wonders.

DULLES, Virginia ― The U.S. government must “permit lawyers access to all legal permanent residents being detained at Dulles International Airport,” a federal judge in Virginia ordered late Saturday.
But U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents at this airport outside Washington, D.C., are defying the judge's order, blocking attorneys from talking to the lawful permanent residents CBP is detaining here.
Border agents have detained dozens of people who were trying to enter the U.S. from the seven majority-Muslim countries covered by President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration. Trump's measure, which also froze the U.S. refugee resettlement program and banned admission of Syrian refugees indefinitely, requires even legal permanent residents from the affected countries to seek approval for re-entry on a case-by-case basis.
CBP agents never actually complied with the judge's order, because they never let the attorneys into the area where the agency was holding the detainees, eight of the attorneys told HuffPost. By around 1 a.m. Sunday, some four hours after the order came down, CBP officials had allowed all but two of the people they had detained Friday and Saturday to enter the United States, according to two lawyers with knowledge of the matter. Both remaining detainees were Syrian nationals: One was denied entry late on Saturday, and the second was released on Sunday to apply for asylum in the U.S.
But as planes began arriving again early Sunday, detentions resumed, and CBP continued to deny lawyers access to the detainees.
“We aren't getting any access at this point,” Sara Dill, director of the American Bar Association's standards project said Sunday.
On Sunday afternoon, Rep Don Beyer (D-Va.) tweeted that he and three other members of Congress had asked CBP to comply with the court order and CBP refused.
We have a constitutional crisis today. Four Members of Congress asked CBP officials to enforce a federal court order and were turned away. — Rep. Don Beyer (@RepDonBeyer) January 29, 2017
Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), who was at Dulles with Beyer and Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), said they hadn't gotten anywhere with their requests to CBP.
“This remains a nation of laws, not of men,” Connolly said.

On Saturday night, attorneys trying to speak to detainees complained of similar lack of access.
“It is unusual for an agency to deny a court order ― a court order clearly stating that these people need to be provided counsel,” Claudia Cubas, an attorney with Capital Area Immigrants' Rights Coalition, said on Saturday night. “We asked several different agency heads to request access to speak to these people and were told ‘no.'”
The order, which was issued by Judge Leonie Brinkema of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, also forbade CBP from denying entry to any lawful permanent residents from Dulles for seven days. It's unclear how many people, if any, CBP is still detaining at the airport. But the agency denied entry to at least one person, a Syrian national, from the airport Saturday.
Sirine Shebaya, a Washington-based civil rights attorney, and Ofelia Calderon, an immigration attorney in Fairfax, Virginia, also said CBP was “absolutely” in contempt of Brinkema's order.
Spokespeople for Customs and Border Protection did not respond to multiple email requests for an explanation of agency officials' behavior.
Rob Robertson, an attorney representing a Syrian woman married to a visa holder, asked an airport official to admit him to the holding area. But the official said CBP was forbidding the airport from allowing the lawyers access to the detainees, Robertson said. His client had a visa to join her husband, a physician who already has a visa to work at a local hospital.
Robertson's client, a Syrian national, was held overnight and released from detention Sunday. She will apply for asylum with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Also on Saturday night, a federal judge in Brooklyn, New York, stopped parts of Trump's executive order from taking effect across the country, effectively precluding the deportation of refugees immigration authorities had previously approved for admission.

"Let them see their lawyers" pic.twitter.com/hzZ8q4tIat — Daniel Marans (@danielmarans) January 29, 2017
Fatima Ebrahimi, an Iranian citizen who has been living in the U.S. for six years, emerged from the CBP holding area with her two young children, one of whom was disabled, shortly before midnight. Although she is a legal permanent resident from Bethesda, Maryland, and her two children are U.S. citizens, they were detained for about five hours. Ebrahimi was returning from a visit to Tehran where her friends had thrown her a surprise birthday party.
Ebrahimi did not say much about her experience in detention, explaining that she was exhausted. But she mentioned that she observed someone named Ebrahim being put in handcuffs after he protested the detention and said he did not want to return to his home country.
The reception area for international arrivals was packed with some 200 protesters and dozens of lawyers who showed up to help if they were needed. It mirrored protests at airports across the country where activists gathered to demonstrate against Trump's executive order restricting immigration, travel and refugee admission.
The protesters cheered every person who walked out of the arrival area, whether they were coming from one of the blacklisted countries or not, chanting, “This is what America looks like,” and “Let them see their lawyers.”
“Just banning people, basically because of the color of their skin ― this is going back to the 1960s,” said Mikael Mikael, 31, an airport employee who lives in Frederick, Maryland, and is the son of Ethiopian immigrants. “This is not making America great again.”
Jason Cherkis contributed reporting. This post has been updated to note that attorneys continued to be denied access to detainees on Sunday and that lawyers offered new information about what happened to the detainees held Saturday.

Rocker Ian Brown stunned jurors when he was unveiled as star witness in the Fred Talbot sex trial - and then claimed his former schoolteacher had shown 'gay porn' to 11-year-old pupils.
The 51-year-old star, famous as frontman of the Stone Roses and for a
successful solo career, walked into Court 9 to testify against Mr Talbot, who is accused of historic sex offences against schoolboys.
Mr Brown is not a victim in the case, but was taught biology by Mr Talbot
at Altrincham Grammar School for Boys in the 1970s.
Dressed in a blue coat, Ian Brown has taken the oath on the Bible. He told the jury teachers were 'violent' in the era, but Fred Talbot was an exception.
He told court that Mr Talbot that in one lesson encouraged his 11-year-old pupils to masturbate, told them how to do it, and asked them about it in a subsequent lesson.
Those that told him they had been 'successful' would be 'murmured' to in lessons by him while other pupils did their work.
Mr Brown described another a lesson from his first year at the school, saying: "The blinds were drawn and there was a projector.
"He showed me a film. It was years before I realised it had been wrong to show us that film.
"It was a three minute film on Super 8 projector and a young guy walks into a room dressed in denims, sits on the bed, takes his trousers down and masturbates.
"It was only a few years later I realised it was perhaps a gay porn film. It wasnt a sex education film."
Mr Talbot, 65, of Bowdon, Cheshire, denies ten indecent assaults on boys as young as 14, dating back to 1969.

There's been a lot of focus lately, on weird happenings in faraway lands. The middle-east, Russia, Asia, even Australia, which from a Can-Am-centric perspective (I'm Canadian) might provide an expanded view of our world, but there are plenty of weird things to look at right here in North America. And today I bring a story from what is arguably one of North America's most beautiful destinations: New England.
Known for high society, fine-dining, world class skiing, and mysterious disappearances, Vermont, one of the six US states that make up the New England region, has been the focus of some of the better minds in anomalous or Fortean research over the years. One place in particular has gotten more than its fair share of attention: Glastonbury Mountain, also known as Green Mountain or the Green Mountain Range, is home to some very strange goings on, and has inspired some of the wildest theories you've ever heard.
The entire area of New England has been the primary focus of renowned author and Fortean researcher Joseph A. Citro. Humorously dubbed the Bard of the Bizarre by the Boston Globe, Citro has written extensively on the weird happenings, disappearances and other phenomena of New England, and especially Vermont. He is the originator of the somewhat little known Bennington Triangle theory, which is, as may seem obvious, a play on the Bermuda Triangle, and is his attempt to document and explain the disappearance of some five different people under mysterious circumstances since 1945, all on Glastonbury Mountain.
Citro notes, in his premiere novel Shadow Child (1987), which deals extensively with the mysteries of Glastonbury Mountain, that the area of what is now called Green Mountain has long been known, through Native American culture, as a strange and dangerous place that is to be avoided at all costs. Citro's apparent familiarity with the history and traditions of the Algonquin peoples, who inhabited the area as early as 8500 BCE, has given him unique insight into the special and dark nature of the mountain.
The disappearances of Middie Rivers (1945), Paula Weldon (1946), James Tedford (1949), Paul Jepson (1950), and Frieda Langer (1950), are something of local legend in the area.
18 year old Paula Weldon, who disappeared while on a solo hike on the Long Trail, became something of a celebrity. As the story goes, several people witnessed her departure from Bennington College, with the knowledge that she was headed out for a short hike. Two elderly hikers reported seeing her on the trail, approximately 100 yards ahead of them, minutes before she disappeared. They claimed that she rounded a corner on the trail, and when they reached the same corner, she was gone, and was never seen or heard from again, despite extensive searches, FBI involvement and even a $5000 reward for her safe return. Her case became part of local urban legend, as people speculated about her becoming a wild recluse on the mountain, or perhaps fleeing to Canada to marry a boyfriend whose identity she kept secret.
There are several coincidences involved in the disappearances, but no real connection between any of the cases has been found. James Tedford (also spelled Teford or Tetford) disappeared from a bus between stops as it travelled toward Bennington exactly three years to the day from Weldon's disappearance. Also, 8 year old Paul Jepson, who disappeared from his mother's truck, while she tended to her pigs, was tracked with dogs. His scent was apparently picked up and followed to a local highway, which happened to be very near where Paula Weldon had disappeared.
The only one of the five to ever have been recovered was 53 year old Frieda Langer, who disappeared during a hike with her cousin only sixteen days after little Paul Jepson. Her body was recovered seven months later, near the Somerset Reservoir, which had been searched extensively at the time of her disappearance. No cause of death could be determined because of the advanced state of decay in which she was found.
Strange coincidences notwithstanding, there isn't much about these disappearances that warrants Fortean attention, at least on the surface. People go missing, it happens every day, all over the world, and though it's a tragic event, it isn't necessarily anomalous or even all that weird.
Except…
According to Citro, the Bennington Triangle, an ill-defined area surrounding Glastonbury Mountain and roughly bordered by the region of Bennington itself, bears striking resemblance to the nearby Bridgewater Triangle of Massachusetts. The Bridgewater Triangle, for those unfamiliar, is an area of approximately 200 square miles in southeastern Massachusetts, wherein sightings of UFO's, orbs, Bigfoot, and thunderbird, as well as cattle mutilations have been taking place on a regular basis for decades, if not centuries. Citro claims that there is similar folklore and history between these two areas, and has put forward some slightly strange explanations for the weirdness held therein.
Perhaps his strangest explanation is the man-eating stone of Glastonbury Mountain. Making its first appearance in Citro's book The Vermont Monster Guide (2009), the man-eating stone is exactly what it sounds like…a rock that eats people.
“No one alive has seen this dangerous anomaly on Glastonbury Mountain. Native Americans knew of it, and warned people away. We can only imagine it as a sizable rock, large enough to stand on. But when someone stands upon it, the rock becomes less solid, and, like a living thing, swallows the unfortunate trespasser. A number of disappearances have been reported on Glastonbury Mountain. Could all these vanished folks have stepped inadvertently on this hungry stone?”[1]
In another of his books, Passing Strange: True Tales of New England Hauntings and Horrors (1996), Citro describes “an inaccessible region, remote, full of dark places, jutting outcrops, vast marshlands and quiet pools.” He seems to regard the entire region as a magical land of mysteries and dangers, almost fairy-tale-like, but describes a wild, almost untouched wilderness sitting in the heart of American society's upper crust summer vacation destination.
Is there something weird going on at Glastonbury Mountain? Is the Bennington Triangle worth a closer look? Or is a talented author and folklorist trying to sell books through sensational, if difficult to believe theories? The facts are that five people disappeared on that mountain, four of them without a trace of evidence as to their whereabouts or fate. That alone should get our attention, and who knows…maybe there is a boulder with an appetite for man-flesh in Vermont.

Daniela Santanch talks to Silvio Berlusconi REUTERS/Tony Gentile Following a court decision that found him — finally — guilty of a crime, sentenced to jail time, and banned from political office, Silvio Berlusconi has a stunning response: his allies may pull out of Italy's coalition government unless he receives a pardon or some other kind of clemency.
That's a pretty brutal threat. Berlusconi is effectively holding his own country hostage— the coalition would collapse without the support of his PdL party, and markets are terrified of more political instability in the country.
Would Berlusconi really go through with it?
He certainly wants people to think he's serious. According to Reuters, Daniela Santanche, a key ally called the "the pythoness" due to her support for the billionaire former Prime Minister, announced today that Berlusconi has prerecorded a video that he plans to release when the government collapses.
"It's ready, Berlusconi will decide when to broadcast it and I think it is absolutely imminent," Santanche said. "Personally, I don't think we can remain sitting next to people who want to be the butchers of Berlusconi."
We picked up right where we left off last week, and we saw that the quantity splicer worked! Ronnie and Stein are separated, and all is well.
It soon becomes clear that they are still ‘connected,' which is why Stein feels that Ronnie is in trouble when the military attacks Jitters — the very public coffee shop, and vice versa when General Eiling has Stein at gunpoint.
Though “Fallout” ends with Ronnie and Stein deciding to re-emerge (but at their own will: Think Digimon DNA Digivolution), and leave Central city — it doesn't seem like the end of this story just yet.
Iris' storyline this week is a little less exciting. It is evident that the writers are setting her up for an integral story arc, but that's what it is: a set-up. She decides it's time to snoop around STAR Labs. I may not be Iris' biggest fan, but what I am thankful for is how many of the characters have picked up on how sketchy Wells can be sometimes. It shows that the writers think the audience is smart, and it gives us hope that we'll find out Wells' motives soon.
Watching Iris slowly journey into the supernatural world will be interesting though — especially if she starts off as the antagonist to Barry and his friends without even knowing it.
With the rest of the meta-humans in Central city taking a breather, Joe takes Barry to his old house and explains that it was an adult version of Barry that tried to save his mom. Every week, I say that Grant and Jesse's chemistry is the strongest on the show, and this week was no different. They seem to have a natural comfort that I don't see a lot of anywhere else.
And just like that, time travel is officially introduced to The Flash. It's heartbreaking to see Barry realize that he ultimately fails as Stein explains to him that his speed can rip a hole into the space-time continuum.
Barry: “If I do, somehow, make it back to that night, it means I didn't save her. My destiny is to fail.”
Comic book fans know that he doesn't save his mom, but there's so much more to it than that, and it's going to be so much fun to see how they decide to play it out! I for one want a ‘what-if' episode where Barry saves his mom, leading to a horrible alternate universe, making him realize he needs to fail. It'll be tragic and beautiful all at once, but will allow Barry to finally understand the power that he wields, ultimately strengthening his character as a superhero.
It was great to see The Flash finally taking on a bigger story arc, rather than the ‘villain of the week' plots it's been having for the last little bit.
Random Thoughts:
They've teased the Grodd storyline twice already- how do you think it'll play into the story?
The STAR labs sweater is the equivalent to a shock blanket in this world- and I want one so bad
If Barry's universe becomes an alternate timeline, does Arrow's as well? Next year's cross over anyone?

In the spring of this year, the federal Liberals released their first budget, which centred on big increases in government spending, persistent deficits, growing debt and higher taxes. At the time, we warned that a fundamental problem with the government's approach of running significant budget deficits outside of a recession is that it exposes Canada's finances to serious risk.
If the expected growth doesn't materialize, this could trigger a greater run-up in debt.
Yesterday's economic and fiscal update confirmed this is happening. Federal finances are now in worse shape than they were just seven months ago.
Recall the spring budget proposed marked increases in federal spending—a whopping 20 per cent increase over just three years. The Liberals acknowledged this would produce a string of deficits much larger than they campaigned on and with no plan to balance the budget within their current mandate.
The update now pegs the five-year cumulative deficit at $32 billion higher than initially planned just seven months ago (and still no plan to return to balance).
Not only is the five-year cumulative deficit total larger, the government has decided to remove its annual safety cushion of $6 billion per year. Prudent budgeting, as was done by previous Liberal and Conservative governments, included a contingency in case of unforeseen events that would cause spending to be higher than planned and/or revenues to be lower than expected. By removing this contingency, the federal government has exposed its finances to even more risk. This is hardly a “fiscally responsible” way to budget, as Finance Minister Bill Morneau claims.
Any further unexpected economic shocks to either revenues or expenditures will lead to even bigger budget deficits and even more debt. There are specific risks on spending. If the government is unable to dramatically reduce the rate of spending growth in 2018/19 as planned, the potential for significantly more debt is real.
Why else should Canadians care about persistent deficits and a run-up in debt? For one thing, economic research shows it will result in slower economic growth as growing public debt increases uncertainty for households and investors and requires future taxpayers to foot the bill. Put differently, more government debt will harm the economy and likely raise the tax burden.
Canadians have seen the unfortunate consequences of routine budget deficits and increased debt play out before. For example, the federal government ran a generation worth of consecutive budget deficits starting in the 1970s, which resulted in a serious debt problem. By the early 1990s, a third of all federal government revenue was being used simply to pay interest on the debt.
It wasn't until a Liberal government led by Jean Chretien made the tough decisions to slay the deficit, rein in debt, and put federal finances on better footing. That experience helped shape the unwritten norm that deficit spending must be temporary, avoided during non-recessionary times, and accompanied by a plan to return to balance. Without this “fiscal anchor,” governments can easily get stuck in the quicksand of deficits, making it very difficult to dig their way out.
Only a year after the University of Wisconsin's men hockey program acquired Don Granato, the former associate head coach announced that he will be taking an assistant head coach position with the Chicago Blackhawks.
Best of luck to Don Granato with the @NHLBlackhawks.https://t.co/tkvYLLbm2l — Wisconsin Hockey (@BadgerMHockey) June 15, 2017
Granato, his brother and current head coach Tony Granato and fellow Wisconsin associate head coach Mark Osiecki came to UW back in 2016 following a rather unpleasant season under the leadership of Mike Eaves. The trio was sent in to help reform the once great men's hockey program to its former glory.
With the 2015-16 season ending in a 8-19-8 record, it was clear that this new regime had a lot of work ahead of them. Still, in a matter of only a single year, Granato and his fellow coaches managed to get the Badgers to a winning record of 20-15-1, and secured Wisconsin a spot in the Big Ten Tournament.
The Blackhawks announced June 15th Granato had been hired as a member of Joel Quenneville's coaching staff for the 2017-18 season. The Blackhawks were Stanley Cup Champions in 2010, 2013 and most recently in 2015.

Don's brother Tony told the Wisconsin State Journal that getting into the NHL was never a priority of his brother's, but that it was such a great opportunity for him. Tony Granato said it had been his brother's dream to coach in the NHL since he was a child, and felt nothing but happiness for his sibling.
“I think it's a great position for him,” Granato said. “I'm really excited for him, just like I was for Luke Kunin and just like I will be for any of our players that move on and get to fulfill their dreams and be where they want to be in our game.”

Tony Granato and Mark Osiecki will continue on with the Badgers in the 2017-18 season, hoping to continue with the success they found with Don Granato this past season. No word has been released yet as to who their second associate head coach will be.
Oil has also brought its share of pitfalls for the fledgling democracy, fostering corruption and patronage, and aggravating tensions with the Kurdish minority in the north over the division of profits, a festering issue that could end up fracturing the country.
The Iraqi government says it can add an additional 400,000 barrels a day of production by next year, and it has announced a goal of producing 10 million barrels a day by 2017, which would put it in a league with Saudi Arabia.
Few independent analysts say they believe the larger goal is realistic, but oil company executives have been impressed by Iraq's progress and ambition.
“What the government is embarking on and the increase in production they are looking for under all of these contracts is unique in the world,” said Michael Townshend, president of BP Iraq. But, he cautioned, “Nobody has yet managed to increase oil production in their country to the extent Iraq is planning to. It's hugely ambitious, and it will take a lot of things to work correctly.”
The country's improving oil fortunes are well timed to compensate for Iran's declining oil output, which according to OPEC fell by 12 percent in the first three months of the year as India , China and other Asian nations have gradually cut purchases under pressure from the United States and Europe .
With little if any progress achieved so far in negotiations between the West and Iran over its nuclear program , and Iran's nuclear chief reaffirming last weekend that the country would continue producing higher-grade uranium, Western sanctions are set to tighten in July.
Iraq's role in ameliorating the effects of those sanctions in the oil market could create tensions with Iran, a strong backer and ally of the Iraqi government. But oil experts say exports are too valuable for Iraq to allow its relationship with Iran to impede production.

The recovery of Iraq's oil industry after decades of wars, sanctions and neglect began in 2009 and 2010 as security improved and Baghdad signed a series of technical service contracts with foreign companies like Exxon Mobil, BP, China National Petroleum Corporation and ENI of Italy . The companies brought in modern seismic equipment and modern well recovery techniques to resuscitate old fields.

The deals have been only modestly profitable for the foreign companies, but foreign executives express cautious optimism that Iraq can eventually produce oil in amounts that could put it in an elite group of exporters with Saudi Arabia and Russia sometime in the 2020s.
Iraq produces around three million barrels a day, and few analysts believe it can reach its goal of 10 million barrels a day by 2017, a target Baghdad recently reduced from a previous estimate of 12 million barrels a day by that year. But Hans Nijkamp, Royal Dutch Shell 's Iraq country chairman, estimates that Iraq could produce 6 million to 10 million barrels a day by early next decade, “which is really substantial.”

International oil executives say the government bureaucracy is still slow and poorly coordinated in building new port and pipeline infrastructure to get oil to the tankers from the fields. The political battle over divvying up profits has prevented the enactment of a national oil law, meaning that the companies need to follow myriad regulations, some of which date back to the Ottoman Empire . Electrical shortages are forcing politicians to choose between serving the oil companies or restive civilian populations that want more reliable utility service.
To increase output, the country will need to develop a huge water project to filter and pump seawater into old oil fields to increase the pressure required to coax crude out of the ground. Planning has begun, but the project is progressing slowly.
Iraq will also need to negotiate a sizable export quota within OPEC to accommodate its increasing potential, a nettlesome process that could produce tensions with Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Some of the problems were on display at last week's oil and gas auction, the country's fourth postwar bidding round, where only 3 contracts were awarded out of 12 up for bid.
The auction, in an auditorium at the Ministry of Oil, had the trappings of a militarized movie premiere, with red carpets, velvet ropes, hordes of photographers and a white-uniformed honor guard carrying Kalashnikov rifles fixed with bayonets. The proceedings were carried live on state television. An elevator- music rendition of Lionel Richie 's “Hello” played over and over.
The room was packed with diplomats, politicians and foreign oil executives, but few actual bidders.
“There are three minutes left and it seems like no one wants to bid,” Abdul Mahdy al-Ameedi, the ministry official overseeing the auction, said at one point.

The disappointing auction was less a reflection of lack of interest in Iraq's energy sector than of the tough terms demanded by the government, the location of some of the fields in dangerous and remote regions of the country, and the fact that many of the blocks up for bid were for natural gas , which is less attractive to foreign companies than oil.
Iraq also used the auction to slap Exxon Mobil's hand for signing production sharing contracts for 850,000 acres in the Kurdistan region without getting permission from the central government, denying the company the right to bid.
But at the same time, Iraq has not touched Exxon Mobil's oil contracts in the south, a sign of pragmatism, or perhaps paralysis , international oil analysts said.
Exxon Mobil has by far the largest stake of any American company in Iraq, but most of the major players are European and Asian, like Lukoil and Gazprom from Russia, and Chinese companies like China National Petroleum and China National Offshore Oil Corporation.
Despite the uncertainties, the foreign companies say they are staying.
“We are in Iraq because we think there is big potential, huge production growth,” said Claudio Descalzi, chief operating officer for exploration and production at ENI, the Italian oil giant. “In the future, things can only get better.”
Flint, Michigan (CNN) An "arsenal" of cases of fresh water stacked in the basement and a graveyard of scattered empty bottles are daily reminders that life in Flint, Michigan, is anything but normal.
For Gina Luster, 41, seeing the stacks of bottles angers her. She says she feels like less than a good parent after watching her daughter, 7, and niece, 13, suffer from hair loss and skin rashes.
"It makes me feel like the lowest of the low. My self-esteem when it first began was so, so bad," Luster said on the verge of tears in her dining room.
"You pull up to a place where you need this water, and the line is a mile long and you're waiting in your car, praying you don't run out of gas waiting, and you've got your kids in the car and they're looking at you like 'What are you going to do about this?'" she said.
151 bottles of water in a day
CNN tallied the number of bottles the Luster family uses in a day and sorted how each bottle was used into eight categories. 36 bottles were used for cooking and another 36 were for washing hair. They used 27 bottles for drinking, plus 24 for doing dishes, and the rest were used for washing faces, brushing teeth and more. Each bottle held 16.9 ounces of water.
The grand total came to 151 bottles -- that's how much the family of three uses in a day.
JUST WATCHED 1 day in Flint, 151 bottles of water Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 1 day in Flint, 151 bottles of water 00:22
The average American uses 100 gallons of water a day , according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. That translates to roughly 757 bottles of water, which is way more the 50 water bottles each person in the Luster household is using.
The EPA statistics include water used to flush toilets, wash hands, shower and it even accounts for leaks.
The family still uses the tap water for washing their hands -- they get tired of having to unscrew a bottle for just about everything. Once or twice a week, they head to Gina's mother's house in nearby Swartz Creek, a suburb of Flint, to shower and do their laundry.
'The taste was like metal'
The family didn't know what was going on until each one started exhibiting health problems in summer 2014 -- the city of Flint switched its water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River in spring 2014.
"By July I had shriveled down and lost 60 pounds. I was down to a size 4," said Luster, who used to weigh 200 pounds.
Gina Luster in her Flint, Michigan home with the total bottles of water it takes to get through a day.
Luster, a self-admitted ice chewer, started noticing the taste of the water was different that summer. It tasted like metal or medicine.
Things grew worse when Luster collapsed at her job that month. She had been a store manager at a retailer Citi Trends until she was forced to go on medical leave in August 2014.
That fall, Luster's medical records indicate doctors found cysts on her ovaries. She had a partial hysterectomy to remove the cysts, but the cause of the cysts was not cited.
Unable to return to work, Luster lost her job. She had previously been making $38,000 a year, but now she was relying on odd part-time jobs and the graciousness of her family to make things work.
Meanwhile, alarm bells were going off in Luster's head when she started getting calls from school about her daughter, Kennedy.
"You're getting calls from the teacher, 'Kennedy was at school today scratching with both hands and she's bleeding.' What? I mean, she scratched until she was raw," Luster said, exasperated.
Kennedy, a bright-eyed, spunky student, was also losing chunks of her hair, her mother said. Luster's well-spoken teenage niece, Eeshyia King, who lives with the family, was experiencing breakouts and rashes that drove her to an intense face-washing ritual.
They had been drinking the water for a year
Fifteen months after the family started seeing adverse changes in their health, they switched to using bottled water in October 2015.
The total number of bottles of water the Luster family uses in one day.
"For a whole year's span, we were drinking that water. That's finally when they came out and said there was lead in the water," Luster said, wide-eyed with a smile of disbelief.
Luster didn't know just how much water they needed until she realized she was going through almost an entire 24-pack of water per day. By night, they'd only have four or five bottles left.
After dropping the girls off at school, Luster drove to a water station to pick up a new pack of water. Local fire stations set up "water stations" to distribute water to the families in Flint.
She picked up a case of water each day, seven days a week, for four months, she said.
With the rashes and hair loss persisting, Luster started using bottled water for more than just drinking. They started washing their hair and faces, brushing teeth and cooking with the precious, fresh water.
Kennedy Luster, 7, holds a pot her mother says was ruined by washing it in Flint's water.
"It just became like second nature to come in and start unscrewing caps and doing whatever you had to do," she said.
To keep up with the family's increasing demand, she started driving to more water stations, acquiring a pack of water from each place. The family would pull off the side of the road, throw the water in the trunk, and go to the next place to get more water, sometimes up to 4 or 5 cases in one excursion.
Friends from around the country rallied to send her money so she could purchase a more water and save on gas money. Luster said she feels blessed when she sees the donated pallet of water sitting in her basement, flanked by more packs of water ascending the stairs.
A family comes together to survive
Since losing her job and taking on whatever random work she can, like cleaning a dialysis center at night, Luster is grateful for the help of her family.
"I've tapped out my savings and I'm literally living off my parents," she said.
Her sister, Corey Luster, chimed in from the kitchen.
"It has forced us to be really reliant on each other for our survival, both economic and the water, period," said the 33-year-old.
Beyond her thinning and breaking hair, weight loss, rashes and more, Luster is worried about more than just the physical problems she and her girls are having.
"People are forgetting the emotional and mental problems that we're going through now," said Luster.
"I'm never going to forget this. My 7-year-old is never going to forget this. My 13-year-old niece is never going to forget this."
In this weekend's soccer action, the Red Bulls overcame a thorn in their side, the Cosmos kept rolling, and NYCFC fans weren't allowed the privilege of watching their team suffer another loss.
KLJESTAN MAKES HIS MARK: RED BULLS 3, CHICAGO 2
At the end of August, question marks had popped up around the Red Bulls when last place Chicago handed them a 3-2 loss on the road. Was this a bad night, or the start of a serious dip in form?
After beating down their longstanding rivals DC 3-0 the same week, the Red Bulls were set to host Chicago for a chance at revenge. But again the team seemed snakebitten, with Jeff Larentowicz converting an early penalty kick and David Accam breaking ankles to put the Fire up 2-0 in Harrison inside the first half an hour:
The Red Bulls had only once come back from a two goal deficit this season (in a 2-2 draw at DC in March), so a challenging game state was on the table. To their credit, the Red Bulls responded immediately. Sacha Kljestan would feed Bradley Wright-Phillips for his 14th of the season just two minutes after Accam's goal. Mike Grella would once again create magic in tight spaces ten minutes later to level the match 2-2:
A penalty kick put away by Kljestan would provide the game winner in the 71st minute. Kljestan has been lights out for RBNY since his ridiculous red card incident in June, scoring four goals and providing nine assists in eleven games. (He had just two goals and one assist in the fourteen games prior.)
Kljestan touched on what's helped change his game - comfort with his teammates. "The relationships with the guys around me have grown so much and I feel so much more comfortable. I think the goal that Bradley scored is an awesome goal because I take one touch and then I play it to him on the ground, and he already knows where the ball's going to be and I already know where he's going to be. At the beginning of the season you don't really have that because I'm the new guy and I haven't played with these guys...I've got a ton of confidence right now and I think that's bleeding out to the rest of my teammates."
That confidence has helped the Red Bulls climb to the top of the MLS Eastern Conference for the first time since April. Tied on points with DC but with three games in hand, they are rapidly becoming a lock to win the East and a viable contender for the Supporters' Shield.
If they want to put the Shield in their trophy case for the second time in three years, they'll need to grind out some road results this week: they travel to New England on Wednesday and then to Portland on Sunday before starting a three game home stand.
NO PLACE LIKE HOME: COSMOS 1, JACKSONVILLE 0
One year, one month, and eleven days: that's how long it's been since the Cosmos last suffered a loss at home in NASL play. NYC's green soccer team stretched that streak to 18 games with a win in the rain Saturday, edging 1-0 past the Jacksonville Armada thanks to this piece of skill from Raul:
"The important thing was for us to be calm, to be solid defensively, and at some point the game was going to give us something to be able to win," offered coach Giovanni Savarese after the match. "The special moment was given by Raul."
The win gives the Cosmos some sweet revenge against the Armada, who broke their 2015 unbeaten streak in July. It also pushes them within three points of Ottawa in the NASL Fall Season standings. Not that the fall matters much - the Cosmos have already qualified for the NASL playoffs after winning the Spring Season. They'll host their semi-final match at Coney Island's MCU Park on November 7th.
THE NO NETWORK: DALLAS 2, NYCFC 1
A thought experiment: if a soccer team puts on a good performance while losing on the road, and no one is able to watch it, does it count?
NYCFC went on the road to Dallas, desperately needing points to stay alive in the hunt for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. City hung in the match early and looked threatening, but two goals right before the interval put them deep in the hole. Dallas midfielder Tesho Akindele unleashed a laser when Jason Hernandez let he turn past him in the box. Then, to put an awful exclamation mark on the evening, Michel scored an olimpico, putting the ball in the net directly from the corner.
Coach Jason Kreis would pull all three of the team's star designated players in the second half, and astonishingly, the team looked better with more youth on the field. (Go figure?) Ned Grabavoy drew a penalty that Patrick Mullins converted to get NYCFC back into the game, but they could not find an equalizer to earn that critical road point. They remain stuck in ninth place in the East, and the odds of of passing sixth place Montreal (who hold a four point lead and three games in hang) grow increasingly long.
If there was a real travesty in the course of the match, it was that only about seven minutes were broadcast in the NYC area. NYCFC games are broadcast locally on YES, but there was no perceived consideration that the Yankees doubleheader with the Blue Jays might conflict with the NYCFC broadcast. When the first game ran into extra innings, and the second game wouldn't begin until 6:17, a conflict was inevitable - but no announcement came.
It was only announced to fans as the game was getting underway that the NYCFC game would not be put on an overflow channel. The only options provided were limited live streaming (through two cable providers), radio, or Twitter. Even when the Yankees game went into a half an hour rain delay in the sixth inning, YES kept the broadcast in their studio rather than cutting to Dallas.
When the game finally ended in the Bronx (the Yankees lost both games in the doubleheader, 9-5 and 10-7), there were only about ten minutes of play left in Dallas. YES cut to the game, waited until the final whistle, and then promptly cut back to the Yankees post-match press conference.
And naturally, social media screaming and jokes ensued - including some Yankees fans upset they were being treated as second class citizens. Sports wars!
So cool of the @YESNetwork to give us the privilege of watching this terrible Yankee game with no mention of the @NYCFC game. — Christian Polanco (@chrispolanco) September 13, 2015
It's a good thing @YESNetwork has a second channel on @DIRECTV which is showing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! Way to take care of fans @nycfc — Kevin Middendorf (@FMLKevin) September 13, 2015
Wonderful @YESNetwork waiting for the post game after a gut wrenching 9 hour double header & we're forced to watch soccer. Y is for #Yankees — Charmian Neary (@CharmianAgain) September 13, 2015
Please note. The next @YESNetwork @NYCFC broadcast will be 9/19. Unless it rains. They would really rather show rain. #NYCFC — Mark Garbowski (@mgarbowski) September 13, 2015
Andrew Marchand should ask Joe Girardi if he agrees with the YES Network's decision to show the last 4 awful innings instead of NYCFC-Dallas — Frank Isola (@FisolaNYDN) September 13, 2015
Those who really want to see the Dallas match can find it on YES this afternoon at 1PM. Those who would rather look forward can focus on NYCFC returning home for a double match week; City will host Toronto on Wednesday (for "Star Wars Night") and San Jose on Saturday. Those who would rather watch the Yankees try to not get swept at home by the Jays should turn to TBS at 1:05 PM.

When they sneak out of the library, there is a scene where Dick is at the vending machine getting some candy. He loses his money and starts kicking the machine. Every one has to run by this door one at a time to get where they are going. They all run by just missing being noticed. Ally Sheedy however slowly walks by stops and stares at Dick kicking the machine then slowly walks past unnoticed. Molly Ringwald then says "She's nuts but she's cool"
The entire sequence with everyone falling asleep at the end is deleted completely in the syndicated TV print. This is done mostly for time.
When Judd Nelson says, "You won't accept a guy's tongue in your mouth..." the television version found it necessary to edit such "vulgar" language and replace it with, "You wont accept a guy's lips on your mouth..."
Criterion Collection release from 2018 includes 50 minutes worth of deleted scenes previously unavailable on a home format.
VHS releases change the majority of the soundtrack, current DVD and Blu-ray releases have the original theatrical soundtrack
TV version features additional scenes:
When Emilio and Alley are asked to get sodas they collect money from everyone. They stick there hands out and and collect it. When they get to Anthony M Hall he gives money and then Judd Nelson sticks his hand out for money from Brian. Brian laughs, but Judd gives him a stone face, so Anthony gives him some money for a pop.
Television version features many scenes heavily edited for content. This is especially noticable when Bender is discussing his family and when the kids are smoking marijuana. Many, many expletives are also bleeped.
The scene where the kids smoke pot is heavily toned down in syndicated TV prints and Network prints. First off, all but one shots of the kids actually inhaling the joints are deleted. Also, the theatrical version shows Andrew coming out of a completly smoked filled room, and then a smile comes on his face after he takes in inhale after he leaves the room. Then he throws the joint on the floor and takes off his jacket. The TV versions are much shorter, and they begin the scene with him taking off his jacket.
The network version replaces part of the shot of Bender's locker (the part saying "fag") with an outside shot of the school.
In the TV version, when Bender says his "Can you hear this? Want me to turn it up?" line, instead of showing him put his middle finger up is shows Allison blowing her hair out of her face again.
Syndicated TV prints cut up to 20 minutes out of the movie, bringing the running time to 72 minutes without commercials.
Oddly enough, despite the fact that Bender's "Eat My Shorts" argument with the principal contains no profanity (and this later became Bart Simpson's trademark line in "Simpsons, The" (1989), television broadcasts re-dub the line as "Eat my socks".
There is at least one network version of this film that dubs out the profanity, but includes it on the closed captioning.
Australian and UK television versions are completely intact, with no scenes edited or deleted: older UK versions dub or omit the 'f' word, but more recent prints remain intact; the Australian version made no such changes, retaining an unaltered and unedited soundtrack (but is usually shown a little later in the evenings because of this).
A Chinese-led consortium has agreed to buy 1% of Australia's land—an area bigger than Ireland.
The deal to buy S. Kidman and Co—Australia's largest farming estate—is worth A$371 million (US$289 million), but has yet to be approved by Australian and Chinese regulatory authorities. The consortium is made up of Dakang Australia, which is set to acquire 80% of the land, with Australian Rural Capital (ARC) taking the remaining 20%.
S.Kidman & Co, which has pastoral leases covering almost 11 million hectares, was up for sale last year, and set off a bidding war including two Chinese companies, but the Australian government blocked any deal. Australian treasurer Scott Morrison said that selling the land to a foreign entity would be “contrary to the national interest.”
The government's main problem with the deal was that the property included the Anna Creek farm, where a military weapon testing range, the Woomera Prohibited Area, is located. The concern was that selling this portion to a foreign company could create a security risk.
The Anna Creek farm was removed from the most recent sale agreement. In December, S.Kidman & Co announced it would sell it to existing shareholders or other Australian buyers.
The estate in the current sale agreement includes 10 cattle stations with a total long-term average herd of 185,000 cattle. The property stretches across South Australia, Western Australia, the Northern Territory, and Queensland. The family that owned the company became one of Australia's largest beef producers.
Dakang Australia's parent company is Hunan Dakang Pasture Farming, a private Chinese company that is primarily involved in the breeding and distribution of pigs. It also has a large stake in New Zealand's dairy industry. Meat consumption has quadrupled in China since 1971. The country has, as a result, become more dependent on feedstock imports of soya bean and corn.
The treasury doesn't have to make a decision on whether to allow the sale until after the elections. The deal follows a two-day visit to China earlier last week (April 14) by Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and 1,000 or so business leaders, part of a push to establish more trade opportunities between nations. Turnbull even announced that Australian rules football—similar to Rugby and American football—will be coming to China (even though no one really cares about it).
Story Highlights No patients were aboard when the helicopter went down Monday night in Rochelle
ROCHELLE, Ill. (AP) — Hospital officials say a pilot and two nurses were killed when a medical helicopter crashed in a field while traveling between two northern Illinois hospitals.
Rockford Memorial Hospital identified those killed as pilot Andy Olson and flight nurses Karen Hollis and Jim Dillow. In a news release Tuesday, officials at Rockford Memorial Hospital say they are grieving for "three heroes who dedicated their careers to serving others."
No patients were aboard when the helicopter went down Monday night in Rochelle, about 70 miles west of Chicago. A spokesman for the Rockford hospital says its helicopter was flying to pick up a patient at a Mendota hospital.
Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Tony Molinaro says the FAA is helping the National Transportation Safety Board investigate to determine what caused the crash.

Gmail voice and video chat makes it easy to stay in touch with friends and family using your computer's microphone and speakers. But until now, this required both people to be at their computers, signed in to Gmail at the same time. Given that most of us don't spend all day in front of our computers, we thought, “wouldn't it be nice if you could call people directly on their phones?”
Starting today, you can call any phone right from Gmail.
Calls to the U.S. and Canada will be free for at least the rest of the year and calls to other countries will be billed at our very low rates. We worked hard to make these rates really cheap (see comparison table) with calls to the U.K., France, Germany, China, Japan—and many more countries—for as little as $0.02 per minute.
Dialing a phone number works just like a normal phone. Just click “Call phone” at the top of your chat list and dial a number or enter a contact's name.

20 Awesome Self Development Questions
I talk about self development questions a lot because as a Life Coach they are at the very core of what I do.
Sure I need to be able to build rapport and actively listen to clients, but if I can't ask the right question at the right time, then I'm unlikely to help effect lasting change.
It's over a year since I wrote my post 7 Killer Life Coaching Questions and I thought that as this is such an important aspect of self development it might be time to compile a more authoritative list than can help you Life Coach yourself.
The questions are in no specific order and I would love to hear your take in the comments section on your favorites and whether you have any personal ones that I may have missed out.
1. What's really important to me?
This is a values based question that, if you ask it enough times, will uncover the essence of who you are as a person. Whatever the answer is that comes back, ask the follow-up question of, “What does that give me?”
Then ask it again and again and again until you can't go any further and end up with one word. Then say hello and give a big hug to a core value of yours.
2. What else can this mean?
Possibly the best question of the lot and one I speak about on a (very) regular basis. It creates curiosity and an opportunity to reframe any negative situation.
What's not to love about that?
3. Who can help me?
Most people when they are setting out on a huge goal become obsessed with what they need to do to succeed.
Fortunately though, success leaves a trail, and you can follow that trail.
Whatever it is you want to achieve, somebody has either done the exact same thing or something similar in the past.
Talk to those people, read about them, even hire them if you can. Drop the belief that you need to do everything yourself and get help, maybe even hire a Life Coach!
4. Who can I help?
This question gets you out of your own head and allows you to focus on helping others. “But I don't really want to help others” you may be thinking. Well that's cool, but you're actually hard wired to do so and altruism stimulates the same part of the brain as taking cocaine.
And I think we can all agree that helping other people is way cooler and much cheaper than developing a coke habit.
5. How often is my gut instinct wrong?
If you are like most people I know, you will occasionally get a strong gut instinct about something. You will also frequently override that gut instinct and then live to regret it because it doesn't seem to make sense at a conscious level.
There's a reason I end every client consultation by saying to the prospective client;
“Go with your gut instinct. If you feel I am the right Life Coach for you, then hire me. If you have some niggling doubts, then don't, because you're gut will probably be right”
Next time you have a strong gut instinct ask yourself how often it's wrong. If that's rarely, then trust it!
6. What would my life be like if I were to go easier on myself?
It seems to me the vast majority of people beat themselves up and I meet plenty that are almost proud of the fact.
The really bizarre thing about this behavior is that it rarely changes a thing. If years or decades of being hard on yourself hasn't worked, wouldn't now be a great time to adopt a slightly different approach?
7. If I didn't need money what would I do with my life?
Money is often the biggest obstacle to people living the life of their dreams. Or at least that's what they think, but they are often very wrong.
Think what you really want to do, see and achieve in your life, and then work out how much money you require to do that.
Do not do what most people do, which is try and acquire as much money as you can and then decide what you want to do with it.
That's the kind of behavior that traps you in a job you hate, but pays great money. Trust me, I've been there.
8. Who can I forgive?
If you want to feel crap about yourself and your life, hold as many grudges as you possibly can. None of them will hurt the person you think wronged you, but they will hurt you and that's almost the same thing, right?
I don't care how much somebody has hurt you, forgive them.
Even write to them telling them you forgive them so you can then move on. You don't even need to mail the letter and the person doesn't even need to still be alive. Just the act of forgiveness can be a huge weight off your shoulders.
9. What am I truly grateful for?
Another obvious one, but get this. It's almost impossible to feel down and depressed and grateful at the same time. A sense of gratitude is one of the most powerful positive emotions known to mankind.
I know for a fact that you have a shit load of stuff to be grateful for. At the very least I know you have eyesight as you are reading this post. You also have access to a computer and/or smart phone as well as electricity and a some form of Internet connection.
If you can't think of 100 things you're grateful for you're either not trying hard enough or you're dead.
10. What would Richard Branson do?
Who is your hero or heroine? Next time you get in a tricky situation, think how they would deal with it. I was talking to my co-author John Strelecky the other day as we were preparing to place the order for the second print run of How To Be Rich and Happy.
I was nervous of the amount of books we were ordering as it was 50% higher than the first print run. John sensed this and he also knows how much I admire Richard Branson. So he picked a Branson phrase and said ‘Screw it, let's do it” and with that, I agreed.
Note: If Charlie Sheen is your hero, you may want to skip past this question.
11. What's my end game?
Next time you are about to complain or whine about something or kick off an argument with a friend or family member ask yourself the above question.
What do you want to achieve and is the route you're about to head down get likely to get you there? 90% of disagreements could be eradicated if everybody on the planet (including me) adopted this question a tad more often!
12. If I did know, what would the answer be?
A stupid question on the face of it, but it's brilliance is in its simplicity. Quite often when I ask a client how they intend to achieve something they'll respond that they don't know. I'll almost always throw this question back at them.
The very least that happens is they laugh at it and I break their state (which frequently helps with problem-solving), but more often than not they will come back with a solution.
The question gives your unconscious permission to dream and be creative because the reality is, you do know.
13. On a scale of 0 to 10 how committed am I to achieving ‘X'?
If I ever ask a client this question and get an answer of 7 or less I know whatever it is, almost certainly isn't going to get done and I have more work to do.
You are either committed to something or your not and 70% commitment is almost worse than no commitment at all. Think about the really successful people you admire, how many of them are half, or even three quarter-assed when it comes to commitment?
Correct, none of them.
14. What can I learn from this?
I've done it to death I know, but it's a hugely powerful question.
If you can learn from a negative situation you reduce the likelihood that it will ever happen again. Asking this question will shift your mind away from “I'm a failure, I screwed up again” to “Wow, I learned some really cool stuff”
15. What can I do to break this pattern of behavior?
Your brain loves patterns. It will sometimes even go out of its way to create patterns where none really exist. If you have ever stared at the clouds for any length of time and started to see shapes and people that aren't really there you'll know what I mean.
Some people think they can't change in the future because they haven't changed in the past.
That's nonsense.
Yes, your brain prefers to replicate patterns of behavior because it's easier and requires less energy.
However, it will also allow you to break those patterns if you consciously step in and disrupt them. And the operative word there is ‘consciously' because without conscious awareness change happens organically and largely out of your control.
16. What can I do today that will scare me?
Self development is about expanding your comfort zone and to do so means you have to experience some discomfort and fear. That's cool though, because it is only fear and as such just it's an emotion and we all know emotions aren't real, right?
17. What's the backstory?
You're a human being and as such you act like an assclown from time to time, we all do. Fortunately you know the reason or reasons when you do so, and they're usually legitimate.
Maybe you didn't sleep well, you're worried about money, a close family member is seriously ill, one of your kids just got into trouble at school or the mother-in-law is coming to stay for a few days.
Any one of the above can knock you off your ‘A' game and cause you to be a bit tetchy, and the same goes for anybody else. Before you presume somebody wants to kill you because they cut you up on the Interstate ask yourself what their backstory may be.
18. What will that goal give me?
People will often set goals because they think they should or because they seem cool at first glance. Our initial goal to sell 1,000,000 copies of How To Be Rich and Happy was a case in point, and it sucked.
When we started to drill down we realized it didn't give us a fat lot, except money. The new goal of giving the books to good causes delivers on multiple fronts and is far more inspiring to both myself and John.
19. What would my perfect day look like?
If you're not sure what you want to do with your life ask yourself the above question. Give your mind permission to wander and the freedom to dream big. How much of your perfect day are you working toward? How much could you be working toward? How much will you work toward?
20. Would I Rather Be Right Or Be Loved?
I had so many brilliant questions and thanks to all of you that offered them up. I went for the one that Pam first mentioned because it's a beauty, and she is 100% right it can stop a lot of arguments before they get going.
The 'Immortal' Homemade Yogurt That Traveled 'Round The World
Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Nishta Mehra Courtesy of Nishta Mehra
As Dan Charles reported on Monday, yogurt has a way of igniting passions. In his story of arson, the flames were literal.
Once you start looking, it's really not hard to find people — even entire countries — deeply attached to this nourishing and calming food.
Back in 2012, I learned an amazing fact: With a little TLC, yogurt can essentially live forever. How? Because yogurt is swimming with billions of bacteria that are busy all the time (as long as the temperature is right) fermenting the sugar, or lactose, in milk into lactic acid.
If you're making your own yogurt at home, you need an old batch to make a new batch. And the community of microbes in that yogurt starter — and the flavor — should remain relatively unchanged if you make it the same way every time. That's what Rachel Dutton, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of California, San Diego who studies cheese and other dairy products, says, anyway.
Of course, most Americans are in the habit of buying their yogurt at the grocery store. We like our yogurt sweet and mild.
But in many countries, like India, most yogurt is still made daily, even twice a day, at home. And that homemade yogurt tends to have a different flavor and texture — thicker and more sour — than the stuff made in a big yogurt factory. (For more on big yogurt factories, sit tight for Dan's forthcoming story on Wednesday.)
Veena Mehra, who emigrated to the U.S. from India, discovered when she first arrived in Oklahoma in 1970 that American yogurt wasn't like what she was used to eating back home.
"It just did not taste the same," she tells me. Her husband was studying at the University of Oklahoma, and there weren't any Indian groceries in Norman. "I tried buttermilk, and then I tried to use the yogurt I found at the store to make my own, but it just didn't work."
She continued to long for her homemade yogurt, so in 1975 or 1976 (she can't remember exactly what year it was), when she returned to Mumbai to visit her family, she decided to bring some yogurt starter back with her on the plane.
"I just put it in a container and then in my purse," she says. The yogurt survived the 21-hour journey to Memphis, Tenn., where they'd moved. Two days later, she was making yogurt again. And, most important, she says, "It tasted good: tart and thick."
Some 40 years later, Mehra, now 68, has kept that same starter going. She says she shared it with other Indian families in Memphis, and brought it with her when she moved to Houston three years ago after her husband died, to be closer to her daughter, Nishta, and grandson.
Nishta, who has a food blog called Blue Jean Gourmet, tells me she's also very partial to her mother's yogurt. "I think all of the American yogurt is really gross — I can't eat it," she says. "And I have this weird experience where I feel like my ancestors are looking down on me, and I can't bring myself to buy it."
And she's learned how to make it herself. "We make a batch every two weeks, or my mom makes a batch and brings it over."
Mehra says they both eat yogurt pretty much every day, in a classic Indian cucumber condiment called raita. Or they'll put just salt and pepper in it. And she says it tastes the same as it always did.
Each time she makes it, she follows the same simple process: She takes two cups of whole organic milk out of the fridge and lets it get to room temperature. Then she warms it over medium heat on the stove for 2.5 minutes. Next, she pours it into a plastic tub and adds a spoonful of yogurt from the old batch to the warm milk, mixing them together. Then she covers it with towels and puts it in the microwave (not to zap it, just to get it out of the way). The next morning, she's got her yogurt, and it goes back in the fridge.
The key to this method, of course, is that you always leave a little yogurt to make the next batch. And Mehra has managed to do that for 40 years.
According to Dutton, the microbiologist, it's plausible that Mehra's 2015 yogurt is very close, biologically and flavorwise, to the yogurt she brought over in 1975 or 1976. After all, to make yogurt, you really only need two species of bacteria: Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus.
"It's possible that the two species have been evolving over that time period, so maybe they're a little different, but they may be behaving in a similar way because you're always asking them to do the same thing," says Dutton.
In this sense, yogurt is different from a fermented food like sourdough bread. "Yogurt is much more controlled," she says, because you heat the milk and kill most of the microbes in it before adding the yogurt starter. So in theory, the only active microbes in the starter are the same ones that Mehra brought over from India four decades ago.
Sourdough, meanwhile, would adapt to a new place much more quickly because you have to add grain to starter, Dutton says. The grain, unlike the milk, hasn't been heated and could be carrying new, local microbes.
Want to try making your own flavorful yogurt at home? If you don't have a neighbor with heirloom yogurt like Mehra's who can share a spoonful, you can buy heirloom starter. It will probably yield a better yogurt than using store-bought yogurt because the bacteria in industrially produced yogurt can't regenerate very long — maybe just for a generation or two.
Heirloom yogurt, however, can theoretically live forever in good hands.
It looks like 2015 is going to be the Year Of The Scrambler. It's fast becoming the dominant genre on the new wave custom scene, and manufacturers are getting into the act too.
As everyone knows, Ducati has joined Triumph in offering a factory scrambler—and Moto Guzzi has just released a kit that converts the popular V7 into a machine capable of light off-road excursions.
Milwaukee is unlikely to join the party, but that hasn't stopped inventive custom builders from doing the dirty on Sportsters. The latest is Benjie Flipprboi of BCR, with this heavily modified 1999 Harley 883 called ‘American Scrambler.'
“For years we had an old 883 in the shop,” says Benjie, who works out of Edison, New Jersey. “It was a small, beat-up bike with a chromed-out engine and mismatched wheels. For a long time, we didn't know what to do with it.”
Benjie considered turning the 883 into a bobber or a cafe racer. “But we build bikes to stand out and be ridden hard. So we decided to turn the old cruiser into a bike that could be ridden everywhere.” And here we have it: the ready-for-adventure ‘American Scrambler.'
The first step was to get rid of the cruiser ergonomics—the high front end and low seat. On went a set of late ‘90s Suzuki GSX1000 forks to lower the front. “We kept the Harley front hub but machined a new front axle and an adapter to accommodate the GSX's double disc brakes,” says Benjie.
To prop up the rear, Benjie used longer shocks (and raised the mounts by an inch). Then he installed lightweight aluminum Borrani wheels with raised-center ‘dirt catcher' rims and fitted Shinko 705 Trail Master dual-purpose tires.
Next step was to figure out the tank. Typical scrambler-style tanks wouldn't fit, due to the shape of the Harley top-end. So Benjie fabricated a tank that follows the curve of the cylinder heads, adding a stainless steel rack and positioning a Monza gas cap off-center. Aside from a black flame graphic, the finish is bare polished aluminum finish.
“That gave us a beautiful curve to play with when building our seat,” says Benjie. “To maintain the natural flow of the lines, we got the front of the seat to follow the tail of the tank, and then curved the seat up at the rear.” To further abandon the bike's previous life as a cruiser, the cowhide leather seat is as narrow as you can get without exposing the frame rails.
There's a custom oil tank slotted inside the frame midsection, with a notch to hide a gel-cell battery.
The fenders and number plate are aluminum to match the gas tank, and held in place by stainless steel mounting brackets. The front skid plate is also aluminum, with ventilation slots to help cool the voltage regulator. A small mild-steel dashboard houses the stock tachometer & warning lights.
Chrome engines do not generally look attractive on scramblers—or indeed any motorcycle—so Benjie sandblasted the side covers and the top end to get a pitted matte finish. Then the internals were treated to a 1200cc piston kit and there's a custom air filter box with stainless wire mesh covering the inlet.
The usual Sportster belt drive was ditched in favor of a chain and Benjie's cut out the side cover of the engine, exposing the front sprocket and gold chain.
The only thing left to fit was an aftermarket headlight bucket and taillight. But nothing seemed to look right, so BCR built their own.
“We wanted to tuck the headlight bucket between the fork legs, so we designed it to be as narrow as possible. The taillight is bare aluminum and wraps around the frame end loop.”
The defining element of any scrambler is invariably the exhaust system. “We wanted to stay true to the signature scrambler style, but as always, we also wanted to give it our own unique twist. So we fabricated our own 2-into-2 exhaust using stainless steel and mounted the mufflers high, in the vein of old school scramblers.”
With adventure in his veins and his eyes on the horizon, there was one last detail that Benjie needed to add: an all-purpose road kit. So he designed a detachable leather bag that matches the cowhide leather of the seat. There's even a protective aluminum plate to help keep the bag clean during the scrambler's (hopefully) muddy future ventures.
BCR's ‘American Scrambler' is both functional and fun. Unlike most Harleys, these 883 can handle a stretch of hard-packed dirt as well as ribbons of asphalt.
And damn, doesn't it look good?

Kit is underpowered & needs more inf? NO! You just need to "git gud scrub!"
This deck went 5-1 in a 17 player, 4 round & top 4 cut GNK! The GNK was stacked with good players including a Top 16 Worlds finalist (who gave me my only loss), a UK Regional winner & a UK Regional top 8'er. In fact some people said it was basically a mini Regional!!!
It stomped Russian NeH & a score of HB:ETF decks! Nothing could keep up!
How does it work?
Using the power of Beth you get all the clickless cards & money you need!
You think things cost too much to install cause you ain't Kate?! THINK AGAIN! Just drain 1 temujin contract & enjoy all the money you need to setup! After that, money don't matter because you have Lockpicks, Ghost Runners & Cloaks FOR DAYS! (Especially with the lovely MU Mirror gives you!)
And what to actually do?! HAMMER R&D! The deck runs 10 R&D attack cards! Simply play which every one Beth gives you, play it fast & never let up!
THE KIT TRAIN HAS NO BRAKES!!!
slight changes after thinking about it again. added a top and bottom bar so you can see who is at the TOP and the BOTTOM. there is no left and right bar because lets face it, all characters have at least one flaw.
———-
Changes are as follows:
Wii Fit definitely lacks options but is a bit less flawed than i originally thought, i feel. i moved her down and to the right.
i moved Robin downward because i just don't think he/she has enough KO power.
i moved Lucario to the right because i think that the wall cling and his excellent Up B have a lot of mixup potential. he's still slightly to the left of Greninja because he's slower but is higher because of his exponential power buildup at high percents.
Pikachu is quick and pretty powerful but isn't represented that strongly in high level play, i feel. i still think he's pretty balanced so i moved him slightly down and to the right.
———-
Now let me explain the rest of my opinion…
Let's start with Quadrant III (bottom left) and the characters that really stick out.
Olimar and DK are at the bottom because they're slow and lack power where it counts. Olimar has to have the right Pikmin at his side to do real work, and DK's attacks take a lot of time to land. Bowser's higher than him because he has a little less lag in his moves. Ike is over to the left because pretty much any character with projectiles can avoid him, but he has a sword and that definitely counts for something (Uair), so he's a bit higher up. Robin lacks KO power, so he's low, but has a few tricks up his sleeve with his charge attack. Game & Watch has his Up Smash (and its super armor) but everything else is super short-range. Palutena has Reflected and Up Smash but i feel these are easily defeated/highly telegraphed attacks. Luigi seems difficult to judge at this point actually, and finally Jigglypuff mixes up with the air mobility but is just very easily killed… Not to mention Rest seems harder to land??
Now Quadrant II (top left). These are the characters that are quite powerful but i feel are difficult to win with.
Little Mac - duh. If he can stay grounded, he's got a huge advantage. His Ftilt is super good and he can do his Up Smash out of dash. Dedede is slow and had a nerf (telegraph) to his dash attack, but his Side B and aerials seem a lot better, and could prove to be really viable. Sonic SEEMS at first glance to be really good but as Mehdi found out, he lacks KO power unless you get lucky and land a Forward/Up smash, which is unlikely. Charizard is powerful but his most powerful attack, his Side B, can be easily punished with ANY Counter move or even with just a jump out of the way, because if it misses, Charizard might not recover back to the stage. Ganondorf (right on the line) is still a pretty disrespectful character to play, but just has a crapton of killing power to make up for it (boots to the face with Forward Tilt, ugh). Mega Man is only over to the left because i think my Villager will always have a good matchup, solely because Mega Man's attacks are ALL pocketable.
Speaking of Villager (as he's my main), he's over to the left because he lacks speed, Smash range, and has probably the WORST grab in the game, dashing or otherwise— it has shitty range and enormous lag if it misses— BUT if any Smashes hit or if he lands a grab, it can lead into a devastating turnip (Up/Down Air) combos. He has some zoning options (Side B/Side Air/Tree) but these can become predictable. But how about that Pocket?? It multiplies the power and speed of the pocketed item, and some Pocketed attacks can kill at 0% (another Villager's Tree, Mega Man/Samus' fully charged beam, etc?) Overall i feel it is a challenge to win as Villager but oh so satisfying.
Closing out Quadrant II is Marth, who i feel was nerfed compared to previous iterations but is still relatively good (damn you, sword!), and Duck Hunt, who is a tricky bastard with THREE separately controllable projectiles, but has a lacking horizontal recovery along with questionable (i.e. will they actually hit?) Smash attacks.
Quadrant IV (bottom right) are the characters that have pretty good moves but take a lot of technical skill to win with. Mario and Dr. Mario are real back-to-basics characters that can make decent combos but both suck at recovering, the latter being worse. What I see a lot of Pit/Dark Pits doing is spamming their Side B, which are indeed powerful moves, but once they become predictable they are easily punished… big time. Kirby is nearer to the middle because i think it depends on who he ends up Copying. he's not too powerful and all of his B attacks are easy to see and avoid. Meta Knight is low but more to the right because he was HEAVILY nerfed but still seems to have some good moves.
Now, Quadrant I (top right). These are the GOOD characters. in a beginner's hands, they're probably going to do decently, but in the hands of professionals they'll probably mop the floor with most of the other characters. Sheik and Diddy are touching the top line because they just have SO MANY options. so many that i can't even explain them all because i don't know how to play them and you'd just have to watch pros play on YouTube. Diddy is further to the left just because of his shitty Up B… like, it has range, but if you don't time it right, you just wasted a stock. Yoshi is just so goddamn powerful and i see a lot of Yoshis get easy spikes with his Forward Air, or just low percentage kills with any attack that involves Yoshi's tail (U-air, B-air, Up Smash), and don't even get me started on Happy Feet (D-air)… Yoshi's just really freakin' powerful. His only downfall seems to be his recovery (Up B doesn't propel him far up). Zero Suit Samus is also very good but you can see she's a lot further to the left than Sheik. Sheik and ZS Samus share a lot of similar moves but i feel that it's a lot easier to land KO moves with Sheik. if you read correctly you can avoid getting ZS Samus' Up B to the face, which is her main KO move, i feel.
Captain Falcon is way over to the left because, although he does have the Knee, AND his Up Air, AND the Falcon Punch, AND his SUPER buffed Side B, his moves have a LOT of lags if they whiff, not to mention he yells out all of his attacks. Definitely a good character but i think a lot of players OVERestimate how good he is and just get punished for spamming Side B and Falcon Punch.
Fox is lower down because he's very balanced as far as attack options, but i think he only has one really viable kill move, his Up Air. He's way better than Falco as far as i'm concerned. i don't think we'll see as many Space Animals in high level play but they seem like they can be good fallbacks.
I don't really have a good opinion on the characters near the middle, because i think they're really Jack of All Trades but masters of none… and I don't play them at all. They'll probably win with a good player or be able to fake out some players, but they really are just AVERAGE. I only put Shulk in the middle because i think Monado arts will trick a lot of players but he really does have readable attacks and he's loud.
TLDR; i placed each character in quadrants based off how easy it is to win with them, Quadrant III being the hardest and Quadrant I being the easiest.

The circus has rolled through town once again. Scenes of mayhem are a staple of the Black Friday media scrum. For over a decade the consumerist holiday has been pushing its roots down into the depths of our collective psyche and this year, although not the worst in terms of violent outbursts, sees the sinister influence spread internationally with the UK and Brazil readily embroiled in the manufactured hysteria.
Much has been said, and indeed is self-evident, of the contrived nature of the ‘holiday'. Many of the products on sale are sub-par versions of desired luxury items, and the need to inject a sense of urgency into proceedings puts the priorities of retailers well above the benefit, comfort and even safety of their customers. In the US, the scenes of panicked shopping are a stark reminder that the thankfulness expressed just a single day earlier sits on very shaky ground – whilst in the UK and elsewhere the successful attempt to export the furore comes with a hefty dose of dissonance as the time of year isn't attached to any kind of annual public holiday.
There are a number of things that sit with particular unease about Black Friday. On the outset, the scenes of violence repulse us. How could people behave in that manner? Such savagery, all for a cheap television! Dig a little bit deeper though and you see that most of us are complicit in the feeding frenzy. Over US$57,000,000,000 was spent last year in the United States, and if you didn't physically enter a store it's likely that you got caught up with a few online deals (I certainly did). Most of us take part, even whilst speaking of the evils of such blatant materialism. We claim to despise the scenes of violence but are drawn to them likes moths to a flame – the voyeurism and sense of self-righteous indignation validating our closely held notions that the problems faced by society are always manifest in the actions of somebody other than ourselves.
Beyond the more visceral scenes of interpersonal conflict, though, lies a far more sinister narrative. We are quick to blame the people involved on the ground, highlighting a worrying subtext of classist denigration aimed at the poorer demographics in society, whilst the manipulative structures of psychological coercion that rest just underneath the surface are often overlooked as ‘business as usual'. The deeply impacting construction of consumer desire put into motion by commercially vested interests has become so common place – advertising and media sensationalism such an accepted part of our modern identity – that we are primed to miss the forest for the trees.
By focusing on the visual outbursts of violence and directing our anger onto the individuals who perpetrate them, we are overlooking the systemic violence inherent in our socioeconomic frameworks. Our global economy is currently geared in a manner that places human dignity at the bottom of the pile, purposefully manufacturing the desire to participate in structures that have little concern for our wellbeing as whole persons and more interest in our transactional agency as economic actors. We should not at all be surprised that such a framework manifests in scenes of shopping stampedes and subsequent injuries, of people fighting over poorly manufactured luxury items, of forever seeking to procure the new and rarely needed rather than appreciate the already owned.
Black Friday is a reminder that we are losing our grasp on a vision of humanity that uplifts the human being in a society that values each of us as more than just our productive output (an arbitrarily defined, private-sector focused notion of productivity at that). Unfortunately, at the same time that we are able to see this effect in many different areas of modern society and the global inequality that it promotes, we are also starting to buy into the idea that the problem lies with the materialism of the individual. That our own complicity in bolstering this consumerist society is the real problem. Until we can all fix our own selfish desires, how can we possibly suggest we should find alternatives to the structures that only exist to serve such a demand?
The ease with which we can place the blame at our own feet (and credit cards) speaks volumes as to the totality of the indoctrination process. Rather than limit the production of over-supplied goods, we have been coerced into desiring the purchase of them regardless of actual need. For the better part of the last century, our desire for commercial products and consumer luxuries has been consciously shaped to meet an ever-increasing need to match our misconstrued notion that economic growth is the measure of a healthy society.
This casts a menacing shadow over our future. The innovation available through the organising mechanisms of the private sector is immense, and in many instances will be required to weather the coming storms of environmental and geopolitical instability. However, we must break free of the idea that society is dependent on a forever growing economy measured by commercial productivity. Otherwise we will not be able to rectify hierarchical imbalances of authority and agency that have placed the role of the person and our collective wellbeing at the bottom of the priority list. If we continue to put our efforts into constructing the person as servant to an amorphous and insatiable entity know as ‘the economy', then we are relegating our future to the workhouse by encouraging the dehumanising tendencies of increasingly abstracted institutions.
Black Friday should be a forceful reminder that we need to reformulate the purpose of our social, political and commercial institutions in a manner that understands the totality of the impact they have on our collective identity and vision of humanity. It's time to right the balance, and challenge structures that overwhelm us in the relentless and almost uncontrollable pursuit for the construction of the perfect consumer.
The fact that we are ‘complicit' in this system, that we profit from it and are kept sated by the products we crave, should not hold us back from seeing the structural violence that lies at its core.
In the words of Oscar Wilde: “…the worst slave-owners were those who were kind to their slaves, and so prevented the horror of the system being realised by those who suffered from it.”
Sports broadcasting can be a fickle business. One day you are the apple of an executive's eye, as attractive as Salma Hayek or one of those Hemsworth dudes. Take Phil Simms, for instance. Last August, upon talking to this column, CBS Sports chairman Sean McManus did not waver on his opinion of his top NFL analyst.
“Listening to it with a very critical ear, I think Phil is vastly underappreciated, and part of that is the overreaction to social media,” McManus said. “If you listen to what he said during some of the biggest moments of the season—he was the first one to say if Denver won the Super Bowl, Von Miller would be MVP, and he was the first one to criticize Cam Newton for not jumping on his fumble toward the end of the game. He was on top of most of the storylines for most of the game, and that's part of the reason we won the [Sports] Emmy [for Outstanding Live Sports Special]. I would just suggest that if people listen to Jim and Phil with an open mind, I think they would recognize what a good job they are doing.”
Ah, romance. Seven months later, Simms is out. On Tuesday CBS announced that former Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo will become the network's lead NFL game analyst beginning with the 2017-18 NFL season. Romo joins Jim Nantz and Tracy Wolfson on the top announce team for the network's coverage of the NFL on Sunday afternoons and Thursday Night Football.
I guess it's time to start dressing up. #CBS pic.twitter.com/GseSRiyNOo — Tony Romo (@tonyromo) April 4, 2017
Along with coming into the booth without any network experience, Romo will not have that benefit of starting with a lower broadcast team to get reps, something Troy Aikman, Simms and many other NFL broadcasters have done. That is a high-wire tightrope no matter how bright or comfortable you are in front of the camera. And NFL fans are not shy with opinions of broadcasting newcomers, as former referee and CBS Sports employee Mike Carey found out quickly.
CBS will provide Romo with everything to make things work, including assigning him their top NFL producer (Lance Barrow) and top director (Mike Arnold). But there are no guarantees in sports broadcasting. Ray Lewis, he of the fire and brimstone speeches as a Baltimore Raven, looked to be a sure thing as a NFL analyst. He was not. Conversely, Louis Riddick, who was a journeyman player in the NFL, has turned into one of the best on-air voices in the sport. In Romo's position, as a color analyst, the mechanics of TV can be taught. What can't be taught is how he prepares for each week and when (if ever) he decides to morph from an ex-player into a fulltime broadcaster. Will he work on behalf of viewers rather than the league, his former team and friends in the league? That's always a key question.
Naturally, McManus thinks Romo will be a game-changer.
“People have said to us, ‘Boy, you're taking a guy who is coming right from the field into a position as a lead analyst, isn't that a risk?' Well, I think it's a very manageable risk, to be honest with you,” McManus said. “I think Tony will be having all sorts of work this summer, whether it's doing practice games, whether it's doing preseason games, whether it's sitting down and looking at film and tape of other analysts and the kind of job that they do. It's going to be a full time job for Tony really starting this summer. So I think when he goes to the booth, he'll be ready. But will he better Week 6 than he is Week 1? Yes, he will be. Will he better in Year 2 than he will be in Year 1, yes he will. But if we didn't have the faith in Tony, if we didn't have the faith that he could be an outstanding analyst, we wouldn't be taking this risk.”
Romo said he spoke to other networks and he thanked them for the interest. He said he felt a connection with the CBS group and that working with Nantz was a big factor in his decision. CBS offered the No. 1 spot from the jump. He is the fifth lead NFL analyst (Pat Summerall, Tom Brookshier, John Madden and Simms) in that network's football history.
On a conference call on Tuesday afternoon, Romo was contemplative and introspective. He clearly won't be a rah-rah analyst like Jon Gruden, nor the over-the-top personality of Madden. He had a good perspective on whether he would get inklings to play again and conceded that he would never feel the same rush in the booth that he did on the field.
“I've got to go attack this just like football and see where I'm good and where I'm not,” Romo said. “The one thing I have always felt is if there is a strength of mine, it's my ability to learn. If I'm not very good right away, my hope is it doesn't take too long. And if I'm not, I can promise you I'll be spending 20-hours a day trying to figure it out and I'll be analyzing that all the time. That's the approach I'm going to take, and I think that gives me the best chance to succeed.”
​When asked about specific analysis, Romo was pretty good on the call, whether discussing the Texans or Patriots.
“There are millions of little scenarios within the game,” Romo said. “The adjustment that took place at the Super Bowl: Bill Belichick runs a bear front defense, which means he puts three lineman right over the center in guards. Well, guess what Atlanta does? They run wide and gash [the Patriots] in the first half. Well, how smart is Belichick? He comes right out and runs a completely different front in the second half. They get one run. It's a really intelligent move. That's the kind of stuff you have a chance to communicate if you can get out there and recognize it. There are a lot of little things and it's going to be fun with the evaluation process.”
As for Simms, CBS said that they are still discussing what he will do in the future. Tara Sullivan, the sports columnist of The Record, spoke to Simms' agent, Steve Rosner of 16W Marketing, LLC, who confirmed that Simms has multiple years left on his CBS contract.
“I've had a few brief discussions with CBS in regard to the future and we have decided at the moment that we will regroup within the next month or so and figure out what his future role will be,” Rosner told Sullivan.
Rosner is a smart guy and the move for Simms would be to quietly take the demotion and continue working. One of the geniuses of Verne Lundquist and Brent Musburger was that they always took assignments, no matter the level or event. Simms will always have work as an analyst if he doesn't get caught up in where he is on the rotation.
Sports networks always have on hand a list of current coaches and players who might make for good analysts. McManus said every time his production teams would do a Dallas game, they reported back that Romo had the potential to be an excellent analyst. The CBS chairman and his top lieutenant David Berson, also met Romo at a party prior to Super Bowl 49 in Phoenix. McManus asked Romo what he thought about the game and Romo proceeded to give him 10 minutes of analysis.
“I didn't realize I would get an audition,” McManus said. “I walked away from that conversation and said to David, ‘Someday that man is going to be a lead analyst.'” (The moral of this story is anytime you meet a TV exec, you are always auditioning.)
McManus said his conversations began with Romo shortly after the NFL season was over, and talks heated up in the last couple of weeks.
“What are the attributes that led us to believe Tony was perfect for this role?” McManus said. “First of all he is remarkably articulate. Having had a lot of conversations with him and not just about football but about life, he has an uncanny way of expressing himself in an amazingly understandable way. He is passionate about the NFL and if you are not passionate about the NFL, you have no shot at being an NFL analyst. That passion will come through in his commentary and I think it is a really important part of what makes Tony Romo. He is very likeable and you can't teach that. You are either likeable on television or not likeable on television and Tony both in person and on television is an incredibly likeable young man.”
You get the picture. McManus spent additional time saying Romo would do the research and preparation that it takes to be a top analyst. He praised Romo's sense of humor. He said Romo had a great outlook on life. He did not, I can confirm, say Romo will bring peace between North and South Korea.
Romo said the decision was difficult but that this is what he wanted to do over the next 15-20 years. One thing he will be quickly graded on his how he discusses the Cowboys during both Dallas games and games involving their division and conference rivals.
“I am speaking from a novice position here, but my feelings are that am always going to feel the need to want to talk up the Cowboys,” Romo said. “Those are your friends, those are the people you sweat and bled with, these are people you will be close with for a long time. For a while I am going to want them to succeed. Now there is part of my job that you need to be impartial. That is part of being an analyst…. I will be fine critiquing players. That is part of the position.”
You bet it is. Cris Collinsworth once told me that he felt he became an analyst when he started thinking about himself as a broadcaster first and a former player second. That will also be the line for Romo, except he's going to be judged much faster and much harder in a social media environment. CBS thinks it has its top NFL guy for the next decade plus. We'll soon see.

(SALEM, Ore.) - A Ukrainian hackers group called "Cyber Berkut" revealed a Qatari -Ukrainian secret arms deal including land to air missiles in support for the ISIS terrorist group. Ahmed Tahiri, the Egyptian prominent journalist, said that the hackers group obtained secret documents from the former Qatari Defence Minister Major General Hamad bin Ali al-Attiyah's negotiations with his Ukrainian counterpart Stjepan Bolturak, to buy air defence systems as well as supplying different types of Cobra, Stinger and Strla missiles to later be handed over to the ISIS terrorist group through intermediaries in Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Not far from the international scene regarding Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the young Qatari Emir's policies, observers say that the Emir is seeking to overthrow ministers and the country's veteran characters, who remain loyal to his father, Hamad Bin Khalifa, in a move to consolidate his own power in Qatar which is witnessing competition between the ruling family (not to mention the deep divisions among them) according to news sources in Qatar's Emiri Diwan. Political analysts question Doha's justifications regarding reshuffling the cabinet and merging eight ministries into four along with overthrowing Foreign Minister Khalid bin Mohamed al-Attiyah and Defense Minister Hamad bin Ali al-Attiyah, after the Emir named himself as the defense minister. That raises questions about how much Emir Tamim bin Hamad trusts his ministers amid news about the attempts of a coup d'état in the country, which occupies the fourth place among the largest gas producers in the world. Reuters quoted a Western diplomat on the condition of anonymity that "the Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, seeks to overthrow the majority of his ministers from office, but it was not possible to overthrow them all at once." Doha claims that reshuffling the cabinet was an effort to cut costs, as a result of the sharp decline in oil prices, in light of Doha's expectations to record $13 billion budget deficit in 2016. _________________________________________

After a skiing accident in January left him with a smashed knee, Beck Bailey, a transgender man in Greenfield, Mass., spent 15 days in a Vermont hospital undergoing a handful of surgeries. As part of his normal routine, Mr. Bailey gives himself regular shots of testosterone. But the endocrinologist on duty in Vermont told him that patients should not take testosterone post surgery.
Mr. Bailey explained that he couldn't just stop his hormone treatment. But the doctors were so resistant that he finally had them call his primary care physician, who explained he should resume his usual protocol.
“I don't expect every doctor in the world to become an expert in trans medicine, but I do think they should be knowledgeable enough to know what they don't know and pick up the phone and call an expert,” said Mr. Bailey, 51, deputy director of employee engagement at the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.
Mr. Bailey's experience is echoed by many transgender patients, both those who have fully transitioned and those in the process. Research on nontransition-related medical needs is limited; most medical schools don't prepare doctors for treating this community.
“What happens once you get past the immediate issues of transition, and you run into problems with diabetes, cancer, with the E.R.?” said Karl Surkan, 46, a professor of women's studies at M.I.T. and Temple University.

Mr. Surkan, who is transitioning from female to male, has firsthand experience: He carries the BRCA1 gene and was given a diagnosis of breast cancer. When he inquired about whether testosterone would affect his cancer treatments, his oncologist told him, “It probably would, but we don't have any data on whether testosterone would cause a recurrence of your cancer. We wish we could help you.”
Indeed, there are few longitudinal studies on hormone use in the trans community. Many doctors aren't aware that some transgender men may still need pap smears, breast exams and mammograms, and that all transgender women should be screened for prostate problems.
“Many transgender men and women have not had genital affirmation surgery and retain reproductive organs they were born with,” said Dr. Harvey Makadon, the director of education and training programs at the Fenway Institute in Boston and a clinical professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. “All transgender women still have a prostate gland, and a good clinician will need to learn about the current anatomy and provide appropriate preventive screening and care.”
In addition to medical concerns, many trans patients say they are discriminated against by doctors and other medical staff members who misuse pronouns, call them by incorrect names or house them with people of the wrong gender.
According to a 2010 report by Lambda Legal, 70 percent of transgender respondents had experienced serious discrimination in health care. And a 2011 study of more than 6,000 transgender people by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National LGBTQ Task Force found that 19 percent said they had been denied health care because of their transgender or gender nonconforming status. Many of them avoided the doctor's office altogether: 28 percent had postponed getting health care when they were ill or injured, and 33 percent had delayed or not sought preventive care because of their past experiences with doctors.
A 2014 report by the HRC Foundation found that out of 501 hospitals researched, 49 percent did not include both “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” in their patient nondiscrimination policies.
Hospitals, for their part, are often flummoxed. Where, for example, should they put a patient who identifies as female, but is anatomically still male or listed that way on their birth certificate?
Mr. Surkan said that he has been placed in hospital rooms with other women. “It doesn't bother me as much as it bothers people who are housed with me,” he said. “I do have a friend who is much more masculine appearing who had a hysterectomy, and he was put in the ward with women. That was pretty awkward for everybody.” He has since co-founded the TransRecord, which, together with sites like RAD remedy, act as a kind of clearinghouse for trans people seeking medical care.
In July, a transwoman alleged sex discrimination at Brooklyn Hospital Center after being placed in a room with a male roommate. “We didn't realize that the individual was transgender,” said Joan Clark, a hospital spokeswoman. The hospital now requires all employees to undergo sensitivity training. “I think it's made us a better organization,” she said. “They don't want different treatment, they just want equitable treatment.”
Wrene Robyn, 46, a transwoman in Somerville, Mass., began her transition in 1989, when she changed her name on her driver's license and Social Security cards, and the gender on her driver's license from male to female. While she integrates fairly well into mainstream society, she has avoided the doctor for years. “Most trans people don't go to the hospital, because they're terrified of the room situation,” she said. “They're terrified of it all. They don't want to be misgendered, and they don't want to explain what they have or don't have in their pants.”
In April, after a bout of pancreatitis, Ms. Robyn spent a week in Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where she was given a single room. “Nobody really asked me what my preference was,” said Ms. Robyn, who works as a software engineer at the hospital and also serves on a transgender care committee there. In addition to worrying about being discriminated against, “What goes through a lot of trans people's minds is, is this going to cost more? Usually we can't afford private rooms.” (It was covered by her insurance.)
Some hospitals are now overhauling — or implementing — policies on treating transgender patients. At Mass General, for example, transgender patients are now asked if they prefer a private room or double. “If they are going to be placed in a double room, we ask them how they identify themselves,” said Terri Ogan, a spokeswoman. “If the patient identifies as a woman, they will be placed in a room with a woman. If they identify as a man, they will be placed in a room with a man.”
Transgender patients at Mount Sinai Health System, which encompasses seven hospitals in New York City, have been housed according to their current gender identity, regardless of where they are in their physical transition, since 2013. They can also request a single room. Previously, the hospital always put them in private rooms, but that had drawbacks: Many patients felt as if they were being segregated, and worried that they would be charged extra (they weren't). “Often the transperson would be delayed or in the E.R. waiting for a single room to open up,” said Barbara Warren, the director for L.G.B.T. programs and policies at Mount Sinai's office for diversity and inclusion.
Terry Lynam, a spokesman for Northwell Health, which has 21 hospitals in New York City, Long Island and Westchester, said that their transgender policy, which was approved in November of 2014, is to treat transgender patients like any other patient. “So, we wouldn't necessarily give them a private room,” said Mr. Lynam. But, he acknowledged, the issue becomes a bit more complicated with patients who still look like the sex they were assigned at birth. In that instance, if a roommate objects, “We'll try to accommodate them and move the person who complains,” he said.
Advocates see this as a long time coming. “I've been telling hospitals that they really need to think about this and adopt some policies proactively,” said Tari Hanneman, deputy director of the Health and Aging Program at the Human Rights Campaign. “The first time you think about where you are going to put a transgender patient should not be when they arrive.”

Maria Moynihan, daughter of 3rd Lord Moynihan, was found on street with five gunshot wounds
The daughter of a late British peer has been shot dead in the Philippines in what appears to be a vigilante-style gang hit in the country's bloody crackdown on drugs.
Maria Aurora Moynihan, 45, was left in the street in the capital Manila on 10 September, police said. Her attackers propped up a cardboard sign against her body which said: “Drug pusher to the celebrities.”
Moynihan was the daughter of the 3rd Lord Moynihan, a British peer who fled to the Philippines in the late 1960s following fraud allegations. He ran several brothels and was allegedly active in drugs trafficking until 1991, when he died of a stroke.
A dual British-Filipino citizen, Maria Moynihan was also accused of involvement in the narcotics business. She had been on bail following charges of possession of illegal drugs in 2013.
“Witnesses told us they heard a series of gunshots, then saw a vehicle leaving the area. They did not see its licence plates,” Ch Insp Tito Jay Cuden told Agence France-Presse.
He said no arrests had been made. “She's considered a drug personality,” he added.
The Philippines president, Rodrigo Duterte, has spent his first three months in office waging a campaign to kill all involved in the rampant drugs trade, causing outrage from rights groups and foreign governments.
More than 3,500 alleged drug dealers and addicts have been killed, about a third of them in police operations but the majority by armed vigilante militias. Duterte has publicly encouraged civilians to kill addicts and said he will not prosecute police for extrajudicial executions.
Moynihan's sister, a famous film actor in the Philippines, said her family had one priority following the death.
“That is to protect her children from further pain and suffering so that they, and we as a family may take this time to grieve, mourn but most of all celebrate the life of this exceptional human being I will forever have the privilege of calling my sister,” Maritoni Fernandez said. A police investigation is ongoing.

Local media aired footage of a vehicle stopping and opening its door on the deserted part of the street where the body was later found. The video was too grainy to determine exactly what happened.
Moynihan's father was described in his Telegraph obituary as a “confidence trickster, brothel-keeper, drug-smuggler and police informer”.
He succeeded his father in 1965 as the Liberal whip in the House of Lords. But by the end of the 1960s, he was facing more than 50 charges including fraud and so fled to Spain and then the Philippines.
He remarried a Filipino belly dancer who ran a chain of massage parlours across Manila and became involved in the local narcotic trade, according to Australian police. He referred to the then president Ferdinand Marcos as “my drinking chum” and avoided arrest.
After being linked to a Sydney criminal syndicate known as the “Double Bay Mob”, which was importing heroin from Manila, the baron was persuaded to act as a police informant.
In 1988, he helped secure the arrest of Howard Marks, the cannabis trafficker whose autobiography, Mr Nice, became a best-selling book. Moynihan secretly recorded “drug dealing” conversations with Marks for the US Drug Enforcement Administration.
Educated in French literature in Paris, Maria Moynihan was arrested in 2013 for alleged possession of shabu, or crystal meth, the drug Duterte wants to rid the country of.
• This article was amended on 21 September 2016 to clarify that people killed in the crackdown are alleged, not necessarily proven, to be drug dealers and drug addicts.

After missing the last two games, Daniel Wells makes his highly anticipated return for North on Friday night against Sydney.
His return has added significance, being the first time he'll pull on an indigenous jumper.
Wells replaces Farren Ray who was solid in his first game for North last week against Carlton.
After missing the last three weeks due to an ankle injury, Sam Wright is also back, at the expense of Aaron Mullett.
The half-back was important the last time the Roos defeated the Swans, notching 20 disposals and seven rebounds 50's in last year's semi-final.
As flagged by Brad Scott on Wednesday, Mason Wood has been named in the 25 as an emergency alongside Majak Daw and Mullett.

Tributes pour in for young Irish musician Rainy Boy Sleep
The body of musician Stevie Martin, who performed under the name Rainy Boy Sleep, was found this weekend.
Martin, 29, had been reported missing three weeks ago, and searches for him had intensified in the last couple of days.
The Derry musician, originally from Lifford, had been very popular on the Irish circuit, and many of his fans and fellow musicians have taken to Twitter and Facebook today to pay their respects to Stevie.
James Vincent McMorrow described the young man as "a life gone too soon."

Awards season frontrunner “La La Land” has added another award — a “Made in Hollywood” prize from the City of Los Angeles in recognition of making Lionsgate's musical comedy-drama in Los Angeles.
The Made in Hollywood Award, hosted by Los Angeles City Councilmember Mitch O'Farrell, was presented Thursday in ceremonies at the 1600 Vine at Heart of Hollywood Terrace. The event was a collaboration with O'Farrell, SAG-AFTRA, the California Film Commission, Film L.A., Teamsters Local 399, the Film Musicians Secondary Markets Fund and the Producers Guild of America.
Rather than stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling accepting the awards, the event was aimed at honoring the below-the-line professionals who worked on “La La Land” and touting the ongoing efforts to persuade producers to shoot in California. Location manager Robert Foulkes, who suggesting using the Hermosa Beach Pier for Gosling's signature “City of Stars” scene, accepted the award after dancers Jillian Meyers and Dominic Chaiduang performed to that song.
“It's great for me to keep on doing publicity for ‘La La Land,'” Foulkes said. “Location managers don't usually get interviewed.”

California Film Commission executive director Amy Lemisch gave a shout-out to the California Department of Transportation for allowing “La La Land” to have a full day of rehearsal and another day for shooting at the 105 and 110 freeways for its “Another Day of Sun” opening number. “That was unprecedented,” she added.
All in all, more than 60 city locations were used, including landmarks like the Griffith Observatory and Chateau Marmont.
Tom Everett Scott, who has an important role late in the film, was also in attendance and said that he was particularly pleased that the film shot in Los Angeles.
“It's so rare that I get to shoot movies here,” he mused. “‘That Thing You Do' was my first movie and that shot here; then there was ‘Dead Man on Campus' and now this.”
The “La La Land” entourage included choroegrapher Mandy Moore, who has spent the awards season explaining that she and actress Mandy Moore are two different people. “I don't mind a bit,” she added.
Others attending were composer Justin Hurwitz, cinematographer Linus Sandgren, supervising sound editor Milly Iatrou and production sound mixer Steve Morrow — all who have been nominated for Academy Awards. “La La Land” was nominated Jan. 24 for a record-tying 14 nods.
Disney's two Oscar-nominated animated films, “Moana” and “Zootopia,” also received the honors in ceremonies hosted by Jazmyn Simon, star of the HBO series “Ballers” opposite Duane Johnson. “Ballers” announced in November that it will be moving its production from Florida to California due to the expanded tax credit program that went into effect in 2015.
“I screamed when I got the news,” said Simon, who's lived in Los Angeles for six years.

I met up at AXPONA with SOTA's Kirk and Donna Bodinet. They were part owners in the company for many years, buying the company outright from Jack Shafton in 1997, when depending upon your perspective, it was vinyl's nadir, or the beginning of its resurgence. Shafton is now V.P. Sales and Marketing at Sandy Gross's Golden Ear Technology speaker company and he too was at AXPONA.
All's well that ends well as both Shafton and the Bodinets are thriving and doing what they like to do. While maintaining a somewhat low profile Donna and Kirk have built SOTA into a very successful company, building in America a full line of 'tables and two vacuum type record cleaning machines.
The Series II Moonbeam is one definitely ripe for an analogplanet.com review, which will hopefully happen over the summer.

A woman in Germany is being evicted from her home of 16 years to make way for asylum-seekers, amid growing concerns over how Germany will find accommodation for the hundreds of thousands of refugees flooding into the country.
Bettina Halbey, a 51-year-old nurse, has lived alone in her flat in the small western German town of Nieheim since her children grew up.
On September 1, she received a letter from her landlord, the local municipality, telling her the building was being turned into a refugee shelter and she had until next May to leave.
“I was completely taken aback,” Ms Halbey told Welt newspaper. “I find it impossible to describe how the city has treated me.”
When Ms Halbey vented her frustration on Facebook, asking why she was being evicted when properties were standing empty in the town, her comment was shared 200,000 times.
In Germany, where 52 per cent of people rent their homes, it is unheard of to be asked to leave under such circumstances.
Tenants are strongly protected by law, and can normally only be evicted if they have broken the terms of their rental agreement.
“I've muddled through sorrow and distress, and then I get this notice,” said Ms Halbey, who brought up her two children as a single mother in the flat. “It was like a kick in the teeth.”
Ms Halbey insisted she was not against Germany taking refugees in. When asylum-seekers moved into the flat above hers last May, they got on well, she said.
“We take care of each other. Helping people, this is my commandment,” she said.
Although the building belongs to the local municipality, it is not social housing and Ms Halbey pays the full market rent.
But Rainer Vidal, the mayor of Nieheim, said the building was needed to house refugees because the town's existing three shelters were full. “A new residential unit for 30 refugees in Nieheim would cost €300,000 (£222,000). This solution will cost me nothing,” he told Welt.
Doubts have been raised over whether the municipality's move is legal. It has invoked a law under which a private landlord can evict a tenant if he wants to move into the property himself.
“Normally, only a natural person can terminate for personal use A municipality cannot move into a flat as a legal entity, so the process is legally highly questionable,” Ulrich Ropertz, spokesman of the German Tenants' Federation, said.
The controversy has come amid growing concern in Germany over how to house refugees, with shelters already full across the country and tens of thousands continuing to arrive.
Angela Merkel's government agreed on Thursday to release a further €2 billion (£1.5 billion) to help pay the costs of sheltering refugees, €500 million (£370 million) of which is earmarked for building new accommodation.
But critics say it is not enough, with Germany expecting to host as many as one million asylum-seekers this year.
The state government of Hamburg is trying to push through legislation that would enable it to seize empty commercial properties and turn them into refugee shelters.
Local politicians in Berlin have called for empty apartments to be requisitioned from private landlords.
There have even been suggestions of a return to the solution of the postwar years, when millions of refugees fleeing to West Germany from former Nazi-held lands were billeted with ordinary families.
Despite the concerns over housing, public support for Mrs Merkel's policy of admitting so many refugees remains high, according to a new opinion poll.
Fewer than a quarter of Germans think the country is accepting too many refugees, while 49 per cent think it's taking the right number, and 21 per cent think it should take even more, the poll for ZDF television found.
But an overwhelming 78 per cent of those polled supported the government's move to suspend the Schengen agreement and temporarily reimpose border controls during the crisis.
Genuine refugees are still allowed to enter Germany, but there are concerns many are lying about their nationality to get around the checks.
The interior ministry estimates as many as 30 per cent of those claiming to be from Syria are in fact from other countries, a spokesman said on Friday.
Germany has said it will accept Syrian refugees even if they should apply for asylum in a different member state under EU rules.
One ant sinks in water, but a bunch of them? It turns out they can link together and become an unsinkable life raft. New research shows that when fire-ants are dropped in water, they quickly form a pancake-shaped floating mass, which traps air beneath them.
The results are incredibly buoyant (a process the researchers liken to weaving waterproof baskets). The trapped air also protects the bottom layer of ants from drowning, and as individual ants are removed, the others shift positions to balance out the mass.

Rather than a beautiful instance of cooperation, it looks like this process may be a forced one, as those towards the edge of the ant mass are forcibly held in place by their neighbors.
The study was trialled on masses of ants numbering between 500 and 8,000. Each group successfully formed a raft. The behavior is an adaptation that's extremely useful in the ants' Brazilian rainforest habitat, due to frequent floods. Scientists compared the behavior of the ant masses to a fluid, with each ant acting as a molecule of the liquid.

Here's the upshot: If you can't drown them, I guess fire's the only answer.
"India-Pakistan once again, and probably will draw the same questions," was the first thing asked of Virat Kohli at his press conference, even before the questions about the coach and captain rift. Because unlike the rules of Fight Club, the first rule of India-Pakistan is to talk about India-Pakistan.
Yet this feels like the quietest contest between these two teams in a long time.
Outside the India team's hotel, there were a handful of fans waiting for autographs, and not many seemed to be Indian fans. Often there is a feeling around the city, the hotel and among the players that lets you know an India-Pakistan match is coming. In Birmingham right now, you'd barely know there is a game of cricket going to be played, let alone the match that is hyped as a war without the shooting.
Perhaps in the days of amateur cricket, when a win for most teams was about national identity and pride, India-Pakistan was the biggest contest in sport. Now it might still be one of the most-watched contests, but for players who have marketing deals, agents, and are regulating their diet for optimum performance, every match is important.
Modern cricketers live in a bubble, and while Twitter and WhatsApp can burst it at times, they will be staying focused and bonding as a unit while ticking off the processes. At training they didn't do a super secret India-Pakistan only training regime, on match day they won't inject themselves with green or blue magical serum to turn into giant India-Pakistan gods. They will play as best they can, like the professionals they are, for their country, but also for their team-mates and their future.
Mickey Arthur was focusing on the professional part of it. "Yeah, we know for us to progress in this tournament, we've got to hit the ground running. So whether it was against South Africa, whether it was against Sri Lanka, the intensity and the expectation, certainly from myself as coach and I'm sure from the captain, would have been the same. It's just a different opposition, and there's a little bit of hype. And it's a massive game. But every game for us in this competition is massive. We can't take our foot off the pedal in any game, and we can't think, ah, it's India, we have to just lift ourselves, because that would be very unprofessional."
When talking about the rivalry, Sarfraz Ahmed spoke of the talk of the rivalry more than the rivalry itself. "It is also played up in the media. I feel those things affect the players sometimes. But we have tried to tell the players these things happen. There will be hype created in the media."
The professionally grumpy Virat Kohli said of the contest: "Nothing different, to be honest. I know it sounds pretty boring, but this is exactly what we feel as cricketers. We're not saying anything different to what we feel." Nothing different, the Indian captain, on India-Pakistan, the day before. Things done changed.
Of course that is probably an understatement, or at least a lesson in the language of pre-match press conferences.
The rivalry still holds for India-Pakistan fans AFP
When Aakash Chopra played in Pakistan in the Goodwill tour of 2003-04, India's first Test series in Pakistan in 14 years, they knew it wasn't a normal series: "As we grew up, it was not an option to lose to Pakistan". Sachin Tendulkar told Chopra that he didn't sleep for 15 nights before the big match in the 2003 World Cup. How many nights' sleep would Virat Kohli lose over a Pakistan match now? Probably none.
The relationship between the two countries has changed so much in the last 10 to 15 years. They are still two nations with a shared history and sibling rivalry, there are still problems on the border and of terrorism, but the roles of the siblings have changed. India is on its way to being one of the most important nations on earth, trying to go cashless while their leader sells out Madison Square Garden. Pakistan has been fighting with itself. India is an economic and political juggernaut, so why would a loss to Pakistan, their less successful sibling, mean that much? This current cricket relationship is more like a massively exaggerated version of Australia and New Zealand: the bigger sibling patronises the little one, when they think of them at all.
There is still tension, the last scheduled match between India and Pakistan caused such political problems that it needed to be moved to a new venue. But there is no doubt that it's not the same, as Chopra says: "It's no longer the matter of life and death, or a war without the weapons".
The players are professional, the nations have moved on, many of the fans who will watch this game at Edgbaston will have friends who are from their great rivals. "The days of effigies getting burned, and player's homes getting vandalised seem to have passed," Chopra says. "When India used to win they'd use firecrackers on the streets, I think now we are well beyond the firecracker celebrations". And as for the players, he says: "the current crop are not overwhelmed."
There are still uber-nationalists on both sides who cling to every chance to beat their enemy. Some players feel that way, most notably Gautam Gambhir, who has suggested that all ties with Pakistan be cut until terrorism ends.
But most players don't feel that strongly. Shahid Afridi recently wrote about his friendship with Indian players (Gambhir aside). Perhaps if the two teams played more often they would have a normal rivalry, but they don't. Of Virat Kohli's 264 international matches, 5% has been against Pakistan (16% against Australia, 17% against England). Azhar Ali has played India twice in 105 matches. And on the odd occasion they play each other, there haven't many good games, or Pakistan wins, to spark anything outside Shahid Afridi's last-over heroics in Dhaka three years ago.
If picked, teenage legspinner Shadab Khan will play India in only his ninth international match, but when he was asked about this momentous game of incredible national and geopolitical importance, he said: "I used to feel the pressure when I saw them play on TV, but now I don't feel any pressure". The pressure is gone, so too the firecrackers, and we're just left with the talk.
The world has become Oliver.
Not the cherubic, doe-eyed innocent we remember from the eponymous film.
But rather an amped-up, wild-eyed, little shit of an Oliver who covers our faces in speckles of spit as he screams at us: I want more, more, more, more, more.
It's not the world's fault.
Homo sapiens are, and always have been, junkies.
We crave the fix of stories.
Until very recent times, we have been able to control that addiction.
The places we went to score our stories were relatively limited: the campfire, the art gallery, the library, the radio, the TV set, the cinema and Uncle Cedric who, despite his wandering hands, spun a mesmeric tale.
But since the explosion of the internet, we can now get any story, any time, any way we want. Instantly. For free.
So, yes – Houston, we have a problem.
And the problem is in order to satisfy that insatiable demand for stories, some poor mug has to create them.
Ten times as quickly for ten times less money.
And in our small sector of the storytelling industry – advertising – those poor mugs are the creatives.
We think we speak for everyone when we say it's all beginning to get a bit overwhelming.
Whatever beyond tired is, we're that.
Not waving, but drowning.
But we all love a good problem, right? Let's get solving.
Logic would suggest that the way to extract maximum productivity from creatives is to work them harder and longer.
Logic also suggested Brexit would never happen.
The Millennium Bug would.
And that Emile Heskey would, eventually, come good.
Logic is a bit of a bellend.
What we need to do is work less.
What we need to do is fucking REST.
Not because we're work-shy fops. Or Luddites who fail to grasp that the world has changed. But because it makes financial sense.
It's the economics, stupid.
More rest = more creativity = more famous work = more £ for clients = more £ for agencies.
Quite literally: more for less.
In the tiny windows of time we get to read books, two have informed.
The first is Daily Rituals by Mason Currey. In it, he looks at the routines of the world's most creative thinkers. Einstein, Stravinsky, Murakami, Lynch… And though they all work in different ways at different times, one thing is constant. And it's not just the drinking. None of them engage in deep work for more than four hours.
Because, basically, it's impossible.
After four hours, creativity crashes. After four hours, the brain needs – you guessed it – a rest.
Which leads us to the second book, Rest by Stanford University boffin Alex Soojung-Kim Pang. Citing the latest research from neuropsychology, Pang proves how rest allows us to reconnect with the deepest part of ourselves from where creativity, resilience and inspiration come.
Rest is not a tax on creativity but an investment in it.
And the thing is, anyone whose job is to be faced by the terror of the blank white page instinctively knows this.
That's why we get grumpy.
We're not afraid of hard work.
We're afraid of not being able to perform at our best.
People often declare this is the most exciting time ever to be working in advertising.
And maybe it is.
But the potential of what we could do is not being reflected by what we are doing.
The work is not getting better.
It's not through lack of trying, it's because we are trying too hard.
Our brains are hurting and it's hurting the work.
It's time to join a movement. One that promotes rest.
More holidays, more flexible working; less email after-hours, less hours.
One that rewards a 90-hour week not with a badge of honour but a dunce's cap.
"Rest," Pang says, "is not something the world gives us… you have to take it… and protect it from a world that is intent on stealing it from you."
Our job as creative leaders is to be bouncers at the door of Club Rest.
Inside, there's no rave music and very little dancing. People are reading and playing peek-a-boo with their kids and whittling sticks and thinking about setting up a sausage company.
And tomorrow, rested, their neurons will light up like a New Year's Eve firework display instead of fizzing, pathetically, like a budget sparkler in the rain.
If we believe in the power of creativity to power our client's business, then it is beholden upon us as an industry to protect and nurture that creativity.
We need to work hard at not working.
Today.
Right now.
Just after we've spent a bit of time looking out of the window.
The case for rest, rests.

Notched my first Battle Cup trophy of the winter season on Saturday (Tier 5). Our cup strategy was to abuse Visage-Tinker cheese, expanding on its global burst by drafting heroes with initiation, lockdown, defensive utility; whatever was most needed. We'll first talk overall about draft planning, bans, why that opener. Then follow it up with game by game draft notes.
Draft order. With our first phase planned, we decided on a relatively strict draft order of 4-2-5-3-1. Offlane and carry could go earlier by a pick if they wanted (didn't happen). The advantage of a strict draft order is that you can quickly start a 1-on-1 conversation with the player to choose his hero, no figuring out what role to pick, saving time. The downside is that you can't control certain lane match-ups (e.g. picking your mid after theirs, offlaner after their supports etc.), and familiar opponents will see through your misdirections (ahem kstigs).

Why Tinker-Visage? The pair is signature heroes for us. That's all. We lucked into these two heroes having incredible synergy. For those who haven't seen the duo before, Tinker is able to BoT onto a Visage familiar. Then his nuke combo instantly gives Visage a full Soul Assumption for the quick pickoff. Finally, Tinker is great at clearing waves; Visage is great at hitting buildings.

I would not recommend this opener in general, but I do recommend the approach .

Protect with bans as best you can, but trust that they know how to adjust to unfavorable match-ups; they've done it before.
. If you have on your team, get their heroes right away and be confident that they can succeed against counters. Protect with bans as best you can, but trust that they know how to adjust to unfavorable match-ups; they've done it before. Speaking of bans, we elected to remove Centaur, Ember first phase each match. They are not the hardest counters but among the power heroes they are pretty good. Statistically the hardest counter is Alchemist, but he is a well below average hero overall and not a first phase pick. We make sure to ban Spectre in phase 2 to spare the Tinker that grief.
In the quarterfinal, our boys were worried about Lone Druid. I wasn't, but sometimes the right ban is for the sake of morale.
I was delighted to snag Riki in phase 2, whose scouting paid dividends against the strong initiation of Axe and Puck. Smoke Cloud is a huge issue for all their heroes. Finally he is a fantastic BoT2 target for Tinker.

I pick my carry his jam. Between Disruption and Astral this was the most defensive draft of the three, appropriately because Radiant had the best initiation. The priority is still pickoffs, ganking, map control – but against the enemy lineup we need to be able to save lives as well.
Overall this Battle Cup exemplifies how drafts should shift their utility while preserving and progressing the primary goal of the opener. We want to kill people, take the map, and maintain global presence – no matter what heroes the enemies pick we don't discard that theme, we adjust in ways that support the theme. Maybe we delete people and silence their friends; or we delete people and play around big ults; or we delete people and banish shit; the soul stays intact.
I believe for every strong opener there are enough heroes to simultaneously strengthen and adapt a strategy. It's why I think an “open” or “uncommitted” first phase is really just a weak first phase. We have something going for us or we don't. We build on a strong foundation. Versatility is great when you're starting a company or decorating your kitchen, but in Dota we draft five heroes for the purpose of demolishing one building. Pick a fucking path to the building.
Just don't next level yourself by say, sticking to that second pick Tinker against a super unlucky weirdo opener like Spectre, Storm Spirit.

The Netherlands international is considering the possibilities of a move to the Rossoneri, but Inter are unlikely to sell the playmaker to their cross-town rivals
Elia Raimondo Wesley Sneijder is ready to leave Inter in the summer transfer window, and is keen to join the club's arch-rivals AC Milan has learned.The Netherlands international's agent Soren Lerby has already indirectly approached Adriano Galliani to inform the Milan director that Sneijder would be open to a move to the Rossoneri.Additionally, the former Ajax star has done some work on a potential switch himself as well as he has approached Kevin-Prince Boateng to help orchestrate a transfer.Sneijder, 27, enjoys a close relationship with the former Ghana international, and called the midfielder shortly before the Derby della Madonnina on May 6 to discuss a possible move across the city.However, there are still plenty of obstacles to overcome to make the transfer happen.Firstly, Milan would have to shell out a fee in the region of €25 million to lure Sneijder away from Inter.In addition, they would have to convince the Nerazzurri to let their star midfielder leave the club for their fierce city rivals.Inter offloaded players such as Andrea Pirlo and Clarence Seedorf to Milan in the past, both of whom went on to become key players at the Rossoneri, and the Nerazzurri are desperate to avoid a similar mistake.Despite Sneijder's eagerness to leave the Nerazzurri, it appears unlikely that he will be allowed to join the 2010-11 Italian champions as Inter prefer to see him leave abroad. Manchester United have previously been linked with the Dutchman.
The Philadelphia Eagles (9-1) cemented their eminance in the NFC East, pulling away from the Dallas Cowboys (5-5), 37-9, thanks to a dominant second half on Sunday Night Football in Week 11:
1. Carson Wentz shook off an uncharacteristic first half, during which he completed 39 percent of his passes and blew two opportunities to turn turnovers into points, to shellack the Cowboys in the final two frames. Wentz led three straight touchdown drives out of the half, aided by a guess-who running game (more on that soon), throwing two TD passes and running a better boot game than Dak Prescott in the Cowboys quarterback's own building.
Thanks to Philly's bounce-back half, the Eagles put up more than 30 points for the sixth time in 10 games and the fifth over their last six. Wentz is the league leader in touchdown passes (25) on the team with the best record in all football. That's usually a guarantee for MVP consideration, if not a recipe to run away with the honor altogether. With the NFC East race in the rear view, the Eagles have the look of a bona fide Super Bowl contender with Wentz as their capable captain.
2. Philadelphia's running-back-by-committee approach is paying dividends just three weeks into the Jay Ajayi Era. With 215 rushing yards on Sunday, the Eagles have compiled their best two-game stretch on the ground this season (412 yards). LeGarrette Blount, Corey Clement and Kenjon Barner each got meaningful snaps against the Cowboys, but it was Ajayi, in only his second game as an Eagle, who broke the game open in the second half. On Philly's back-to-back scoring drives, Ajayi set the pace. First: An eight-yard first-down run shortened the distance for the Eagles' first third-down conversion of the game, a picture-perfect roll-out and toss-back to Brent Celek. Then: Ajayi's career-best 71-yard run, sprung by Jason Kelce on Anthony Hitchens, took Philly out of the shadow of its own end zone and into scoring position. Ajayi's change of pace altered the course of the game, and his night underscores Philly's most vital advantage over most of its opponents: The Eagles have more talent on offense, man-to-man, than you do. When you focus too much on one position or one player, you get exposed for big gains without warning.
3. Tyron Smith's absence loomed large over the Cowboys for a second straight loss. Byron Bell took the place of Chaz Green, who was posterized by Adrian Clayborn and his six sacks last week, at Smith's left tackle spot. Bell fared better against Derek Barnett, but man, that's a low bar. Bell was beaten by the destructive Eagles rookie defensive end at the worst times, surrendering three QB hits, two Barnett sacks and a game-sealing strip-sack touchdown. Smith has only four days to recover before the Cowboys play next. If he's not available, Bell and right tackle La'el Collins will have to go at it alone against the Chargers' dynamic duo of Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram. That spells trouble.
4. An underrated Eagle secondary was buoyed by the return of Ronald Darby against the Cowboys. Darby recorded an interception, two passes defensed and a team-high eight tackles in his first game since Week 1, leading a Philadelphia pass defense to hold Prescott to just 143 passing yards and a career-worst three interceptions. Adding Darby to that Eagles defensive backfield is akin to plopping a Pro Bowl-caliber cherry right on top of Philly's victory Sundays (sundaes?). The Eagles now boast a surplus of talent in the secondary, which can only help down the stretch.
5. Speaking of Dak ... sans Smith and Ezekiel Elliott, the Cowboys quarterback had one of the worst games of his career on Sunday night. Dak missed throws short and high, rushed passes into high-risk areas to beat the Eagles' pass rush and struggled to find his most reliable targets once again. Jason Witten caught just one ball on one target; and Dez Bryant was targeted 16 times, but he recorded only eight catches, many of which came after Dallas was already down three scores. The running game was not the problem; Alfred Morris averaged 5.4 yards per tote as he rattled off 91 rushing yards. But Dak couldn't capitalize on ensuing play-action plays. The confluence of Smith and Zeke's absences is clearly messing with the Cowboys' philosophy on offense and will likely keep them from making a realistic postseason run, but Prescott should not be without blame.
PITTSBURGH (93-7 The Fan) – For the first time since 1992, the Pittsburgh Pirates are playoff-bound, and team President Frank Coonelly reacts with Vinnie & Cook on Sportsradio 93-7 The Fan.
Coonelly is pleased for the Pirates fans who are finally watching their team head to the postseason.
“I've met so many of our season ticket holders,” he says. “When we went down to Brandenton, these people believed that we were going to be in the postseason that year, even though most years there was no tangible evidence that would support that belief, they truly believed it. This year, their belief was fulfilled.”
“We're looking forward to going as far as we possibly can, and the goal is quite simple,” he added. “We call ourselves the ‘City of Champions' for a reason, and we're intent on attempting to win a championship here in Pittsburgh.”
Coonelly notes that this year's result is validation that sticking with Neal Huntington and the front office was the correct move.
“Obviously, there were a lot of outside influences and some outside pressure to step back after last year and reboot,” Coonelly says. “There were a lot of outside forces that were suggesting that was the correct course. For me, that was never a consideration, not for a second. I knew that those guys were dedicated baseball men, extraordinarily talented baseball men, and that we were on the right track.”
Now that the Pirates have made the playoffs, Coonelly reports that this season's success appears to be sustainable for the forseeable future.
“The farm system is extremely strong, with more players coming up,” he reports. “We have a very talented pipeline coming now from Latin America, which we didn't have. I do believe we have elite training in the player development system, and that's helping to sustain success.”

The Republican National Committee claims that 8.2 million Americans can't find full-time jobs “partly due to ObamaCare.” But that figure is the total number of part-time workers in the U.S. seeking full-time work. The RNC also claims 6 million retirees “will lose prescription drug coverage” under the health care law. But 6 million aren't expected to go without drug coverage. Instead, they are expected to lose employer-sponsored drug plans and join other Medicare Part D plans instead.
These are just two of a list of 57 figures the RNC calls “ObamaCare By the Numbers,” a compilation the GOP has promoted in years past as well. Several items repeat old claims we've seen many times before. For instance, the RNC claims the law “cuts” Medicare by $716 billion, but that's a reduction in the future growth of Medicare spending over 10 years, not a slashing of the current budget. And the RNC repeats the well-worn distortion that 800,000 “Will Be Cut Out Of The Workforce By ObamaCare,” a twisting of the Congressional Budget Office's analysis that actually said there would be a reduction in labor primarily because people would choose to work less.
Other numbers in the list are true: The gross cost of insurance coverage provisions in the law do add up to $1.8 trillion for 2014 to 2023, according to the nonpartisan CBO, and the law's 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services would amount to $1.5 billion over 10 years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.
We'll go through the new, misleading criticisms that caught our attention.
More Part-Time Workers?
RNC, July 15: 8.2 Million: Americans Unable To Find Full-Time Work Partly Due To ObamaCare.
The RNC wasn't the first to suggest the health care law was blocking part-timers from getting full-time jobs. Early in July, House Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor made similar claims:
Boehner Press Conference, July 9: Because of ObamaCare, millions of full-time workers can only find part-time work. Cantor Press Conference, July 23: The problem is, the only thing that [Obama] has done is acted to continue to implement ObamaCare, which as we all know now is creating a part-time worker economy, not a full-time economy that can grow.
The RNC's 8.2 million figure is the total number of Americans working “part-time for economic reasons,” either because they couldn't find full-time work or because their hours had been reduced, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' June figures. Certainly, everyone who can't find a full-time job, in a still recovering economy, isn't in that predicament “partly due to ObamaCare.”
The 8.2 million is actually less than the 9.1 million part-timers seeking full-time work in March 2010, the month the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. BLS figures show that this category of workers skyrocketed in 2008, from 4.8 million in January of that year to 8 million in December. (The nation was officially in a recession from December 2007 to June 2009.)
In recent years, the number working part-time for economic reasons has fluctuated, but in general, has been on a slow trajectory downward. Here's a chart of BLS data, showing the pre- and post-health care law figures.
The health care law requires employers with 50 or more full-time workers (defined as 30 hours per week or more) to provide insurance or pay a fine. The Obama administration recently delayed that requirement until 2015. It's possible that some among the 8.2 million part-timers had their hours cut by employers concerned about the law's requirements. But we don't know how many that might be, and neither do the Republicans.
There's no evidence from the BLS numbers that the Affordable Care Act has had an influence on those seeking full-time work. But that didn't stop Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso from claiming exactly that. Barrasso went into more detail than the RNC, claiming that those working part-time for economic reasons “soared by over 300,000″ in June. He continued in his July 9 remarks to Congress: “There are now 8.2 million Americans working part-time jobs because their hours were cut back, or because they couldn't find full-time work. Republicans have been warning that this would happen because of the Democrats' health care law, and that's exactly what's been happening for months now.”
But the 300,000 increase in June was more of a continuing fluctuation than a soaring. And there's no trend showing an increase is “exactly what's been happening for months now.” The big jump in these part-timers occurred back in 2008, not because of the health care law.
Medicare Part D
RNC, July 15: 6 Million: Retirees That Will Lose Prescription Drug Coverage.
This claim implies that the Medicare prescription drug coverage, known as Part D, is being scaled back. But that's not the case. The RNC is referring to a little-known provision in the law that changes the tax treatment for subsidies that the government gives to companies that offer their own retiree prescription drug programs.
The government gives qualifying employer plans a subsidy — called the retiree drug subsidy — worth 28 percent of prescription drug plan costs, and those employers have been able to deduct the subsidy amount from income taxes. But the health care law changes that. Beginning in 2013, employers won't be able to deduct drug plan costs covered by this subsidy. Also, other Part D plans are becoming more attractive to seniors: The health care law gradually closes the gap in drug coverage, known as the doughnut hole, and it provides a 50 percent discount on brand-name drugs. The retiree drug subsidy, meanwhile, stays put at 28 percent.
For those reasons, the number of seniors on these plans is expected to decline by 6 million between 2010 and 2016, according to the Medicare Board of Trustees' 2013 report. “It is expected that the majority of the retirees losing drug coverage through qualifying employer plans will participate in other Part D plans,” the trustees' report said. (See pages 149-151.)
At the same time, total Part D enrollment is expected to go up, from 34.8 million in 2010 to 42.3 million in 2016. So while employer-subsidized plans are projected to decline by 6 million from 2010 to 2016, total Part D enrollment is expected to increase by 7.5 million.
By taking away the deduction of the subsidy, government revenues increase by an estimated $3.1 billion, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. The RNC twists that, claiming the $3.1 billion amounts to “Taxes On Retiree's Prescription Drug Plans.” Note that these are the same retirees that the RNC says will lose their drug plans — it's tough to be taxed on a plan you no longer have. No retiree will get hit with a new tax. Instead, certain employers won't be able to deduct the subsidy from their tax liability.
Inflating Health Care Spending
RNC, July 15: $3 Trillion: Projected Federal Health Care Spending In 2023.
The RNC attributed this figure to a May 2013 CBO report. But the CBO didn't say that federal health care spending would total $3 trillion in 2023. Instead, it said that Social Security and major federal health care programs would cost that much.
CBO, May 14, 2013: Most mandatory spending consists of outlays for Social Security and the federal government's major health care programs. By 2023, net outlays for those components of mandatory spending will total $3.0 trillion …
The RNC ignores Social Security, which is estimated to total a little more than $1.4 trillion in 2023, nearly half of the total spending for these mandatory programs. The gross cost of insurance coverage provisions in the health care law, meanwhile, is expected to cost $250 billion that year.
Plenty of Premium Spin
The RNC lists several numbers about premium increases, but doesn't tell the full story behind the figures.
RNC: 56%: Expected Premium Increase For A Healthy Male Ages 21-29 On The Individual Market Under ObamaCare.
This was an average estimate by the consulting firm Milliman. The RNC points to a CNN Money article, which also quotes the author of the Milliman report saying: “The average isn't very relevant to any particular person.” The May 2013 article concludes: “At this point, everyone — including the insurers — is just guessing at what premiums should be.”
It may be frustrating to those who buy their insurance on the individual market — currently that's 15 million Americans (or 6 percent of those under age 65) — but it's difficult to estimate how exactly their premiums will change. There will be winners and losers, and even Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has acknowledged that. “Women are going to see some lower costs, some men are going to see some higher costs,” Sebelius said in March. “It's sort of a one to one shift … some of the older customers may see a slight decline, and some of the younger ones are going to see a slight increase.”
The author of the Milliman report estimated a big average increase for young men, but said women's premiums on average would increase slightly. And older men (ages 60-64) would see a decrease.
But, as we've said before, it's tough to make a blanket estimate in the individual market, where premiums and benefits per plan vary widely. Whether an individual's premium goes up or down, and by how much, depends on what kind of plan they're purchasing now (bare bones or with benefits similar to what will be minimum requirements under the law), health status, age, and existing state regulations on insurance companies. And then there are federal subsidies, which are available to those earning up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level. The CBO estimates that 25 million Americans will get coverage through the state-based exchanges in 2023, with about 80 percent of them receiving federal subsidies.
RNC: 32%: Average Increase In Health Care Costs Per Person According To The Society Of Actuaries.
This is an estimate for costs to insurance companies in the individual market — not in all markets. The analysis was sponsored by the Society of Actuaries, an organization of actuaries who mostly work for the insurance industry. It was conducted by the Lewin Group, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group that operates independently of the health care company. The analysis estimated that for the individual market the “cost per member per month will increase 32 percent under ACA, compared to pre-ACA projections.”
The report said that it didn't attempt to estimate premium costs — which it said would vary based on factors such as competition. But it's true that costs to insurers could be passed along to consumers.
RNC: $255: Average Monthly Increase In Family Health Care Premiums Under Obama. RNC: $76: Average Increase In Monthly Premiums That Americans Pay Under Obama.
These figures come from the Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research & Educational Trust's annual employer health benefits surveys, which show that premiums for employer-sponsored plans have been going up for years, since well before Obama took office. The figures above are for total premiums, paid by both employer and worker combined. Experts told us the health care law was responsible for a 1 percent to 3 percent increase in family premiums from 2010 to 2011 — they went up a total of 9 percent, mainly due to higher medical costs. The increase due to the law was attributed to the elimination of preexisting condition exclusions for children, the requirement that dependents be covered on their parents' plan to age 26, free coverage of preventive care, and the increase in caps on annual coverage. From 2011 to 2012, employer-based family plans increased by just 4 percent on average, a jump Kaiser and HRET called “moderate by historical standards.”
What's the takeaway from all these premium figures? Insurance premiums are expected to continue to go up, as they have for years, with or without the Affordable Care Act. And there's still uncertainty for those who currently buy insurance on the individual market.

Aiming to put an end to the controversy and intrigue surrounding the death of the late J Jayalalithaa, the Tamil Nadu government has released a set of documents pertaining to the treatment provided to the late AIADMK leader.
A copy of All India Institute of Medical Sciences doctors' report, a statement from the state health secretary and the treatment summary of Jayalalithaa when she was treated at Apollo Hospitals have been released.
The detailed Apollo summary, the AIIMS report and the Health Secretary's statement have been released at a crucial period when Tamil Nadu Chief Minister E Palaniswami's rival Panneerselvam has been able to garner the people's support on the back of the supposed mystery surrounding Jayalalithaa's death.
"Given the need to put at rest needless speculation relating to the circumstances surrounding the hospitalisation level, treatment and sad demise of the late Hon'ble Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, the government has decided to make public the discharge summary received from Apollo Hospitals and the medical reports received from AIIMS, New Delhi", health secretary Radhakrishnan said.
Addressing allegations that Jayalalithaa was given the wrong medication, Radhakrishnan said except for corticosteroids, administered for atopic dermatitis, the former Tamil Nadu chief minister was only taking oral hypoglycemic and anti-hypersensitive drugs to control pre- existing diabetes millions and hyper tension.
The treatment summary, over which there has been a lot of speculation, was also released.
Highlights from the reports: Apollo Hospitals' discharge summary mentions that the Apollo helpline received a call regarding Jayalalithaa's ill health at around 10pm on September 22, 2016, from her Poes Garden residence. "On reaching there, the team reportedly noted that she was not consistently responding to calls and was also breathless with low oxygen saturation (approximately 48 per cent)", the summary says. In contrast to what former speaker PH Pandian has alleged, the summary did not have any mention of Jayalalithaa being pushed down and getting hurt. Jayalalithaa had reached Apollo Hospitals by 10.25 pm and received immediate treatment in the emergency room with non-invasive ventilation, diuretic, empirical antibiotics, bronchodilators and intravenous insulin infusion. She was then admitted in a very critical condition to the Multidisciplinary Critical Care Unit. The report goes into the detail about the treatments Jayalalithaa received and mentions that there was a significant issue with her sleep cycle. The revered AIADMK was apparently unable to sleep through the night even with optimised sedative agents. On 4th December morning, Jayalalithaa was placed back on a tracheotomy mask to ensure an oxygen saturation level of 98-100 per cent. Following this, Jayalalithaa had an episode of vomiting after eating her breakfast. "At about 4.20 pm while watching television in the presence of nurses, duty doctors and family members in the room, Jayalalithaa had complained of worsening breathlessness and she was placed on a ventilator immediately", the report adds. On 5th December, a neurological exam had revealed a brainstorm dysfunction. The treating physicians and AIIMS doctors had a detailed discussion and decided not to continue VA ECMO and other organ and life supporting measures. This decision was conveyed to the Tamil Nadu chief secretary, then-Chief Minister O Panneerselvam, Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker M. Thambidurai, state Health Minister C Vijayabaskar, state Health Secretary Radhakrishnan, and 'family' viz Sasikala. The summary attributed the cause of death as 'ventriculor fibrillation', 'infective endocarditis' and 'acute respiratory distress syndrome'.

State Sen. Ralph Northam, the Democrat running for lieutenant governor, is calling for new ethics rules in Virginia, including the creation of an ethics board and a $100 cap on gifts to lawmakers and their immediate families.
Northam, who faces Chesapeake minister E.W. Jackson (R) in November, also said his proposal would cut the threshold for elected officials to have to disclose an investment in half, to $5,000.
Northam's initiative is the latest in a string of proposed measures, including plans by gubernatorial candidates Ken Cuccinelli (R) and Terry McAuliffe (D), as state and federal investigators probe gifts and payments to Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) and some family members by Jonnie R. Williams Sr., the chief executive of the dietary supplement firm Star Scientific. The proposals would be a significant shift from Virginia's ethics laws, seen as among the most relaxed rules in the country and focused primarily on disclosure, not limits or state oversight.
The current “safeguards against the abuse of political power for personal gain in Virginia are woefully inadequate, and we must restore confidence that ethical misconduct will not be tolerated,” Northam said in a statement.
In Virginia, elected officials can accept unlimited gifts as long as they disclose those worth more than $50. Officials are not required to report gifts to family members.
McDonnell has denied any wrongdoing as investigators probe his financial ties to Williams. The governor has said he followed the state's disclosure laws, and that he is open to changing the ethics rules to address some of the issues raised by the Williams' gifts and payments.
Northam, a senator from Norfolk, sponsored similar legislation in 2010, but the proposal only applied to members of the General Assembly. The plan received bipartisan support in the Senate, but stalled in the House.
Cuccinelli, whose relationship with Williams has drawn scrutiny as well, and McAuliffe also have mentioned ethics reform on the campaign trail.
McAuliffe has called for an independent ethics commission, and has vowed not to accept more than $100 worth of gifts from a single donor. Cuccinelli said he supports tighter rules governing gifts to public officials, including eliminating the family member reporting exclusion.
We first covered breaking the commodity 27MHz radios used in wireless keyboards, mice, and presenters when [Luis Miras] gave a talk at Black Hat. Since then, the people at Dreamlab have managed to crack the encryption on Microsoft's Wireless Optical Desktop 1000 and 2000 products (and possibly more). Analyzing the protocol they found out that meta keys like shift and ALT are transmitted in cleartext. The “encryption” used on each regular keystroke involves XORing the key against a random one byte value determined during the initial sync with the receiver. So, if you sniff the handshake, you can decrypt the keystrokes. You really don't have to though; there are only 256 possible encryption keys. Using a dictionary file you can check all possible keys and determine the correct one after only receiving 20-50 keystrokes. Their demo video shows them sniffing keystrokes from three different keyboards at the same time. Someone could potentially build a wireless keylogger that picks up every keystroke from every keyboard in an office. You can read more about the attack in the whitepaper(pdf).

While Europe battles with a heatwave named Lucifer, the Middle East is enduring a summer so brutal that even those accustomed to Baghdad's searing August weather are labelling it “ungodly”.
As temperatures rose towards 51C (124F) on Thursday, Iraq's government declared a mandatory holiday, allowing civil servants to shelter at home.
So far this month in the Iraqi capital, every day but one has reached 48C or higher, and the forecast is for the high temperatures to continue for the next week.
July was little different, in Iraq and in Syria, where the capital, Damascus, has also been several degrees hotter than usual nearly every day since late June.
In Kuwait, where birds have reportedly dropped from the skies, and Riyadh, where building work has ceased this week, locals have called for mercy from a hotter-than-normal air mass that has remained nearly stationary over central Arabia for more than three weeks, stretching the capacity of electricity networks beyond limits.
While the centre of the region is being scorched, on the Mediterranean coast Beirut and Istanbul have also been blighted by a cruel summer – in their cases, extreme humidity that has made comparatively modest daytime temperatures seem far higher.
In Baghdad, the perennially underfunded state power network has again failed to cope with the annual onslaught, as demand for power for air conditioners and water coolers far exceeds the capacity to supply it.

“We had the day off today,” said Mohanad, from central Baghdad. “The heat is ungodly. The generator in my neighbourhood that provides electricity for about 300 houses has caught fire from the heat. All it generates is smoke.
“We don't know what to do. Men can go to the pool here but what do we do with our women, elderly and our babies? Even the ACs in the car aren't working properly. It's over 53 degrees today.
“It's disgusting. The government cannot do anything to help us even if they tried; the electricity generators were built in the 1960s and haven't been changed or modified since. They can't stand against this heat. We are a poor folk, the Iraqis, it's hell, it's misery. Do not be surprised if you hear on the news about people dying from the heat. We've never witnessed such a summer before.”
Salam al-Saade, from the eastern suburb of Mashtal, said: “The heat is unbearable. Everyone around me is so sick of it. We are going to the pool and sending our kids there from the morning till night-time to cool off a little. A lot of people are suffering from headaches.
“The government is not going to help us in any way. We get 12 hours of national electricity a day but it is not consecutive. It comes for two hours then cuts off. When it does cut off we generate our own and pay for it. This year is the worst we've seen.”
In Lebanon, Faysal al-Banna, the chief of ground observation for Beirut's meteorological department said: “We definitely do not have it as bad as Iraq and other places. Today it is 30 degrees but we feel it's much hotter because of the humidity. It's the humidity from hell, it's on fire this year. I guarantee you the next few days will be worse.”

Pizza Hut is a division of giant YUM! Brands which employs many thousands in its many stores which also include the KFC and Taco Bell brands. YUM! is hugely profitable and certainly has the right to decide its own hours of operation.
However, its customers and citizen advocates can decide to eat elsewhere during the holidays in a show of protest.
Ex- manager Rohr says it better than I can:
"Thanksgiving and Christmas are the only two days that they're closed in the whole year and they're the only two days that those people are guaranteed to have off and spend it with their families," Rohr said. His letter went on to say, "I hope you realize that it's the people at the bottom of the totem pole that make your life possible."
Well said.
The University of Virginia has begun a three-year process of shutting down all of its public computer labs as part of an effort to cut costs.
In an explanation published on the university's Web site, information-technology officials say that students' changing habits have rendered the public labs obsolete. A survey conducted last fall revealed that 99 percent of new students brought their own laptops to the campus. And while the labs are still heavily used (students spent 651,900 hours in the labs last year), internal data indicated that 95 percent of the time those students used the lab computers to surf the Web and read and compose text documents—tasks that officials say they could easily do on their own computers.
“In these budget times, we have to distinguish between providing essential services and providing ones that are merely convenient,” said James L. Hilton, vice president and chief information officer at the university.
While some students do rely on the lab computers to run specialized programs—such as MatLab, Eclipse, MathCAD, and SPSS—Mr. Hilton said he believed the university would be able to negotiate licensing agreements with the software companies that would allow students to run the programs on their laptops through the university's network.
Mr. Hilton said the university now spends about $300,000 per year maintaining the labs. But it is difficult to predict how much the university will save by closing those facilities, he said, since it is not yet clear how much the new system will cost to implement.
What about the 1 percent of students without computers? Or students without printers who now rely on the labs to print out their papers? Mr. Hilton acknowledged that some issues will need to be worked out during this transition. “Printing is the bane of everyone's existence everywhere, and we will continue working on finding better printing solutions,” said Mr. Hilton. “But there are solutions out there.”
He said that the university would be open to adjusting the plan as necessary, depending “on what impact we start to see it having.” —Steve Kolowich
California State Auditor Elaine Howle on Tuesday released a scathing audit of the University of California's Office of the President.
The examination had been requested by legislators who have complained for years that the semi-independent UC system is not transparent with its finances.
Here are some of the key findings of the audit:
Tens of millions of dollars in budget reserve funds weren't disclosed The state audit found that the UC Office of the President failed to disclose to the University of California Board of Regents, the Legislature and the public that it had $175 million in budget reserve funds. UC President Janet Napolitano disputes that the money was hidden, and said it was committed to programs to improve the UC system. State officials including Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom have called on UC to reverse its tuition hike.

$32 million that could've been spent on students wasn't The reserve included $32 million in unspent funds from an annual charge levied on the UC schools — money that the campuses could have spent on student services if they kept it, Howle said. The money comes from a fund that is used for programs including cybersecurity, food for poor students and making campuses carbon neutral. Howle and state legislators said the money should be sent back to campuses.

Pay in UC's Office of the President is higher than comparable salaries
The UC Office of the President's executive and administrative salaries are significantly higher than comparable state employee salaries. This is a longstanding complaint by legislators, union leaders and students.
Administrative salaries amounted to a combined $2.5 million more than the maximum annual salaries for comparable state employee positions, auditors found.
Some examples:
The UC system's chief investment officer has a base salary of $615,000. The top investment officer with the state's teachers' retirement system is paid $568,000.
The UC system's general counsel is paid $428,000 while the general counsel for the California Public Employees' Retirement System is paid $414,000.
The chief financial officer for UC makes $412,000 while the counterpart in the California State University system makes $341,000.

Millions were spent on benefits that public employees typically don't receive
During a five-year period, the Office of the President spent at least $21.6 million on employee benefits, some of which are not typical for the public sector, such as supplemental retirement contributions, the audit found.
The UC system, like other state agencies, provides a standard retirement plan, but Napolitano's office also offered its executives a retirement savings account, contributing up to 5% of the executives' salaries. Those contributions have totaled about $2.5 million over the last five years, the audit found.
UC administrators weren't able to justify how money was spent
The Office of the President failed to satisfactorily justify its spending on systemwide initiatives, the audit found, and did not evaluate the programs' continued priority or cost. Auditors said the Office of the President was unable to provide a complete listing of the systemwide initiatives, their costs or how they benefit the university system.
Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Paramount) compared the situation to the 2012 budget scandal with the State Parks Department and to issues with the California Public Utilities Commission.

Administrative spending is high compared to other university systems
Spending in the Office of the President has increased and annual budget and staffing levels for the Office of the President are higher than administrations at other comparable public universities, the report found.
Among the auditor's findings:
The Office of the President's administrative spending increased 28%, or $80 million, from fiscal years 2012–13 through 2015–16.
The Office of the President needs to develop new, clear policies for tracking its expenses, the audit said.
The Office of the President's budget and staffing levels are higher than other central administration offices at similar university systems, including the University of Texas. UC officials said that this may be because it provides services to its campuses and employees that other universities do not, including the management costs associated with the university's retirement program.

Surveys on campus spending appeared to be doctored
The auditors submitted surveys to each campus to determine whether there was duplication of spending, and the Office of the President inappropriately screened the campuses' survey responses before the surveys were submitted to auditors, the state report says. The audit said the Office of the President intentionally interfered with the audit process.

CBS News intern shows how easy it is to obtain an abortion
By CRIMEINSIDER STAFF / June 14, 2013
The Kermit Gosnell murder trial has rekindled the debate over abortion as Republicans pounce on restrictions after the disturbing details of abortion were brought to light in Philadelphia. But in many states across the country, the laws are pretty straightforward about killing a child in utero.
In New York, where there were 138,370 abortions in 2011, there are no parental consent requirements for women under the age of 18, whereas in Pennsylvania parental consent laws can be easily side-stepped through judicial bypass or if the parents are not “reasonably available.” New York's abortion rate ranked No. 1 in 2011 with 34.2 abortions per 1,000 women.
CBS News sent one of our 17-year-old unpaid interns (Related article: The Wealth Gap: America's Unjustly Low Minimum Wage Laws) into a Manhattan abortion clinic without an appointment.
She filled out some forms requiring her consent, proof of ability to pay the fee, along with adequate insurance, and a few basic questions about any past health issues. The doctor informed her of the typical loose state non-requirements: no parental consent, no disturbing information distributed about the baby's experience during the procedure, and no surgical center requirements. No hassle, no problem.
All told, it took 57 minutes and a $450 co-pay for her to walk out of the clinic legally free of her pre-natal nuisance.
“Throughout most of America, you could go into an abortion clinic and pay to kill your baby, just like you'd go into a Starbucks and buy a cup of coffee,” said Northwest University professor John Smith.
According the Guttmacher Institute, 27 states require wait times, which typically last 24 hours, while only 19 states impose restrictions on so-called partial-birth abortion. Many states, including Illinois, allow for public funding.
“Generally, killing is subject to more extensive restrictions,” one expert explained. “Abortions are used far more often to end a life than are guns. Our patchwork quilt of abortion laws is destined to be ineffective.”
At a rally outside a Planned Parenthood clinic Tuesday, abortion control supporters renewed their calls for stricter laws. But 40 percent of Americans still disagree, even after Gosnell was convicted of three counts of first-degree murder for severing the spinal cords of late-term babies post-delivery.
Cecil Richards, the CEO of Planned Parenthood, wants fewer laws restricting baby killing.
“I can't imagine that my children would have fewer rights, and less access to the safest, best health care,” Richards said. “At Planned Parenthood, we see the impact of abortion stigma firsthand, in the women who delay getting ‘reproductive health care' because they fear they'll be labeled and judged.”
This debate is not going away. The fetus from the abortion our intern purchased was legally transferred to a regulated waste facility just hours after it was violently removed, to ensure it was not sold for profit.
A CITY-CENTRE pub's kitchen will be used to cook a Christmas Day meal for the homeless.
The Spread Eagle, in Walmgate, stopped serving food earlier this year, making its ovens and hobs redundant.
However, manager Nick Cope has decided to fire them up once more and provide volunteers with a place to make food for whoever needs it on December 25.
The vegan food - which will include an African groundnut stew and gingerbread cake - will be cooked by volunteers from the Food Not Bombs group and served in St Helen's Square from 8pm.
"We had a chef here and when he left we decided not to do food any more, but when I found out Food Not Bombs were doing this I thought it was a great idea," said Mr Cope.
"I contacted them through their Facebook page because they were only using people's homes and moving around kitchens to cook, and I thought because the kitchen wasn't being used they could use it for free.
"It's sad for them, having nothing, no money and being on the streets, so this is a really good thing to do."
Food Not Bombs raises awareness of poverty and homelessness in society by sharing food and organising gatherings.
The organisation is made up of volunteers who offer their services each week to make food for those struggling to make ends meet throughout the year, and is cooking in The Spread Eagle three times a week.
Volunteer Zoe McBride, 20, said: "We go out every Friday and it just happens that Christmas Day falls on a Friday this year.
"It's free food and we are promoting solidarity, not charity.
"Anyone can come along and help."
To help cook food on Christmas Day meet at The Spread Eagle from 6pm.

In Chapter 9, Interactive Programs, Dr. Meijer will teach us how to make programs in Haskell that are side-effecting:
interactive. Haskell programs are pure mathematical functions with no side effects. That said, you want to be able to write Haskell programs that can read input from the keyboard and write output to the screen which are in fact side effects. So, interactive programs have side effects... Interactive programs can be written in Haskell by using types to distinguish pure expressions from impure actions that may involve side effects.
Consider the following:
IO a
The type of actions that return values of type a
IO Char
The type of actions that return a character
IO()
The type of purely side effecting actions that return no result value|

ZCASH ROADMAP OFFERS PLENTY OF NEW THINGS it is always desirable to see particular cryptocurrencies evolving. there's very little news regarding Zcash in recent times, even though the currency is still doing its thing behind the scenes. Now that this currency has been around for over a year, it is due time to appearance ahead and spots what else the project has in shop for the community. The currency still boasts that it has had no major downtime or protection breaches to talk of. things are a bit different with regards to other cryptocurrencies; that much is sure.
The aim for 2018 is pretty simple: make Zcash even better than it is today. Upgrading this currency's performance, safety and balance are the top time table objects right now, that's only to be expected. what is a substitute extremely good is that the team has determined to deliver this currency to the mobile sector, as they purpose to tap into the two billion user-strong smartphone marketplace in 2018. All of this could be accomplished through the mixing of the Sapling cryptographic technology, and it'll be exciting to look how things play out in this regard.
There could be some improvements along the way to ensure all of that is achievable. more, in particular, the first community upgrade will come in June, although none of its unique features are acknowledged at the moment. it is evident there may be still lots of work to be done, thinking about this improve lays the foundation for future community upgrades. it is doubtful this can be brought as a hard fork, although we will discover more than time progresses.
In September, we will see the introduction of the Sapling cryptographic technology. This must deliver “orders of significance” improvements to Zcash in terms of the memory and time related to shielded transactions. furthermore, it will allow mobile transactions for this cryptocurrency, that can only be taken into consideration a good thing. that is possibly the biggest improvement Zcash has acquired for the reason that its release over a year ago, but it remains to be seen if any extra features might be added.
so far, there are some basic plans in place to upgrade Zcash even after its Sapling community upgrade. For now, they may be still in the early stages of improvement, and there may be still masses of room for improvement as far as Zcash is involved. Scalability enhancements, for instance, are being taken into consideration, despite the fact that no further details were found out at the moment. there may be even discussion of the usage of proof-of-stake in a few abilities, although that has additionally not been shown.
it is evident we are slowly coming to the subsequent level of development in the world of cryptocurrency. quite a few currencies are advancing their agendas, while Bitcoin is laid low with a lack of innovation right now. even though SegWit is active and the Lightning network is close to being found out, the current scaling worries will no longer be resolved overnight. None of this means Zcash will suddenly grow to be a top cryptocurrency in the coming months, however, it is ideal to look its developer's consciousness on what matters to them.

PHILADELPHIA — Hillary Clinton, the first woman to lead a major American political party's presidential ticket, accepted the Democratic nomination Thursday night with an appeal for a more collaborative and unified nation in the face of domestic divisiveness and global uncertainty.
And she described her opponent, Republican nominee Donald Trump, as a self-absorbed and unstable leader antithetical to America's need for cool-headed and compassionate leadership.
"We have to decide whether we're going to work together so we can all rise together," she said in perhaps the most closely-watched speech of her quarter-decade in the public eye.
Clinton's call for cooperation represented a direct repudiation of Trump's assertion in his acceptance speech last week that "I alone can fix it."
"Americans don't say: 'I alone can fix it,'" Clinton said to cheers from the crowd at Wells Fargo Center. "We say: 'We'll fix it together.'"

Describing a country "at a moment of reckoning," Clinton nodded to some of the same problems that peppered the remarks of speakers at last week's Republican National Convention in Cleveland: the threat of terrorism, the stagnation of wages for many Americans, and the systemic violence that plagues many communities nationwide.
But Clinton, unlike her GOP foes, cited greater inclusion and tolerance as the antidotes to the nation's ills.
Saying that Trump has taken his party "from 'Morning in America' to 'Midnight in America,'" she said the Republican nominee "wants us to fear the future and fear each other."
"In the end, it comes down to what Donald Trump doesn't get: that America is great – because America is good," she said.
At times echoing President Barack Obama's optimistic vision of the future in his address Wednesday night, Clinton painted a hopeful picture of American resolve, tolerance and progress.
Referencing the convention's theme, "Stronger Together," Clinton urged recognition of the nation's shared values in a message aimed not just at liberal Democrats still smarting from the defeat of Bernie Sanders, but at the nation as a whole.

Early in her remarks, Clinton directly addressed backers of the Vermont senator, telling his fans "I want you to know, I've heard you. Your cause is our cause."
Clinton's address was interrupted periodically by Sanders supporters in the arena who yelled "No more war!" Her fans tried to drown out the hecklers with chants of "Hillary!"
The former senator and first lady appeared to acknowledge the perception of many voters that she is too guarded or artificial in her public appearances.
"The truth is, through all these years of public service, the “service” part has always come easier to me than the 'public' part," she said. "I get it that some people just don't know what to make of me."
And she made a direct appeal to Republicans and independents wary of Trump's fitness to serve as the commander in chief.
"He loses his cool at the slightest provocation," she said of Trump. "Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons."

"America's strength doesn't come from lashing out. Strength relies on smarts, judgment, cool resolve, and the precise and strategic application of power," she added. "That's the kind of Commander-in-Chief I pledge to be."
Speaking in Iowa before Clinton's remarks, Trump blasted Democrats as describing a naive vision of a world that doesn't exist.
Clinton's journey to the presidential nomination began over nine years ago, when she announced her first White House run with the declaration "I'm in, and I'm in to win." After her unsuccessful and bitter primary run against then-Sen. Barack Obama, she served as his secretary of state, enjoying for a time some of the highest approval ratings of her long career in the public spotlight.
But lingering questions over her use of a private email server during her time at the State Department -- compiled with voters' suspicions about the Clinton administration scandals of the 1990s — erased much of that warmth for the former first lady, leaving Clinton with historically poor favorability among voters.
At last week's Republican National Convention in Cleveland, loathing for Clinton was raw, with delegates chanting “Lock her up!” and even one prominent speaker, Dr. Ben Carson, drawing a parallel between Clinton and Lucifer.
But in November she will face the one political candidate viewed even more negatively than she is by the American electorate: GOP nominee Donald Trump.
Leaders of the world's largest and most dynamic economies will gather this weekend for what should have been simply another yearly summit.
But this annual gathering of 21 Asia-Pacific nations – whose members range from Thailand to China to Japan to the United States – comes at a time of strong pressure on them to resort to an old idea – namely, that prosperity and power only come at the expense of others.
This myth of limited good in human affairs is a hard one to break. But consider these challenges now facing the nations of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum:
At least seven Asian nations are clashing dangerously over claims to islands and the ocean resources around them. China and the US are beefing up their militaries in a contest for influence. And two proposals for regional trade pacts – one led by China, the other by the US – are competing for support.
In addition, slow growth in Europe, India, Japan, the US, and China has more nations scrambling for advantage in trade, resources, and commercial ideas. The very openness that made the Asia-Pacific region so dynamic is in jeopardy.
One reason behind these problems is that China regards the US as a superpower in decline, especially since the 2008 financial crisis. Its aggressive expansion in Asia has prompted the Obama administration to seek strong trade and military ties in the region, even with old foe Vietnam.
All sides in APEC still talk of “win-win” strategies. In fact, the theme of this year's summit, which is being held in the Russian port city of Vladivostok, is “Integrate to Grow, Innovate to Prosper.”
But the recent challenges and clashes in Asia point to a return of the idea that there is a fixed amount of wealth and prestige in the world. The old belief that the strong only feed off the weak and that the rich only gain by depleting the poor could dominate again.
American leadership in Asia has long tried to dispel such archaic notions of humanity – by keeping sea lanes open, by opening US borders to trade, by welcoming foreign students to American universities, and by encouraging democracy in Asia.
China was reminded of America's historic influence on Thursday when the prime minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien Loong, spoke in Beijing at the training school of China's Communist Party.
“Among China's external relationships, none is more important than that with the US,” stated the leader of the small city-state in Southeast Asia. “This is the most important bilateral relationship for both parties, and for the entire world.”
“The US will remain the dominant superpower for the foreseeable future. It is currently facing some very difficult problems, but it is not a nation in decline.”
“The US is an enormously resilient and creative society, which attracts and absorbs talent from all over the world, including many from China and the rest of Asia.”
And, Mr. Lee noted, eight Nobel Prize winners in science who are of Chinese descent are American citizens. “We should never underestimate the US's capacity to reinvigorate and reinvent itself,” he said.
Other regions of the world have long looked to Asia as a model of growth. This APEC meeting needs to keep that inspiration alive by making sure the region doesn't slip back into zero-sum power plays or the kind of commercial mercantilism that assumes others must fail for one to succeed. Progress in history has only come when nations see their own good in helping others prosper.
The mother of “Thin Lizzy” singer Philip Lynott said this week that she was very offended at the Republican Party's use of her son's song “The Boys Are Back In Town” to introduce Republican vice presidential candidate Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) during last week's Republican National Convention.
“As far as I am concerned, Mitt Romney's opposition to gay marriage and to civil unions for gays makes him anti-gay – which is not something that Philip would have supported. He had some wonderful gay friends, as indeed I do, and they deserve equal treatment in every respect, whether in Ireland or the United States,” Philomena Lynott said in an interview with music magazine Hot Press. “Neither would Philip have supported his policy of taxing the poor and offering tax cuts to the rich, which Paul Ryan is advocating. There is certainly no way that I would want the Lynott name to be associated with any of those ideas.”
Philip Lynott died in 1986 at just 36 years old.
It's not the first time the Republican Party's presidential ticket has misappropriated a song. Dee Snider, the lead singer of the flamboyant cross-dressing group “Twisted Sister,” said last month that he never authorized the Romney campaign to use “We're Not Gonna Take It” during a Ryan campaign event. “There is almost nothing he stands for that I agree with except the use of the [workout routine] P90X.”
Ryan also ran afoul of “Rage Against the Machine” guitarist Tom Morello when he told The New York Times that “Rage” is one of his favorite bands. Morello penned an op-ed in response arguing that Ryan completely missed the point of the band's music.
“I wonder what Ryan's favorite Rage song is?” the rebel rocker wrote. “Is it the one where we condemn the genocide of Native Americans? The one lambasting American imperialism? Our cover of ‘Fuck the Police'? Or is it the one where we call on the people to seize the means of production? So many excellent choices to jam out to at Young Republican meetings!”
In a similar kerfuffle, a Romney campaign event drew a rebuke from the band “Silversun Pickups” over its use of the song “Panic Switch.” The band later told Rolling Stone that Romney was “inadvertently playing a song that describes his whole campaign.”

Having watched closely the manner in which questions of liberty and power are batted around in the first part of the 21st century — most recently during the disgraceful contretemps that Indiana's rather tame Religious Freedom Restoration Act provoked across the land — I have come to wonder of late whether the Bill of Rights could be ratified today.

In its classical mode, liberalism requires the citizenry that it serves to respect the crucial distinction that obtains between the principle of a given rule and the consequences that the rule might feasibly yield. Simply put, a country in which the people regard certain individual rights as inviolable axioms of nature — and who accept with alacrity, therefore, that they will often be used for ill — will be a country that boasts protections of those rights within its national charter. A country in which the people are focused primarily on what might be done with those rights, by contrast, will be a country that prefers to elevate and to abide by the whims of transient majorities — or, perhaps, by the discretion of a supposedly enlightened few. In Indiana, we were given an insight into which of these countries the people of the United States would rather live in.

Speaking at the Virginia Ratifying Convention of 1788, the anti-federalist Patrick Henry insisted that Americans should expect the refurbished national government to provide a framework for ordered liberty, and not to guarantee a particular set of outcomes. “You are not to inquire how your trade may be increased,” Henry advised, “nor how you are to become a great and powerful people, but how your liberties can be secured; for liberty ought to be the direct end of your Government.” Increasingly, alas, we seem to be more interested in trade and power and prescription than we are in liberty.

One can only imagine the attack ads that would today be marshaled against the Bill of Rights. Posited in 2015, the First Amendment's speech protections would likely be characterized as “anti-gay” or “pro-racist” measures that had been cynically contrived to protect the capacity of bigots to say disgraceful things with impunity and to reinforce the various power structures and privileges that are at present claimed to be destroying America. The “freedom of the press,” meanwhile, would be openly disdained as an overture to the corporate purchase of elections; the “right of the people peaceably to assemble” would be regarded as a direct threat to the sanctity of the land around the entrance to abortion clinics; and the wide-ranging conscience protections contained within both the establishment and the free-exercise clauses would be cast as a devilish recipe for theocracy that would allow the irrational to operate without oversight and the backward to undermine the great cause of Science.

To run down the list is to see the modern objections fall neatly into place. As it is so often, the Second Amendment would be cast as a recipe for “Wild West” anarchy, an open invitation to sedition for those white, mountain-dwelling racists of the Southern Poverty Law Center's nightmares, and an overture to the execution of children. The Fourth, the Fifth, and the Eighth would be denounced by both overzealous law-and-order types and totalitarian feminists as damnable “soft on crime” provisions intended to help dastardly types get away with raping college students and selling drugs to the vulnerable. And the Ninth and Tenth would be attacked viciously by our seemingly endless plague of ambitious public-policy graduates, almost all of whom believe down to their ill-fitting boots that there is no problem so small or so personal that it cannot be solved nationally. Precisely because it has such a limited effect in restraining the government, the only provision that would remain would be the Third, about quartering soldiers, although one can only suppose that John McCain and Lindsey Graham would put up quite the fight.

As James Madison recorded in Federalist 45, “the powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined.”
Worst of all, rather than discussing any of these questions in terms of their effect on individual freedom and the limitation of the state, we would be subjected to an endless set of graphs and numbers and pseudo-meaningful jargon, all meditations on the essential question of capital-L Liberty having been replaced by dry lectures delivered by 29-year-old UCLA graduates with no life skills at all. Oscar Wilde once complained that in the industrial era we have come to understand “the price of everything and the value of nothing.” There is, I'm afraid, a little truth in this. Last month, the left-leaning magazine Mother Jones attempted to put a financial “cost” on the Second Amendment. The right of the people to keep and bear arms, the magazine contended rather unconvincingly, costs the Treasury more each year than does Medicaid and should therefore be abolished or seriously restricted. Responding to the ruse, one wag on Twitter observed wryly that “the future of policy debates is argued with spreadsheets and calculators to show individual rights ‘burden' the masses.” He is right. Sorry, Mr. Jefferson, your insights aren't needed here.
At the time when it was demanded, there was little to no serious argument over whether the individual protections contained within the Bill of Rights were worthwhile in and of themselves. Rather, the contemporary dispute was over structure, the vast majority of opposition to the insertion of explicit protections coming not from those who feared that such protections would hamstring government's capacity to act, but from those who were worried that they would destroy the overarching logic of the Constitution and therefore serve to undermine it.

This was a reasonable objection. In its original form, at least, the Constitution that had been drawn up in Philadelphia was a charter of enumerated powers that granted to the national government a limited and clearly delineated role in the nation's political life. As James Madison recorded in Federalist 45, “the powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined.” In other words, what it was not clearly permitted to do, it could not do. That being so, a Bill of Rights made little sense, for, if the federal government had been accorded the opportunity to do only a certain number of things, listing what it could not do was superfluous. Underscoring this point, Alexander Hamilton submitted in Federalist 84 that a list of specific prohibitions would represent “various exceptions to powers not granted; and, on this very account, would afford a colorable pretext to claim more than were granted.” “Why declare,” Hamilton asked, “that things shall not be done which there is no power to do?”
The answer to this question was a simple one: The naysayers did not trust the dam to hold. Rather, they were sincerely worried that the national government would expand beyond all recognition, and that, in its broadened form, it would inevitably begin to encroach upon the rights of the people. To help prevent this from happening, they sought a parchment backstop to which they might appeal in such cases as denied their natural liberties.

A host of proposals is offered up, ten of which made it in. There is a certain logic to their order. For the protection of their spiritual, political, and intellectual rights, the rebels secured the First Amendment. For the protection of their Lockean physical rights, they acquired the Second, Third, and Fourth. For the protection of their legal, civil, and criminal safeguards, they obtained the Fifth through the Eighth. And, in order to ensure that the inclusion of such prophylactics did not adversely alter the document's structure, they garnered the Ninth and the Tenth.
If it sometimes feels as if the Bill of Rights is the only thing standing between the little guy and majoritarian tyranny, that's possibly because it is.
In the year 2015, it is difficult not to conclude that this was a smart and prescient move. Because the commerce clause has been expanded so drastically — and because the Supreme Court does not effectively police its limits — the Bill of Rights is now the only serious check left on the power of a federal government that has slowly come to enjoy the plenary powers that were intended to be reserved to the states. As the dissenters feared, Americans now live in a country in which it is presumed that the national authorities can do whatever they wish unless they are checked.
Worse still, they live in a country in which the majority is not upset by this development. Indeed, without a Bill of Rights to serve as a bulwark, one imagines that the United States would look more like everyplace else. It is commonplace for conservatives to note that in most of the world's countries, key individual rights are routinely ignored. It is less usual, however, to hear it observed that this is true even in more liberal nations such as Britain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. In my own country of birth, free speech is now violated without thought; the right to keep and bear arms is, to borrow a phrase from the 19th-century jurist William Rawle, “allowed more or less sparingly, according to circumstances”; there are few meaningful rights of conscience left; and the criminal-justice system is showing signs of cracking at the edges. Shockingly, even the Magna Carta has been undermined. Not only is the British government allowed to lock up suspects without charges for up to 28 days, but in 2009 the Crown Prosecution Service invoked a 2003 law and held its first criminal trial without a jury. There were no protests.

If it sometimes feels as if the Bill of Rights is the only thing standing between the little guy and majoritarian tyranny, that's possibly because it is. Americans may be freer than most, but it is often thanks to Supreme Court decisions and not to public opinion that America remains an outlier. It is because judges have stepped in that it is legal to burn the American flag in protest; that the Westboro Baptist Church may stage its execrable funeral demonstrations without fear of tort liability; that seditious speech may not be punished by the government; that disgusting videos may not be banned; that conservative Christians have been spared the indignities of the Obama administration's contraception mandate; that collections of citizens may engage in political criticism; that parents caring for their children may not be forced by the state to join a union; that the residents of Washington, D.C., Chicago, and other “blue” cities may buy and own handguns for their protection; that the government is prohibited from searching cell phones without a warrant; and so on and so forth. Looking around the country — and examining the attitudes that prevail in Washington, D.C., on our college campuses, and in our hopelessly excitable media — can we honestly conclude that three-fourths of We the People would vote today to so restrain ourselves? We are living on borrowed wisdom.

Lock a guy up for all or part of a flick and you've got all kinds of inherent drama just waiting to bust out. The fear of confinement exists in all of us. Preying on that fear has produced a host of memorable films over the years. Be it intense drama, thrilling action, dark science fiction or ribald comedy, a trip to the pokey rarely disappoints. Here are the fifteen very best prison movies.

Director Favid Fincher took a lot of grief for ruining the Alien franchise with his big screen debut. That seems a bit harsh. The third chapter, set on a dark, desolate prison planet, looks fantastic. It could have used a major script overhaul, but that wasn't Fincher's fault. Far from perfect, it has its moments.
14) Kiss of the Spider Woman – 1985
William Hurt snagged himself an Oscar playing a homosexual movie buff in love with his cellmate, a political activist imprisoned for his attempts to topple a corrupt government. Since the majority of the narrative takes place inside a cramped cell, it perfectly depicts the loneliness and isolation of incarceration.
13) The Hurricane – 1999
The emotional story of middleweight boxer Rubin “Hurricane” Carter's twenty-year imprisonment and subsequent release for a 1966 triple murder. A swarm of controversy surrounded glaring inaccuracies portrayed in the film, but that doesn't take away from it being a quality prison flick.
12) American History X – 1998
Edward Norton pumped some serious iron to play a violent neo-Nazi in this riveting drama. The scenes behind bars are both eye-opening and chilling. No punches are pulled by director Tony Kaye and writer David McKenna. If you're thinking about pursuing a life of crime, watch this first.
11) The Green Mile – 1999
Adapted from a Stephen King novel, The Green Mile unfolds the life of a 1930s death row corrections officer played by Tom Hanks, and his relationship with gentle giant John Coffey — a man who possesses strange healing powers. The plot often drifts toward melodrama, but it still contains several powerful scenes.
10) Brubaker – 1980
If you thought American History X was a nightmare, you ain't seen nothin' yet. Robert Redford plays a warden who goes undercover in his own prison to reveal sexual abuse and torture among inmates, and rampant corruption and murder among prison officials. Easily one of the most frightening fictional institutions ever put to film.
9) Papillon – 1973
Steve McQueen stars as real life French thief Henri Charriere, aka “Papillon,” who was sentenced to life in the notorious Devil's Island penal colony off the coast of French Guiana. Based on a novel written by Charriere, the plot recounts he and pal Louis Dega's daring escape, which may or may not be true. Whatever the case, it makes for a thrilling conclusion.
8) Dead Man Walking – 1995
Sean Penn should have scored Oscar gold as death row inmate Matthew Poncelet. Raw and emotional, this riveting film dives head first into the issue of capital punishment. Politics aside, it's hard not to be impressed by Tim Robbins' brilliant work behind the camera.
7) Bad Boys – 1983
Sean Penn again. Shortly after portraying everyone's favorite surfer dude Jeff Spicoli, Penn signed up to play a teen hood sent to a rough and tumble juvenile detention center reserved for the baddest of the bad. Gritty and brutal, this movie is not for the faint of heart.
6) The Longest Yard – 1974
There is no better place to stage a football game than behind prison walls; violent and unstable men looking to hit something aren't in short supply. Burt Reynolds delivers the goods as washed-up former football star turned convict, Paul Crewe. The climactic guards versus inmates gridiron showdown are classic.
5) Midnight Express – 1978
Note to self: never try to smuggle hash out of a foreign country. Especially if that country is Turkey. Although not classified in the horror genre, it would be easy to call this a horror movie after witnessing the inhumane torture subjected on young Billy Hayes. If any fictional account can scare a person straight, it would be Midnight Express.
4) Escape From Alcatraz – 1979
Whether or not Frank Morris and the Anglin brothers successfully escaped from Alcatraz isn't important. Seeing how they devised and executed their ingenious plan is what makes this flick memorable. Clint Eastwood was the perfect choice to play the enigmatic Morris.
3) The Great Escape – 1963
Steve McQueen again. This World Ward II epic details the planned escape by a group of Allied prisoners from a German POW camp. It's famous for catchy theme music and McQueen's iconic performance as “The Cooler King.” If you have a spare three hours, be sure to check out this highly entertaining prison romp.
2) The Shawshank Redemption – 1994
One of the best films of the '90s, Shawshank is a tour de force in storytelling and acting. A circumspect banker named Andy Dufresne is handed two life sentences for murdering his wife, even though the evidence is circumstantial. What happens after his arrival at Shawshank State Penitentiary is cinema at its finest.
1) Cool Hand Luke – 1967
“I can eat fifty eggs.” Immortal words from the incomparable Paul Newman. It's a travesty Newman didn't win Best Actor for the role of Luke Jackson. Unwilling to bend to institutional conformity, Luke would become one of the big screen's greatest tragic heroes. This film never ceases to amaze.
Most people know that that Congress unfortunately doesn't look like the rest of the country. It's more male, whiter, and more Republican. But a new Pew Research Center report has highlighted another way that members of Congress don't accurately reflect the people they are sent to represent: Its members are far more Christian than the nation at large.
Only 71 percent of Americans now identify as Christian, but a whopping 91 percent of elected members of Congress consider themselves Christian, according to the Pew report. This isn't due to underrepresentation of faiths such as Islam, Hinduism or Judaism, however but entirely from underrepresentation of those who are not affiliated with any '/'religion.

"The analysis finds that some religious groups, including Protestants, Catholics and Jews, have greater representation in Congress than in the general population," Aleksandra Sandstorm wrote in the Pew Research Center explication of the findings. "The group that is most notably underrepresented is the religiously unaffiliated. This group — also known as religious 'nones' — now accounts for 23% of the general public but just 0.2 % of Congress."
There's only one member of Congress, Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., who identifies as religiously unaffiliated.
“It's very dismaying to see this gap between representatives and the people they represent," Annie Laurie Gaylor, the co-founder and co-president of the Freedom From Religion Foundation, said by phone. She referred to “a quarter of the population [as having] one person that supposedly represents us.”
Gaylor argued, “People are afraid if they run for office and they aren't religious, they won't get elected," adding that this contributes to the "stigmatization and demonization of the non-religious."
It's hard to argue with Gaylor's point, in light of the election of Donald Trump as president.
Prior to his campaign, Trump was not, by any reasonable measure, a religious man. In August 2015, the church he claimed to be a member of, Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan, released a statement to the media making it clear that Trump was not an "active member."

Rather than admit that he isn't really a religious believer, Trump kept making public statements of piety, telling reporters his favorite book is the Bible and that he goes to church "as often as I can." His efforts at pretending to be religious would often slide into outright comedy, such as when he cited "Two Corinthians" during a Liberty University speech (any person minimally familiar with the Bible would say "Second Corinthians") or when he tried to put money on the Communion platter at a service in Council Bluffs, Iowa.
That's what happens, Gaylor argued, when politicians are made to feel taht they have to espouse religious beliefs to be considered legitimate candidates. It leads to a bunch of "knee-jerk piety and parading around of piety" that is more about showing off than about sincere belief. It marginalizes the nearly one quarter of the American public not affiliated with any organized religion.
Gaylor also expressed concern that the near-mandatory nature of religious affiliation in politics helps empower the religious right. Even though Congress has Jewish, Muslim and Hindu members — as well as many liberal and nonfundamentalist Christians — who support the separation of church and state, the very fact that religious faith is seen as a foundational aspect of governance makes it easier for religious conservatives to justify injecting their beliefs into their politics, despite the fact that our nation is supposed to be a secular one.
There's considerable reason to believe that racial and gender diversity in Congress strengthens advocacy on issues pertaining to women and people of color. Female representatives often push harder than their male counterparts on reproductive health issues, for instance. The Congressional Black Caucus takes the lead on issues like voting rights and protecting low-income housing.

Now imagine if there were a hefty number of nonreligious people in Congress, and they felt empowered to speak out when issues touching on religious belief cropped up in the legislative arena. Nonreligious or unaffiliated representatives, for instance, could argue that religiously motivated bills restricting abortion rights or undermining science education or funding were a direct attack on their personal right to not live under the dictates of a religion. Liberal believers are great, but having a secular team that includes actual nonbelievers and "unchurched" people would add oomph to the arguments against using the government to push dogmas of faith.
More important, having more religiously unaffiliated people in Congress would help remove the stigma entirely from the issue. Being without faith (or at least without a religious denomination) is still treated in most places as if it disqualified a candidate for public office or sends the signal that there is something unsavory about that trait.
The public is probably more ready to vote for nonbelievers than many politicians think. During his presidential run, Sen. Bernie Sanders admitted that while he identifies as Jewish and holds spiritual beliefs, he is "not actively involved with organized religion."
Advertisement:
That does not seem to have been a factor in Sanders' defeat in the Democratic primaries and this matter attracted hardly any negative attention. There's no reason to believe that had he become his party's nominee, it would have affected his chances of wining. Voters didn't seem to care, and almost all of those who did were going to vote for Republicans anyway. Still, even Sanders kowtows to the mandatory religiosity line, avoiding any in-depth discussion of his secular ways and identifying himself, in general terms, as a believer.
The hyper-religiosity of our elected government officials simply doesn't reflect the public at large, and that disparity helps explain, in a lot of ways, why Congress tends to be more conservative than the country at large. More nonbelievers in office would go a long way toward secularizing our government and making sure it represents the people as they are, instead of serving as some overly religious, distorted throwback.
You may have noticed on the side bar that a section called ‘Terrain Plugin' appeared recently, this is a non Unity plugin for 3ds max to generate terrains for virtually anywhere on the Earth and texture them. I did originally think about playing with terrains in Unity as well so after adding a custom export feature from the plugin to a custom Unity Terrain file format and doing some editor scripts to read the data we can now easily and quickly generate some nice looking real world terrains, the example below is of Pikes Peak and was built with just a few clicks in Max and then a few more in Unity.

Michelle Flores thought she had everything worked out for Thanksgiving. The 20-year-old San Francisco State junior was planning to join friends this Thursday to make pineapple-crusted ham, a family favorite. But last Friday, the Safeway where Flores works as a part-time cashier informed her that she'd be expected to work during on the holiday. She reluctantly called her friends to cancel their Thanksgiving plans.
Flores is well acquainted with the stressful unpredictability of part-time work. Last semester, she found out just three days before her midterm exams that the supermarket expected her to work 30 hours that week, 25 percent more than what she typically put in. One night, she got off work at 9, made it home by 10, and had to study all night for a 9 a.m. exam. “I definitely would have done better if I'd had more sleep,” she says. “Had I been notified sooner I could have studied more beforehand.”
For millions of retail workers, similar disappointments are all too common. According to a recent study by Susan Lambert, a professor at the University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration, nearly half of young part-time retail employees receive their work schedules less than a week in advance. This is partly a symptom of retailers' increasing reliance on computerized “on call” scheduling systems that track weather predictions and real-time sales data to schedule work shifts—maximizing efficiency but wreaking havoc on workers' ability to manage their personal schedules.
But for Flores and 40,000 other retail workers in San Francisco, that's about to change. Yesterday, San Francisco's Board of Supervisors passed two laws that will sharply curtail “on call” scheduling at the city's major chain stores.
Nearly half of young part-time retail employees receive their work schedules less than a week in advance.
“We see this as one exciting way to address the inequality gap and pull low-wage workers out of poverty,” says Gordon Mar, the executive director of Jobs With Justice San Francisco, a coalition of community and labor groups that has lobbied for the measures for more than a year. He sees them as important complements to San Francisco's new $15 minimum wage. While the wage is highest in the country, it still “isn't enough on its own to really create security for low-wage workers that are struggling to survive,” says Mar.
The bills, known as the Retail Workers Bill of Rights, will make sweeping changes to how large service-industry employers hire, schedule, and retain their workforce. The new rules require employers to post worker schedules at least two weeks in advance. They discourage arbitrary or inconvenient “on call” shifts by requiring employers to pay workers when the shifts are canceled at the last minute, which can happen when real-time sales slow down. Employers are essentially banned from relying entirely on part-time workers, a common strategy to avoid paying benefits; they must now offer available shifts to existing employees before hiring new ones. And they must offer part-time workers the same opportunities for promotions, raises, and time off as full-time employees.
“It's really exciting to see San Francisco break ground on solutions for low-wage workers,” says Carrie Gleason, the director of the Center for Popular Democracy's Fair Workweek Initiative. “The workweek has changed a lot in recent years, but the last time we legislated workplace standards on these issues was 75 years ago. It's long overdue that we set new standards.”
More than five years into the recovery, the economy has added middle-class jobs much more slowly than part-time service positions such as cashiers and fast-food clerks. Consequently, since 2007, the number of part-time workers who'd like to work full-time positions has doubled. As Jodi Kantor reported in a gripping New York Times profile of a Starbucks barista, the shift towards part-time work and “on call” scheduling has had the effect of “injecting turbulence into parents' routines and personal relationships, undermining efforts to expand preschool access, driving some mothers out of the work force and redistributing some of the uncertainty of doing business from corporations to families.”
“It's more convenient for them, without considering what is a better option for you.”
Several states, including California and New York, already have “reporting pay” laws that require employers to pay workers extra if they send them home early from a shift. Last year, SeaTac, an airport town between Seattle and Tacoma in Washington, became the first in the country to require employers to offer additional hours to part-time workers before hiring new employees. But San Francisco's Worker Bill of Rights goes much further than these efforts, and labor organizers expect it to help catalyze similar worker rights laws elsewhere.
Jobs for Justice, the group that lobbied for the San Francisco bills, is pushing similar measures in the Washington, DC, and Boston. Minnesota and New York are considering tighter regulations of “on call” shifts. Those two states and Michigan may also adopt laws that would bar employers from discriminating against part-time workers who request more stable schedules. The Service Employees International Union is pushing for a mandatory 30-hour workweek for security and janitorial workers in multiple states.
The Schedules That Work Act, introduced in this July in Congress by Reps. George Miller (D-Calif.) and Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), mirrors many of the provisions of the Retail Workers Bill of Rights, including advance notice for shifts and pay for workers sent home early. Labor groups don't expect the bill or a companion measure in the Senate to pass, but see them as rallying points for other state and local legislation.
The new San Francisco laws go into effect seven months after the mayor signs them and apply to chain stores with more than 20 employees and 20 global locations. For Flores, the changes come as a relief, albeit not soon enough to salvage her Turkey Day. The current system “does deteriorate your quality of life,” she says. “It's more convenient for them, without considering what is a better option for you.”
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Germany's former foreign minister and an outspoken critic of U.S. President Donald Trump, was elected Germany's 12th postwar president Sunday by a parliamentary assembly.
Steinmeier has been dubbed Germany's “anti-Trump” by the media after repeated comments during the U.S. election cycle. He called Trump a “hate preacher” and predicted years of challenging relations between Germany and the U.S. following the election. He has further lashed out against populists who “make politics with fear.”
“The result is not what most German would have wished,” Steinmeier said Nov. 9, the day after Trump's election victory. “I don't want to sugarcoat anything. Nothing will be easier, many things will become more difficult.”
The presidency is regarded as the highest office in Germany but the role is purely ceremonial. Steinmeier won 931 out of 1,260 votes from lawmakers and prominent German figures.
Steinmeier, a Social Democrat, has long been one of Germany's most popular politicians and he served eight years as Chancellor Angela Merkel's foreign minister. He made a run for the chancellory in 2009 but lost out to Merkel in the federal election.
Steinmeier said he wants Germany to be an “anchor of hope” during increasingly tumultuous times.
“We're living in tumultuous times. Many in our country feel insecure,” he said during his acceptance speech.

Former Chicago Bear Steve McMichael said today that he intends to run for mayor of southwest suburban Romeoville.
He announced his mayoral plans this morning on 1340 WJOL, a Will County talk radio station, and later confirmed his political intentions when contacted by the Tribune.
“I am dead serious about this,” said McMichael, a member of the 1985 Super Bowl champion Bears who has lived in a townhouse in Romeoville since April. “I am not a politician. I am someone who will not delegate over the people. I will listen to them and act on what they want to see in the community.”
McMichael, owner of Mongo McMichael's restaurant and sports bar in Romeoville, said he was encouraged to run by his customers.
McMichael said many of his customers are unhappy with various issues in the village including a lack of businesses and empty store fronts, especially on the east side of town.
McMichael said he has a plan to spruce up the town but did not want to share specifics yet. He plans to seek signatures in October to be on the mayoral ballot and expects to run against Mayor John Noak in the April election.
Noak defended the east side of the village, saying there are plans to build a new downtown area and community center.
"Good things are happening in the village," Noak said.
As for McMichael, Noak said everyone has a right to seek elected office. Noak, who has been mayor since 2008, said he will make a statement in the coming months about whether he plans to seek re-election.
McMichael, who has a 4-year-old daughter, said he used to live in a condo in downtown Chicago but moved to Romeoville so his daughter can grow up in a small town environment.

Story crafted by the ages are deep reservoirs of human experience. They live within the mysterious mix of vulnerability and strength that it is to be human. One of the wonders of the ancient stories is how … their deep meanings unfold across the stages of a lifetime. Like a “simple” traditional song with a circular structure – which can be entered from an almost infinite set of places in the circle – always experienceable as fresh. And so it goes with the stories and the changing perspectives of our place along life's journeys. It is in this ability to speak to the wholeness of life that stories sustain across generations. This theme of wholeness permeated this year's tellings.
Stories that my daughter grew up with were being told with both her and our granddaughter listening and hearing the tales with us – 3 generations together. My granddaughter shared knowing looks as she noticed ways that versions varied from the way they have been told at home. The intimacy of a human voice imparting what we receive in such a personal way… and feeling the love and care that has sustained the telling… and the way the stories have encouraged and taught us. These are among the greatest treasures of humanity. Feeling the movements of love and experience moving forward in a good way – despite our imperfections and challenges as human beings.
It is in the telling of story that are rooted our ways of understanding beauty, healing, family, community, our many relatives in the earthly world, conflict, peace making and so much more. The strength of stories, which have remained relevant over the generations reveal how we work together to face personal and communal existential challenges. This is how decentralized indigenous communities teach legal orders or laws informing each one of their responsibilities in relationship. These are places we can turn together in times of violation and conflict finding guidance. It is in knowing our place and our relationships and fulfilling our responsibility to place that freedom arises in indigenous experience.
This is a very different experience than that which has arisen from rights based orientation in which property and commerce have assumed rights greater than the rights of the earth herself, or of communities indigenous to place. The arrogance and violence of the exercise of such “rights” has exposed the imbalance of responsibility implicit in our ecological participation with the earth – our responsibility to the common welfare of one another. The age of the industrial Anthropocene is revealing its unsustainability as expressed in global climate change, the weakening of human languages (carriers of the wisdom of place based experience) and the rapidly accelerating rates of species extinctions. It is among the traditional indigenous stories that the ecological and social wisdoms that have sustained life in Cascadia, Ilahee, the Pacific Northwest, over 1000's of generations are revealed. Val Napoleon and others in Indigenous Legal studies programs and Tribal legal programs are turning to these stories to reveal the Indigenous Legal Orders which have informed responsibility of each of us in bringing health and wholeness to ourselves, our loved ones and communities. A growing movement is using these ancient stories as testimony in court cases, allowing them to become a part of common law (within the nation state system) and they are slowly emerging into a new legitimacy after being suppressed for generations of forced acculturation into colonial languages and schools. The stories are gathering power.
This year trickster tales, featuring raven, coyote, rabbit and blue jay among others were generous with themselves – the world being shaken up and awoken in dramatic ways over time. 70,000-year-old memories showed up to remind us that many of today's human challenges have been faced before. And that indigenous peoples around the world have connected and are continuing their connections in ways that anthropologists and nation states have tended to dismiss. These wisdoms and histories, which have been held in private, are remerging with new strengths and relevance.
The festival began on the day of the 2nd of 3 blood moon lunar eclipses. One of the tales, which connected to this, was of the reemergence of a ceremony for the Balancing Power of Women. A ceremony in which a man dances in support of the Women who choose their place of Power on the dance floor. It is a reminder of the responsibility of men to support women in their dance of Balancing Power, without interference.
Another tale of significance that came out was of the Sacred Medicine Bundle of the Mandan Water Buster Clan. A tale that connected with it's theft by the Field Museum in Chicago and the work of young people to recover it and bring it home. This was during the time of the dust bowl when it stopped raining for years. Upon the successful return of the bundle and the day its home coming ceremony ended a 3-day rain commenced from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. A reminder of the reality of the stories and the medicine, which they carry.
Many of the stories were about how we have learned to work together. The grandmother cedar tree story Johnny Moses shared is among those – the story of migration that Rose High Bear shared is another. A theme developed as many “raising the sky” stories began to come out. This represents the beautiful fostering of emerging tellers which happens at the festival each year. As usual, the diversity and artistry of telling was inspiring, provoking and full of wonders.
Local legend, Celilo Falls born Ed Edmo, told 3 times at this years festival, opening on the first day, opening on the third day and closing with a final pushing up the sky story on the final day. The people are – working together. Eee Hychka, thank you, to all who share so generously of themselves in bringing a fine festival to life once again.

A controversial new San Francisco law requiring retailers to post radiation information about cell phones started this month.
A trade group representing the cell phone industry said Tuesday it will file a federal lawsuit challenging San Francisco's new law to provide radiation information.
The suit comes the week The City's new controversial ordinance went live and after months of debate and publicity.
The ordinance requires cell phone retailers to display information about the amount of radiation emanating from cell phones and to provide fact sheets to customers who ask for them.
The CTIA said it plans to file its suit because the ordinance is trumped by federal law and it violates the industry's First Amendment rights.
Celebrities Who Dare To Bare It All
The law has been discussed and debated in the City for almost two years with former San Francisco mayor and now California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom pushing its adoption.
There is some controversy about how radiation levels are measured and whether cell phone radiation poses an immediate threat at all.
Regardless, the new law gives retailers until the end of the month to comply.
The thwarting of an Iranian plot raises the issue how far will the US go in response? Hard to complain, after Israel's cave-in.
It was a clear moment of satisfaction for US Attorney General Eric Holder.
Holder has in the past been accused of weakness and ineffectiveness in the fight against Islamic terror, but now he could announce the foiling of an Iranian plot to assassinate foreign diplomats in Washington.
The news that the Iranians had tried to work through a Mexican drug cartel only confirms the testimony before congressional committees that Iran is active in Latin America and uses the drug trade to facilitate and fund terrorism.
The United States is committed to holding Iran accountable for its actions” and would take “further action” against Iran, Holder said.
“We're going to work with allies and partners to send Iran a message: we don't tolerate the targeting of foreign diplomats on our soil,” said a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
This talk is good, but the question that remains is whether the Obama administration is prepared to walk the walk. Iran has already been accused by the US military of helping insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan kill American soldiers including training and supplying the explosive charges.
This was to be an attack on American soil and a restaurant bombing that would have resulted in the loss of many lives, according to FBI director Robert Mueller.
However, the administration mentions using allies and partners and this appears to rule out a unilateral American action against Iran in favor of multilateralism.
Another curious element in the announcement is to describe the principals in the affair, who are affiliated with the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, as a faction within the Iranian government. That is the equivalent of calling the Conservative party in Britain a faction of the British government because the British government coalition is comprised of 2 parties.
The Revolutionary Guard Corps is currently the backbone of the Iranian regime and controls a major share of the economy.
By imputing the plot to a faction, the administration seemingly absolves the other factions in the Iranian government. This allows the United States an element of room to avoid a decisive response.
We can at best expect targeted economic sanctions against senior members of the Revolutionary guards and their Quds force. The departments mentioned as organizing the response were State and the Treasury rather than the Defense Department.
If Russia, China and India don't go along, the sanctions will not be effective.
It was ironic that news of the terrorist plot was revealed by Attorney General Holder at around the time that Israel Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was announcing the deal with Hamas in which terrorists kingpins will go free in order to ransom Gilad Shalit.
It is difficult to criticize American failings in the fight against terrorism following the announcement of a massive Israeli cave-in.
Bad news for New Yorkers, thanks to ObamaCare: More than 100,000 policyholders just learned that their Health Republic insurance plans will be canceled on Dec. 31. The start-up insurer (spun off from the Freelancers' Union) is hemorrhaging red ink and has to close down.
That's unfortunate for the policyholders, who now have to scramble to find other coverage and try to keep their doctors.
But even worse is the abuse of taxpayers across the country: Congress loaned a whopping $2.5 billion of taxpayers' money to Health Republic of New York and 22 other boondoggle insurance co-ops, even after being warned by its own budget experts that many co-ops would fail and not repay the loans. How carelessly politicians spend other people's money.
If anything, the experts' warnings were understated. Across the nation, 21 out of the 23 co-ops are either shut down already or losing money. And it's your money going down the rathole.
The Obama administration itself labeled six of the co-ops in critical condition. Too bad it refuses to disclose which ones: Policyholders deserve as much warning as possible that their insurance may be on the rocks.
Thank the left-wingers in Congress and the Obama White House who concocted this scheme back in 2010 for this mess.
Abhorring for-profit insurance companies, they insisted that the Affordable Care Act establish nonprofit insurance cooperatives to compete with big players like Aetna and Humana.
Preposterously, the Obama administration specified that the co-ops be run by novices with no history of ties to the insurance industry. As if measuring risk and pricing policies is something that requires no expertise.
Obama administration rules also barred the start-ups from spending money on advertising or marketing to make their products known. Why? Because the left has always blamed the high cost of health insurance on ad spending. It was a formula for failure.
A wacky ideological agenda doomed these co-ops from the start.
The New York co-op's collapse is an especially humiliating defeat for the Freelancers' Union and Sara Horowitz, its self-proclaimed labor visionary, who has spent years touting the benefits of the collectivist “sharing economy.” But make no mistake: Taxpayers and policyholders nationwide are taking a hit.
All across the country, loans went to Obama cronies from his pre-presidential career as a community activist. During the fall of 2012, as his first term neared its end, Obama shoveled out money to these experimental start-ups.
Remember the outrage over the failed green energy project Solyndra? That only cost taxpayers $500 million — a fifth of what they could be forced to pay for the co-op folly.
The losses are racking up. A co-op in Vermont closed in 2013. Iowa's CoOpportunity Health collapsed in January, taking $145 million in federal loans with it.
Louisiana's Health Cooperative shut down in July, after a steady stream of red ink. And in August, Nevada's co-op announced it will close up by Jan. 1. It had $65.9 million in federal loans on its books.
A July inspector general's report warns that several remaining co-ops are tottering. Yet the media are almost silent.
That's especially regrettable: Policyholders should be warned that they may have to switch plans (and doctors) in the future. And the public should get a straight story about how its tax dollars are going up in smoke.
During the wrangling in Congress over Obama's health law, the co-ops became the consolation prize for lawmakers dreaming of socialist health care, also called a single-payer plan. There's a lesson here, though some people refuse to accept it.
A Health Republic executive suggested that the co-ops are failing because a “bitterly partisan Congress” provided less funding than they actually needed. No, more funding would have resulted in more taxpayer money down the drain.
When you want to solve a complex problem like increasing access to health care and controlling costs, look to the marketplace, not the ivory-tower wonks and community activists whose hubris is rivaled only by their lack of practical knowledge.

The wind industry is rapidly expanding, that much you probably already know. But did you know that it is expanding so fast that both the European Wind Energy Association and the European Commission have consistently underestimated the future wind power capacity they expect to be installed?
Going back to 1997, when the European Commission first talked about targets for renewable energy, a Commission White Paper set a non-binding goal of 40 GW of wind power by 2010. This target was exceeded by more than double: by the end of 2010 there were 84.3 GW of wind power in Europe. Impressively, the 40 GW target was reached five years early.
That's not to mention the industry's own targets. In 2003 EWEA set targets of 75 GW of wind power capacity by 2010 and 180 GW by 2020, which was before the European Union expanded to include central and eastern European countries. Following the admission of Romania and Bulgaria in 2007, EWEA increased its targets. This time it expected 80 GW by 2010, 180 GW by 2020 and 300 GW by 2030.
In 2011 we can safely say that the industry exceeded its own 2010 target: by the end of the year 84.3 GW was installed. Even the industry itself cannot keep up with its targets!
And then, in 2007, agreement on a binding target for a 20% share of renewable electricity in the EU's overall supply by 2020 was reached. With wind energy in the leading position in the EU renewable energy sector, EWEA decided to raise its 2020 and 2030 targets to 230 GW and 400 GW respectively. Given the sector's track record, we're confident these targets will be met.
But the industry still needs signals to keep on growing, to keep on cutting the EU's carbon output and to keep on creating green jobs. A new renewable energy target for 2030 must be set, we must invest in the electricity infrastructure that will deliver power from onshore and offshore wind farms to consumers and, a single EU power market must be formed to allow all power technologies to compete on a fair basis.
With this in place Europe will be on the path to having 100% renewable electricity by 2050 with wind power contributing 50% of this.

We will be keeping tabs here on the Israel/Palestine related news coming out of the staggering election results in the United States last night, with many updates to follow:
Rightwing Jewish leader Naftali Bennett, Israel's education minister and head of the Jewish Home party, saw unequivocal meaning in the Trump victory:
Trump's victory is a tremendous opportunity for Israel to immediately announce its intention to renege on the idea of establishing Palestine in the heart of the country – a direct blow to our security and the justice of our cause.
This is the president-elect's outlook as it appears in his platform, and that definitely should be our way. Salient, simple and clear. The era of the Palestinian state is over.”
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu published big hopeful hugs statement:
“I congratulate Donald Trump on being elected the 45th President of the United States of America. President-elect Trump is a true friend of the State of Israel, and I look forward to working with him to advance security, stability and peace in our region. The ironclad bond between the United States and Israel is rooted in shared values, buttressed by shared interests and driven by a shared destiny. I am confident that President-elect Trump and I will continue to strengthen the unique alliance between our two countries and bring it to ever greater heights.”
Yaacov Friedman, editor of the Jerusalem Post, reports:
Spoke to David Friedman, @realDonaldTrump's Israel adviser. Says US-Israel relationship will completely change. Will be better than ever. Friedman said that @realDonaldTrump plans to keep promise to move US embassy to #Jerusalem. Hostility b/w DC-Jerusalem will also end.
Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat also said he is confident this means that the U.S. will move its embassy to Jerusalem.
Yehuda Glick, a leader of the Jewish zealots who want to colonize one of the holy sites of Islam in Jerusalem, can't wait for Trump to come to Jerusalem and have a vision:
Glick expressed hope that Trump would “ascend the Temple Mount and lead from the source of light and energy a dialogue of world reconciliation and peace.”
A Hebron settler leader says the era of bad feelings between the U.S. and Israel regarding the colonization of the West Bank is over. Yochai Damari:
I hope that this governmental turnover will also lead to a revolution in the attitude and practical actions of the United States toward the settlement movement in Judea and Samaria… The difficult days of Obama are over for the settlement movement. If we work correctly, this could be the dawn of a new day for the settlements and for the entire State of Israel.
The view of opposition leader Yitzhak Herzog, as reported by New York Times' Isabel Kershner:
So Isaac Herzog, Israeli opposition leader, hails "new era of change" and defeat of pundits, clearly wishing same for himself #SilverLining — Isabel Kershner (@IKershner) November 9, 2016
Ofer Neiman provides a translation of Herzog's statement:
Warm greetings to the president of the biggest strongest superpower of the world, Donald J. Trump! The American democracy has voted today to place at its helm an American leader, who has taught the commentators and the skeptics that we are in a new era of change and the replacement of old ruling elites! You have done the unexpected against all odds, polls and studies and the prophets of the old era. I am convinced that the security and economic alliance with our strong and important ally will continue and be strengthened under your presidency. Good luck to you, Donald J. Trump.
Ali Abunimah observes at Electronic Intifada that Clinton would have been an “anti-Palestinian extremist” as president, and panderer to her donors, and while no one is sure what Trump will do,
The Israeli counterparts of these vile American racists are celebrating Trump's victory today.
Jewish Insider quotes several pro-Israel voices saying that President Obama will now do nothing to advance the so-called peace process at the United Nations. For instance centrist-setttler Zionist Yossi Klein Halevi:
“If Obama does go to the UN, it will be a fit of pique that will have no positive consequences. It would be Obama throwing a temper tantrum. If I were Obama waking up to the news today, the last thing on my mind would be the Palestinian issue. Obama is looking at the ruin of Obamacare, at a very shaky Iran deal, and some other of his key initiatives. If he goes to the UN, he will just be compounding his failure on the peace process.”
As for the Iran deal, which Trump has promised to rip up, the conventional wisdom is already forming that Trump will not be able to undo the deal, in its many international dimensions anyway. Aaron David Miller at Jewish Insider:
[A] Trump Administration will adopt a kind of if ‘it ain't broke don't try to fix it' mentality to any relationship that isn't in need of immediate attention. Relations post Obama are likely to improve as Trump's hostility to the Iran nuclear deal increases and any pressure on Israel with respect to the Palestinian issue diminishes, Expect Netanyahu to come to the White House before Passover.
Rebecca Vilkomerson of Jewish Voice for Peace issued a statement of solidarity with those who feel threatened by Trump.
To everyone whose safety and rights are at stake, I am with you. I will lay it all on the line with you and for you. — Rebecca Vilkomerson (@RVilkomerson) November 9, 2016
Peter Beinart offered a related message at Haaretz, he doesn't trust America:
As an American, a white one, I've always felt safe. I've always assumed my country would be stable… I'm not leaving America. It's my country. I have to fight – every American Jew has to fight – to protect the American Muslims who right now must be terrified beyond belief… I still love America to my core. But I don't trust it in the same way.

Female US cop caught on tape giving two women body cavity search during routine traffic stop... and 'using the SAME gloves on both'
Angel Dobbs, 38, and niece Ashley Dobbs, 24, were pulled over on State Highway 161 near Irving, Texas
Trooper searched car for marijuana before requesting invasive cavity search
Older woman claims search by trooper Kellie Helleson irritated an anal cyst she was suffering causing 'severe pain and discomfort'
Also suing the Texas Department of Public Safety for failing to act on previous complaints about 'violating' searches
Two Texas women are suing after state troopers subjected them to a humiliating and invasive 'roadside body cavity search' that was caught on video.
Female trooper Kellie Helleson is seen in the footage aggressively searching the private parts of Angel Dobbs, 38, and her niece, Ashley Dobbs, 24, in front of passing cars.
The women, who claim the trooper used the same rubber glove for both of them, were initially stopped by Helleson's colleague David Farrell on State Highway 161 near Irving after he saw one of them throw a cigarette butt out the window.
SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO
Invasive: Female trooper Kelley Helleson, left, aggressively searched Ashley Dobbs, 24
Farrell can be heard in the disturbing video questioning the pair about marijuana though he failed to find any evidence of the drug in the vehicle.
However, he requested the women be searches after allegedly claiming they were 'acting weird.'
The lawsuit states he then tried to 'morph this situation into a DWI investigation,' according to the Dallas Morning News .
Angel Dobbs passed a roadside sobriety test and the women were given warnings for littering.
Pulled over: The women were initially stopped by Helleson's colleague David Farrell on State Highway 161 near Irving, Texas
Angel Dobbs said Helleson irritated an anal cyst she suffers from during the search, causing her 'severe and continuing pain and discomfort.'
The suit said: 'Angel Dobbs was overwhelmed with emotion and a feeling of helplessness and reacted stating that Helleson had just violated her in a most horrific manner.'
The two women are also suing the director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, Steven McCraw, who they claim ignored previous complaints about 'unlawful strip searches, cavity searches and the like.'
Lawsuit: The women are also suing the director of the Texas Department of Public Safety for ignoring prior complaints about searches
The Dobbs' lawyer Scott H. Palmer said the shocking incident, which was filmed on one of the trooper's dash-mounted cameras, was a roadside 'sexual assault.'
He said the Texas Rangers investigated his clients' complaints but failed to take any action against the troopers.
'You can see what's happening clearly,' he told the Dallas Morning News of the video. 'No one's ever seen the likes of this. We can't let them get away with it.'
Not true, Bitcoin is pseudonymous , because all transactions are public and recipients and senders are identified by their Bitcoin addresses. Physical cash is a fully anonymous form of currency.
1:10 — “They can't be … confiscated by governments.”
This is somewhat misleading because a Bitcoin wallet can be confiscated by governments, law enforcement, or anyone else. The taker just has to hack your computer, or steal your hard drive, or snag whatever physical medium that contains your wallet's private keys. And your bitcoins will be gone. Just ask Ross Ulbricht, who had 144,000 bitcoins seized by the FBI when they snatched his laptop while he was using it in a public library.
The best protection against physical theft is to encrypt your hard drive or Bitcoin wallet with a secure passphrase, and back it up to another physical location. Then even if your wallet is taken, it will be nearly impossible for the thief to use or spend your bitcoins, while you will still have access to them.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - A third outbreak of avian flu has been detected in Washington state, prompting agriculture officials on Tuesday to warn bird owners to keep their flocks away from migratory birds that have spread viruses from Oregon to British Columbia.
State and federal agriculture officials culled about 120 backyard chickens, geese and ducks in Clallam County, 125 miles (200 km) northwest of Seattle, on Sunday after confirmed infections of the highly pathogenic H5N2 strain of avian flu.
“All bird owners, whether commercial producers or backyard enthusiasts, need to continue practicing good biosecurity, preventing contact between their birds and wild birds and reporting sick birds or unusual bird deaths,” said U.S. Department of Agriculture spokeswoman Joelle Hayden.
The virus has not been found in commercial poultry and there was no immediate public health concern, federal agriculture officials said.
Most strains of bird flu viruses do not infect humans, although some strains can be dangerous or deadly.
In December, the USDA confirmed two separate virus strains of bird flu in Washington's northern Whatcom County, near the Canadian border, with infections detected in pintail ducks and captive Gyrfalcons that were fed hunter-killed wild birds.
Earlier this month, the Washington State Department of Agriculture imposed an emergency eight-month quarantine of poultry and eggs in parts of Benton and Franklin counties, in the state's southeast, after the H5N2 strain was found in two flocks of mixed poultry there.
The virus is extremely contagious among poultry and can spread rapidly through a flock, killing birds in as little as 48 hours. The H5N2 strain of bird flu has killed thousands of birds on two Canadian farms in British Columbia.
Last week, China banned all imports of U.S. poultry products and eggs following the discovery of avian influenza in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, the USDA said. All poultry shipped to China after Jan. 8 was to be returned or destroyed, the agency said.

A Japan Airlines flight to Tokyo's Narita Airport returned to Boston's Logan Airport on Thursday because of a possible fuel pump issue on the Boeing 787 aircraft.
BOSTON —
A Japan Airlines flight to Tokyo's Narita Airport returned to Boston's Logan Airport on Thursday because of a possible fuel pump issue on the Boeing 787 aircraft.
It's the latest trouble for the new Dreamliner aircraft after a lithium-ion battery problem grounded the fleet in January and a fire erupted on an empty Ethiopian Airlines plane parked at Britain's Heathrow Airport last week.
Flight 007 returned to Boston "as a standard precautionary measure" to check out a maintenance message indicator showing the possible fuel pump problem and landed safely, Japan Airlines spokeswoman Carol Anderson said.
The pilot didn't declare an emergency, and the aircraft burned off fuel before landing, Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Arlene Salac said.
The plane left for Tokyo just before 1 p.m. Thursday for a flight of nearly 14 hours. It returned just before 6:30 p.m.
The flight was canceled, and passengers were being put on other flights.
One of two battery fires that grounded the 787s for three months broke out on a Japan Airlines plane at Logan in January after passengers had exited. The next day, another Japan Airlines 787 leaked 40 gallons of fuel at Logan. The airline said an open valve caused a tank to overflow through a vent.
The 787 is the newest and highest-profile plane from Chicago-based Boeing Co., which has said it stands behind its safety and overall integrity. The 787 is assembled at Boeing plants in Everett, Wash., and North Charleston, S.C.
Members of two competing parliaments met in Morocco to agree plan although some groups have denounced it as illegitimate
A group of Libyan politicians have signed a UN-sponsored peace deal that nominally unifies the country's two rival governments, despite being denounced as illegitimate by some of the groups the agreement is meant to unite.
Members of Libya's two competing parliaments met in Morocco to sign the deal which supporters say will hasten the end of an 18-month civil war, as well as five years of political violence that followed the uprising against the former dictator, Muammar Gaddafi. Western powers hope a united Libya will allow the country's warring militias to instead focus on eradicating an Islamic State franchise that has seized power on parts of the country's coast.
But the sustainability of the deal has been thrown into doubt after key players not present at the signing ceremony said it was an agreement forced on Libya by external powers.
Britain hopes the unity government, to be run by a nine-strong presidency, will invite western powers to mount airstrikes against Isis positions, allowing David Cameron to avoid another Commons vote before dispatching RAF jets.
The deal was accepted on Thursday by some members of Libya Dawn, the rebel coalition that seized power in Tripoli in July 2014 and forced the internationally recognised government to retreat to the eastern city of Tobruk. But Jamal Zubia, the rebel government spokesman, claimed those who signed the unity deal did not speak for the Tripoli faction and were merely puppets for the international community.
“People who are signing this UN draft – none of them have any authority. When you send unauthorised people to sign, it's a fake document,” Zubia said.
He added: “If they want a democratic country, they must do it in a democratic way – they can't force us to accept it. If they want to make it a colony, then call it a colony, but don't pass it to us as a gift from the UN.”
Other factions were more supportive. Hatem al-Oraibi, the spokesman for the Tobruk government, said: “We support all the efforts that are being done for the sake of reunifying Libya during this critical phase.”
'We cannot allow status quo to continue in Libya', Kerry warns Read more
Analysts warn the unity government will face many of the same problems that the previous internationally recognised government faced. Without a cohesive state-run police force and army under its control, the new government may not be able to meet in Tripoli without the support of sympathetic militias. This could perpetuate the involvement of militias in political affairs, an unstable arrangement that goes against the long-term goals of the peace deal.
Frederic Wehrey, a Libya specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: “The danger is that it becomes yet another third body that has to meet outside the capital or even worse outside the country. There is a plan for [local] armed actors to help secure the new government. But the problem is that the actual army and police are quite weak so we would be relying on militias again.
“And that's the larger issue – how do you create a security force under the control of the authorities, while at the same time demobilising the militias?”
Q&A with Clemson Athletic Director Terry Don Phillips
David Hood by Senior Writer -
CLEMSON – Clemson Athletic Director Terry Don Phillips agreed to a sit-down with TigerNet Monday afternoon, and we covered a lot of ground in the time allotted.
Of, course the biggest topics were possible conference realignment, the recent news of the bowl tie-in between the SEC and the Big XII and the ACC's television deal, but we also asked about Dabo Swinney
Head Coach
View Full Profile 's contract and facilities.
Hopefully we can break this up into two parts. Of course, as soon as I left his office my phone was already ringing as people wanted to know one thing: Is Clemson leaving for the Big XII?
Of course, I can't answer that, but I do think his answers to some of the questions are interesting to say the least and you can draw your own conclusions.
He did say that current conference affiliations and the college football landscape are “a moving target.” And he said that the Atlantic Coast Conference now understands that football is king, and that moves have to be made to protect those football interests. If you don't, your relevance goes away.
Once again, I asked for this meeting on extremely short notice, and I was thankful for his time. Hopefully he will allot us a little more time in the near future when the dust settles a little bit.
Q&A with Clemson AD Terry Don Phillips
TN: The recent announcement of a game between the SEC and the Big XII shook the football world. What are your thoughts on what happened, and what this means for the landscape of college football?
TDP: It [college football landscape] is a moving target now. I think that has been well established over the last two or three years. You would've thought that it would've settled down a lot after what occurred late last summer and this past fall, but it hasn't. The SEC and the Big XII and the arrangement to try and protect their champion if they're not in the top four- actually, it makes a whole lot of sense of to me that now you can protect your champion and at the same time you create a vehicle that your conference can go out and sell and generate more funds for your conference. So, that was a good, solid, strategic move for both conferences.
TN: In your opinion, how does that move affect the ACC?
TDP: The ACC- we just got back from our spring meetings. Certainly, there were a lot of things discussed down there. The conference and the membership well understand what is happening. For example, in this latest contract with ESPN, 80% of it is generated by football. As good as basketball has been in the ACC, it is very evident just through this contract that football has to be very, very relevant. And the conference is well aware of that and they are going to be turning over every stone that they can and not just sitting on this contract. For example this new contract has two look-in windows- one at five years and one at 10 years. The purpose of that - in talking with ESPN people and our people in the same room – is to look at the end of five years where are we- competitively, what's our performance, and does it merit a significant increase in the rights fee. There's no question that on ESPN, the rights to television money is larger than any other conference. They've got other- the SEC has CBS and other conferences have other carriers, but there is tremendous exposure for the ACC football games as well as basketball games and other Olympic sports. As far as exposure, it's a very good contract. Dollar wise as far as what ESPN is paying, it's at the top, but overall because of the lack of CBS, you don't have the same kind of dollars that other conferences have. But, having said that, ESPN has made it very clear that the purpose of writing in those look-ins is to see where we are in five years. You don't wait until the end of the 15 years to say, ‘hey, how are we doing?' That's the purpose of the five-year and the ten-year look-in to challenge our conference and all of us associated with the conference know that football is extremely important and we have to perform and do everything we can to perform.
TN: Does the ACC contract put the conference's schools at a competitive disadvantage?
TDP: You've got to look at what occurred during the period of time that it was negotiated. One of the interesting things that I've heard, with regards to the negotiations is that the conference didn't do a good job negotiating. What's interesting is that a lot of these conferences use the same consultants when dealing with the networks. When I came out here from the Big XII to the ACC, we had the same consultant that we had in the Big XII, and so what you have as a package has to speak for itself and provide whatever leverage that you have to negotiate at the highest rate. Some of these contracts- you're really not privy to- they're not subject to FOIA because they are privately owned and not for non-profit so you can't get it there. The only way you can get information- not the provisions- is through tax returns which is always retrospective. You try to understand where you are, but you don't have a quick and easy way to see what the provisions are. For example as reported, in the Pac 12, when they negotiated their contract- I guess it came about a year after the ACC negotiated its contract- at the time Fox and ESPN with the ACC were bidding against one another. What occurred in the Pac 12, I guess it was NBC Comcast, they came in as a bidder and Fox and ESPN joined forces to keep the other out of the market so that drove up the market value of that contract because of the market dynamics of what occurred at that particular point and time- a new group wanting to come in and get a piece of the college football landscape. And Fox and ESPN determined not to let them have a piece of the landscape so they came together and joined forces to preempt NBC Comcast. Then on top of it, the Pac 12 pulled in all of the multimedia contracts from all of the member institutions which pull that out of the control of the individual school and put it in the conference office, and now they have the multimedia rights. They control these third tier rights for the conference schools, which is part of that figure. Here, you say, ‘ok, what's it worth to Clemson if you look at the Pac 12 model?' We probably on our rights pull in 4.5 million annually and maybe a little more so you add that on top- that's your sponsorships, radio, printed publications, and all of that. So, you could pull in those kinds of rights and put it on top of your television contract and instead of it being 17 million, it's 21 million in a similar format as the Pac 12. Not being privy and not knowing what's in the contracts, you don't know what rights are in there. You only know what's reported, and that's sometimes accurate and sometimes not accurate. The conference offices don't release those contracts and the only thing you can look at are the tax returns of the not-for-profit conference member offices. You don't know what the provisions are or where those numbers are coming from.
TN: Speaking of third tier rights, it was my understanding that the ACC contract didn't allow for schools like Clemson to negotiate on games that are not picked up by the networks. Is that correct?
TDP: Anything that's not picked up by ESPN or Raycom- my understanding of the contract- is that we would be able to try to take it to the marketplace, but again there are some things that we need clarity on and that's one of them. As far as membership, again we all understand that 80% of the dollars in this contract comes from football. Everybody is treated the same in regard to equal distribution and every school has the same opportunity with the third tier rights that they retain to go out and sell them in the marketplace so no one is being treated different than the other and I think that's important for people to understand. The big challenge that we've got is in football we've got to maintain and have a stronger voice when it comes to BCS issues and that means that football has got to continue to improve and get better in our league.
TN: Does it worry you that events that are out of your control can change what happens to Clemson in regards to football playoffs and national recognition? Meaning, what if Florida St. leaves, or another ACC team leaves, thereby weakening the conference?
TDP: There are a lot of things that I or anybody can't control. The only thing that I feel confident in saying is that I believe that the ACC understands the challenges that we have going forward that football is strong and gets stronger. We cannot afford to lose our seat at the table when it comes to the BCS and championships going forward. We simply cannot afford to allow that to happen. The conference and the conference leadership, as well as the presidents, understand the importance that has to be placed on football going forward.
TN: Does that mean you think the ACC will expand even further or needs to expand in order to keep that seat at the table?
TDP: I'm at a juncture to where you don't rule anything out anymore. You simply can't rule it out. The irony of it is that as I look backwards, I can still remember when I was at Arkansas when we went to the SEC and the consternation of us leaving the old Southwest Conference at that time. That was traumatic because of the ties that we had. Then I go to the Big XII when they expanded. I guess that should've been a signal that this is the times that we live in. I do believe that it's going to continue. I do know this- football has got to be very strong because that is driving these contracts. At the ACC meetings, we had an interesting presentation that was in regard to basketball and football with regard to the public. Basketball is a great sport and has a great following, but over the last 10-15 years ,where at one time basketball was up as a sport in this part of the country and football was lower and now it has changed places. That in of itself tells you that football is what the public wants. They want a playoff. They want a championship game that's not contrived, but one that pretty well matches up the two best teams at the end of the day. That's what the public wants and conferences have got to position themselves to where their members have an opportunity to get there. One of the things that Dabo did a very good job of talking about at the conference level was about the concern that one of the [SEC] teams will start off ranked higher and they have a tendency to stay up there and Dabo said, ‘well, this past year was a great example that that is not true. If you base it on performance and who you are playing.' We start off 8-0 and we go from being unranked to fifth in the BCS and had we finished out-fortunately we were able to come back and beat Wake Forest to get in the championship and then we beat a good, solid Virginia Tech team in the ACC Championship. But had we finished out the year the way we did those first eight games, we could've been playing for the national championship and that's going from being unranked. That's based on performance. I thought Dabo's point was very good. This year showed what can happen and unfortunately, we were very grateful that our kids played well in the championship game and we won that against a good, solid Virginia Tech team, but our losses occurred at the end of the year which dropped us out of the BCS opportunity, but at one time we were sitting there pretty doggone good.
TN: The ACC teams have to perform better……
TDP: I believe that if you perform very well. And it's about wins. Again, I go back to this year and would say that if we had finished out the year with how we started, I'm very confident that we would've been in one of this top four.
TN: Let's look at a hypothetical situation, if FSU were to leave……
TDP: I'm not going to get into hypotheticals. I'm not going to discuss it. I hope you can understand that.
TN: So there has been no contact between Clemson and the Big XII or talks about Clemson joining?
TDP: There's nothing of such between Clemson University and the Big XII.
TN: But that doesn't mean things won't change if the need arises?
TDP: Like I said, it's such a moving target. The landscape has changed so dramatically here in the last few years that it just seems like it was yesterday that at Arkansas we were going to the SEC and then the Big XII was formed so it's changing. It's a changing landscape.
TN: And this administration will do what's best for Clemson, regardless?
TDP: The short answer is absolutely. At the end of the day, we have to do what's best for our program. Having said that, the conference knows the challenges that we have and the conference unquestionably understands that football has got to perform and perform at a very high level.
TN: So winning takes care of itself?
TDP: It's going to help a great deal. One of the reasons, we felt it was important to keep Georgia on the schedule- we've got South Carolina on the schedule every year- because our thinking was that going forward we wanted to have two teams from really strong conferences that enhanced our non-conference schedule. The Georgia game was a game that we simply weren't going to lose because of conference expansion. Granted, it has presented some challenges for us but we are going to play Georgia and we'll work it out. It's important to play those kinds of games. Football here has been the heartbeat. We've just got to keep building it.
Kıvılcım Arat was taken into custody at Istanbul Atatürk Airport
A transgender activist was taken into custody and nearly sent to a cell with 20 men at a Turkish airport.
Kıvılcım Arat was arrested at the international terminal at Istanbul Atatürk Airport tonight (17 March).
She was on her way to a conference on women's rights in Germany; it is thought she was arrested during passport checks.
According to KaosGL, a Turkish LGBTI organization, the full reason for Arat's arrest is unknown.
Authorities reportedly said it was because she failed to testify in an investigation.
But lawyer Aylin Kırıkçı said Arat didn't know the contents of a file outlining the reason for her detention.
‘It is necessary to testify from an earlier investigation, so it is clear that there is a catch-up decision,' Kırıkçı told KaosGL.
‘It is also unclear from which inquiry she should testify.'
Laywers tried reaching the prosecutor, partly because Arat reportedly has health issues, but were unsuccessful.
Kırıkçı also said authorities at Atatürk Airport wanted to detain Arat in a cell with 20 men.
‘Despite the fact that my client is a trans woman, they want to put her in a room with 20 men,' Kırıkçı said.
After Arat objected and had a discussion with authorities, it seems she is now detained separately.
Through her lawyer the activist sent a message from where she is detained.
‘In our areas of solidarity, we are stubborn about those who call for notice,' she said.
‘We will continue to struggle, to be solid, to stand shoulder to shoulder.'
Zelal Demir, speaking on behalf of Istanbuld LGBTI Solidarity Association said they were standing in support with their friend.
‘As far as we know, there is no reason for detainment. We have no information about Kıvılcım's condition and where the police keep her,' Demir said.
‘Our friend and comrade Kıvılcım Arat is a human rights defender and recently there is a massive detainment wave against human rights defender[s].
‘She is not alone and we want from the authorities to release her.'
Gay Star News has contacted KaosGL and Istanbul LGBTI Solidarity Association for comment.
Three rockets fired from Gaza fell in Israel's South on Monday evening, just after the Israsel Defense Force's Home Front Command informed local authorities that the threat level was now reduced. One of the rockets, which fell in the coastal region near Ashkelon, led to a brush fire, which firefighters are currently working to extinguish.
The rockets fell four days after coordinated terror attacks in Israels South, which was followed by IAF bombardment of terrorist targets in Gaza, beginning a new cycle of escalating violence. A ceasefire was announced a day ago, and led to the Home Fronts re-evaluation of the terror threat.
Inhabitants of some of the cities and towns that surround Gaza had returned to a sense of normalcy. The malls and shopping centers in Ashdod and Beer Sheva that were empty in recent days were filled with people today.
Finally we have relief and we can leave our houses, we are certain that we will have to return to our reinforced rooms and that we will hear the siren alarm again soon, said Roni from Beer Sheva.
Ashkelon city council decided to hold the Briza Festival after all, and it is expected to begin tomorrow. The decision to hold the festival was made in consultation with the Home Front Command.
The streets of Ashdod were also filled with people Monday. We understand the the ceasefire is temporary, but we finally were are to take the children to the malls today and breathe fresh air after two difficult days in Ashdod, said Galit, a resident of the city.
Even if the ceasefire is temporary, it causes the whole city to reawaken, she added.
A coalition of the inhumane is rising in Europe. A group of political leaders have been meeting this week in Vienna to coordinate how to seal the western Balkan refugee passage. The countries involved, including Macedonia, Croatia and Serbia, don't want to risk hosting thousands of stranded people in their poor societies. They expect that by intentionally causing a humanitarian disaster in Greece they are going to stop the misery of the world getting in their backyard. Only this week Greece pleaded with Macedonia to reopen its border as 4,000 refugees became stranded.
Meanwhile the four Visegrád countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) who have not been not invited to join these discussions, are also at the forefront of this ideological campaign to seal the Balkan route. Their motivation is based on an Islamophobic narrative, as advocated by Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, a self-declared enemy of liberal democracy and consolidator of a Christian front against the Islamisation of Europe.
Refugee arrivals in Greece exceed 100,000 in less than two months Read more
Despite having accepted 90,000 people last year, Austria is the latest country to impose quotas on asylum seekers and send refugees towards Germany. Trying to avoid disaster in the forthcoming election against nationalist Heinz-Christian Strache and his Freedom party, its terrified leadership has moved from social-democratic moderation to rightwing extremism within a few months. Chancellor Faymann has been dwarfed by an emerging nationalist star, the 29-year-old minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, who lobbied hard for the ringfencing of Greece after failing to force the Greek government into pushing back boats in the Aegean sea. The declaration produced after the meeting yesterday branded the refugee crisis an illegal migration issue, cynically ignoring the suffering of hundreds of thousand of people escaping war.
Consider for a minute the “invasion” these leaders are moving against. Figures show 34% of refugees are children, thousands of them unaccompanied. Another 20% are women. The vast majority of these people are families fleeing conflict. Just under half are Syrians escaping Islamic extremism themselves. The refugee influx amounts to less than 0.5% of the European population. This was never an unmanageable problem for the EU: it is an issue only for nation states. But resorting to nationalist fixes is a cheap solution.
Those finding comfort in virulent leaders is set for a huge surprise. The formal declaration of Europe failing to respond collectively to this crisis is about to cause a huge backlash to EU institutions. And the degradation of a system of institutions, no matter how ineffective and despised they may have become, will reverberate into homes. Nationalist hostility between states will mean decades of stable diplomatic relations deteriorate. The slowdown of economic activity throughout the continent will impact on pay packets too. When other problems strike, EU partners won't be a stabilising factor to resort to. Mistrust and dishonesty are going to spread like a disease.
The families trapped out in the cold by conflict and disaster – in pictures Read more
We have reached the point of no return without a plan. Greece cannot go on like this: mostly due to the fact that a sequence of political developments has brought its ineffective government to the largely unwanted place of defending the 1951 Refugee Convention in its desperation for a European solution for the arriving refugees. The UN high commissioner for refugees, visiting Athens this week, committed the UNHCR to increasing its involvement in reception operations in cooperation with the Greek government. He has to deliver on this as soon as possible. The European commission should do the only thing it does well: pick up the bill. It has a lot to lose if it doesn't.
Furthermore, a UN humanitarian evacuation plan (from Turkey and Greece) reaching beyond the EU should be put in place immediately. If EU technocrats and state leaders won't do it in Brussels there is another way. Last week Portugal offered to resettle refugees from Greece. Yesterday, Spanish regional officials reached an agreement for the transfer of a thousand migrants – bypassing the European Union's slow moving relocation system. Smaller scale, decentralised solutions are easier to finance, legally feasible, and they set a precedent.
Democratic communities can do what states have failed to achieve by reacting to the real crisis Europe is facing today: the racist and nationalist backlash throughout the continent. There are a lot of people out there who remember well that the failure of Europe has been blamed on the weak in the past and where this leads. We will fight against it.
Deliveries & Due Dates Survey
In trying to find good numbers for my pregnancy script I ran into a ton of conflicting information, narrow studies, and numbers that were just plain made up. So I decided to create my own survey, which I admit is not terribly scientific, but it's something. You can help out by participating and sending it to your friends. You can even take it more than once, if you've given birth more than once. Or if you're just interested in the results, you can view the results.
All questions in this survey are optional except I must know:
Date you gave birth Either your last menstrual period, due date, or how far along you were (fill in whichever one you remember)
I'm collecting first names mostly so people can contact me (example, if you remember in three days that you filled this out wrong, you can e-mail me and say "change the survey that Sandy took last Thursday!" and I'll know which one you're talking about. Fake it if you want.)
I do request that you only take this survey for births you personally have had, not ones you have just been around for or close to.
All fields may be shared with other researchers or published at some time. In fact I PLAN on sharing the birth story links if you include them, I think it'd be really cool for women to read stories of births that happened at the exact same stage of pregnancy they're at.
The Sacramento Kings have an important decision coming up this summer regarding free agent Rajon Rondo. Previous reports have indicated that the Kings are very interested in keeping the mercurial point guard. In his latest column from the NBA Draft Lottery, ESPN's Zach Lowe dropped a new development:
The latest scuttlebutt is that the Kings are prepared to cut bait with Rajon Rondo if the bidding for him gets beyond a certain threshold that is lower than we might imagine, given the Kings' recent transaction history.
This is a change from what we've heard before, but should come as welcome news. Even the most ardent Rondo supporters should be on board with the idea of keeping him if the price is right, but letting him walk if the price is wrong. The question still remains, though, what exactly is the price the Kings would be comfortable with?
Letting Rondo walk isn't inherently a good or bad move. It depends on the price he fetches, what else the Kings do with the cap space, and how the Kings address the point guard position if Rondo isn't retained. We'll continue to watch the situation, and I'm sure we'll have plenty more updates in the coming months.
A Los Angeles judge Wednesday rejected an initial effort by Charlie Sheen's legal team to keep his lawsuit against Chuck Lorre and Warner Bros. from going into arbitration, but they still desire to see his side of the dispute get the full airing of a public trial.
There's a reason for the strategy: Sheen's suit is focused on Lorre, not the actor's many public proclamations of the past month. It rests significantly on a brash contention that Lorre was actively trying to sabotage production on CBS sitcom “Two and a Half Men.”
Throughout the 30-page filing made March 10 in Los Angeles Superior Court are numerous claims that Lorre had stopped production of scripts for “Men” before Sheen's behavior became an issue, and that Warner Bros. not only accommodated Lorre but conspired with him for financial reasons to make Sheen the scapegoat.

“They did so because of Lorre's significant influence upon them as a result of his role as creator of multiple primetime programs from which Warner Bros. and CBS reap huge profits,” this suit reads. “Lorre is the proverbial ‘800-pound gorilla' as far as WB and CBS are concerned.”
Though they did not comment for this report, the Lorre and WB camps bluntly refute this, placing responsibility for the series' suspension squarely on Sheen.
“Sheen's lawsuit is primarily fiction with regard to the allegations about Chuck Lorre,” said Lorre attorney Howard Weitzman. “To state Mr. Lorre was responsible for undermining production of the show ignores reality. We believe Warner Bros. was completely justified in terminating Mr. Sheen given his intentional and willful conduct.”
Warners and Weitzman have stated that, per the dispute resolution clause in Sheen's contract, the arbitrator will render the verdict.
Among the chief issues in the suit is what happened after Sheen voluntarily entered a rehabilitation program held at his residence beginning Jan. 28. That day, CBS, Warner Bros. and Lorre announced that production was being put on hiatus, saying jointly in a statement that they were “profoundly concerned for his health and well-being and support his decision.”
Subsequently, Sheen declared himself ready to return to work Feb. 14. But, according to Sheen's attorney Marty Singer, the actor was told that no scripts were ready.
Singer notes that during that hiatus, a decision was also made to reduce the 24-episode order for “Men” to 20 and end production of season eight on March 25 instead of the original April 8 date. This was ostensibly in response to Sheen's condition, but Singer emphatically maintains that Sheen was always completely capable of working, and that for no reason should Sheen be held accountable for any reduction in “Men” episodes.
“This is called Spin City,” Singer told Variety last week. “That is a ridiculous concept. Nobody said (at the time) there was a problem with Charlie. All they said was Chuck was going to work (only) another four weeks, and that's it. It's a ridiculous, absurd excuse.”
Singer argued that because the next scheduled production week for “Men” was originally set for Jan. 31, Lorre should have had no problem having a script ready by Feb. 14.
The suit reads, “Lorre had no right to unilaterally discontinue the production of shooting scripts, and thereby interrupt the production schedule.”
Insiders with “Men” and Warner Bros. rebut this argument. They say that scripts were in progress and that one would have been ready for the Jan. 31 return date, but that the suspension of production on Jan. 28 included the series' writers.
Once Sheen went into rehab, Lorre and Warners appear to have had no intention of resuming production on “Men” before Feb. 28 — that just because Sheen decided Feb. 14 was the day did not mean that it was so.
Implicit in WB's reasoning is the belief that two weeks wasn't sufficient rehab and recovery time for Sheen. Though Singer said Sheen was sober, others had concerns about taping based on his condition as well as his appearance. Both sides stipulate that the actor had significant weight loss.
The Sheen lawsuit doesn't directly address the question of why, even if “Men” were beset by “Lorre's inflated ego, laziness and ill-will toward Mr. Sheen and his perceived lifestyle” (as the suit says), it would not have been in the defendants' interest to simply have others on the writing staff finish the scripts when production was active.
For Singer, the larger point remains that from the moment in May that Sheen overcame initial reluctance and signed his contract extension, there was never a time when Sheen wasn't willing to work, and that CBS and Warners pushed him to, even as his behavior raised eyebrows in the tabloids.
That leads into another leading issue of the conflict: whether WB had cause to fire Sheen without pay.
Among other references in its March 7 termination letter, WB cited a clause that can be invoked when Sheen “has committed an act which constitutes a felony offense involving moral turpitude … (or) to the extent such event interferes with performer's ability to fully and completely render all material services,” notwithstanding the fact that the studio had not found cause to dispatch with Sheen when he behaved questionably in the past.
Neither side in this case disputes that there is an arbitration clause in Sheen's contract — in fact, Singer's filing in pursuit of the TRO included that clause verbatim. However, Singer maintains that the current dispute falls outside the scope of that clause.
Warner Bros. cites a clause in the contract saying that even “disputes over … the scope of the agreement under which arbitration is sought … shall be submitted to and ruled on by the arbitrator.”
Singer's filing expresses concern that JAMS no longer can be considered a neutral party, given that it stands to receive a financial benefit from handling the case rather than allowing it to go to court.
In the meantime, Sheen has cemented plans for his live “My Violent Torpedo of Truth” stage tour, scheduled to begin April 2 in Detroit and continue through 16 other cities into May.

"Gun guys: A Road Trip" by Dan Baum
Chuck Leddy is a Boston book critic and a member of the National Book Critics Circle.
BOSTON (CBS) – The three major U.S. domestic airlines have plans for Boston and that will likely mean lower prices for passengers.
American, Delta and United see growth at Logan Airport. Fuel prices remain low, the Massachusetts economy is hot and no one airline dominates the market.
JetBlue ranks number one at Logan in the passenger count but ranks number five on a national count. The airline has been shifting some of its resources from Boston to Fort Lauderdale in Florida.
The latest airline to get ready for growth is United.
Last week, the airline strengthened its management team and recently signed new labor agreements that will mean smoother ground and air operations. United named Scott Kirby as its new president. That move was totally unexpected and took place in a matter of days.
United had been slowed when its CEO Oscar Munoz underwent a heart transplant, its former president was forced out and new directors were appointed. In late August, United caught a big break. It grabbed Kirby from American Airlines.
Kirby had resigned from American when he lost out in a management shakeup. Why he had no non-compete employment contract is anyone's guess. United got a very experienced executive to run day-to-day operations.
American Airlines meanwhile has successfully merged its operations with US Airways and is concentrating its operations on taking delivery of new fuel-efficient aircraft. It has not added new routes from Logan Airport.
Delta Air Lines, which currently ranks third in passenger traffic at Logan, plans major new routes in 2017 that will add more than 10-percent more seats. Operating out of Terminal A, Delta will start daily service to San Francisco, a flight to Nashville and a number of weekend flights to the Caribbean this winter.
Delta suffered a major computer failure last summer that cancelled hundreds of flights, stranded thousands of passengers and cost the airline $100 million in the third quarter.
All three airlines are targeting business travelers who bring in more revenue and are seeking a larger share of all travelers from the low-cost airlines JetBlue and Southwest in Boston.
The passenger count at Logan Airport should show an increase of one million by the end of this year. The numbers may slow next year but the battle for new passengers will increase.
“All Things Travel” reports with Bob Weiss can be heard on WBZ NewsRadio 1030
Presidential candidate Rick Perry called this week's Charleston Church shooting an “accident” in a recent interview — an apparent slip of the tongue, his spokesman said later.
Perry entered the topic by calling President Obama's gun control message in the wake of the South Carolina tragedy, a “knee-jerk reaction,” when prompted by a Newsmax reporter.
“This is the M.O. of this administration, anytime there is a accident like this,” Perry told Steve Malzberg. “You know, the president's clear. He doesn't like for Americans to have guns, and so he uses every opportunity — this being another one — to basically go parrot that message.”
Shortly after Perry's remark became a headline of its own, as well as a trending topic on social media, the politician's press secretary Travis Considine claimed the former governor misspoke. “From the context of his comments, it is clear Gov. Perry meant incident,” Considine said in a statement.

Also on topic, Perry said that he wasn't sure if the shooting was an act of terror, but that it was indeed a “crime of hate.”
He also suggested that confessed shooter, 21-year-old Dylann Roof, may have been “medicated.” One of Perry's platforms is the issue of opioids he alleges are being handed out too easily to ex-military members.
“I know for a fact, being a substantial supporter of our military and our veterans, that the Veterans Administration, for instance, is handing out these opioids in massive amounts,” Perry said. “And then people question, ‘Well then why can't these young individuals get work?' or ‘Why is the suicide rate so high?'”

This isn't the only time Perry has made a public political gaffe while running for the nation's highest office. During the 2012 debate, Perry was unable to remember the third federal agency that he planned to eliminate if elected president.

Roof is accused of killing the nine victims at the historic black Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston on Wednesday night.

DAYTON, Ohio, June 21 (Reuters) - Scott Weidle is struggling with the death of his son Daniel, who died from a heroin overdose 18 months ago, one day after Christmas.
Daniel, who was 30 when he died, was a father of three young boys: Dylan, Landon and Gavin.
"I got the call laying on the beach," Weidle, 58, said. "Worst day of my life."
Weidle, a sand and gravel contractor in Montgomery County, Ohio, said he could never have imagined his son becoming a statistic in the United States' growing opioid crisis.
"I have all kinds of emotions," he said. "One day it's outrage, one day I'm infuriated, and one day I'm in disbelief."
Opioid drugs, including prescription painkillers and heroin, killed more than 33,000 people in the United States in 2015, more than any year on record, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
An estimated 800 people in Montgomery County will die this year from drug overdose, more than double the 370 overdose deaths the county recorded last year, giving it the unfortunate distinction of logging the most overdose deaths in the country per capita, according to the county's coroner's office.
"If we stay on this pace, we could quadruple our deaths from last year," Mike Brem, captain of the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office, said.
Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid pain medication responsible for an epidemic of overdose deaths around the U.S., accounts for a significant number of the county's overdose deaths, Brem said.
Fentanyl is 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. The agency says illegally manufactured non-pharmaceutical fentanyl, and related overdoses, are a rising problem.
In May, the state of Ohio sued five major drug manufacturers, accusing them of misrepresenting the risks of prescription opioid painkillers.
The county morgue is at "full capacity all the time," Ken Betz, director of the coroner's office, said.
"We can average almost 10 bodies per day in our facility where, historically, five bodies a day was a busy day," Betz said. "Our staff is just plain tired.
"We've never experienced this level of daily drug overdoses in my entire career," he added.
Weidle continues to fight on behalf of Daniel, advocating for stricter laws to curb opioid deaths.
"He always loved to put his arm around you, always had a smile on his face," Weidle said.
"People who looked a little desperate, a little down and out ... he would go friend them. It's something I wish I could do." (Reporting by Linda So; Editing by Melissa Fares and Leslie Adler)

3 Pittsburgh Pirates mascot, Pirate the Parrot Claim to infamy: Involved in the baseball drug scandal of 1985 Story: This is why we all go to the ballpark-to eat some hotdogs, watch some baseball and maybe score a little cocaine off the fuzzy mascot between innings. The Pittsburgh drug trials of 1985 opened the country's eyes that maybe, just maybe, ballplayers weren't the milk-drinking, vitamin-taking, All-American boys we thought they were. Among the revelations that came out of the court testimony was that Keith Hernandez revealed nearly 40 percent of major leaguers were using cocaine. Tim Raines even claimed he kept a vial in his uniform pocket, taking care to slide into bases on his stomach so he wouldn't break it. But of all the dirty laundry that aired, nothing tops the image of Pirate the Parrot walking around the ballpark stoned out of his mind, leading the youngsters in Take Me Out to the Ball Game while trying to make an extra buck in the bathrooms selling crank from a satchel tucked into his costume.

2 Dock Ellis Claim to infamy: Pitched a no-hitter while tripping on LSD Story: While playing for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Ellis claimed he dropped acid with friends, only to learn he was scheduled to pitch against the Dodgers that afternoon. Some of us at CRACKED have admittedly done the same at part-time jobs flipping burgers at Wendy's, though at least when we did it, we weren't getting paid six figures and having it nationally televised. We can only imagine what was going through Ellis' mind as he faced each batter. We'd like to think it was similar to the movie The Doors, when the naked Indian was following Val Kilmer around and miming vaguely mystical shit at him. There had to have been dozens of naked Indians in the ballpark that day-some telling him which pitch to throw, others scattered in the outfield shagging fly balls and a few flashing him signs from the dugout. Continue Reading Below Advertisement Despite the no-hitter, Ellis walked eight and hit one batter, allowing nine Dodgers to reach base-making it possibly the sloppiest no-hitter in baseball history. The implications are clear: Naked Indians caused by psychedelic hallucinations don't know shit about pin-point accuracy.
1 Mike Kekich and Fritz Peterson Claim to infamy: Swapped families-wives, kids and dogs Story: Free agency and trades are a part of baseball. But then there's this entry from our Dad of the Year files: In 1972, two New York Yankees pitchers, Fritz Peterson and Mike Kekich, decided to swap their entire families. Kekich got Marilyn Peterson, a couple of kids and a poodle. Peterson came away from the deal with Susan Kekich, a couple of little Kekiches and a terrier. We're trying to imagine how Peterson broke the news to his son that he'd been lost to free agency: "Son, you've been a good son to this family. But daddy needs some strange. And, the hell of the coincidence is your Uncle Mike needs some strange, too. Now, this isn't the end for you, son. You're going to be an excellent son over at the Kekich household, and I expect you to be the same son over there that you were over here." Peterson and the former Mrs. Kekich went on to marry and have four children of their own. Kekich and the former Mrs. Peterson never wed; some trades just don't work out. We assume all four Kekich-Peterson children involved in the swap went on to years of binge drinking and counseling, before acting out their lost childhoods in office shootings and failed relationships of their own. Both dogs are probably dead.

A variety of therapeutic interventions have been applied in the treatment of PTSD, including psychodynamic therapy, cognitive-behavioural therapy, family therapy and group therapy. Regardless of the orientation used, two factors appear to be critical for the success of psychotherapy with PTSD clients: 1) therapy should start soon after the traumatic experience, and 2) therapy should be brief and focused (Schawz & Prout, 1991).
The primary focus of psychodynamic therapy for PTSD is not on the symptoms of the disorder but on the underlying meaning which the trauma carries for the individual. This includes how it affects their views of themselves, others, as well as the external world. It also aims at understanding the basic assumptions which have been overturned by the trauma and the obstacles to psychological integration of the event (Krupnick, 2002). In order to provide clients with the benefits of traditional psychoanalytic therapy without the extensive time commitment necessary for such treatment, brief psychodynamic therapy has been used successfully. Brief trauma focused therapy has received much attention from Horowitz and his colleagues (Horowitz et al., 1997, cited in Krupnick, 2002) who proposed a 12-session treatment model for PTSD. Included in this are four phases: a pre-treatment phase and three treatment phases. The main purpose of the pretreatment phase is to assess the severity of the client's symptoms and to determine if a time-limited approach is the best approach for the individual in question. [showmyads]
The purpose of the initial phase (sessions 1-4) is to establish a therapeutic alliance and a sense of security in the client so that he feels comfortable telling his story. Unlike friends and relatives, the therapist encourages the client to tell and retell his story with as many details as possible and does not get bored or annoyed. The individual therefore comes to understand that he can relate the event without driving away, distressing or overwhelming the self or others. The purpose of this is to encourage catharsis which in itself can be therapeutic. Techniques used in this phase include free association, exploration, clarification and provision of support.
The middle phase of therapy (sessions 5-8) is the working through phase. As symptoms become less pervasive, the therapist takes on a more interpretive role, focusing on the underlying beliefs and attitudes which prevent the individual from integrating the trauma. The therapist addresses any signs of negative self-image which may have resulted from the trauma and helps clients to revise their rigid expectations of self.
In the final phase of therapy (sessions 9-12), the therapist prepares the client for termination and works through the sense of loss which may be reactivated in trauma victims as a result of this. Both client and therapist revise what has been accomplished in therapy and what is left for the client to explore and address after the therapeutic relationship has ended. Long term psychodynamic therapy may be required if the trauma was particularly severe, if the person experienced more than one stressor, if there was a long delay between the appearance of symptoms and the time formal treatment was sought, and if further problems develop following brief psychotherapy.
Despite the usefulness of psychodynamic interventions, cognitive-behavioural therapy has been found to be the most effective psychological treatment for PTSD (Whitney, 2002). It provides a more structured environment than psychodynamic therapy and this in itself proves helpful for victims of severe trauma who may feel as if their lives are out of control. It also produces much quicker results. Two main techniques used in this form of therapy are exposure and cognitive restructuring. As the name suggests, exposure therapy involves gradually exposing clients to thoughts, memories and situations related to the trauma which produce anxiety. This can be done through imaging techniques or by gradually engaging in activities, or approaching places, that trigger anxiety (a technique known as systematic desensitization).
Cognitive restructuring rests on the premise that the way in which one thinks about an event, and not the event itself, results in psychopathology. It involves identifying irrational beliefs relating to the trauma and helping the client to replace them with more rational and positive thoughts, which in turn will result in new emotional and behavioural responses.
As with all forms of treatment, both psychodynamic and cognitive-behavioural therapies have advantages as well as disadvantages. It is up to the client to investigate available treatment options and make an informed decision as to the treatment choice that would be most appropriate. Once a choice has been made, clients must then remain committed to the therapeutic process in order to achieve the best possible outcome.

Laker fans cheered when Lou Williams made a contested 3-pointer just as the shot clock expired in Wednesday's game in Atlanta. Some Hawks fans cheered too, seeing a hometown favorite at his best.
With both fan bases in his corner, Williams shared something with teammate D'Angelo Russell.
“This is my (house)!” Williams boasted before the Lakers' 123-116 victory at Philips Arena.
Despite scoring 16 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter, however, Williams wasn't interested in gloating in the spotlight. He tried to race out of the locker room to see his children, only to have that visit delayed with reporters greeting him.
Those moments sum up Williams. He's averaging 14.6 points on 46.9 percent shooting as the team's starting shooting guard going into Friday's game against the Golden State Warriors (4-1) at Staples Center. Thus far, he's avoided the attention.
“He's more of a natural leader than he realizes,” Lakers coach Luke Walton said. “He's quiet and doesn't always talk. But when he does, everyone listens.”
After one preseason practice, Williams led a team huddle and called for everyone to maintain their hunger level.
He arrives early for practices and games so teammates follow suit. During a recent film session, Walton presented a clip that showed Williams picking up a teammate's defensive assignment because of a switch.
“He has a great voice as far as his opinions,” Russell said. “He voices them and lets you know what's right and wrong and what you can do in a situation. I feel like you're learning when you're playing with him. He does a great job for us.”
Williams is providing leadership without the use of dramatic speeches, saying he mostly has “general conversations” on the plane and in the locker room.
“It's fun to see the development and to see their growth,” Williams said of the Lakers' young core. “Night in and night out, you see something different. You're always encouraged by what they are able to do.”
The Lakers are encouraged by Williams' presence. Forward Nick Young said the team has given Williams the nickname “Mighty Mouse,” since the 6-foot-1, 175-pound Williams plays with confidence. For better and worse, Walton noted Williams takes a high volume of shots because he “always thinks the next one is going in” the basket. On Wednesday, Williams went on a late-game scoring binge that Walton said “bailed us out on a few possessions.”
“Lou does a good job of keeping it pretty level. He has the respect of all of his teammates,” Walton said. “When he speaks up and pulls guys to the side it helps bring the team back to where we need to be.”
INJURY UPDATE
The Lakers listed center Timofey Mozgov as doubtful for Friday's game after team doctors diagnosed him with a soft tissue contusion around his left eye.
Mozgov underwent tests Thursday that came back negative for any fractures or a concussion. He missed Wednesday's win in Atlanta after the results of a CT scan were ruled inconclusive.
The 7-1 Russian was poked in his left eye and suffered a laceration in his mouth during Tuesday's loss in Indiana. Mozgov, who signed as a free agent this summer, is averaging 8.5 points and 6.0 rebounds.
Rookie center Ivica Zubac started in place of Mozgov against Atlanta and matched up with veteran center and former Laker Dwight Howard. Zubac had six points on 3-for-3 shooting, though he also was called for four fouls.

In 1976, for the first time in the English-speaking world, rape in marriage became a criminal offence. Changes were made to the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 of South Australia that made rape within marriage an offence and extended the definition of rape to include penetration of the anus of a man or woman without his or her consent. Current law includes penetration of other parts of the body and covers oral and anal rape. Although, in recent times, the law in relation to rape has changed, many myths and misconceptions are still widely held. For example, victims/survivors do not need to demonstrate physical resistance for the assault to be legally defined as rape, but many people may think that “she didn't fight back, so it couldn't have been rape”, or “he didn't have a weapon so it can't be rape”.
Seventy thousand teachers in the Mexican state of Oaxaca struck May 23, demanding better funding for their students. The strike began with a march from four different points to the city's square, where the educators rallied and then spread out to put pressure on both government and business.
Teachers blockaded government offices and private companies, closed major intersections, and “liberated” the toll booths on the privately owned highway to Mexico City. They also attempted to shut down the airport.
Oaxaca is a stronghold of a longstanding opposition caucus within the teachers union and while the strike is over local issues, it also demonstrates the teachers' opposition to union president Elba Esther Gordillo.
She recently signed a new agreement which will reward educators for teaching to a new national test, which teachers in some areas have protested and refused to administer.
The Oaxaca teachers are making no new wage demands. They insist, however, that the Oaxaca state government install computers in all elementary schools and pay the schools' electric bills. According to union spokespeople utility bills are currently paid by parents.
The state governor claims he's offered about $128 million to settle the dispute, while the union says the offer was only about $59 million. The governor says the state can afford no more and asked the union to keep the strike “as brief as possible.” Strikes in Oaxaca have taken place virtually every year since the mid-1970s and have sometimes lasted for months. Azael Santiago Chepi, a union leader, said the government's offers were “minimal and insufficient.”
In 2006, then-Governor Ulises Ruíz turned out the police to attack striking teachers as they slept in Oaxaca's main square, and many believe that he also created death squads that killed more than 20 teachers and their supporters during protracted strikes and protests.
This month's actions are the strongest since that year's “Oaxaca Rebellion,” when citizens took over radio stations, set up barricades, and created a dual power situation in the city. Ruíz was defeated in a re-election bid last year.
Other teacher locals in Chiapas, Michoacan, Tlaxcala, Guerrero, Baja California Sur, and the Federal District could join the Oaxacan teachers in striking over local and national issues.
New Ed Pact
The Oaxaca strike comes as Mexican President Felipe Calderón signed an agreement May 26 with Gordillo, the teachers union head. The pact is intended to transform Mexican education by rewarding teachers for their students' success in passing national achievement tests.
When students score high, the agreement will reward their teachers with more points on their evaluations. Fifty points out of 100 in teachers' annual evaluations will be based on student achievement.
Until now student stores on the exam represented only 20 points on the evaluation, but now they'll be 40. Teachers receive just 10 points for their years of service.
Teachers whose students score the highest on the test will receive a $1,725 bonus. Some outstanding teachers will be rewarded with houses.
President Calderón and union leader Gordillo say the changes will modernize Mexico's school system, improve education for students, and provide a fairer career path for teachers.
Rank-and-File Dissent
The teachers opposition caucus rejected the national achievement test, the new teacher evaluation system, and the broader education overhaul that Calderon has argued for since his term began in 2006. The teachers say test-driven education is bad for both students and teachers, and that linking bonuses and prizes to test scores will encourage fraud.
Gordillo, an ally of Calderón, was elected at meetings that violated the union's statutes. Oppositionists argue she has no standing to negotiate a pact on behalf of the teachers, but the government refuses to act on dissident demands to investigate and remove her.
The test measures students' “acceptance and adaptation to the system,” said Sergio Espinal, leader of the opposition caucus, at a press conference. “It is the final point in the application and justification of business discourse. It measures their familiarity and competence in the market.”
Another opposition caucus founder and leader, José González Figueroa, said that instead of spending resources for these programs, money should go to “resolve the chaos in Mexico's education system, and to open school breakfast centers for students, and to repair the schools.”
The caucus represents a majority of teachers in several states, and leaders promised to demonstrate in Mexico City and elsewhere as they build toward a general strike by teachers against the new testing scheme.

During the conversation the 31 year old admitted that he found it strange that there were people in Spain who still harked for the days of the dictatorship and revealed that he was surprised that Donald Trump won the US election but admitted that people were tired with the current state of affairs.
"I enjoyed football until I played at Real Madrid"
The Madrid born player admitted that he was blessed to have made a career in the game of football.
"For me at an early age, football was fun but that all changed when I joined Real Madrid at the age of 11. At that time there were about 300 kids eager to progress but sadly over 85% of them never made it. "I saw much heartbreak as all the young lads wanted to make the grade" the player affirmed.

What changes when there are more women in government? Probably a lot more than you think.
Yes, a woman hasn't yet been elected president. But in 2017, there are a record 21 women serving in the US Senate, with 83 more in the House of Representatives. Women make up nearly 25 percent of state legislators, according to Rutgers' Eagleton Institute of Politics.
Women's representation in politics is growing slowly, but it's growing. And as more and more women start to occupy all levels of government, we should expect them to govern differently.
Related How I came to realize that a woman president would be a huge deal
Political science research has found this over and over again: Women legislators are more likely to introduce legislation that specifically benefits women. They're better at bringing funding back to their home districts. And, to put it bluntly, they just get more shit done: A woman legislator, on average, passed twice as many bills as a male legislator in one recent session of Congress.
Women bring a different background to Congress. They face different obstacles to success — and sometimes more obstacles to winning office. That shapes how they govern and what issues they choose to focus their time on.
There is, obviously, no research on women presidents in the United States. But political scientists think their findings about Congress would apply to a woman president as well because of the shared experience and obstacles that all women politicians face.
Women legislators sponsor more bills, pass more laws, and send their districts more money
Congress has become increasingly female over the past three decades. In 1991 there were 33 women legislators. Today there are 104. While that's far from gender parity — men still outnumber women four to one in Congress — it is already true that having more women in Congress has changed the way the legislative body works.
Michele Swers, a political scientist at Georgetown University, has written multiple books examining how this shifting gender balance has changed the body. Her research consistently finds that women in Congress tend to shift the conversation to focus more on bills and policies that relate to women specifically — such as increasing paid leave or prosecuting violence against women.
One of her papers looked at Congress in the mid-1990s, comparing male and female legislators of similar ideologies. She found that liberal female legislators co-sponsored an average of 10.6 bills related to women's health — an average of 5.3 more than their liberal male colleagues.
Women in Congress pass, on average, twice as many bills as their male colleagues
Changing the conversation can have an effect on the laws that Congress eventually passes: One recent study of Congress since 2009 found that the average female legislator had 2.31 of her bills enacted, compared with men, who turned 1.57 bills into law.
"Women in Congress are just more likely to prioritize issues that have a direct connection to women — violence against women, family leave policy, this kind of things," Swers says. "The more you can directly connect the consequence to women, the more you see female legislators getting involved."
The "Jill Robinson theory" of high-achieving, women Congress members
Another way legislators serve their constituents is by bringing programs and money to their districts — securing more money to start a pre-K program, for example, or dollars to repave local roads.
All told, Congress allocated $20.8 trillion in federal outlays (excluding defense and military spending) from 1984 to 2004. Women, it turns out, did a better job at getting their share of that money. On average, female legislators sent 9 percent more funds back to their districts than their male colleagues. Districts represented by women received an additional $49 million annually on average compared to their male-represented counterparts.
Sarah Anzia, the author of this study, argues that this might reflect something particular about the type of women who run for Congress. Multiple studies have found that women underestimate their qualifications for office compared to men. When you look at a comparable group of lawyers, business leaders, and others likely to run for office, the men are significantly more likely to say that they'd make a good politician.
"One of the common jokes in this field is that every day, there are a million men who wake up in the morning, look in the mirror, and say 'I'd be a great congressman,'" says Heidi Hartmann, an economist who runs the Institute for Women's Policy Research. "And there aren't that many women who do that."
As such, Anzia hypothesizes that the women who do assess their qualifications positively are those who are actually overqualified for the job.
"If women … underestimate their qualifications for office, then only the most qualified, politically ambitious females will emerge as candidates," Anzia writes. "The women who are elected to office will perform better, on average, than their male counterparts."
Anzia dubs this the "Jill Robinson effect" after Jackie Robinson, the first black baseball player who was also heralded as one of the top talents in the game. "Robinson had to be better than almost any white player in order to overcome the prejudice of owners, players, and fans," Anzia writes.
Women still face hurdles to running for office
Women politicians don't face the same hurdles as Robinson did — but there are still obstacles that impede women's ability to pursue office. Gender norms, for example, shape the responsibilities that women have outside the office. Potential women candidates are 15 times more likely to be responsible for the child care in their homes — and six times more likely to shoulder the majority of housework.
Women are also much less likely to have others encourage them to run for office — whether that's a party official or even a friend in passing conversation.
With these obstacles — and with the 2016 campaign still a vivid memory — it can be hard to imagine when a woman will next decide to run for president, or when one will be able to win.
Maybe the woman who finally is elected to the presidency won't fit the patterns that researchers have found among woman legislators. It is true that women politicians running for any position do bring their own perspective into office. That could shape the type of policies one might pursue in the White House or Congress. At the same time, presidents are subject to significantly more competing interests than members of Congress — and have a much larger staff shaping their policy agenda. That could make a woman president look less like a woman Congress member.
But what we know, at this point, about elected female officials is this: Their experience shapes how they govern. And the success of women who do serve in Congress can reflect not just their skill as legislators but also their skill to get there in the first place.

Day One: Horizontal Is Your Friend
On my first morning at TrueNorth Health Center, the only medically supervised water-fasting clinic in America, a Dr. Michael Klaper shows up to check my vitals. He is tall and lean, with white hair and the glowing young face of the little brother I never had. He is either 75 years old and absurdly youthful or 30 with a case of premature white hair. A hunger artist? I want to see health and wellness on these premises, impossibly fit bodies with a blinding glow. Something post-human, to prove that fasting works. Dr. Klaper will do fine. He makes me think I can fast my way back to childhood. Maybe infancy. I could return home a smooth, cooing baby and see if my wife will still have me.
It's the first day of my six-day fast at TrueNorth, an anonymous-looking cluster of buildings on a quiet street in Santa Rosa, California. Water fast is not a juice fast or a honey-lemon-cayenne fast or any of the body-hacking protocols or superfood regimens, sometimes rich in calories, that are mistakenly called fasting, however cleansing they might be. This is hard-core, a diet of nothing, a full-body reboot. Dr. Klaper and his colleagues tout their regimen as a potent balm for not only weight and digestive problems but a litany of ailments that plague mankind. Detractors, including my wife, liken fasting to starvation, because without food we turn into ashen little wastrels, crying for help in tiny voices. Right?
Dr. Klaper tells me the rules. No leaving the grounds. I might get confused, or I might fall down. It turns out you get dizzy without food. Horizontal is your friend, the doctor advises me. Also, no toothpaste, no lotions or creams. And no showering. Not because they want me dirty, but, again, because I might slip and fall down.
Dr. Klaper takes my pulse and pronounces it lovely. He thumps my chest, sounding the cavity, and says my heart is normal-size. I shudder at either alternative.
A technician draws my blood. They're testing lipids, vitamin D, inflammation markers. I ask if they'll test for allergies, because I've always suspected I'm allergic to animals, plants, people, maybe even myself.
They can do that, Dr. Klaper says, but after hearing my description of the nose faucet I wake to every day, and the leaky, bloodshot eyes, he smiles and tells me not to bother with a test. Those symptoms will be gone after my fast.
I like this man.
The good doctor dismisses me, and I stroll outside to sit in the sunshine, waiting for hunger, watching the other fasters come and go. Some are here not to fast but to eat clean for a while, to see the doctors and maybe get some treatments. But the water fasters stand out, because they cling to the wall when they walk. They take the stairs slowly.
Watch Now:
You're Doing It Wrong: The Hair Part
TrueNorth lacks the whorehouse comforts of a spa. There isn't even a pool, which seems to violate some central tenet of California apartment complexes. It feels more like a scientific-research center. There are daily lectures and cooking demos, and the guest rooms are stocked with DVDs of slightly NSFW health documentaries. Today at the clinic they showed a grim video called The Pleasure Trap, an unflinching lecture on why we eat, and eat, and fucking eat, what isn't good for us. Salt, sugar, and fat, combined with chemicals in processed foods, trick the brain in the same way as cocaine, and the brain flushes our bodies with dopamine, perhaps the most blissful, and addictive, homemade chemical we have. Once we find a way to trigger it, we kill ourselves to get more. Literally.
Around 850,000 Canadians cast their ballots on just the first day of advance polls on Friday, according to Elections Canada.
This represents a 26% increase from the first day of advance polls during the federal election of 2011 and a 90% increase over 2008.
Another 780,000 people cast their ballots on Saturday, bringing the two-day total to 1.6 million, a 34% increase over the first two days in 2011.
While some polling stations saw long line ups, those casting their ballots at a station in the Edmonton Sun building, 4990 92 Avenue, on Sunday afternoon said the process was quick and hassle free.
“It's handy,” said Emilia Quibell, who used the advance poll for the first time as she is undergoing surgery that would have made it difficult to cast her vote on election day on Oct. 19.
She seized thanksgiving dinner as an opportunity to have her son Grant Quibell take her to cast her ballot before they settle in for their family meal.
“It only took a few minutes, and we're done,” said Grant, who chose to wait until election day to vote.
Emilia said she wasn't willing to let surgery interfere with performing her civic duty, laughing, “you can't complain if you don't vote.”
Kathy Gallagher said elections have always been a family affair and the advance polls allow her, her husband and two sons to coordinate their schedules and vote together.
“So many countries, people have to fight so hard just to get the right [to vote], so we shouldn't vote because it is just too important,” said Gallagher.
Athena Ng said she has taken advantage of the advance polls many times before as a way to avoid the line ups and traffic jams of election day.
“It's our right, it's our privilege to do it,” she said.
For those unable to make it to the ballot box on Oct. 19, the advance polls are open Thanksgiving Monday from noon to 8 p.m.
Voters can also cast a ballot at Elections Canada Offices until Tuesday, Oct. 13 at 6 p.m. Those unable to get to a polling station can apply to vote by mail before Tuesday at 6 p.m.

Last Wednesday, the Golden State Warriors beat the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 3 of the 2017 NBA Finals. By doing so, they unlocked a special offer from Taco Bell: Steal a Game, Steal a Taco. Because the Warriors stole a road win, everyone gets to steal a taco from Taco Bell on Tuesday, June 13th.
In order to take advantage of this limited time offer, all you have to do is head to your nearest Taco Bell and ask for a free Doritos Locos Taco between 2:00 PM – 6:00 PM local time. Every customer is entitled to one free taco, and the rules state that “restaurant managers reserve the right to deny Free Taco to any person they reasonably believe has already received a Taco,” so don't press your luck.
On the other hand, if you live in an area with a bunch of Taco Bell restaurants, you can spend the next four hours hitting up all of them to score a bunch of free Doritos Locos Tacos. Just be sure to hide the bags and wrappers before you show up at the next Taco Bell. Don't want to get caught.
Oh, and for those of you curious about what ended up happening in the NBA Finals, the Cavaliers took Game 4 but the Warriors won it all in Game 5. That's the third year in a row these teams have faced off in the Finals, alternating championships every year. Whoever ends up going to the NBA Finals in 2018, let's hope that one of them manages to steal a game on the road so we can get more free tacos.
Story highlights "I'm not aware of what that would be," Sanders said
It's the 5th anniversary of the massacre
Washington (CNN) Five years after a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, the White House downplayed efforts to prevent mass shootings, insisting there was no single solution to increasingly deadly violence.
"I'm not aware of what that would be," Sanders said during a daily news briefing. "But we want to look for every opportunity, every way possible, that we can to protect American lives. And we are going to continue doing that."
Gun control groups and Democrats maintain that a ban on so-called assault weapons and tighter controls on background checks could prevent deadly weapons being used to massacre Americans. Efforts to pass those items through Congress have failed, however.
Pressed on efforts underway within the administration to curb gun violence, Sanders cast doubt on the efficacy of legislation that would make it harder to obtain firearms.

LRT television reports that a five-party treaty was concluded in 2001 among the Baltic states, Russia and Belarus (the so-called BRELL ring), which might entitle the latter two countries to demand compensation from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia for leaving the electricity network of the former Soviet Union.
With two major electricity links due to be finished this year, the Baltic states hope to soon become part of the EU energy network, allowing them to import electricity via power connections with Sweden and Poland.
However, Russian President Vladimir Putin has recently claimed such a move would be very unwise economically and might cost billions. In an interview to La Serra newspaper last June he said that the Baltic withdrawal from the Russia-dominated electricity market might cost Moscow up to EUR 2.5bn.
Gediminas Kirkilas, chairman of the European Affairs Committee at the Lithuanian parliament, told LRT that Brussels was indeed considering reimbursing Moscow for its losses.
"Yes, there are talks to that effect, there has even been a study which quotes slightly lower figures than the one mentioned by the current president of Russia. We are talking about a billion euros. I would not rule out the possibility that the EU might try to convince us to pay compensation for our withdrawal," Kirkilas said.
The BRELL treaty, signed in 2001 under the government of the then conservative Prime Minister Rolandas Paksas, regulated electricity supply among the Baltic states, Russia and Belarus. It includes a clause saying that should any of the parties wish to quit, the others are entitled to compensation for any losses they might incur.
According to LRT, Russia and Belarus might claim compensation from the Baltic states for the cost of building power lines and other infrastructure to ensure reliability of their power supply.

Earlier today, we brought you Tim Schafer's explanation for Spacebase DF-9's unexpected transition from early access to v1.0 release, and why planned features have been lost in the process. The short version is that the game stopped selling enough Early Access copies to keep supporting development at the scale Double Fine was hoping for, so it had to adjust its plans. In light of this, several other developers with Early Access games have made public statements regarding their projects, and Early Access in general. Here's what they had to say:
"Alpha Funded / Early Access is not an 'alternative' development approach. It has a very specific use for a very specific set of games," said Andy Hodgetts of Project Zomboid developer The Indie Stone. "So what is very clear to me, is if you can't guarantee this from the outset then Alpha-Funding / Early Access is not for you. It's too risky and were it just your own reputation on the line, that'd be fine. But failures tarnish the reputation of the entire model, so a failure (particularly a high-profile failure) is potentially damaging to the very developers who need this model the most."
Meanwhile, a 'health check' statement on the Chucklefish blog notes that recent troubles at other developers means: "It's not the best time to be a part of the early access party and it's easy to see why people are worried about the health of the Starbound project." However, it goes on to note that the game's future is completely secure:
"Not only is the development of Starbound extremely healthy. (More so than it's ever been in fact, with more team members than ever and all of us in the same location), but Chucklefish could fund the development of Starbound for another 9 years at least. Even if we didn't make another penny in that time."
Elsewhere, Maia developer Simon Roth shared some hard numbers. He said that, over its lifetime, Maia has averaged $1,515 a day, though that number is massively skewed by the attention it got around launch. During a month without significant updates, it makes closer to half that amount.
"At our current burn rate, running off cash reserves, with no further sales of the game, development can easily continue for about five years," Roth said . "That said, current development has a few bottlenecks I would like to hammer out of the pipeline, which will push up costs by a few thousand."
It's interesting to see that it's these smaller devs that have the financial safety to net to keep development going even if sales drop, but it also makes sense. As Hodgetts pointed out, unlike Double Fine, they have much smaller teams that don't work out of San Francisco, where the average employee costs $10,000 per month .

House Republicans will not negotiate over the Senate's immigration reform bill, Speaker John Boehner said, dealing another blow to the chances of an overhaul being signed into law this year.
“Frankly, I'll make clear, we have no intention of ever going to conference on the Senate bill,” Boehner told reporters Wednesday morning.

The remarks are a major setback for immigration reform advocates. Many proponents of reform thought that if the House passed small-bore, tightly-focused immigration bills, it would create a pathway for a formal negotiation with the Senate's bill. But conservatives have balked at entering into negotiations, because they fear ending up with a bill that is dominated by the Senate's priorities.

House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told immigration activists last week in Bakersfield, Calif., that there would be no immigration legislation on the floor this year.
Republican leaders are struggling to figure out how to move forward on immigration reform — a policy that that stirs deep emotions from the right but could serve to expand the party's popularity with minorities. Boehner said Wednesday that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) was writing a list of principles intended to guide the party on how to enact immigration reform.
Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), a chief architect of the Senate legislation, indicated that he still believed immigration reform will happen, and that Republicans would need to court Democrats in order to pass any overhaul bills.
“They cannot possibly end this Congress only having passed legislation to deport all of the Dream Act kids,” Schumer said, referring to a House vote in June to defund an Obama administration program that defers deportations of young undocumented immigrants.

And Boehner's comments peeved some in his own party who have been actively drafting immigration reform bills. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) said Wednesday that Boehner should reconsider ruling out a potential conference on immigration.
“I urge Speaker Boehner to remain open to any options that allow us to solve this crucial issue,” he said. “It has been said time and time again that our immigration system is broken, and we must come together to find a sensible solution to fix it.”
Before Boehner spoke at the press conference, he was accosted by a pair of young immigration advocates on Wednesday morning at Pete's Diner — the Hill fixture where Boehner is a regular for breakfast. The speaker indicated to them that he is still working on getting reform bills through the House.
The two teenage girls who approached Boehner told him personal stories about how U.S. immigration laws affected their families, with one – Carmen Lima – telling Boehner about her father who was deported.

“How would you feel if you had to tell your kids at the age of ten that you were never coming home?” Carmen, who is from California, asked Boehner, according to a transcript provided by Fair Immigration Reform Movement, a pro-reform coalition. Jennifer Martinez, a 16-year-old from Washington, shared a similar story with Boehner.
“That wouldn't be good,” Boehner responded.
Boehner told the girls that he is “trying to find some way to get this thing done.”
“It's, uh, you know, not easy — not gonna be an easy path forward,” he said. “But I've made it clear since the day after the election that it's time to get this done.”
Lima, 13, then asked whether they could count of Boehner's vote for immigration reform, and Boehner responded that he “will try to find a way to move the bill forward.”
Michael Steel, a Boehner spokesman, said the speaker was referring to his “step-by-step” approach to immigration reform, which means taking up reform with a collection of bills, not a sweeping comprehensive bill like the Senate passed in June. Boehner reiterated that position at the press conference.
“Just understand something: I want us to deal with this issue,” he said. “But I want to deal with it in a common-sense, step-by-step way.”
Homo neanderthalensis is a hominin that most of you would be familiar with. Palaeoanthropologists are busy, repairing the tarnished reputation of this once dominant creature.
It was arguably the best equipped species of human to tackle the harsh environmental conditions of most west Eurasia for nearly 400,000 years. It used the Mousterian stone tool industry to cope with the tundra conditions. This technocomplex is made up of flakes, for the most part, produced using a technique called Levallois. This used the structure of stone to its advantage to produce a near symmetrical flake, usually large a bulky.
It got its name from the Parisienne suburb of Lavallois-Perret, where a lot of these flakes were found in the 19th century. This a prepared core technology, involving the knapping of flakes around the core and the creation of a key striking platform, which, when struck will produce a flake with a noticeable plano-convex profile. Retouch can then be conducted on the newly created flake. Levallois can be found throughout Europe and in the Levant. Initial hypotheses pointed to this technocomplex being associated with a group of humans, a culture. This however has not been supported by the evidence and such a hypothesis has been laid to rest since the early 1990's.
Palaeoanthropology and prehistoric archaeology are ever changing fields, quite dynamic, evident in the hypotheses that come and go in light of new research. The latest paper on the Levallois technocomplex aimed to date the stratigraphic layer in which the stone tools were found. The dating technique used, optically stimulated luminescence or OSL, for short, examines the wavelength of light given off by the defects within the lattice structure of the rock being tested.
Basically, the number of electrons determines the wavelength of light, so for example the sodium has 11 electrons contained within three shells. The exciting stuff begins here. Using green, blue or infrared lighting, the electrons are excited (photoexcitation), resulting in the emission of light. This light is detected by the machine and calculated to determine the age of the rock.
Take a flint flake, it is knapped and is eventually discarded on a campsite fire. Over thousands of years burial runs its course, until palaeoanthropologists or geologists find it. Care must be taken to seal the artefact in appropriate opaque bags to prevent sun radiation from interfering with the electrons in the mineral structure. What we are dating here is the last time the mineral was exposed to 400o of heat and in order to do that we need to assess the extent of radiation damage within the structure. The rock absorbs the radiation and throughout its burial, the radioactive materials within damage the rock, leaving unstable electrons and it is these that are excited. The stronger the signal the older the rock.
There are some major problems with this and one rather massive problem is assumption. Not something you particularly want in scientific analysis, but when there is little else to date more difficult archaeological sites, we use what we can. We assume the mineral has been exposed to enough sun radiation. If there is not enough exposure of the stone tool to adequate sunlight, the clock is not reset and we would be dating the previous time it was exposed to large volumes of radiation. The Lake Mungo skeleton was dated using OSL. Enough, what about this new mousterian site?
We are in Nesher Ramla, Israel, an open-air site located in an interesting geological landscape, which has presented archaeologists with a rather special treasure trove of zooarchaeological and lithic deposits. The karstic landscape in which this site is situated, has numerous depressions characteristic of chemically eroded carbonate rocks. An 8m thick depression at the site revealed a collection of stone tools and animal remains. While the team of scientists says something about the lithics and their accompanying animal remains, the aim of the paper involves the need to firmly date the remains.
The bottom of the 8m sequence was dated to 170,000 years ago. If you are not well up on your prehistoric Levantine archaeology, that makes Nesher Ramla the oldest Middle Palaeolithic site in this part of the world. The site was occupied by Homo neanderthalensis for about 30,000 years on a regular basis, with the remaining 40,000 years seeing much less activity. How do we know this? Well, increase in the presence of artefacts, coupled with the manuport and bone concentration lends some support to such a hypothesis. So what can we say about the stone tools. Well quite a lot actually, thanks to the 81,000 strong assemblage recovered. As mentioned earlier there is more intensive activity the further back in time you go and this is evident from the intensity of lithics, increasing from 20 artefacts per 10 cm to 300 artefacts (in some places) per 10 cm.
The most common method of flaking at the site is Levallois, exhibiting short, squat flakes, unlike those laminar and longer Levallois flakes of other European sites. Retouch is a notable feature of the Nesher Ramla Flakes, with the odd discarded side scraper rejuvenated (reused) using retouching processes. Until the publication of this article there were no Levantine Mousterian sites with rejuvenation activities, making Homo neanderthalensis (if indeed it is that species that occupied Nesher in the later part of the sites history) more Homo sapien-like. As we reach the 100,000 year mark, the stone tool kit has changed remarkably (in the context of the small size of the assemblage), with an intensity of denticulates and irregularly retouched flakes.
The stone tools of trench three were analysed with a total assemblage number of 4224 artefacts in that one trench. More analysis has yet to be conducted and could reveal more about the nature of the Nesher Ramla assemblage. The manuports included ochre, small amounts of it, scattered throughout the sequence. This makes it the third Levantine site including the famous caves of Skhul and Qafzeh to possess ochre chunks. Little more can be said for these. The faunal remains tell us a great deal and appear to bust a few myths about the animals we might expect at cave sites or open-air sites. Let's get into the myths, first. A Levantine cave will usually produce gazelles or deer, small ungulates in general. Open-air sites usually produce aurochs remains usually in small numbers. Nesher Ramla produce an unexpected and enormous amount of faunal remains (similar to the quantity you might expect at a cave site), but unsurprisingly dominated by Aurochs.
Based upon the unbutchered fauna, the complete bones, presence of Aurochs and the standard nature of the stone tool kit, the palaeoanthropologists suggest that the site was an initial processing site, where some consumption did take place. But the team wish to put this hypothesis through further testing. The site saw extensive activity over its 70,000 year use. For whatever reason it lost its importance about 100,000 years ago. The site is very intriguing and boasts a few interesting twists in our understanding of Levantine Middle Palaeolithic open-air sites. The site does not follow the norm as far as the faunal assemblage is concerned, the stone tools change over time in form, but did not follow the classic Levallois knapping technique of the Mousterian technocomplex, Nesher Ramla is the third site to possess ochre chunks and it is the oldest Levantine Middle Palaeolithic site known (provided you are happy with OSL Dating).

Dozens of people reported seeing a bright meteor streaking across the sky in New Hampshire Wednesday night.Click to watch News 9's coverage.People reported seeing the meteor in Campton, Salem, Hooksett, Lebanon, Hampstead, Milton and Ashuelot. Some even managed to catch it on camera or video, including a Northfield police officer who caught it on his cruiser's dashcam.View the video of the meteor in Northfield."I was just driving down Park Street, and all of a sudden, there was a big, bright light in the sky right in front of me," Officer Aaron Chapple said. "It looked like a meteor streaking across the sky."Chapple said it appeared to last eight to nine seconds."It was a large, bright, whitish-blue ball moving through the sky with a small tail behind it," he said. "I hit my cruiser camera to reactivate the camera so it would back-record the meteor, and it showed up on the video."That video was shown at Plymouth State University during an astronomy class. Several students said they also spotted it."I was on my bike, and I got off, and I thought, 'Did that just land here?'" student Maxwell Goddard said. "I biked off to see because it looked so close, until I realized, no. That must have actually just been huge."Professor Tom Morin discussed the video in class and took a closer look at it."When we are looking at this, look at how bright it gets. Then it's going to dim off," he said. "The idea that it's blue and it happened so quickly, I would say it's most likely that a meteor did that."Morin said meteors are common. They're fragments left by comets or asteroids that begin to burn up when they hit the atmosphere."And when it hits the atmosphere, it gets very bright, and then it blows up like a shotgun," he said. "At the angle that it came in, I think it was a little steeper, so I don't think anything made it to the ground."Morin said he will look into whether any part of the meteor made it to the ground.Anyone with photos of the meteor is asked to share them by emailing them to NewsPics@WMUR.com.Get the WMUR app12967056
This image provided by the Virginia State Police shows Lawrence Alan Stewart II. (Photo: Va. State Police/AP) Story Highlights Stewart was wanted on charges of detonating pipe bombs in Va.
He led police on a chase across the Montana plains
Stewart threw multiple bombs at the officers behind him
HELENA, Mont. (AP) — A man wanted on charges of detonating pipe bombs in Virginia led police on a chase across the Montana plains Thursday during which he threw several bombs at his pursuers before he was captured, authorities said.
The chase began after a trooper with the Montana Highway Patrol pulled over Laurence Alan Stewart II for speeding, said Bradley Beyersdorf, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
Stewart stopped at first, then sped off. Deputies from the Cascade County sheriff's office and a helicopter joined in the pursuit, which began in Judith Basin County and then headed toward Great Falls on U.S. Highway 87.
Along the way, Stewart threw multiple bombs at the officers behind him, Beyersdorf said. Some of the bombs detonated, but there were no injuries during the pursuit.
The chase went on for about 40 miles before the officers disabled the car, but Beyersdorf did not know how. Stewart fled the vehicle with a handgun but was taken into custody.
One Cascade County sheriff's deputy pulled a muscle during the foot chase, the Great Falls Tribune reported.
"This was an individual that was very dangerous. He showed that capacity in Virginia and continued that today in Montana," Beyersdorf said.
It was not clear how Stewart came to be in Montana.
The highway patrol closed portions of U.S. 87 southeast of Great Falls. Beyersdorf said there may be more explosives in the car, and ATF personnel and a sniffer dog were headed to the scene.
Stewart, 25, is suspected of detonating pipe bombs in the homes of his ex-girlfriend and two investigators handling an indecent exposure case that involves him. Authorities said he is accused of exposing himself to two people while sitting in his car in North Stafford in July and August.
Nobody was injured in the explosions Tuesday in Stafford County and Fredericksburg. Authorities said the detective and deputy sheriff involved in that case were those targeted by the explosives, as was his ex-girlfriend.
Stewart faces charges in Virginia that include attempted capital murder of a law enforcement officer, manufacture or possession of a weapon of terror, and arson.
Stewart also faces three counts of attempted deliberate homicide for allegedly throwing pipe bombs near patrol cars and one count of felony criminal endangerment for a pipe bomb thrown near a civilian's car, the Tribune reported.
It was not immediately clear whether Stewart had an attorney.

Cedrick Argueta, a senior at Abraham Lincoln High School in Lincoln Heights, was one of only 12 students in the world to earn a perfect score on the exam.
The 17-year-old was among 302,532 students to take the Advanced Placement Calculus AB exam, which tests the fundamental theories of calculus in a series of multiple-choice and free-response problems, according to a news release from the Los Angeles Unified School District.
Cedrick, whose mom is a nurse and dad is a maintenance worker at a convalescent home, said he spent hours studying for the exam.
“Leading up to the exam we spent about two or three hours every day after school,” he said.
Cedrick also earned perfect scores on the English and math sections of the ACT college-entrance exam, the district said.
“It's amazing. I'm so, so proud of him,” his mother said.
Cedrick's ultimate goal is to study at Caltech and one day work at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
Journalist Lena Klimova helped create Deti-404, a Web site where gay and lesbian teenagers can share their stories. Deti means children and 404 refers to “page not found” on Internet searches. (Natalia Korelina)
Like other gay teenagers here, Maxim Moiseyev grappled with his identity alone, frightened and uninformed. Adults either ignored him or admonished him. Classmates reviled him. And a new law that prohibits minors from hearing anything positive about homosexuality has only made life harder.
Maxim, a 16-year-old Muscovite, is among the few Russian teenagers who dare to openly identify as gay. He first did so at age 13, when he had nothing more to lose. His mother had just died. She had been found beaten and drowned in a pond. His parents had divorced when he was 3, and he went to live with his grandmother.
“I changed,” said Maxim, a dark-haired boy with an earnest expression. “I was afraid when I was younger, but when my mom died, I opened up. I didn't care when people called me dirty names.”
Maxim said he never felt attracted to girls. When he was 10, he said, he told another boy that he loved him. The boy laughed him off. “Are you crazy, or what?” he said. Maxim kept his feelings to himself after that, but when he was 12, his uncle got a computer. Maxim went online and searched for: “What does it mean if a boy likes a boy?”
The search produced a trove of nastiness, but amid the homophobic comments, he found definitions of gay and lesbian. “I printed that out,” he said, “and thinking about myself, I decided I should be called gay. Of course, I didn't say a word to anyone.”
Now, it's even more difficult and dangerous for teenagers to get information. The new law makes it illegal to tell minors that “traditional” and “non-traditional” sexual relations are socially equal. Its prohibition on giving minors gay “propaganda” is so vague that most people assume they can't mention the word “homosexuality” in front of minors.
Lawmakers said they wanted to protect children. “Homosexuality is a sexual perversion which is unnatural and contradicts human nature,” said Duma deputy Tatiana Yakovleva, a member of the ruling United Russia party. The law is so broad that it has been interpreted as prohibiting gay pride parades — a minor might see one. Frightened teachers are silent.
President Vladimir Putin signed the national law July 1. Even before that, four cities had passed their own versions. Earlier this year, Lena Klimova, a 25-year-old Internet journalist from Yekaterinburg, wrote an article about the debate, challenging the assertions that homosexuality is a perversion.
A 15-year-old girl wrote to Klimova in March, saying the article had saved her life.
The student said she had been sitting in biology class when a pack of girls started to hiss at her. “Lesbian,” they taunted, “lesbian.”
A teachable moment? Not here. When the distraught victim told the bullying girls to shut up, the teacher ordered her out of the classroom. When her mother asked her why she had gotten home early, the girl broke down in tears and told her everything. She was a lesbian and had been together with her girlfriend, Vera, for a year.
“So my mom started to yell at me,” the girl told Klimova, “and said that everybody had normal children, and I am not normal, a pervert. She was yelling that she would lock me in my room and would never let me see Vera again.”
The girl said she was in despair, feeling there was no way she could go on living, but when she happened to find Klimova's article, she realized that she was neither abnormal nor alone.
“No one in Russia has ever looked at LGBT teenagers and their situation,” Klimova said.
‘A very difficult life'
That incident led to the creation of Deti-404, pages on Facebook and a similar Russian site called Vkontakte where teenagers can share their stories. Deti means children and 404 refers to “page not found” on Internet searches.
“They have a very difficult life,” Klimova said. “They're afraid to go to school psychologists because if they do, the psychologists call the parents and there are scenes and quarrels at home. Some parents ban their children from talking about it. They take away their cellphones and order them to stay away from their girlfriend or boyfriend. They threaten to send their kids to psychiatric hospitals, and sometimes do.”
While the law has done damage, Klimova said, it has also made her and others speak up. “I don't want to live in a country where a particular group is persecuted,” she said.
Ivan Simochkin, a freelance Web site designer in Moscow, helped Klimova develop Deti-404, refusing to worry about whether he could be accused of breaking the law. Fines for violating the law begin at $125, but those who break it using the Internet can be fined up to $3,000.
Simochkin, who began supporting gay rights when a friend opened his eyes to the widespread discrimination, worries that teachers have been put in an impossible situation. “Homophobes have been given the signal that it's okay to persecute gays,” he said, “and those who might help them are afraid to do so.”
All LGBT teenagers share two big problems here, Klimova said: isolation and parents who can't accept them. Deti-404 has already helped with the first, she said, but transforming parents will take years. “You have to change the whole society,” she said.
Persistent attitudes
Maxim has been an enthusiastic contributor to Deti-404. “I decided I should be an activist,” he said. “I want to explain to people who don't understand about homosexuality.”
Though Russia repealed a law making homosexuality a criminal offense in 1993, four years before he was born, attitudes inherited from Soviet times prevail today. A national poll by the independent Levada Center in April found that nearly 80 percent of respondents attributed homosexuality to disease, psychological trauma or immorality.
In the Soviet Union, gay men and lesbians could be sent to prison or forced to undergo medical treatment.
Sitting in a sunlit Moscow park, under the baleful gaze of a large statue of Lenin, Maxim recalled how classmates called him names and threatened him after he revealed he was gay. Teachers ignored his situation, except for one who picked up scissors and tried to cut his longish bangs.
Some kids asked why he became gay. “I didn't become gay,” he told them. “I was born gay.”
His grandmother has come to accept him, but she hasn't heard about the law and he hasn't told her, sparing her worry.
The law set off vociferous criticism of Russia around the world, along with debates about boycotting vodka and even the Sochi Winter Olympics. President Obama made his disapproval clear on Jay Leno's “Tonight Show.”
Those rebukes have little resonance here, where the law is widely supported and where gays and lesbians feel the landscape has grown more dangerous than ever for them.
“You can't impose homosexuality on anyone,” Maxim said, “but you can easily impose homophobia.”

Boris Johnson has told the BBC that Britain should reject any EU demands for a £50bn "exit bill" and follow the example of former PM Margaret Thatcher.
It has been reported that EU negotiator Michel Barnier has said the UK must continue to pay into the EU until 2020.
Mr Johnson said it was "not reasonable" for the UK to "continue to make vast budget payments" once it left the EU.
He cited Mrs Thatcher's success at the 1984 Fontainebleau Summit, when she threatened to halt payments to the EU.
Laura Kuenssberg: Thatcher to inspire UK 'Brexit bill' talks?
Poland fails to stop Tusk EU re-election
"I think we have illustrious precedent in this matter, and you will doubtless recall the 1984 Fontainebleau Summit in which Mrs Thatcher said she wanted her money back, and I think that is exactly what we will get," he told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg in BBC Two's Brexit: Britain's Biggest Deal.
"It is not reasonable, I don't think, for the UK having left the EU to continue to make vast budget payments, I think everybody understands that and that's the reality."
The UK won the rebate in 1984, after then prime minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to halt payments to the EU budget.
At the time the UK was then the third poorest member of the Community but was on course to become the biggest net contributor to the EU budget.
Asked about Mr Johnson's comments, Mrs May said "there was only ever one Margaret Thatcher" and insisted the British people did not vote for Brexit to keep paying "huge sums" into the EU budget.
The Daily Telegraph has reported that Mr Barnier raised the idea that the UK may have to pay 60bn euros (£52bn) to cover the UK's share of outstanding pension liabilities, loan guarantees and spending on UK-based projects until 2020 - even if it leaves the EU by 2019.

Irish premier Enda Kenny suggested he may back demands for the UK to pay a "divorce bill" when it leaves the EU, telling reporters at the summit on Thursday: "When you sign on for a contract, you commit yourself to participation.
"And obviously the extent of that level of money will be determined. Mr Barnier is the lead negotiator for the European Union and obviously Britain will have a say.
"But that no more than any other problem will have to be faced, it will have to be dealt with and it will be dealt with."
Meanwhile, in London, ministers have cleared time for MPs to vote on reversing Lords Brexit bill amendments.
Commons Leader David Lidington announced that the bill will be debated by MPs on Monday, 13 March.
Ministers hope to overturn peers' calls for a "meaningful" parliamentary vote on the final terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
They also want to reverse a Lords defeat on the issue of guaranteeing the rights of EU citizens in the UK.
Tusk backed
At the summit, the 28 EU leaders discussed migration, security and economic growth, but the meeting began with a vote backing former Polish prime minister Donald Tusk remaining European Council president - a move opposed by Poland's government.
Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo had accused predecessor Mr Tusk of interfering in the country's domestic affairs.
The president is elected by the European Council by a qualified majority, which means that no single country can veto it.
At the summit, Mrs May called for more action to counter "Russian disinformation" and "raise the visibility" of Western commitment in the western Balkans, where Moscow faces allegations of helping to plot a coup attempt in Montenegro.
She is leaving the summit on Thursday.
The other 27 leaders are expected to use Friday's informal meeting to discuss the next summit in Rome on 25 March, which will celebrate the EU's 60th anniversary.
A government source suggested Mrs May, who plans to trigger Article 50 this month - the mechanism that kick-starts the UK's departure from the EU - will not be attending the Rome summit.
Apple has long been seen as the cool, innovative company, the one that would buck trends. Microsoft, on the other hand, was the safe bet, not really trying to force the market to its will, but rather service it wherever the market demanded. Both companies recently lost their leaders—Steve Jobs passed away in 2011 and Steve Ballmer left Microsoft in 2014.
Has there been a principle switch?
To some extent, yes. In the mid-aughts, Apple was trying to take a play from Microsoft's dominance in the computer space. MacBooks were seen as expensive boutique machines that only professional photographers used. Clearly, Apple needed to steal some of the general computing audience from Microsoft. Along came one of the most effective marketing campaigns by Apple: the “Get a Mac” ads.
The campaign also launched at the same time as Microsoft's Vista, which was plagued by issues. These ads highlighted Windows' problems, as well as the general ease of use Apple products could offer.
The campaign clearly worked: Excluding tablets, Apple's PC marketshare in 2005 was hovering around five percent. Now Apple's PC dominance stands at around 10 percent global market share. If we include tablets in the equation, Apple's share hovers closer to 20 percent. That's quite a chunk to gain in less than a decade.
But that was Apple then. The little guy, trying to make it in a PC-dominated world. But now?
Let's take a look at the most recent ad from Microsoft. The company is taking a jab at Siri by showing off Cortana.
While it might not have the witty banter of those “Get a Mac” ads, it's effective nonetheless. Right now Microsoft's Lumia phone line is nowhere near Apple's iPhone global market share, but it does seem to be growing in very specific regions over Apple. (Granted, in some cases Lumias are $400 cheaper than iPhones.) Substitute smartphones for computers, and Microsoft is in the same situation Apple was a decade ago. And now it's pushing the same types of ads Apple did.
Another example is the battle between the iPad Air and the Surface Pro 3. Both are absolutely tremendous machines, but Microsoft still uses advertising to paint itself as the superior choice.
In this case, Microsoft's ad push does seem to be working. The Surface, as a product line, had a very shaky start, and the Pro 3 cannot seem to catch a break from the NFL or CNN. But now it's trending to be Microsoft's next billion-dollar business.
The one argument that Microsoft fans would hold over Apple is cost. In the desktop world, that's still the case by quite a wide margin. But when it comes to ultrabooks, Apple is the cheaper option. Let's take a look at the base 13-inch MacBook Air. Over at Best Buy, the machine will run you about $950. Microsoft's direct competitor to the MacBook Air this holiday season, as detailed in an ad, was the 13-inch Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro, a device that will run you $1,300. That's a huge price difference, even considering the Yoga 3 Pro has double the RAM and hard drive space.
Under Jobs, Apple was a company that would do things its own way. Under Tim Cook, Apple seems more worried about keeping investors happy than stubbornly pushing its design. Take the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, each sporting much larger screens to compete with major competitor Samsung. Apple made this move to try and gain some share in a very stubborn Asian market, which prefers larger phones.
The change is in stark contrast to the ad Apple pushed out two years ago in response to larger screens.
Compare that to the ad for the iPhone 6 Plus.
This second ad just seems so… not Apple. It's not smart or subtle. Couple that with the Apple Watch announcement back in September, and it feels like Apple is creating reactionary products rather than acting as the forecaster.
Compare that to Microsoft's smartwatch… or rather, smartband. It's a device that's not putting itself out there to compete with the Samsung Gears, Pebbles, and Apple Watches of the world, but rather to be a supplementary fitness device, one that works across all platforms and gathers all fitness data into one hub. It's not going to enjoy the status that the Apple Watch will, and it certainly doesn't come with all the bells and whistles, but when you compare this product and vision to the “old” Microsoft, it's absolutely a major creative strike from what's been labeled an unimaginative company.
Right now Apple is coasting on its loyal fanbase and the positive press it receives, even if that means twisting a few arms. Microsoft is playing catchup and is doing everything it can to set itself apart as the premium hardware and software provider. The company is practically giving away free Cloud storage space, and is giving more free options to consumers to keep its dominance over Google software.
None of this means Microsoft will become the new Apple, or Apple the new Microsoft; in a lot of ways Microsoft is still the same lingering machine it was 10 years ago. But it's possible that respective regime changes are stirring the waters. These are not the cliche companies we used to know. What will they become?

By Rick Hurd
U.S. Postal inspectors still were working Sunday morning to determine who put a suspicious device in a mail collection box and what it was.
Postal inspectors and a bomb squad were called to the corner of Stanford and San Pablo avenues around 3 p.m. Saturday after a postal carrier noticed something strange at the bottom of the blue collection box, U.S. Postal Inspector spokesman Jeff Fitch said.

Hundreds gather downtown for Occupy Orlando
Grass-roots group has ties to Occupy Wall Street
Wednesday night, Munnerlyn and more than 400 others gathered outside the Orange County Regional History Center to show their support for Occupy Orlando, a grass-roots group with ties to the Occupy Wall Street movement going on in New York City.
"It's time for the American people to rise up and quit taking this … ," said Munnerlyn, 64, of Orlando.
Wearing a camouflage hat and American flag suspenders, Travis Munnerlyn held a sign that read "Banks Caused this Crisis … Make Them Pay!"

For almost three hours, tattooed youths, middle-aged couples and at least one gay veteran stood by listening to speakers rally against everything from corporate greed and government corruption to social inequalities and the disparity of wealth in America.
One organizer who goes by the name Reverend Faux said he was pleased by the number of people who showed up to support Occupy Orlando.
Many of those who attended the meeting learned about it on social media, Faux said. By Wednesday afternoon, Occupy Orlando had more than 2,500 followers on Facebook and 300 followers on Twitter.
He described the group as people who are "tired of being stepped on."
"Are we ready Orlando, Florida, to stand as a voice with the rest of the world?" he asked while addressing the crowd.
The gathering, described as a meeting and not a protest, sprang out of the movement that has been going on in New York since Sept. 17.
For almost three weeks, thousands of activists have been demonstrating on Wall Street and across theNew York City.
Copycat demonstrations, organized through a central online hub called Occupy Together, have spread across the country, with rallies held in Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago, and Washington. Also on Wednesday, students at more than 75 colleges walked out of class to show their support for the Occupy movement.
Representatives of the University of Central Florida and Rollins College said they hadn't heard of any students participating in Wednesday's walkout.
Occupy Orlando plans to meet again near the Orlando Chamber of Commerce on Oct. 15 and stage a march.

The world's Pacific bluefin tuna won something of a reprieve Friday, when tuna-fishing countries reached an agreement to gradually rebuild severely depleted stocks while still allowing nations such as Japan to catch and consume the delicacy.
Japan — by far the world's biggest consumer of bluefin, eating about 80 percent of the global haul in the $42 billion tuna industry — had been resisting new rules, while conservationists have warned about the commercial extinction of bluefin in the Pacific Ocean.
Proponents of limits hailed the deal as a compromise that everyone could live with.
"It's definitely a good first step towards the recovery of the species," said James Gibbon, global tuna conservation officer at the Pew Charitable Trusts. "But it is only the first step. There are a lot of commitments that the countries agreed to, and we need to make sure they stick to them."
At the week-long meeting in Busan, South Korea, the two bodies charged with shared management of Pacific bluefin — the northern committee of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission — hammered out a plan to try to put the fish back on a path to sustainability. Countries represented at the meeting included the United States, Canada, China, South Korea and Japan.
The Pacific bluefin population has been depleted by more than 97 percent from its historic high, because of overfishing.

At the meeting, the two organizations agreed to a target to rebuild tuna stocks to 20 percent of historic levels by 2034, the minimum level that scientists consider necessary to protect the species.
If the chances of meeting the 2034 rebuilding target fall below 60 percent, the parties agreed to immediately reduce their catch levels.
The groups also agreed to develop a "catch documentation scheme" by 2020 to try to stop illegally caught Pacific bluefin from entering the international market.
Both Japan and Mexico have exceeded their annual bluefin fishing for the 2017 fishing year, which ended in June, and Japan's Fisheries Agency estimated that more than 100 tons had been caught illegally or without being reported. Japan's domestic limits on fishing are entirely voluntary.
Pacific bluefin is particularly prized in Japan for its fatty underbelly, called "otoro," which sells for as much as $23 per piece at Michelin-starred sushi restaurants in Tokyo.

Going into the meeting, Japan's Fisheries Agency had contended that replenishment goals could be met through a new rule introduced last year that sought to halve the annual catch of juvenile bluefin, or tuna weighing less than 66 pounds, to increase the egg-laying adult bluefin tuna population.
But Japan had not been sticking to this rule, and its delegates came under sustained pressure from other countries and the Japanese media to agree to the new targets.
That made the new rules imperative, said Yamauchi of WWF. "There's no other resource that is as terribly depleted as the Pacific bluefin tuna, so there's no time to wait," she said.

The Midwest is becoming big cat country again.
Cougars are experiencing a resurgence in the Midwestern states of Arkansas, Missouri and Nebraska and will recolonize their former habitats in the next 25 years, according to a new study in the journal Ecological Modelling conducted by researchers at the University of Minnesota and Southern Illinois University Carbondale.
Cougars, also known as mountain lions or pumas, have an expansive geographic distribution throughout the United States, but western expansion drove them out of their former surroundings in the Midwest. Their populations on the East Coast were completely decimated; earlier this year, the eastern cougar was declared extinct by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, with the last sighting being in Maine back in 1938. Fortunately, western cougar predilection for a rugged environment kept it safe from hunters.
“In the West, there are a lot of mountains and it's tough for people to get back there; they had the topography working for them,” study co-author Michelle LaRue told weather.com. “They were able to maintain a strong hold in many of those areas."

“In the 1960s, they were changed from a bounty species to a managed game species and that allowed for their populations to rebound ever since," she added. "The populations are doing well enough that there's no more room for them to disperse, so they're coming back to the Midwest.”
Cougar resettlement is contingent on female populations. The habitat is suitable for breeding in Arkansas, Missouri and Nebraska, predictive models in the study show, considering demographic data, dispersal rate and information about their space.
LaRue said she hopes her findings will help educate people and serve as the basis for targeted outreach programs throughout the region.
“We want to use this paper as a proactive management tool,” she said. “We highlight where cougars are likely to show up, and that information can be used by agencies and conservation organizations to educate the public about cougar ecology, life history and what it might mean to live with them.”
LaRue said the next pressing issue to be addressed will be how people in these areas feel about living with cougars. She stressed that the public has no need to fear and cougar attacks are incredibly rare.
“The likelihood of seeing a cougar is very low. It's rare to see one, let alone interact with one,” she noted. “You should be more afraid of deer.”

What makes a football player great?
For years, experts have been trying to qualify that answer by holding rookie combines, crafting scouting reports and reviewing hours of game tape only to come up with numbers that, at the end of the day, still don't really help us understand what type of player we're getting.
But what if what they're missing is as simple as where that player comes from?
What if I told you that a tiny island in the middle of the South Pacific, with the population of 65,000 people (which is less than the capacity of most NFL stadiums), was the most important breeding ground for some of the best talent in the National Football League?
Samoa -- or "Football Island" as it's often referred to -- is one of a handful of Polynesian islands that produces dozens of professional football players every year. But it's not just the sheer amount of players, both retired and currently active in the NFL, that impresses coaches, fans and teammates alike (there are closes to 40 active players of Samoan descent today).
It's the warrior-like intensity they display every time they step onto the field. It's how they channel all of that strength and energy into the game, but can be such gentle and loving people off it. To put it simply, they play the game the way it's supposed to be played: with supreme toughness.
While Samoans and Tongans make up a majority of Polynesian players in the NFL, they're mostly identifiable with long-flowing manes and traditional Maori tattoos that are something like battle stripes.
But to really sum it all up, Ravens All-Pro defensive tackle Haloti Ngata's father, Haloti Moala (who's of Tongan ancestry), said it the best during an interview leading up to Super Bowl XLVII with USA Today.
Polynesian players are built for combat, built for football — big, strong, fast.
But we know that it's much more than that. To be a great player in this game, and an even better man away from it, takes a certain strength that you'll consistently find within this special group of people. It's a cultural mindset that's been passed down from generation to generation, with values that teaches respect, love and passion for everything they do.
Why are Pacific islanders so big?
There is no legitimate explanation for this, but many believe that generations of farming and strenuous labor required by all males of the family might give us a little more insight as to why these behemoths of athletes exist.
Pacific Islanders are just born big-boned and have frames perfect for any NFL position, especially for linemen down in the trenches.
One theory in physical anthropology is that through ancestral evolution, Polynesians were forced to adapt to cold weather at one stage of their history.
People in cold climates tend to develop larger, lean bodies to store more fat, which would, of course, be a contrast to the warmer tropical environments they live in today. But considering that all Polynesians migrated to islands and were known as extraordinary travelers, this could be where the answer lies.
Other findings show that the Samoan obesity epidemic starts at birth. According to a study conducted by Brown University, weight gain drastically increases 23 percent more in a Samoan boy than the average male American child within the first 15 months of life. This, however, is not confined to just the Samoan populations. Many experts believe that this rise in childhood obesity foreshadows a trend that we can see in the United States.
Bringing football back to its real roots.
The most common trait shared between all Polynesian football players is their physical style of play and ability to react with instincts, instead of relying on brute strength or top-line speed.
Moala stressed that this is something that all of them were born to do. It comes from a history of fighting and strife, which they've been able to harness and make a living out of it.
We love contact. That's been the history of our people. The warrior spirit is within us.
While Samoans and Tongans are among some of the fastest and strongest, just take a look at an athlete like Troy Polamalu, safety of the Pittsburgh Steelers. He's never solely relied on any one of his physical attributes alone, yet has made a career, and won Super Bowls, because of his tenacity on the field. Even his approach to the game is old school.
During his training for the season, Polamalu refuses to touch any heavy weights and relies mostly on training in the sports lab where he uses special stretches to improve range of movement and swimming to build his stamina. And if you wonder where he gets this unorthodox approach to the game, he reiterates the same message of values that are ingrained within him and his people.
In an article stressing why Americans should be concerned with the economic plight of American Samoa, he stressed what he knows to be true.
All of my Polynesian counterparts in the NFL with roots in American Samoa understand how the values embedded in our South Pacific culture -- community, hard work, perseverance, respect -- contribute directly to our success.
Why their future is brighter than ever.
The pipeline of Polynesian players will only continue to improve in the coming years, both in quantity and quality.
Consider this: Youth football wasn't even initiated in Samoa until 2011. That means freshman year of high school used to be the first form of organized football players were allowed to participate in.
And because of the economic plight on the island of Samoa, much of the field and equipment used by athletes would never pass standards in the states. However, with more attention and investment in recent years, it's time for the pure talent to be cultivated, which means two things for the people: an education in America and the chance to break into the NFL to support their families.
For one of the most impoverished communities in the world, this is the ultimate opportunity and is what so many of the local kids fight towards.
But the talent extends closer to the United States as well. One player who's getting us excited about the future of Polynesian players is Heisman Trophy candidate and Hawaii-native, Marcus Mariota, who is the quarterback for the #2 Oregon Ducks.
If he were to walk away with the prestigious accolade, he would become the first Pacific islander to do so, and would pave the way for more just like him. His talent translates into the pros, too, and he is even the number one rated quarterback heading into the NFL draft come 2015.
Just watching his highlight tape alone shows you that he's truly a special talent and his humble attitude is what we've come to expect from kids who grew up like him.
As the number of Polynesian players continues to increase over the next few years, more awareness will be raised about their communities and the light that they deserve will finally be shined on them.
For one of the most intriguing, yet seemingly untapped communities in the world, football is exactly what they needed. And the truth is, football needs them too.

Three cheers for the campaign to oust Debbie Wasserman Schultz as head of the Democratic National Committee: Her efforts to grease every wheel for Hillary Clinton are a disservice to the party, the nation and even to Clinton.
The party chief “is trying to manipulate the presidential election process by limiting direct debate and tilting the national party apparatus in favor of one candidate. This is unacceptable,” says
RootsAction.org co-founder Norman Solomon. As of Friday, the group had 30,000-plus signatures for its ouster effort.
Wasserman Schultz has helped schedule remarkably few debates — six, against the Republicans' 12. And the timing's guaranteed to minimize viewership: The Dems' next debate is on the Sunday in the middle of the Martin Luther King three-day weekend, programmed against the NFL playoffs.
This, notes Jeff Cohen of RootsAction, has led to “domination of the media's extensive election coverage by the other big party.”
Plus, she moved to deny Bernie Sanders access to his own voter database after some (immediately fired) staffers got caught peeking at others' data. It took a lawsuit to get Wasserman Schultz to back off.
Clinton would be a stronger general-election candidate for facing a fair primary fight — and Democrats would feel more confidence.
Turning the contest into a coronation isn't just undemocratic, it's downright royalist.
Once upon a time, I started sewing lingerie – and now I'm addicted. I mean, to be fair I've only sewn about 5 bras, 2 bikini sets, several knickers, a corset and a swimming costume (I'm counting these as underwear too) which doesn't really scream obsession yet, but then again, have you seen my Sewing Pinterest board? It's at least half-filled with lingerie and underwear sewing tips, tutorials and patterns. And have you seen my collection of fabrics, accessories and implements for sewing lingerie? Believe me, I'm addicted!
So I started off in the shallow end with the Watson bra – with no padding and no underwires, I'd definitely recommend that someone start out sewing their own bras. It was really helpful to me to find out how to sew with these new fabrics and how to use elastic. But in reality, the Watson is more of a bralette. That's all well and good, but I also wanted to learn how to sew a “real” bra with underwires and foam, but this presented me with a challenge as my 28GG/H size is pretty difficult to find a pattern for. I had recommendations to take apart an old bra and draft a pattern from that (but just couldn't bring myself too – I love all my bras!), but this being my first time sewing one, I wanted a comprehensive pattern to sew so I knew things were on the right lines and what order to do them in. I asked in a few of my frequented sewing groups, but came up blank from those – sadly all the recommendations I had were either sister sizes (which I was worried about grading down) or in American sizing, so I'd need a 28J or K in that system which I couldn't find, or a combination of both.
I was a bit at a loss on what to do and was ready to start drafting my own when my prayers were suddenly answered as I came across blog posts reviewing the soon-to-be-released Maya bra by AFI which is available in UK sizes 28-44 AA-H (the AA cups start from the 34 band). I eagerly awaited its arrival and on launch day snapped up my copy (although I did have to wait while my size was produced – this was just a quick email to Ana who sorted it out!). I decided to give it a go in a 28GG, and here's how it went:
(Sorry about the innards of the cups not being so pretty – I hadn't yet removed the markings before photographing!)
While I do have a bit of a stash of bra making bits and pieces now, I didn't have everything I needed for this bra. I decided to go for a Bra & Knicker Making Starter Kit from English Couture (in Maroon) as it was the only one I could find with fabric, elastic, strapping, findings (rings, sliders and fastening), interfacing, wire casings and, most importantly, underwires! It's possible to buy all these things separately, but so much easier to buy in a kit. I went for wire size 44 for a 28GG(it took a lot of sisters sizing to figure this out!) – it seems their website has changed its wire sizing system since I ordered though, and that would be a ECL07 according to their new sizing. I also bought 2m of Cut and Sew Foam from Make Bra – this comes from Finland so I'm still trying to source this foam from somewhere UK based – I know Sewing Chest sometimes has it but they seem to be small amounts usually, so if anyone knows anywhere, let me know!
So that was all the pieces needed to make the bra, and everything else, including rotary wheel and cutting mat (easier to use for this than scissors), tracing paper (for tracing out the pattern – I'm still using this massive roll from Amazon), sewing machine etc. I already had.
To get started, you need to choose your size – AFI provides some sizing charts here, but I just went with my usual ready to wear size – then download it from this page. The Maya pattern is free – this is amazing and I'm so grateful to Ana for providing it! You'll then need to print your pattern (make sure your printer is set to 100% zoom so you get the right size) and stick it together where needed. I'm terrible at this part, it takes me forever! Once you have your pattern, you can cut it out or trace it so you get lasting pattern pieces. It's then straightforward enough as you simply cut out your pieces and follow the pattern instructions.
So this was my first time sewing a proper bra with cut and sew foam and underwires – and I loved it! I was worried I might mess up the foam, but it was really simple to sew together with a zig zag stitch – probably one of the easiest parts actually! The cup is in three parts (and my top cup part looked MASSIVE, but don't worry as it curls around and looks smaller when it comes together!), and I covered my inside foam seams with ribbon (albeit fairly messily – need more practice on this).
Before I get into the fit and sizing of the final piece, I had a small issue in that unfortunately, my English Couture kit didn't include enough of the fusible mesh interfacing for me to use on the cradle of the bra. I'm not sure whether this was an error or whether that's the amount you're supposed to receive (maybe it's just supposed to be used on the gore?), but there wasn't nearly enough for me to cut the piece out on the fold. Instead I decided to use a different fusible interfacing I had which in retrospect wasn't a great idea as it's already pulling apart. To be fair though, I knew this bra was going to be a test and was unlikely to fit me properly, so I wasn't too bothered about little things like that.
I'm not sure how well you can tell from these pictures, but unfortunately – the Maya bra is not a great fit at all for me in a 28GG. Sadly, it's not to do with the sizing but rather the shape and the grading of the bra. I have a projected breast shape and the Maya in my size range expects a much more shallow shape. It's most likely the cup has been graded from a sister size with a larger band size, and subsequently the cups increase in size width ways rather than outwards. I suspect I could partially rectify this by finding narrower underwires which would push the shape of the cup forwards slightly, but the bottom of the cup doesn't have the amount of forward projection I need meaning the gore sits quite high off my chestbone. This brings me to the point that the underwires are not quite right for me either – because I am a smaller band size with a larger cup size, I need fairly narrow wires and these are wide. It's possible to use a smaller underwire for this situation apparently, but I'd have to ensure that the length is correct too.
I also have the issue that the cups are a little too tall for my liking and that the gore is too wide for my closer set shape. This is not a criticism of the bra and pattern itself, but rather just an incompatibly with my shape sadly. I also have one more problem with the bra, this:
See the band riding up? It means it's too big around the back for me. I think this is a combination of a couple of factors – the fabric is quite stretchy, so would be better being lined with a fairly strong powernet since as it is, it's just the stretch fabric. I think it may also be to do with the cradle not being lined with the right fusible interfacing as it has a little extra stretch that it shouldn't have – the cradle should be non-stretch to support more. I think I could also do with shortening the pattern piece for the band for me too.
But these issues don't mean at all that has been a pointless project. In fact, it's been a massively positive experience in that I SEWED A REAL BRA, YOU GUYS!! And it even looks real! I now know how to sew underwire channels and how to use cut and sew foam, and it looks pretty too. It was also really fun to make and to see it coming together. The biggest positive is that I had a very good set of instructions to follow from AFI so that I now confidently understand how bras go together, so much so that I've already started on making a new one with a pattern that I'm slightly drafting myself so that it will fit better.
I'd definitely recommend giving the Maya bra a go if you're looking to start sewing bras with foam and underwires – not only is it free, it also has very clear instructions. It seems that most people in the more average set of bra sizes find it fits them very well too, so don't be put off by my fitting of it – it's just that my shape wasn't compatible with it.

John T. Williams, a Native American woodcarver, died after being shot 4 times by Officer Ian Birk on August 30, 2010. Dashcam video is shown below.
Birk resigned Feb. 16 after the release of a scathing report by the Firearms Review Board report that found, among other problems, that Birk didn't identify himself as a police officer as he approached Williams from behind. Williams was crossing the intersection while carving on a piece of wood with a legal knife (shown here in a police photo). The knife was folded shut when found by officers.
Williams, who was deaf in one ear, was shot in the side, not facing the officer.
Officer Birk was not criminally charged in the shooting.

They noted Beale's immediate contrition, the trashing of his name since, and the fact that Beale had already effectively been suspended from recent matches.
What they had done though was to set up a quasi-legal process, overseen by independent arbiters of impeccable pedigree, and have them wade through all the evidence, all the factors, talk to witnesses, take statements, and come up with what they felt was a fair result. They did.
I talked to many of the directors of the ARU board and other key players on Thursday evening at the John Eales Medal Dinner, and it was their united expectation that Beale would go. There was certainly no conspiracy on their part to contrive to save him.
The end result is that a troubled player with a troubled past is not thrown on the scrap-heap and left to rot but given one last chance – and make no mistake it is exactly that – to redeem himself. What he did was apalling outrageous, horrifying and unforgivable but . . . actually constituted moments of madness. It was not part of a long pattern of constant harassment consistent with one who is a danger to all shipping within coo-ee. In the case of Beale, the fact that he had huge frustration with the position of employee in question, shared by some of the other Wallabies, does not excuse the sending of the text for a second, but, whatever else, it does indicate that the cause was not simple malicious misogyny.
Whatever happens from here to Beale, we may take it as given that he is highly unlikely to ever send a text of that nature again, and it is equally unlikely that other rugby players – present and rising – won't get the message that it is totally unacceptable.
Will he join the Wallabies now in Europe, though? I, for one, hope not. He needs to retreat, disappear, train hard, think about all that has happened and then come back next year as a better player, and a better man.
Beale is a troubled soul, but he is not a bad man. Those who know him well report kindness, humility, and yes, integrity. This shocking episode is one he will struggle to live down, but at least – against all expectations – he has been given a chance to do so.
It is for him now to work hard to take that chance.

Why Amy Schumer is officially the new John Oliver
Here's a shameless post about the new ‘Magic Mike XXL' trailer because, well, look at it
Miss that ‘Scrubs' reunion on TV this week? Here's what happened.
Sasha Grey is a former porn actress turned legit actress, a move solidified with her roles in Steven Soderbergh's The Girlfriend Experience in 2009 and HBO's Entourage in 2010. She's now reflecting on the career she retired from in a new photography book titled Neü Sex. (It's filled with glossy pictorials, essays pondering pornography's place in society, and at least one irony-free Sartre quote.) Grey looked back even further in her past and pointed to six cartoon shows that she's found to be an acquired taste, yet ultimately quite delicious. We understand that thinking about Sasha Grey and cartoons at the same time might not come naturally, but not to worry, it's not like she's having a threesome with Pinky & The Brain. Narf!
The Venture Bros. Brock Samson is probably the sexiest cartoon ever. [Laughs.] If he was a real guy, every woman would want him. I just think it's a hilarious show and the characters are all great. There are even a few [David] Bowie appearances, and I'm a big fan of him. So I just think they bring together so many different elements in the show. The Monarch is, you know, a failed bad guy. [Laughs.] It's kind of awesome. That was one I started watching in the second season and I decided to stop until it came out on DVD and I went and grabbed the first two after the second one ended. I heard about that because at the time I didn't have cable, so the only show I watched was Aqua Teen Hunger Force. I was at a friend's house and they were like, "I have to turn this on! It doesn't matter what we're doing, I have to turn this on!" “I think Aqua Teen was the first Adult Swim show I fell in love with, though I thought it was f***ing stupid the first time I saw it. ” I think Aqua Teen was the first Adult Swim show I fell in love with, though I thought it was f***ing stupid the first time I saw it. I thought it was terribly racist, and not in a funny way. Obviously the show is irreverent, but things like watching the intro at first I was like, "What the hell is this? This is garbage!" Then I actually watched it instead of just watching the first few minutes and fell in love with that. I have this weird thing, though, where if I get into a TV show that's not a cartoon, I have to watch it from the first season or I'll go crazy. I just feel like with a lot of the Adult Swim stuff you can just jump in and it'll always be reliably funny.
South Park I used to hate that show, too. Was there a specific episode or moment that you remember changing your opinion? For the sake of conversation, Scott Tenorman and the chili episode. [Laughs.] Any time you have a cook-off in a show there's going to be some big excitement. But the fact that he, you know, got the ultimate revenge to his bully and killed his parents and put it in the chili. The best part was when he walked up to Scott's face and said, "Mmm, your tears taste so good." [Laughs.] You're laughing so hard, you're actually silent because you're curled in a ball. But when Radiohead shows up [while Scott Tenorman is crying because he just ate his family]? Having your favorite person watch you cry is the ultimate no-no for teenage boys. “Having your favorite person watch you cry is the ultimate no-no for teenage boys.” What about it didn't you really like at first? I think initially it was the way it looked. I mean, I was like eight years old the first time I saw that. Eight or nine. You just made a lot of people reading this feel really old. [Laughs.] I mean, I was just too young to get a lot of the humor. It definitely wasn't the offensive part about it because that's what I like about it now. But a lot of people criticize South Park for going too far or playing with the same old tricks all the time, but I still think they're at the top of their game. They poke fun at pop culture just as much as your favorite gossip magazine does, except they make it funny. [Laughs.] They're interested in making fun of it and it's actually hilarious.
American Dad I think it just keeps getting better with every episode with every season. It actually took me a while to get into it. I don't know what I didn't really like about it before, but I was just a little bored by it. Now I just find it hilarious. All the characters are great, though I'd have to say my favorite is Roger. [Laughs.] He just comes up with these ridiculous backstories about whoever he decides to be that day. He'll pull open his closet and he has 200 different wigs and 300 different outfits. It's just great. Do you prefer that show to Family Guy? It's tough to say, but I have been thinking about this a lot lately. I think it has surpassed Family Guy. It gets away with much more. I think once you get into American Dad, the humor, they just get into so much. Some f***ed up humor. I think cartoons are the last medium to be able to explore some really seedy things you wouldn't be able to do on a television show with real actors. “I think cartoons are the last medium to be able to explore some really seedy things you wouldn't be able to do on a television show with real actors. ”
Humphrey The Bear It's a long-lost Disney character. They only had a few seasons, maybe one or two. But I think this is something everyone needs to see. Man, it's hilarious. What I think is so great about it is there's not a lot of dialogs and there's just a lot of action. It's kinda like physical comedy. That's the kind of chraracter Humphrey is. He's just this dumb bear that tries to do the right thing, but no matter how hard he tries he just f*** up. That's something everybody can relate to. “He's just this dumb bear that tries to do the right thing, but no matter how hard he tries he just f*** up. ”
Eek! The Cat I just always remember it was on after Bobby's World, so I couldn't wait for that to end. Eek was always like, "Sure! It never hurts to help." It was kinda the same Humphrey The Bear thing of always wanting to do the right thing, and not making a mistake, but he's just very incompetent. He was in love with this other girl cat. Their relationship always reminded me of the Kermit and Miss Piggy thing, where she's just this huge big woman and it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks. He's just in love with her. And his dog, Sharky, hated Eek the cat. So Sharky was always finding ways to break up the relationship and get rid of Eek. There was this great episode, the only one I have on VHS anywhere, and it was called Pup Fiction. It was a whole Pulp Fiction-themed episode.

Uruguay is the latest country to join a U.S. initiative that seeks to promote LGBT rights around the world.
The small South American nation that borders Brazil and Argentina will join Chile, France, Germany, Sweden and other countries that contribute to the Global Equality Fund, a public-private partnership the State Department manages with the U.S. Agency for International Development.
The initiative has given more than $17 million to LGBT advocacy groups since its 2011 launch.
The State Department, the Uruguayan government and the Washington-based Council for Global Equality are scheduled to formally announce Uruguay's participation in the Global Equality Fund on Nov. 18 during a reception at the Uruguay Embassy in Northwest D.C. Uruguay Ambassador to the U.S. Carlos Gianelli, Special Envoy for the Human Rights of LGBTI Persons Randy Berry and Council for Global Equality Chair Mark Bromley are among those who are expected to attend the event.
Same-sex couples have been able to legally marry in Uruguay since 2013. Transgender people are also able to legally change their gender in the South American country without surgery.
Uruguay co-sponsored a resolution against anti-LGBT discrimination and violence that the U.N. Human Rights Council adopted in September 2014.
Uruguay is among the Latin American countries that Berry visited in June. The Uruguayan government in April 2016 will host an LGBT rights conference that is expected to draw advocates from around the world.
“It is within this context that Uruguay has decided to join the Global Equality Fund, recognizing it as a valuable tool in the promotion and protection of LGBTI rights around the world,” the Uruguay Embassy in the U.S. told the Washington Blade on Friday in a statement.
The Uruguay Embassy in the U.S. also noted Chile's participation in the Global Equality Fund as evidence of Latin America's growing role in the promotion of LGBT rights around the world.
“In the wider framework of the protection of these people's rights as a fundamental element for the development of these communities, Uruguay considers the region's strength (on these issues) as key,” it told the Blade. “In this sense, we will seek to promote and expand the participation of other countries of the region in the Global Equality Fund.”
Some running for superintendent of education are critical of new high school standards and would also like to see intelligent design taught alongside evolution. Others seeking the office oppose the idea of mixing faith and science.

The crowded field of candidates for state superintendent of education may be winnowed by the process of natural selection in the June 10 primaries, but in the meantime, GOP contenders for the office are sniping at each other over teaching of Darwin's theory of the origin of species and the adoption of high school science standards.
Sheri Few, who runs a conservative parents group, took the first shots at Meka Childs, who was deputy superintendent under incumbent Republican Mick Zais, during Tuesday's debate on SC-ETV.
She tagged Childs with adoption of new science standards that Few says were copied from the Next Generation Science Standards, a set of national standards developed by the same organization that created the Common Core State Standards.
She also accused Childs, at Zais' behest, of circumventing a proviso that was inserted into the state budget that specified that no state funds were to be spent on adopting Next Generation Science Standards.
Childs says the new standards were based on the state's 2005 standards, not the Next Generation standards. She also said that science standards, by definition, are going to cover the same material regardless of who writes them.
"If you're talking about water, the molecular structure of water is going to be the same no matter what version of standards you're using," Childs said.
She said Few is falsely attacking her, to the detriment of the Republican Party's cause.
"When it comes to Ms. Few, it's like I've got a bull's-eye on my back," she told The News. "In my view it's misplaced."
Few, who has made opposition to Common Core the centerpiece of her campaign, went on the offensive Thursday, calling a news conference in Greenville, flanked by Phillip Bowers, a member of the state Education Oversight Committee and former state Board of Education member; a representative of a national group called Citizens for Objectivity in Public Education; and former Greenville County School Board member Julie Hershey.
Bowers tried unsuccessfully to insert a science standard that calls on students to question whether climate change is caused by human activity but was able to get enough support on the EOC to offer a standard that calls for students to examine evidence that discredits Darwinism.

All of the new science standards have been adopted except for that new item, which the state Board of Education is scheduled to consider at its June 11 meeting.
The proposed standard calls on students to "construct scientific arguments that seem to support and scientific arguments that seem to discredit Darwinian natural selection."
Few said she only wants students to learn critical thinking and to analyze all the evidence.
"Children are not receiving an objective education," Few said during Tuesday's debate.
"There was plenty of science and research behind the theory of intelligent design, and yet it is not allowed in the classroom. There is no reason why the scientific theory of intelligent design should not be taught in the classroom alongside the theory of evolution.
"And that way children would receive an objective education and also, for Christian children, could point to their God through the theory of intelligent design."
The theory of intelligent design holds that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection.
The eight Republicans in Tuesday's debate took a variety of positions on the issue, with many of them saying it makes a clear case for publicly funded tuition for private schools.
"I know how important it is to empower our parents with the ability to choose a school that is right for their child," said Amy Cofield, an attorney who is seeking the seat.
Some walked the line.
"As far as the state science standards, I believe that we have to teach accurate information to our students, and that involves factual texts, factual information," said Molly Spearman, executive director of the South Carolina Association of School Administrators.
"As a Christian, I have taken the responsibility to teach my own children at home about our special beliefs and the creation of the world, and I think that is the responsibility of parents to do that in their own home on religious beliefs," she said.
Don Jordan, a math professor at the University of South Carolina, said he sees no conflict between the biblical account of creation and science. He said he would use his influence if elected to encourage the kind of religious activity in schools that is legally permissible.
"I am going to ask every school to have a moment of silence, and I'm going to ask every parent in the state of South Carolina, you can't pray in the school but you can pray on the way to school with your children," he said. "And maybe you can't pray inside the school but you can take the spirit into the school."
Sally Atwater, a special education teacher and widow of GOP political strategist Lee Atwater, said she supports the state science standards but also is a person of faith.
"I know this: As long as we have tests, many students are going to need to say that moment of silence in prayer before they take a test," she said.
Charleston County businesswoman Elizabeth Moffly said, "I'm a firm believer in separation of church and state." She noted that she had sent some of her children to religious school and supports expansion of a program that offers credit for public students to take religious courses.
Gary Burgess, a member of the Anderson County Board of Education, said he believes evolution should be taught "as a theory, not as a conclusive fact."
"We need to make sure that children are given all the information, but it is the home's responsibility and houses of faith's responsibility to teach faith," he said.
"I do not base my faith on science nor do I do base my science on faith. But my faith verifies my science."
Democratic candidate Montrio M. Belton Sr. said he believes the state's science standards are well founded and added, "I am very cautious about bringing my religious belief into the classroom."
But he is adamantly opposed to the idea of giving vouchers or tax credits for parents to send their children to private schools, regardless of the reason.
Democrat Sheila Gallagher also said she believes the state's science standards are fact-based and opposes vouchers.
Democratic state Rep. Jerry Govan, contacted on the House floor Thursday, said he wasn't prepared to comment on the issue. Democratic candidate Tom Thompson couldn't be reached.

Introduction Pandas makes it very easy to output a DataFrame to Excel. However, there are limited options for customizing the output and using Excel's features to make your output as useful as it could be. Fortunately, it is easy to use the excellent XlsxWriter module to customize and enhance the Excel workbooks created by Panda's to_Excel function. This article will describe how to use XlsxWriter and Pandas to make complex, visually appealing and useful Excel workbooks. As an added bonus, the article will briefly discuss the use of the new assign function that has been introduced in pandas 0.16.0. Since this is a discussion about making Excel look better, a visual will probably be a quicker way to show what we can accomplish with a little bit of extra python code on top of the standard pandas library.
Background If you are not familiar with pandas and how to use it to manipulate data, some of these prior articles might put it in perspective: Common Excel Tasks Demonstrated in Pandas
Common Excel Tasks Demonstrated in Pandas - Part 2
Combining Multiple Excel Files One other point to clarify is that you must be using pandas 0.16 or higher to use assign . In addition there was a subtle bug in prior pandas versions that would not allow the formatting to work correctly when using XlsxWriter as shown below. Version Warning Please make sure you have a version of pandas ( > 0.16) installed for this example to work. For the purposes of this article, I will be using data very similar to the ones described in Common Excel Tasks Demonstrated in Pandas.
Simple Output Let's get started by importing pandas, numpy and xl_rowcol_to_cell . import pandas as pd import numpy as np from xlsxwriter.utility import xl_rowcol_to_cell Read in the file. df = pd . read_excel ( "excel-comp-datav2.xlsx" ) df . head () account name street city state post-code quota Jan Feb Mar 0 211829 Kerluke, Koepp and Hilpert 34456 Sean Highway New Jaycob TX 28752 110000 10000 62000 35000 1 320563 Walter-Trantow 1311 Alvis Tunnel Port Khadijah NC 38365 150000 95000 45000 35000 2 648336 Bashirian, Kunde and Price 62184 Schamberger Underpass Apt. 231 New Lilianland IA 76517 300000 91000 120000 35000 3 109996 D'Amore, Gleichner and Bode 155 Fadel Crescent Apt. 144 Hyattburgh ME 46021 180000 45000 120000 10000 4 121213 Bauch-Goldner 7274 Marissa Common Shanahanchester CA 49681 300000 162000 120000 35000 This dummy data shows account sales for Jan, Feb and March as well as the quota for each of these accounts. What we are going to do is summarize the data and see how close each account was towards hitting its quota. Get the number of rows to make it easier to add our Excel formulas a little later. number_rows = len ( df . index ) As of pandas 0.16, there is a new function called assign that is useful here to add some total data. # Add some summary data using the new assign functionality in pandas 0.16 df = df . assign ( total = ( df [ 'Jan' ] + df [ 'Feb' ] + df [ 'Mar' ])) df . head () account name street city state post-code quota Jan Feb Mar total 0 211829 Kerluke, Koepp and Hilpert 34456 Sean Highway New Jaycob TX 28752 110000 10000 62000 35000 107000 1 320563 Walter-Trantow 1311 Alvis Tunnel Port Khadijah NC 38365 150000 95000 45000 35000 175000 2 648336 Bashirian, Kunde and Price 62184 Schamberger Underpass Apt. 231 New Lilianland IA 76517 300000 91000 120000 35000 246000 3 109996 D'Amore, Gleichner and Bode 155 Fadel Crescent Apt. 144 Hyattburgh ME 46021 180000 45000 120000 10000 175000 4 121213 Bauch-Goldner 7274 Marissa Common Shanahanchester CA 49681 300000 162000 120000 35000 317000 We can also use assign to show how close accounts are towards their quota. df = df . assign ( quota_pct = ( 1 + ( df [ 'total' ] - df [ 'quota' ]) / df [ 'quota' ])) df . head () account name street city state post-code quota Jan Feb Mar total quota_pct 0 211829 Kerluke, Koepp and Hilpert 34456 Sean Highway New Jaycob TX 28752 110000 10000 62000 35000 107000 0.972727 1 320563 Walter-Trantow 1311 Alvis Tunnel Port Khadijah NC 38365 150000 95000 45000 35000 175000 1.166667 2 648336 Bashirian, Kunde and Price 62184 Schamberger Underpass Apt. 231 New Lilianland IA 76517 300000 91000 120000 35000 246000 0.820000 3 109996 D'Amore, Gleichner and Bode 155 Fadel Crescent Apt. 144 Hyattburgh ME 46021 180000 45000 120000 10000 175000 0.972222 4 121213 Bauch-Goldner 7274 Marissa Common Shanahanchester CA 49681 300000 162000 120000 35000 317000 1.056667
Thoughts on using assign As a side note, I personally like the assign function for adding these types of additional columns. Here is how you could add a total without assign: df [ "total" ] = df [ "Jan" ] + df [ "Feb" ] + df [ "Mar" ] Save this data using the simple to_excel process. writer_orig = pd . ExcelWriter ( 'simple.xlsx' , engine = 'xlsxwriter' ) df . to_excel ( writer_orig , index = False , sheet_name = 'report' ) writer_orig . save () Here is what the simple file looks like: You will notice a couple of things that would be nice to fix: The column widths make it tough to see all the data
The sales and percentages are not formmatted as dollars or %'s
There is no total information.
Overall it is pretty boring.
Complex Output With just a little more coding, we can create a more sophisticated output. We create another writer and use the to_excel to create our workbook. writer = pd . ExcelWriter ( 'fancy.xlsx' , engine = 'xlsxwriter' ) df . to_excel ( writer , index = False , sheet_name = 'report' ) The key is to get access to the worksheet which enables us to use all the XlsxWriter capability available in that library. workbook = writer . book worksheet = writer . sheets [ 'report' ] Now that we have the worksheet, we can do anything that xlsxwriter supports. If you have not done so yet, I encourage you to take a look at the XlsxWriter docs. They are very well written and show you all the capabilities available for customizing Excel output. By accessing the worksheet as shown above, you can easily drop in all XlsxWriter's features into your output. I'll walk through a few of them to give you some ideas. First, we resize the sheet by adjusting the zoom. worksheet . set_zoom ( 90 ) Some of our biggest improvements come through formatting the columns to make the data more readable. add_format is very useful for improving your standard output. Here are two examples of formatting numbers: # Add a number format for cells with money. money_fmt = workbook . add_format ({ 'num_format' : '$#,##0' , 'bold' : True }) # Add a percent format with 1 decimal point percent_fmt = workbook . add_format ({ 'num_format' : '0.0%' , 'bold' : True }) This example shows how to add additional formatting including underlines. # Total formatting total_fmt = workbook . add_format ({ 'align' : 'right' , 'num_format' : '$#,##0' , 'bold' : True , 'bottom' : 6 }) # Total percent format total_percent_fmt = workbook . add_format ({ 'align' : 'right' , 'num_format' : '0.0%' , 'bold' : True , 'bottom' : 6 }) Change the size of several columns using set_column . This can also be used to apply formatting to a column. This section changes the size of columns B-F to sizes more appropriate for the data they store. # Account info columns worksheet . set_column ( 'B:D' , 20 ) # State column worksheet . set_column ( 'E:E' , 5 ) # Post code worksheet . set_column ( 'F:F' , 10 ) In addition to changing the size of G-L, we also can apply the money and percent formatting on the entire column. # Monthly columns worksheet . set_column ( 'G:K' , 12 , money_fmt ) # Quota percent columns worksheet . set_column ( 'L:L' , 12 , percent_fmt ) The next section adds a total at the bottom of our data. The biggest challenge in working with Excel is converting between numeric indices and cell labels. This loop shows how to loop through the columns numerically but also use xl_rowcol_to_cell to get cell locations. # Add total rows for column in range ( 6 , 11 ): # Determine where we will place the formula cell_location = xl_rowcol_to_cell ( number_rows + 1 , column ) # Get the range to use for the sum formula start_range = xl_rowcol_to_cell ( 1 , column ) end_range = xl_rowcol_to_cell ( number_rows , column ) # Construct and write the formula formula = "=SUM({:s}:{:s})" . format ( start_range , end_range ) worksheet . write_formula ( cell_location , formula , total_fmt ) In addition to writing the total label, we want to see what our % to quota is in aggregate. We construct the string to calculate the percent to quota and write it out using write_formula # Add a total label worksheet . write_string ( number_rows + 1 , 5 , "Total" , total_fmt ) percent_formula = "=1+(K{0}-G{0})/G{0}" . format ( number_rows + 2 ) worksheet . write_formula ( number_rows + 1 , 11 , percent_formula , total_percent_fmt ) The final item to add is the capability to highlight the top 5 values and the bottom 5 values. This gives us a nice visual representation of where we may need to inspect further. First, we define the range we want to format. # Define our range for the color formatting color_range = "L2:L{}" . format ( number_rows + 1 ) Then, we define the colors. # Add a format. Light red fill with dark red text. format1 = workbook . add_format ({ 'bg_color' : '#FFC7CE' , 'font_color' : '#9C0006' }) # Add a format. Green fill with dark green text. format2 = workbook . add_format ({ 'bg_color' : '#C6EFCE' , 'font_color' : '#006100' }) Finally, we apply the conditional formatting and save our output. # Highlight the top 5 values in Green worksheet . conditional_format ( color_range , { 'type' : 'top' , 'value' : '5' , 'format' : format2 }) # Highlight the bottom 5 values in Red worksheet . conditional_format ( color_range , { 'type' : 'bottom' , 'value' : '5' , 'format' : format1 }) writer . save () Here is the final output.
The Abbott Government's neoliberalism is skewing the balance against the sovereignty of the people in favour of the sheer might of the corporation. Professor Carl Rhodes examines the rise of corporatocracy in Australia and our loss of democracy.
IT IS A sign of the Abbott Government's political and economic values that the failure of a bill attacking trade unions could be what sparks an early election. If this happens, it would play to the conflict between labour and capital that has long defined the division between the right and left of politics.
Abbott wears his political economy on his sleeve. Never shy of a slogan, “Australia is open for business” has become his refrain. He first declared his openness when he took over as Prime Minister in 2013.
The sloganeering continued when he used the same line as the catchcry of his 2014 trade visit to the United States. In that case, it was emblazoned on banners as he smiled and rang the bell to open the New York stock exchange.
It was back again last month at the signing of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement.
Abbott heralds corporate capitalism and free trade as the route to prosperity for the nation as well as for individual Australians.
But is the economic tail wagging the political dog?

Politics for Business
Business means a lot to Abbott and his government. Since elected, he has embarked on a series of actions intended to promote corporate supremacy and freedom.
The ideology he professes and the policies he pushes are all led towards making business – especially corporations – more powerful. The agenda to achieve this is small government, free markets, international trade, weak unions, disavowal of the class system, user pays public services, and a shrunken welfare system.
After a campaign fuelled by generous corporate donations, he abolished the carbon tax, proselytised that coal is “good for humanity”, sought to surrender universities to the free market, threatened universal healthcare, attacked trade unionism, and worked on reducing penalty rates for the employed and benefits for the unemployed.
In the “battlelines” in which Abbott fights, labour – as a political party and as a class of people – are his declared enemy. Business and the wealthy elite are his allies; maybe even his heroes. From the legacy of his captain's calls, to his respect for the British monarchy and to his disdain for the process and institutions of democracy Abbott, himself, often behaves more like a ruthless CEO king than a leader of a democratic nation.
Corporatocracy
Democracy is a system of government where ultimately political power comes from a nation's citizens. Democracy dethrones the king and declares the people as sovereign. The collective citizenry is the source of political authority that should be superseded by no other person or institution.
Although Abbott's economic and trade policies promise prosperity, they also serve to transfer power away from the people and towards corporations. This is a move from democracy to corporatocracy, all the while preserving the role of the state as the political arm of business.
As business, commerce and trade are pursued by the government, there is less worrying being done about domestic competition. Australia's corporations are powerful both collectively and individually. Whether they be in banking, retail, mining, media or telecommunications, Australia's biggest corporations operate exclusively in monopolistic, duopolistic or oligopolistic markets.
As democracy withers, inequality widens. The top one per cent, populated by big business capitalists and CEOs, claims more and more of the nation's wealth and income. This is a government that serves the market and its powerful actors. It draws political legitimacy from business and corporations, rather than from people and civil society.
As one would hope, the economy is central to government policy. Sadly, the equality of how the income and wealth generated by the economy is distributed is of far less concern. That is part of how corporatocracy works. Australia is a wealthy country, but that wealth is shared more and more inequitably.
Trading Sovereign Power
International trade agreements are the apogee of the burgeoning sovereign power of corporations. While important, the China-Australia Trade Agreement signed in June was just a step on the road.
The big prize is the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Negotiations have been done in secret, and what we know is only through leaked documents. The agreement is about increasing trade around the Pacific, but way that this will be achieved is through political as much as economic means.
Central to the proposed partnership is the Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) clauses. This clause stipulates that special tribunals would be established where corporations could sue any country whose laws impeded its pursuit of profitability.
This represents the apex of a long trend of corporatocratic governments shifting power from the people they notionally represent to corporations. The ISDS reverses the idea that corporations and beholden to the laws of the state. It insists a precedent whereby the law is beholden to the dictates of corporate profitability.
Despite the leaks, it was intended that the details of the agreement would not be made public until after it was signed. This would mean of course that public debate was entirely and deliberately eliminated from the process.
Of the Corporation, For the Corporation
Abbott's government, funded into office by the big end of town, is a government of, for and by the corporation. Citizens are just a means, not the ends, of economically driven politics where the corporation is sovereign.
As for the individual citizen, anyone can get on in life so long as you, as Joe Hockey says, “get a good job, that pays good money”. If, for some reason, you can't get a good job then you are left to the mercy of a political and economic system that claims to offer nothing. You will get what you deserve.
Abbott echoes a neoliberal exhortation of commerce and individualism. It is delivered from the seat of white male privilege, just with an Australian accent and an added dose of macho brutality.
In contemporary Australia, individual citizens can be condemned as being dole bludgers, or leaners not lifters, but corporations get a much broader berth.
Major Australian and multinational corporations are given generous tax deductions, exemptions and incentives. With what's left, they are able to shuffle profits around the world to bring the tax bill down even further.
While welfare benefits for citizens are under attack, if a bank is in trouble it can expect to be bailed out by putting its hand deep in the public purse.
"We are living in a plutocracy in Australia, that is government by the wealthy in the interests of the wealthy” ~ Sen Christine Milne.
After Democracy?
The corporatocracy being instituted in Australia is far from complete. Democracy cannot be undone that easily.
But what we are getting from the Liberal Party is a ticket on a coal-powered and bank-financed train headed away from democracy. This is a politics that is no longer defined by the distinction between left and the right. It is a battle for the very system that enables political difference to exist in the first place.
Our choice, in that we might still have one, is between democracy and corporatocracy. At present, the balance is skewing against the sovereignty of the people and in favour of the sheer might of the corporation.

Some 4,500 Palestinian security prisoners held in Israel began what may propel into a hunger strike Sunday, by refusing their breakfasts in unison.
The measure was taken in protest of the Saturday death of Palestinian prisoner Arafat Jardat, 39, apparently of cardiac arrest, at the Megiddo Prison.
Related stories:
News of the "breakfast strike" came as Palestinian sources reported that hundreds of Palestinians were rioting in various villages across the West Bank over Jardat's death.
Rioters stoned IDF forces trying to maintain order. Security forces used crowd-control measures in an effort to stop the protestors from blocking nearby Highway 60.
Riot in Khusra
Israel has reportedly relayed a communiqué to the Palestinian Authority, via Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's confidant Attorney Yitzhak Molcho, demanding it take all necessary measure to calm the situation on the ground.
Netanyahu also ordered the Treasury to release January tax revenue held by Israel to the PA.
Palestinian sources, however, said that the Palestinian prisoners intend to refuse all their meals throughout the day.
The Israel Prison Service noted that prisoners are allowed to keep food in their cells, which they usually purchase in the prison canteen.
According to IPS regulations, the prisoners would have to refuse all meals for 48 hours for the measure to be recognized as a full-fledged hunger strike.

Meanwhile, the Doctors for Human Rights group requested the Shin Bet's permission to examine the four Palestinian security prisoners who have been hospitalized over their extended hunger strike.
The organization said that the Shin Bet has yet to respond to the request.

HOLLYWOOD, Fla. — Republican delegates are warning Donald Trump that attacks on them and their party's presidential selection process could backfire, sinking him at the convention or damaging his prospects in November if he wins the nomination.
Trump, the front-runner for the nomination, has called the GOP's arcane rules for nominating a president "rigged" and referred to the process for choosing delegates as "corrupt." But it's the delegates who are charged with picking a nominee if Trump can't secure a binding, 1,237 majority in the primaries — and the New York billionaire's broadsides aren't going over well.
"I have never met a group of more honest, hardworking, dedicated people. We all understand it's our job to get the winner of the process elected, not to pick favorites," Peter Goldberg, chairman of the Alaska Republican Party, told the Washington Examiner on Wednesday. "We are working our tails off to be transparent."
"It's offensive and it speaks to a lack of knowledge about this process. I think everyone needs to go back and take civics lesson again," added a member of the Republican National Committee who requested anonymity in order to speak candidly because this individual will be serving as a convention delegate in Cleveland this July.
Hundreds of party insiders, including around 170 RNC members who are automatic convention delegates, gathered this week at an upscale oceanfront resort in south Florida to prepare for a possible contested convention. They were also were attending private briefings conducted by the campaigns of Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Gov. John Kasich designed to build support, and win votes, in the event of a multi-ballot floor fight.
Illustrating just how important these delegates have become, Cruz and Kasich diverted from the campaign trail on Wednesday to woo them, travling to the RNC's regularly scheduled spring meeting, at the Diplomat Resort and Spa in Hollywood, Fla., near Ft. Lauderdale. This was despite the fact there are primaries scheduled in five states in less than a week that present critical opportunities for them to try to accumulate more delegates and narrow their gap with Trump.
Delegates could have enormous power at a contested convention. The delegate pool is comprised of RNC members, plus more than 2,000 others, including alternate delegates, that are going through the election and selection process in states across the country. These activists often comprise the bulwark of the volunteer ground forces presidential campaigns need to help them get the out the vote and win in key battlegrounds.
So it was hardly by accident that Cruz defended their integrity against Trump's charges that they are on the take and participating in a system that is un-democratic. The senator had concluded a news conference here Wednesday afternoon but stopped halfway out the door of a hotel conference room here to make this point when asked if his meeting with RNC members constituted colluding with the GOP establishment.
"The strength of our campaign and the strength of our party is the grassroots," Cruz said. "And, it is not beneficial for the party or for the country to have a presidential candidate that looks down on the grassroots. I am happy to go where the grassroots are, to ask for their supports and to answer their questions at any and all times."
Trump has won the bulk of the primary and caucus elections held so far, and won more support from voters in these contests than Cruz or Kasich.
That has allowed him to rack up more delegates bound to vote for him on the first ballot at the convention — and in some cases second and third ballots — than either of his competitors. Indeed, only Trump can clinch the nomination in the remaining primaries; Cruz and Kasich can only win it by a vote of the delegates in Cleveland. Trump leads in delegates 845 to 559 for Cruz, with Kasich trailing at 148.
But Trump has taken a beating in the county, district and state elections that act as the selection mechanisms for the individuals who serve as delegates (so has Kasich.) Cruz's superior grassroots operation, fielded months ago, has been installing loyalists in convention delegations that are prepared to vote for him once they are unbound from the candidate that won their state's primary or caucus and become free agents.
Cruz's success has extended to states like Arizona and Georgia, where Trump won the voter preference primary quite easily. Trump has responded by blaming an unjust system for his campaign's delegate failures, saying it disenfranchises voters. "It's a crooked system, it's a system that's rigged and we're going to go back to the old way, it's called you vote and you win," he said Tuesday night after his landslide victory in New York.
Trump has vowed to overhaul GOP rules if he is elected president and becomes head of the party.
Veteran Republicans say they understand the politics behind Trump attacking their party's processes. There hasn't been a contested GOP convention in 40 years, most voters are unfamiliar with the role of delegates in the nomination. And, at time when anti-establishment fervor is running high, Trump could win votes with his attack on national party.
But RNC members say Trump is carrying his criticism too far — to his detriment.
To begin with, there is little appetite among GOP activists to create uniform rules for presidential nominations. The state parties are jealous of their power to make their own rules, and compared it to the conservative, Republican principle of limited government and valuing states' rights.
Additionally, while they can understand generalized attacks on the system for political gain, Trump essentially calling them all crooks, and referring an organization they have in some cases devoted years of their life to as corrupt, is too much for them to stomach. Trump could end up regretting his rhetoric, they said, especially if Cleveland, or November, doesn't go his way.
"I understand the public relations value of the candidate saying, you know the system's rigged, but it isn't. All they had to do is read the rules, and you know in Donald Trump's book, 'The Art of the Deal,' he says be prepared," Steve Duprey, the RNC committeeman and delegate from New Hampshire, said.
Photo: National Nuclear Security Agency Getting an upgrade: A variable-yield B61-12 thermonuclear bomb is undergoing tests at Sandia National Laboratory as part of the Pentagon's “Life Extension Program” to keep nuclear weapons in service into the 2030s.
Treat the test subject very, very carefully. It's a thermonuclear bomb.
The B61 is an American tactical gravity device (a relatively low-energy bomb dropped from aircraft rather than carried on a missile) with a variable, 0.3-to-340-kiloton yield. It was designed in the early 1960s; the U.S. made some 3 100 B61s, in a number of different configurations, for deployment at home and in Europe.
Today (according to nuclear-weapons watchdogs at The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists) about 200 B61s remain in service in the U.S. and 180 are deployed with NATO allies in Europe. While the U.S. military continues to reduce the number of H-bombs, they're also trying to keep the few that remain in good working order until they can be scrapped. Thus, the B61, along with three types of nuclear warheads for submarine-launched and other missiles, is the object of a $US 11 billion Life Extension Program (LEP) designed to keep them operational into the 2030s.
In the process, the Pentagon plans to modify the four current B61 models into a single configuration, the B61-12.
The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA, not to be confused with NSA or NASA) is responsible for maintaining, upgrading, and testing the devices, without using underground detonations. To accomplish this, in 2004 the NNSA broke ground or a new test facility at the Sandia National Laboratory, replacing installations that were as much as 50 years old. That was the start of a decade-long, two-phase Test Capabilities Revitalization. The program included, in the first phase, building resources like a seven-story flame test cell and a cross-wind test lab, and, in the second phase (just completed), building an improved sled track complex, mechanical shock and vibration facilities, a large-scale centrifuge, and an improved aero-sciences wind tunnel.
This week, the agency announced that it had completed the first full-system mechanical tests to certify that the new B61 will perform in both “normal and abnormal (accident)” environments. The data will help refine analytical models that will allow engineers at Sandia National Laboratories to evaluate existing components and to build whatever new hardware is necessary for the B61-12 conversion.
NNSA does not go into detail on the tests, except to say that it included the first tests of the integrated component and subsystem hardware, including the new B61-12 tail-kit assembly. The program tests subassembly and system-level mass properties and shock-and-vibration resistance. Last summer, NNSA announced the success of drop tests, to verify the performance of on-board radar systems (which include vacuum-tube components). Those tests were done by hoisting an unloaded bomb assembly into the air under a helicopter before releasing it to its gravitational fate.

Needville Independent School District Violates State Law With Suspension Of Five-Year-Old
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT: (212) 549-2666; media@aclu.org
HOUSTON – The American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Texas today filed a lawsuit against the Needville Independent School District (NISD) for punishing a five-year-old American Indian kindergarten student for practicing and expressing his family's religious beliefs and heritage by wearing his hair long in violation of school rules.
School officials have forced A.A. into isolated in-school suspension because he and his family refuse to abide by a district mandate that he stuff his long hair, part of his American Indian religious and cultural heritage, down the back of his shirt while at school - a requirement that would cause A.A. shame, embarrassment and physical discomfort.
"A.A.'s parents have raised him to practice and be proud of his religion and culture as an American Indian, which includes wearing his uncut hair in two long braids," said Lisa Graybill, Legal Director for the ACLU of Texas. "NISD recognized that A.A.'s religious beliefs exempt him from its dress code requirement that boys have short hair, but the alternate policy they adopted for him is still unlawful."
A.A.'s parents, Kenny Arocha and Micelle Betenbaugh, have raised their son according to his father's American Indian religious beliefs. Kenny and A.A. Arocha believe that one's hair should only be cut for life-changing occasions, such as the death of a loved one. They believe their long hair is a sacred symbol of their own lives. The five-year-old's hair has never been cut.
Nearly eight months after A.A.'s parents first requested an exemption from the district's dress code, and only after the family appealed the Needville School Board's initial denial, the district finally conceded less than a week before school started that A.A.'s long hair is part of his religious heritage and that he cannot be forced to cut it.
But instead of simply exempting him from that part of the dress code, NISD officials are requiring that A.A. keep his thick, foot-long hair "tightly woven" into a single braid and stuffed down the back of his shirt at all times, and to re-prove his religious sincerity to NISD officials every school year.
A.A.'s parents have refused to subject their son to this degrading and impracticable policy. His mother, Michelle Betenbaugh, said, "Asking a five-year-old to keep a foot of hair shoved down his shirt is not just humiliating, it is impractical and unhygienic in Houston's sweltering climate."
As punishment for non-compliance with its dress code policy, NISD has segregated A.A. from his kindergarten class and assigned him to in-school suspension every school day since Sept. 3. In-school suspension is the harshest discipline the law permits for a child his age.
"NISD is trying to force A.A. and his parents to choose between practicing and expressing his religion and identity, and obtaining a public education," said Fleming Terrell, staff attorney for the ACLU of Texas. "But Texas law and the First Amendment both prohibit the district from forcing parents and students to make this choice."
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, charges that NISD's actions violate Betenbaugh's and Arocha's rights to raise A.A. according to their family's religion, heritage and identity, as well as A.A.'s constitutional and statutory rights to free exercise of religion and free expression. Courts have held that the First and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution protect students' rights to dress in conformation with their religious beliefs. Texas' Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) provides additional protections.
"The Constitution protects the right of all people in this country to express their religious beliefs as they see fit," said Daniel Mach, Director of Litigation for the ACLU Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief. "The same law protects Catholic students who wear a rosary, Christian students who wear a cross or Jewish students who wear a Star of David. Yet the school board has ignored this basic principle by punishing this young child's expression of his faith and heritage."

On September 19th, 1989, a Libyan terrorist detonated a suitcase bomb on UTA Flight 772 over the Sahara desert, killing all 170 people on board.
Due to the remote resting place of the wreck, the wreckage is still scattered around the area, a glaring but out-of-sight reminder of the tragedy that happened there. After 18 years of it being nothing but a desert filled with debris, the families of the victims came together and decided to build a monument in one of the most remote places on the globe.
Funded with the 170-million-dollar aid package provided by the Libyan government, trucks were driven almost 44 miles out to transport countless stones to place at the crash site. After two months of grueling work in a brutal climate, the monument was complete. The stones when seen from above resemble a compass with a plane inside it.
Around the edge of the monument are 170 broken mirrors, each mirror symbolizing a victim in the crash. At one end of the monument, one of the plane's wings stands with its tip pointing up, with a plaque that lists the names of the victims.
Cyberattacks on the US from Russia have been gathering pace and a hack of the US presidential vote could spark post-election chaos, says Tim Stevens
Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images
It's been a busy summer for Russian hackers. After a series of high-profile data breaches and threats, questions are being raised about the vulnerability of November's US presidential election to cyber-interference and subversion.
July saw the leak of Democratic National Convention emails, which embarrassed the Clinton campaign by revealing accusations of the party's dirty tricks against Democrat rival Bernie Sanders. There was the infiltration of electoral registries in Arizona and Illinois, highlighting the insecurity of electronic voting systems. Both, arguably, boosted Donald Trump, the Republican nominee.
Investigations into these breaches implicate Russia's domestic and military intelligence agencies, the FSB and GRU, a charge Russia denies. But these claims have been unusually specific and backed with corroborating evidence. If true, they suggest Russia is unleashing new tools and tactics to pursue its objectives.

Could it affect the outcome of the US election? And how should we understand the apparent escalation in Russian state-sponsored hacking?
Real risk
A report this week by the US Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology details myriad ways in which hackers could infiltrate electronic voting systems, potentially influencing electoral outcomes. The Arizona and Illinois hacks show this is more than a hypothetical risk. However, it is unlikely that large-scale digital tampering required to swing a vote would go unnoticed, despite the antiquated systems involved.
Hackers are more likely to try to erode trust in the outcome by introducing unreliability and uncertainty into vote-counting. In the event of a close result, it might also make seeking a Supreme Court ruling seem more legitimate.
Again, this would presumably benefit Trump. Many of his supporters mistrust government infrastructure already. He is also the candidate most likely to make political capital out of such travails.
Aside from the technical attribution of recent hacks to Russian intelligence, these events also align with Russian foreign policy. Its “New-Generation” warfare, focused on subversion and interference, aims to achieve political outcomes that fit Russian interests, as seen in Estonia, Georgia, Ukraine and elsewhere.
Putin favours Trump
Interfering with the US election would tally with this, not least as President Putin has made no secret of his wish for Trump to win.
This is not through any deep personal admiration but because the probable destabilising effect of a Trump victory – not least his suggestion of radically redefining US foreign policy – would give Russia opportunities for strategic exploitation. Possible electoral manipulation is just one way to pursue this end.
Such activities are not entirely novel, of course, but Russia has been uniquely willing to deploy them and does so with apparent impunity.
The US government's reluctance to identify Russia as the culprit has only emboldened it. If the US has evidence of Russian involvement it should set this out in clear and unambiguous terms, as it has done in the past with China, Iran and North Korea. It must also warn, diplomatically, of the political consequences of further meddling in US internal politics.
It is technically feasible for foreign hackers to disrupt US electoral politics and processes, as recent events demonstrate, but vanishingly unlikely that such interference could directly engineer an election result.
However, Russia appears to be bold enough to try to shape the political environment through sophisticated technological means. The problem for the US and other democracies is how to respond to this growing threat.

Alex Brandon / AP Supporters cheer as they watch the results on television at the election night party for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe, Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2013, in Tysons Corner, Va.
Democratic businessman Terry McAuliffe defeated Republican Ken Cuccinelli to become Virginia's next governor after a contentious race that was closer than many political watchers anticipated.
With nearly all the votes tallied late Tuesday, McAuliffe edged out Cuccinelli by about two percentage points, with libertarian Robert Sarvis receiving around seven percent of the vote as a third-party candidate.
Terry McAuliffe talks about the challenges he will face as the next governor of Virginia.
Read the exit polls here (.pdf)
In his victory speech Tuesday night, McAuliffe pledged – in a show of bipartisanship - to reach out to every Republican in the state assembly before taking office.
"The truth is that this election was never a choice between Democrats and Republicans, it was a choice about whether Virginia would continue the mainstream bipartisan tradition that has served us so well over the last decade," he said.
Exit polls showed McAuliffe's support among women and in the Democrat-leaning northern part of the state was enough to top the state's attorney general in a race that had Cuccinelli fighting back against a litany of ads painting him as "too extreme" for the state's moderate voters. However, voters cited the economy and health care as the issues most important to them, and Cuccinelli beat his Democratic rival in both categories, helping to keep the contest tight throughout Tuesday evening.
McAuliffe's victory will have broad political implications for both parties. Republicans now face questions about a nominating process that produced a very conservative candidate in a state rapidly changing demographically. And for Democrats looking ahead to the 2016 presidential contest, the party now has a solid record of winning in this once-red state – not just in this gubernatorial race, but in the U.S Senate as well.
McAuliffe, a former political moneyman who failed to win the Democratic nomination for governor four years ago, received help from President Barack Obama as well as his good friends Bill and Hillary Clinton, who made multiple campaign stops on his behalf. The presence of the former president and onetime secretary of state is not just about a longstanding friendship with McAuliffe – should Hillary Clinton decide to run for president, having the support of a governor in a crucial swing state could prove to be a strong asset.
Likewise, Cuccinelli received support from Republicans who may be eying a 2016 presidential run, including Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky, as well as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.
Cuccinelli had distinguished himself as a conservative stalwart during eight years as a state senator and most recently as attorney general. The Republican embraced the ascendant Tea Party movement early on, winning accolades from conservatives for his legal challenges to Obamacare, abortion rights laws and climate change research.
But Cuccinelli's support for limiting abortion rights and a 2008 proposal that would have made it more difficult for women with children to obtain divorces helped McAuliffe make the case that the conservative was out of step with the state's moderate voters. Virginians were inundated with ads that dubbed Cuccinelli "too extreme for Virginia," a state which has become friendlier to Democrats in recent elections due to changing demographics.
Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli speaks to a crowd of supporters Tuesday after losing his bid to become the state's next governor.
Exit polling showed more than half of all Virginia women voted for McAuliffe, and 67 percent of voters who believe abortion should be legal supported him.
Cuccinelli also contended with backlash over the October government shutdown, which affected federal workers who reside in Washington's Northern Virginia suburbs and throughout the state. Democrats attempted to tie Cuccinelli to Tea Party-affiliated pols and in for his part, the GOP contender pushed instead to make the election a referendum on Obama's glitch-riddled health care rollout. Half of Virginians said Cuccinelli was too conservative, according to exit polling.
McAuliffe greatly outraised his GOP opponent handily, and Democratic allies poured $24 million to Cuccinelli's $17 million in TV advertising, according to NBC's First Read.
"Despite being outspent by an unprecedented $15 million, this race came down to the wire because of Obamacare," Cuccinelli said in his concession speech.
Cuccinelli's struggles to appeal to moderate stands in contrast to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, the big-name Republican who breezed to a projected re-election in his blue home state Tuesday.
Also on Tuesday, State Sen. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, won the lieutenant governor's race, while the attorney general's race between Republican Mark Obenshain and Democrat Mark Herring was too close to call late Tuesday.

Summer Slaughter, one of the world's biggest metal tours, is celebrating its tenth anniversary. Upstate New York metal fans were graced with its date at The Chance Theater in Poughkeepsie; the venue became packed the moment its 2 PM door time had arrived. Metal fans young and old from all over the tri-state flocked to this monstrous line up, which included Krisiun, Revocation, Suffocation, Nile and Cannibal Corpse.
Brazil's Krisiun brought on a machine gun performance only enhanced by their complex drumming and intense stage presence.
Revocation was the most techical band of the night but their love of music theory didn't prevent them from having tons of energy and a great setlist.
Sadly, Suffocation's iconic vocalist, Frank Mullen,could not make this tour. Instead they had Ricky Myers of Disgorge on vocal duties. Despite this, Ricky kept the crowd entertained.
Fans were worried about Nile's set; the band only had a 40 minute time slot and are known for having pretty long songs. These lovers of all things Egyptian didn't let that hurt their performance as they used their little time well with a crushing performance and played several great tracks such as Black Seeds Of Vengeance with a crisp sound fit for a Pharaoh.
The night ended with the one and only Cannibal Corpse. Almost everyone in the crowd had seen these guys live before, but the memories of those shows only made them come back for more. Like always, Cannibal Corpse had a great mix of newer and older songs and a crushing performance. Vocalist George “Corpsegrinder” Fisher wasn't afraid to show off his sense of humour. No matter how many times one sees these giants, it never gets old.
During the fest I was able to catch Suffocation guitarist Terrance Hobbs on his tour bus for an in person interview; we talked about subjects such as their upcoming album and promoted a very cool company called Distrokid.
How is Summer Slaughter going and how was this awesome lineup made possible?
Well, every band on the Summer Slaughter tour is really awesome. Thank you to all the people coming out and supporting these shows, I think it is fantastic. On how we got on this tour, we have known Cannibal Corpse, Nile, Krisiun, Revocation and all these bands throughout our history. We have played with them and toured with them a lot… Summer Slaughter was formed by word of mouth. We put into the hat and we pitched in and we saw how much Summer Slaughter would pay. With Suffocation we were able to budget it out to make it as comfortable as possible. I have to say thanks to Ash and everyone else who put together Summer Slaughter. This is the first one we have played, but it's the best one we have played due to the line up.
Which bands are you most excited to play with on this tour?
Pretty much every single one of them. Cannibal Corpse is always a staple of my diet, Nile, Krisiun, Revocation, and Carnifex all are as well, but everyone on this tour is great. I don't play favorites. Every genre has its share of great bands. I'm usually there to watch the whole thing instead of coming and going 'cause I'm a fan as well.
Are you guys working on any new music at the moment?
We have a whole new record that is pretty much written we just haven't had time to record any of it yet. It will be out on Nuclear Blast. We hate pushing things back, but we have always been touring. We just haven't had the time to be in the studio and record it. We have a whole new record written already and I can't wait for you guys to hear it. We have not titled it yet. We are looking for the best artists we can to give the record a great cover.
What's the style going to be like on this new record? You guys tend to evolve a lot.
It's pretty straight forward. There are quite a bit of guitar solos on it and quite a bit of aggressive everything. It's pretty much a standard Suffocation record. We try to capture in the studio what best represents the band at the time. I'm just going to tell you it rips.
What kind of set list are we expecting?
Like always it will be a mix of old school and new school stuff. We do not have much time on this bill since we aren't a headliner. We mix up the sets every day. You should just expect straight brutality, 'cause that is the way we always come off.
I noticed Frank hasn't been touring with you. Is this a permanent thing or will Frank return to touring with you guys again?
Frank has a full time job and he also has children. His life has relied on that job. As the economy tanks, it gets harder for him to get the time off he needs. It is a heart felt choice for Frank to not be on the road all the time. Plus he does not like traveling as much as I do. After all these years he got stuck with this life choice where he cannot be on the road all the time. There are only about two to two and a half weeks a year where he can really play shows. Unless it's a week or close to home you might see him,but if it's far away say like eight hours of flying, it would take him more time to get there to play then it would to get home. We try to utilize him as much as we can where he can play as many shows possible without wasting his time traveling. It is really hard for him, so we have Ricky Myers singing for us. I mean, Frank is not going out of Suffocation ever. He will always be part of the band as he is a focal point. He is also my fucking close friend. We made this shit together. In that kind of aspect it's a little different for us.
I heard a lot of fans like Ricky's vocals too.
Ricky is a great singer. He has good timing and his band Disgorge is awesome. Ricky is a good musician and Frank, knowing he couldn't do the tours, had heard something that Ricky had sent to us and told us to grab him. Ever since then, Ricky has done a hundred gigs with us at least. We are really happy to have him on board, he is a good dude.
I know when your second album Breeding the Spawn came out you guys were not proud of it at all. Do you still have the same feeling on it?
Oh Yeah! We just had a rough turmoil time with the band we didn't have an engineer to help us out. Roadrunner Records pretty much just rigged us cold. At that point in time we were still a young band in the industry. With that being said the real turmoil got transferred directly to your ear. To this day we hate thing so we try to do a Breeding the Spawn song re-recorded whenever we do a record. Look forward to hearing another on our next record.
Do you guys remember playing in the Hudson Valley area a lot during your early days?
Oh, yes I do. One of my favorite shows was playing The Class in Middletown with Lesch-Nyhan and Morpheus. Morpheus is now called Morpheus Descends, very cool guys. Human Remains from Jersey always played, very sick band. That band is great.
How do you feel the death metal scene in New York is now compared to back then?
We still have a bunch of death metal bands in New York. We have a lot of new death metal bands, black metal bands and hardcore bands. Nowadays New York City and Long Island is mostly hardcore. In terms of that we are still a little difference then a lot of those bands. Who you should check out is The Merciless Concept. They are a very good newer metal band from Long Island, heavy as shit! I also am always hearing about this band called Necroptic Engorgement. I still never heard the band, but I always hear their name. Maybe I should check them out!
To conclude, this I just want to mention one of our sponsors who are doing really good things for younger bands. The name of it is Distrokid. Dark Angel is even using them! A lot of other well known bands and musicians are using Distrokid. It is something to get you guys and your new music to all the streaming sites out there. They help to push smaller bands to keep all their publishing and all their royalties and things of that nature. So if you are in a new band and don't know what to do and have yourselves a CD, then I really think you guys should contact Distrokid. Very good people and the intention is to keep the money in the musicians' hands. Not in everybody else's so check it out!
From mammals to deep-sea shark fossils, spanning five continents and two oceans, these discoveries add to the family tree of life on Earth
SAN FRANCISCO (December 22, 2014) -- In 2014, researchers at the California Academy of Sciences added a whopping 221 new plant and animal species to our family tree, enriching our understanding of Earth's complex web of life and strengthening our ability to make informed conservation decisions. The new species include 110 ants, 16 beetles, three spiders, 28 fishes, 24 sea slugs, two marine worms, 9 barnacles, two octocorals, 25 plants, one waterbear, and one tiny mammal. More than a dozen Academy scientists--along with several dozen international collaborators--described the discoveries.
Proving that there are still plenty of places to explore and things to discover on Earth, the scientists made their finds over five continents and two oceans, ventured into remote caves and descended to the bottom of the sea, looked in their owns backyards (California) and on the other side of the world (Africa). Their results, published in 64 different scientific papers, help advance the Academy's research into two of the most important scientific questions of our time: "How did life evolve?" and "How will it persist?"
"Biodiversity scientists estimate that we have discovered less than 10% of species on the planet," says Dr. Meg Lowman, the Academy's Chief of Science and Sustainability. "Academy scientists tirelessly explore the unexplored regions of Earth--not only to discover new species, but also to uncover the importance of these species to the health of our natural systems. Our findings help to sustain the future of life for our children and grandchildren. Even in our own backyards," she adds, "new discoveries abound!"
New species of mammal found in Namibia
Scientists from the California Academy of Sciences discovered a new species of round-eared sengi, or elephant-shrew, in the remote deserts of southwestern Africa. It is the smallest known member of the 19 sengis in the order Macroscelidea. The team's discovery and description of the Etendeka round-eared sengi--Macroscelides micus--was published in the June issue of the Journal of Mammalogy.
While collecting and examining sengi specimens from southwestern Africa, Drs. Jack Dumbacher and Galen Rathbun found an unusual specimen they hadn't previously encountered. When preliminary genetic analysis showed important differences between this specimen and close relatives, the Academy scientists joined forces with an international team of experts to collect new wild specimens and compare their findings to existing museum collections worldwide. The collaborative research efforts--spanning several years and nine African expeditions--culminated in the confirmation of Macroscelides micus as a unique species.
Sengis are restricted to Africa and, despite their small size, are more closely related to elephants, sea cows, and aardvarks than they are to true shrews. Found in a remote area of Namibia, on the inland edge of the Namib Desert, scientists believe this new rust-colored species went undescribed for so long because of the challenges of doing scientific research in such an isolated area.
"With only about a dozen new species of mammal discovered in the wild each year, it is amazing that the Academy has been involved in describing three new sengis in the last decade," says Rathbun, one of the world's foremost experts on sengis and an Academy Fellow and Research Associate. "There are new and exciting insights into biodiversity awaiting discovery, even in a group as familiar as mammals."
An Etendeka round-eared sengi specimen is on display in the Namib Desert diorama exhibit in the Academy's African Hall, part of its natural history museum. For more information about sengis and their biology, visit http://www. sengis. org .
The Hero Ant of Madagascar
The island nation of Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot teeming with wildlife found nowhere else on Earth. Academy entomologist and renowned ant expert Dr. Brian Fisher has worked in the critically threatened region for more than 20 years, training local leaders to protect their country's priceless natural resources before they are lost forever.
2014 was a banner year for scientific exploration in Madagascar and mainland Africa. Fisher and his research team found and described 110 new species of ants and 4 new genera, with several additional findings slated for publishing in the coming year.
One species stands out against the stunning backdrop of entomological treasures: Malagidris sofina, or, "the Hero Ant." Armed with a host of special nest-building techniques and defense behaviors, the Hero Ant has adapted to its home (and threat of invaders) in fascinating ways. M. sofina lives in an environment with non-porous clay, and is thought to build a striking, funnel-like nest to promote oxygen exchange and protect its colony from suffocation.
While a heroic feat of insect engineering, this knack for nest architecture did not inspire the Hero moniker. Fisher and his colleagues painstakingly observed the species' bold defense against invaders--a behavior they call "cliff-jumping" in the journal Insectes Sociaux. As soon as a foreign ant approaches the funnel's entrance, a lone Hero Ant breaks from the colony and tackles the intruder, springing them both dramatically over the lip of the nest.
"Some arboreal ants have been observed taking to the air to avoid a predator, but no type of ant is known to sacrifice itself alongside an invader," says Fisher. "This remarkable species is one of thousands threatened by slash-and-burn agriculture in Madagascar. The more we know about this critically diverse region, the more we can do to help protect it."
Beneath the Sea
Academy scientists described a jaw-dropping 65 new species of ocean-dwellers--including a new type of 23-million year old megamouth shark (in the form of fossilized teeth)--in 2014 alone. Along with the new fossil shark, researches uncovered 20 new species of gobies, one cardinalfish, one toadfish, two grenadiers, one yellow damselfish, one pipefish, 24 colorful nudibranchs, a gigantic deepwater worm eel, two octocoral, nine new barnacles, two marine worms, and a ghost shark from New Zealand.
The gigantic deepwater worm eel--Pylorobranchus hearstorum, the largest of its kind--caught its namesakes by surprise. Aquatic biologist Dr. John McCosker, Emeritus Curator, discovered a single female specimen in a treasure trove of Philippine marine biodiversity called the Verde Island Passage. William and Margaret Hearst sponsored the massive 2011 Academy expedition to the region, said to be the "center of the center" of fish diversity, and were surprised to hear that a new species had been named for them.
"Some might be less than thrilled to have a gigantic worm eel named in their honor, but the Hearsts were delighted," says McCosker, acknowledging the Hearsts' commitment to ocean exploration in an era of great environmental change. "People don't think of eels as fish, but indeed they are! This discovery reminds us that there are many deep water creatures yet to be discovered, in the Philippines and beyond."
The new eel is called gigantic for good reason; at nearly 50 inches from head to tail, it is almost twice as long and three times heavier than any known worm eel. Pylorobranchus hearstorum is related to snake eels--aptly named for their snake-like appearance--and probably lurks at depths close to 1,000 feet beneath the ocean's surface. McCosker's find is the only specimen of its kind, highlighting our need to learn more about unique deepwater habitats and the life that thrives so far from the sun.
A "new" ancient shark unearthed close to home
The discovery of a new fossil relative of the megamouth shark came from a very different--and decidedly un-aquatic--habitat than that of the gigantic worm eel. Academy Research Associate Dr. Douglas Long calls the description of Megachasma applegatei, published in the March issue of the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, a discovery "decades in the making."
Throughout the 1960's and 1970's, paleontologists digging in California's Central Valley uncovered small, prehistoric shark teeth that looked markedly different from others on record. Moving from 23-million year old marine sediment sites to local museum collections, the fossilized teeth sat relatively unnoticed until a U.S. Navy boat hauled up an extraordinarily rare megamouth shark--Megachasma pelagios--off the coast of Hawaii in 1976. Once a formal description was published in 1983, scientists speculated that the fossilized teeth belonged to an ancient relative of the filter-feeding megamouth shark.
Without a formal study on record, the shark mystery remained unsolved for five decades. Scientists noticed privately owned fossils of the supposed ancestor's teeth popping up on online auction sites, and decided it was time to take action.
Long and a team of passionate researchers analyzed 67 teeth--carefully preserved in museum collections--from sites in California and coastal Oregon, and placed M. applegatei in its proper place on the shark tree of life. Study findings revealed that the megamouth's lineage extends far earlier in history than previously imagined, converging with another group of ancient sharks called Odontaspids that persist in today's oceans in the form of sand tiger and gray nurse sharks. With stronger lineage information and teeth from ancient and existing sharks for comparison, scientists suggest that megamouth sharks evolved from sharp-toothed fish-eaters before evolving into the small-toothed filter-feeders they are today.
From islands to the mainland: three new spiders
The tropical forests and reef-filled waters of Southeast Asia are renowned for their unique plants and animals--and now, three newly discovered ray spiders. Arachnologist Dr. Charles Griswold, Emeritus Curator, wasn't terribly surprised to find tiny orb-weavers from the family Theridiosomatidae in the dark, wet forests of Malaysia and the Philippines, but notes that few researchers have formally documented the region's wild spiders. Well-known spiders abound in local rice paddies, but the new ray species--about the size of a single, chunky grain of sand--are wild mountain-dwellers.
To solve the problem of spotting such small spiders in the wild, researchers use "puffers" filled with fine cornstarch to seek out characteristic webs near waterfalls and damp rock structures. Named for their ray-like (and incredibly diverse) webs, these spiders have a neat trick for catching prey.
"Ray spiders aren't filter feeders," says Griswold. "They tend to stretch their sticky webs into a cone-like shape, and hold on tightly while they wait for unsuspecting prey. Once spotted, they shake or let their webs fly out to catch a meal."
Griswold and his research team found the new genus Tagalogonia (with two novel species) on dormant Philippine volcanoes. Another new species--from a genus previously described in China--was discovered in the forested hills of Malaysia. The latter is the first new ray spider described from Malaysia in more than a century, shedding more light on the region's stunning biodiversity.

About Research at the California Academy of Sciences
This isn't what people usually mean when they say they've got a chicken heating up in the kitchen.
Harrison the chicken sits on a padded cushion on top of a heater, by the kitchen window, so that he can keep an eye on his companion, Clarice, and his enemy, a rooster named Alvin. Though he has long white feathers, Harrison is 6 years old and "he gets cold," his owner, Terry Cummings, explained.
Cummings and her husband, Dave Hoerauf, run one of the country's only farm-animal rescues, Poplar Spring Animal Sanctuary, on 400 acres in Western Maryland. The farm is only about an hour from the nation's capital, but with the trees and hills and chickens -- not to mention the lack of folks in khakis talking about the debt ceiling -- it seems much farther.
And speaking of chickens: In addition to Harrison and Clarice, plus Harrison's clucking nemesis, Alvin, Cummings and Hoerauf have some 60 other chickens of a variety of provenances. They fell off trucks, or came from animal shelters after backyard hen-keeping didn't work out for suburbanites. Some recent acquisitions had been mailed in a box to a man who decided he didn't want the chicks and just threw the box away. Then add in about a half-dozen turkeys, 40 pigs, 3 horses, several donkeys, 22 goats, 19 sheep and 11 cows, all of whom have names and many of whom also bear stories of abuse, neglect or lucky escapes from slaughter.
They've got it better these days. During a recent visit, a 1,000-pound pig named Patsy, who was removed from her home in North Carolina where she was being starved, was treated to a belly rub. And Sophie -- a newly arrived pig, still small -- snuggled with a teddy bear under a heat lamp before getting up for some treats. She'd been sold as a pot-belly to a family by a farmer at the side of the road; they quickly discovered that she wasn't as advertised and dispatched her elsewhere before she landed at Poplar Spring Animal Sanctuary.
"I taught her to sit!" Cummings said, holding out a banana to Sophie.
Cummings and Hoerauf opened the sanctuary in 1996. The pair had been renting a farmhouse dated to the 1730s on the site -- with Cummings commuting to D.C. to work as a veterinary technician at the National Zoo, and Hoerauf working in printing -- while the surrounding property was rented out to a beef cattle farmer. The couple got to know the animals. They developed relationships. Then one day the slaughter truck arrived.
“It occurred to me that my next hamburger could be one of my friends,” is how Cummings described this development to The Washington Post.
Meat exited the diet, and, after a long talk with the property's owner, rescued farm animals replaced the beef cattle. Over time, the land was donated by the couple's landlord -- the one who'd once rented property to the farmer whose animals were destined to be meat, and whose original lease, somewhat ironically, prohibited cats and dogs in the house.
"We didn't have any cats and dogs," Cummings said. "We had ducks and chickens."
There still aren't any traditional pets running around. (And, being vegan, the birds' eggs aren't eaten by humans; every day, they're collected and left in the woods for skunks and foxes.)
Poplar Spring specializes in animals that Cummings and Hoerauf say are often overlooked -- kids aren't generally taught to love cows and chickens, and even animal abuse laws generally exempt farm animals. So on top of caring for the 200-odd rescues who will live out their natural lives at Poplar Spring, the sanctuary is open to visitors such as school groups, as a way to promote the message that all animals, including farm animals, deserve humane treatment.
"Here they're treated with love and tenderness," Cummings said. "Of all the animals that need help, it seems like farm animals need it the most."
In a couple of weeks, on Nov. 23, the sanctuary will hold one of its annual events. It's a vegan potluck, where Poplar Spring's six turkeys get their own table -- in a twist on the usual Thanksgiving meal, visitors feed them.
One of the guests of honor this year will be a turkey named Perry, who arrived at Poplar Spring in 2012, on the night before Thanksgiving.
We received quite a Thanksgiving Day surprise when we discovered this beautiful boy turkey in a crate in the middle of our driveway late last night!! No note or phone call or any clue as to who brought him or where he came from. It is a mystery, but we will welcome him in to live happily here with our other rescued turkeys, who he will hopefully be friends with. Unlike the millions of other turkeys on this day, he is a very lucky guy.
You could think of this bird as a living, breathing, lucky feathered Thanksgiving parable. Or maybe he's a sign that the farm's outreach is having some effect.
Here's a video from the 2010 Thanksgiving with the Turkeys:

To cope with the food crisis, poor families often buy less food and less nutritious food. A WFP study shows that this brings a major health risk for children.
Amid the food and financial crises, many poor families in Central America reduce their spending by buying less food and choosing less nutritious food. In El Salvador, for example, WFP estimates 87% of poor households have reduced the quantity and quality of food consumed as a result of the increase in food prices.
The reduction in the quality of food is causing a major health risk for children, according to a WFP study entitled "Rises in Prices, Markets and Food and Nutritional Insecurity in Central America" (October 2008). The study highlights the risks that the urban poor, food producers, poor labourers and the rural poor face as a result of the current food crisis. Those especially at risk are children under the age of five, pregnant women, and breastfeeding mothers, the study says.
Costs began to rise
Midway through 2007, the cost of the household basket began to rise, triggering economic vulnerability and food insecurity among the population affected by poverty. According to the President of the World Bank, Robert Zoellick, this is a drawback in the fight against poverty, possibly "seven years lost" in the on-going fight.
Despite the fact that in the last months the food and oil prices have fallen considerably, they still remain substantially higher than when the crisis began. A reduction in prices in the international market does not necessarily result in an immediate reduction of prices in the local markets.
In El Salvador, the cost of the household basket has increased by 20% in urban areas and 27% in rural areas between January 2007 and August 2008. According to the Statistics and Census Bureau (DIGESTYC, January 2009) the cost of the household basket in 2009 was 18% higher in urban areas and 22% higher in rural areas when compared to prices in January 2007.
Falling remittances
In addition to the food crisis, the economic crisis in the United States is affecting El Salvador by reducing the flow of remittances sent by more than one million Salvadoran immigrants living in the US.
Remittances make up 18% of El Salvador's GDP, a net worth equivalent to 80% of the value of its exports. Not only does this reduction of remittances reduce the purchasing power of Salvadoran families but it also jeopardizes the families' investment in the future education of their children.
WFP has requested additional support from the donor community for its humanitarian programmes as well as for the local social protection programmes, such as the school feeding programme, which are essential tools in the fight against hunger and undernutrition.
Safety nets critical
Pedro Medrano, the WFP Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean, says the region, much like the rest of the world, is at a critical crossroads as far as the most vulnerable populations are concerned. "It would be a serious mistake if the current financial crisis were to translate into fewer funds (for social protection and safety net programmes) to face the already critical situation", he said.
The Chronicles of Elyria team has revealed that it will begin its KickStarter initiative on May 3, 2016. In a lengthy post on the site, Soulbound Studios Creative Director Jeromy Walsh remarks how the journey to create Chronicles of Elyria began years ago with a single step. To celebrate the big news, Soulbound has a first look video that features fantastic in-game footage.
Chronicles of Elyria is unquestionably one of the most pivotal games of the decade. It's a game which encourages massive player collaboration through new game mechanics such as contracts and an evolving story line. It encourages meaningful player decisions through a risk-reward system that truly forces players to make those tough decisions. It connects players to their characters in a way no MMO ever has, by bringing the human condition into the game.

NAPA — Charles Woodson will resume his Raiders career wearing his familiar No. 24.
Cornerback Tracy Porter, who wore No. 24 after being signed as an unrestricted free agent, said on his Twitter account Wednesday: “Well, you Raider fans . . . your guy has 24. It was TAKEN from me and given to him. #congrats . . . too funny how this biz works.”
Porter added a second tweet that said, “Not mad at all. It's just the principle and the way it was handled . . . said my piece, now back to football.”
Woodson wore No. 24 during his first seven seasons with the Raiders before being assigned No. 21 with the Green Bay Packers. With No. 24 taken after signing with Oakland as a free agent, Woodson revisited his college days at Michigan and wore No. 2 in practice.
NFL rules mandate defensive backs must wear jersey numbers from No. 20 through No. 39.
Woodson owns a Napa-based wine company called “Twenty Four Wines.”
Woodson and Porter had seemed to take the number issue in good fun during minicamps and OTAs, with Woodson talking about potential “negotiations” to get his number back.
What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time
When Brussels last month trumpeted the launch of its new rule book on failing banks, it could hardly have imagined the political backlash would come so swiftly, or that the regime could be blamed for so much market turmoil.
At the time they were agreed in 2014, these so-called “bail-in” reforms secured unanimous backing from EU governments, which wanted to shift the burden of bank rescues away from taxpayers and on to investors.
But the nascent regime is now under sustained attack from Italy for being ill-thought through, rushed and destabilising. Some analysts also cited it as one of several factors driving this week's volatility in European bank stocks. A messy round of forced bondholder writedowns at Portugal's Novo Banco last month heightened creditor jumpiness.
With European bank shares facing another tempestuous day on Thursday, these issues will be on the agenda of eurozone finance ministers at their regular Brussels gathering.
What are the rules?
Known in EU jargon as the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, the legislation is the centrepiece of efforts to avoid a repeat of the €1.6tn of taxpayer support to banks during the 2008 financial crisis.
It empowers regulators to intervene quickly when a bank is weak, avoiding the panic that could arise from a messy and prolonged insolvency procedure. The law took effect in 2015, but markets were given an extra year to adjust to the most controversial measure: tougher rules imposing losses on a failing bank's creditors, which kicked in on January 1.
This stipulates that 8 per cent of a bank's liabilities must be wiped out before any taxpayer support can be provided, placing unsecured senior bondholders and also large corporate depositors on the hook for forced losses, also known as bail-ins.
Why are the Italians so unhappy?
Matteo Renzi, Italy's premier, has complained about the new regime; Pier Carlo Padoan, his finance minister, described it as “an increase in instability, rather than stability”. Yet in practice it has never actually been used. What caused a stir were events in the run-up to its inauguration.
The Italian government was rocked in December when the rescue of four small regional banks saw thousands of pensioners lose their savings. Rather than being anything to do with the new EU rules, the writedowns were the result of earlier, less tough, European competition standards requiring only low-ranking creditors to take a hit.
This turned toxic in Italy because of a history of banks encouraging high-street customers to take out investment products — actually risky debt issued by the bank itself — instead of traditional deposits, raising questions about whether people actually understood the risks of what they were buying.
Italy also faces broader challenges. Rome last month agreed with the EU commission's powerful competition enforcers to launch a scheme of state guarantees to help its banks offload their heavy stockpiles of non-performing loans. While the plan was welcomed by investors, its design involved fractious negotiations between Rome and Brussels to find a blueprint that would not count as state aid that triggers the bail-in rules.
Is bail-in a culture shock for markets?
In the immediate aftermath of the 2008 crash, regulators shied away from imposing losses on senior creditors. Controversially, the European Central Bank in 2010 pressured Ireland not to write down seniors, hastening the country's path towards an international bailout.
The push for more senior bail-ins grew with the eruption of the euro-area debt crisis. When Cyprus was bailed out by governments in 2013, it became a test-case as large deposits were forcibly converted into Bank of Cyprus shares.
At the end of last year, Portugal's central bank wrote down around €2bn of senior bonds at Novo Banco, the new lender that emerged from the 2014 failure of Banco Espírito Santo. The move has provoked threats of lawsuits from investors who claimed that the central bank discriminated against them by imposing losses on certain bondholders and not others.
What changes with the new law is that senior bail-in becomes standard practice in the event of a big banking collapse, with common, formalised EU rules on how it should be conducted.
Lord Hill, the EU commissioner for financial services, told the FT that it would be “a bit of a stretch to put any change in global sentiment towards the banks in recent days down to the BRRD, given that it has been known about now for over 18 months”.
Nicolas Véron of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a US think-tank, said some unease stemmed from markets “only now waking up” to senior bail-in, and yet having no precedent to price that risk under the new regime.
What is the chance of the rules being changed?
Almost none. Mr Renzi is upset. But other EU governments have pinned their fiscal credibility on rigorous bail-in. Wolfgang Schäuble, Germany's powerful finance minister, was the main architect of the 8 per cent rule. And the ECB supports the rules; it has conspicuously failed to echo any Italian concerns.
The measures are also essential to the euro-area's ambitious “banking union” project to centralise supervision and crisis-management of its banks — a project credited with helping to take the sting out of the bloc's debt crisis. Mr Schäuble has in recent months called for further tightening of EU bank rules in general as a prerequisite to any further development of the banking union.
18 years later, friend arrested in cold case death of 20-year-old Texas woman

A Gainesville man has been indicted on a capital murder charge in an 18-year-old case.
Christopher Ax, 38, was indicted Wednesday in the March, 1997, death of 20-year-old Shebaniah Sarah Dougherty, according to Cooke County Sheriff Terry Gilbert.
Ax, who was arrested June 5 on the capital murder charge, was in the Cooke County Jail on Friday on $1 million bond. His attorney could not be immediately reached Friday for comment.
According to the arrest warrant, the Cooke County Sheriff's Department asked Texas Ranger James B. Holland earlier this year to assist in investigating the death of Dougherty, whose body was discovered March 30, 1997. An autopsy at the time determined she had been strangled.
As stated in the 33-page arrest warrant, Dougherty didn't come home March 28, 1997, after getting off work at the Movie Store in Gainesville. The next day her parents reported her missing to the Gainesville Police Department. On March 29, 1997, her car was found abandoned within a block of the Movie Store.
In a statement, Gilbert said Dougherty's body was found March 30, 1997, near an abandoned residence on what was then called Cooper's Crossing Road near County Road No. 218.
According to the arrest warrant, her body was found with some of her clothing removed. Despite an exhaustive search of the area, investigators never found her car keys or purse, believed to contain her identification, wallet and a small amount of cash.
In January of this year, the Cooke County Sheriff's Department reactivated the case in a combined effort with the Texas Rangers unsolved crimes investigation team, the Cooke County District Attorney's Office, the Gainesville Police Department, and Cooke County Constable Precinct 1 Office, Gilbert said in a news release.
After months of interviews, Ax eventually confessed, Gilbert said.
On March 26 of this year, Holland interviewed Dougherty's mother, who said her daughter was a "good girl that did not date, drink or use drugs." She said her daughter had a crush on a guy with "beautiful blue eyes."
The victim's sister told the Texas ranger that Sarah Dougherty had never kissed a boy, did not have a boyfriend but liked a boy named Chris Thomas, later determined to be Christopher Ax, the arrest warrant stated.
Norwood said Ax left town after Sarah's death and joined the army. He had recently returned to town and told Levi that he left because he was afraid he would be a suspect in Sarah's murder.
On April 9, Holland interviewed one of Cougherty's coworkers, who described her as a "pretty but simple girl that did not drink, do drugs or have a boyfriend."
Another coworker said Dougherty was very shy and very religious and liked a guy named Chris, whose last name she didn't know.
On April 20, Holland interviewed Ax, who told the investigator he had known Sarah as long as he could remember. At the time of her death, Ax lived about three blocks from the Movie Store and saw her almost every day on his way home from work, according to the arrest warrant.
Ax told Holland he didn't have sex with Dougherty and that they were just friends. When she was reported missing, he helped her father look for her.
Ax said he stayed in town until May 1998 when he went into the military.
Over the next month, Holland had several conversations with Ax. In the last one, a phone call on May 29, Ax said that, if he did anything to hurt Dougherty, it would have been self-defense.
He told the ranger he had been thinking about something but wasn't sure if was a memory or vivid imagination."
"You know like I said, 'If I did the crime I'm gonna do the time.' I have no issue with that," Ax told Holland, according to the arrest warrant. "This is about remembering for me what happened."

Back in March, we posted a video showing a rather high risk ferry docking at a Greek island port in less-than-ideal conditions. Here is another video seemingly showing the same vessel performing the same maneuver in similar conditions, although this time shot from better angle.
As the uploader points out, this is the roro passenger ferry Adamantios Korahs, performing a Mediterranean Mooring procedure (stern-to-dock) at the Greek Island of Sikinos in the Aegean Sea.
Sketchy? Yes. But residents of the Greek islands depend on the ferry system for vital deliveries of food, medicine and various other items. Needless to say, the Captain and crew are not about to get off schedule just because of a little wind and waves. Just another day in the Greek islands, I guess…
With a gain of 16 points in Sunday's Grand Prix, McLaren secures the WCC with a total of 387 points before the final race in Abu Dhabi next weekend.
Intense season coming to an end
With the final race of the inaugural season fast approaching, we can look back at an intensive season. Since the first race in mid July, every weekend has hosted a new GP, leaving very little time for teams to relax. “No doubt, it's been a long season, taking it's toll on us all. I think we're all looking forward to some well-deserved time off”, says McLaren Assistant Team Principal /u/jeppe96.
“I would like to thank everyone in the team for their contributions this season. We owe every single point we got this season to our regular members of the team. Our race crew in particular has done an amazing job”.
Drivers Championship to be decided in final race
Even though the Constructors Champion has been found, the WDC is still open to both Williams' Sebastian Vettel and McLaren's Fernando Alonso.
An excellent write-up by /u/lolsokje shows the championship scenarios. In short, anything but a win for Alonso will in all likelihood make Vettel the champion.
Vettel, who's gained the upper hand through some excellent drives in the last half of the season, is currently 10 points ahead of Alonso.

Before reading: mining any crypto currency in Azure is a verry bad idea! This article explains why
Update: I have reports that this is being actively blocked by Azure. This was always intended for testing purposes not for actual production mining
Last post I wrote about setting up a simple mining instance in Azure using the GPU instances. As seen the efficiency was very low. However this topic sparked a lot of interest, so I decided to give it another try this time focusing on getting higher efficiency from the rig.
I believe this might be possible due to more efficient miners, tuning the mining parameters and fully using all machine resources CPU and GPU.
Let's get started!
I will use windows instead of Linux and change the way I measure the hashes per second so please do not compare results with my previous post
Most miners are leveraging Cuda and other optimization techniques, this also gives the user the possibility to customize miner settings. With this in mind I wanted to build a script which tries all parameters of a miner within certain limits to find the optimal mining settings. With this I wanted to see if I could raise the efficiency and see how big the difference is between base settings and possible optimized settings.
Secondly, last blog post I described how disappointing it was to see that not all the available CPU power was used in the VM. When using this to mine Ethereum there was literally no effect: the CPU was simply not fast enough to contribute. So this time I wanted to take a look at other coins which run better on CPU instead of only GPU. I have chosen Monero for this, which is also a large coin and has CPU optimized miners.
Hardware to use
In the previous post I used the K80 and M60 Nvidia GPU this, when available I will also use the P100 and P40 GPU and make a new post. I will also test the script on consumer PC hardware to compare this to the cloud GPUs.
How does the program work?
I have written this optimization script in Nodejs, which in turn spawns child processes with the miner. I have used windows so the commands needs to be adjusted a little to work on Linux. This is an easy fix. I have tested and it worked. I am using both Ethminer and Claymore which are also packaged in the optimization script so no need to install or anything.
You can find the code here but below is an easily readable version on how the optimizer works:
Step 1. Create an array with all parameter names and possibilities. Step 2. Loop trough all possibilities and start a miner with the certain options. Step 3. Save the Log output of the miner to a file. Step 4. Analyse the outcome and start the miner with the best parameter settings. To run until VM is shut down.
Did this really work?
VM Name Default Min Optimized % default optimized NC6 8.76 8.10 17.04 1.95 NC12 18.66 7.44 24.62 1.32 NC24 30.95 26.37 36.77 1.19 NV6 10.54 9.40 24.62 2.34 NV12 23.09 19.86 26.39 1.14 NV24 39.96 26.14 41.1 1.03 GTX1060 19.41 19.71 41.10 2.12
Final parameters which I have found:
VM paramters NC6 ethminer.exe -U --cuda-parallel-hash 8 --cuda-block-size 256 --cuda-streams 8 --cuda-grid-size 65536 NC12 ethminer.exe -U --cuda-parallel-hash 8 --cuda-block-size 256 --cuda-streams 4 --cuda-grid-size 65536 NC24 ethminer.exe -U --cuda-parallel-hash 8 --cuda-block-size 256 --cuda-streams 8 --cuda-grid-size 65536 NV6 ethminer.exe -U --cuda-parallel-hash 8 --cuda-block-size 256 --cuda-streams 4 --cuda-grid-size 131072 NV12 ethminer.exe -U --cuda-parallel-hash 8 --cuda-block-size 256 --cuda-streams 4 --cuda-grid-size 65536 NV24 ethminer.exe -U --cuda-parallel-hash 8 --cuda-block-size 128 --cuda-streams 4 --cuda-grid-size 65536
I have tested both the Ethminer and the Claymore miner, however in all cases the Ethminer performed better.
As you can see the performance gains are very significant so it really pays to spend time to optimize your miners. Unfortunately this does not come near to a profitable solution.
Trying to get some extra cash from the CPU
In previous post I tried to get some extra revenue by using the CPU to mine Ethereum, this failed horribly. So I searched for coins that do not place too harsh of a penalty on mining with CPU, for that I turned to Monero. The miner I am using is the XMR stak miner, my first thought would be that this would get a way higher yield then Ethereum mining.
Regardless of the machines I got roughly 30H/s per core and this scaled completely linear. This would result in roughly $0.09 per day per core. So again this made no sense at all.
Big fail again.
Conclusion
Working with these technologies is really cool, and tuning does really give you a better performance however it is still very far from being profitable. Next step will be to test te same script on the new GPU which will launch coming months in Azure. This might be more profitable when using on personal rigs.
Will keep you posted
As seen this is very inefficient I do not encourage doing this for actual mining, even if you have left over Azure credits.
After spending the last year quietly being tested by over 300 select organizations, Facebook's enterprise version of its social network, Facebook at Work, will roll out in the coming months, company spokeswoman Vanessa Chan said yesterday.
Facebook at Work is aimed at businesses and their employees, and on the surface looks almost identical to the ‘traditional' Facebook layout. It has a scrolling newsfeed, posts that can be 'liked', timelines, groups, events, the ability to follow and interact with co-worders, and a built-in chat service.
"I would say 95 percent of what we developed for Facebook is also adopted for Facebook at Work," Julien Codorniou, director of global platform partnerships at Facebook, told Reuters. Although he did say that you wouldn't be able to play Candy Crush on the platform, as games aren't part of the package.
A lot of companies are fighting to become the number one social network for the enterprise market, such as Microsoft's Yammer, VMWare's Socialcast, Salesforce Chatter, and Jive. But one big advantage for Facebook is that the vast majority of people are already familiar with how it works.
In addition to all the features and options Facebook at Work brings from the consumer version of the site, the company is also developing exclusive products for this professional version, including security tools, Codorniou said.
Those using Facebook at Work will have their business and personal profiles kept separate, so what they share on their work account will only be seen by people in the company and anything they put on their personal account will only be visible to their friends (based on privacy settings).
During the last 12 months of its testing phase, Facebook for Work has been a free, ‘invite-only' service. Once it's launched and open to all companies it will still be free, but Facebook plans to charge “a few dollars per month per user” for premium services such as analytics and customer support, a company spokesperson said.
Some of the companies that have been beta-testing the service include Heineken, Royal Bank of Scotland and jewelry firm Stella and Dot. French resort company Club Med plans to offer Facebook for Work to all its 13,000 employees through summer 2016, according to Anne Browaeys-Level, Club Mediterranee's chief marketing & digital officer.
If the service proves popular, it could mean that workers won't have to hide the fact that they're on Facebook from their boss anymore - as long as it's the professional version.

Prior to the debut of the Hulk in May 1962, Marvel had earlier monster characters that used the name "Hulk", but had no direct relation. Debuting in Strange Tales #75 (June 1960), was a huge robot built by Albert Poole called the Hulk, which was actually armor that Poole would wear. In modern-day reprints, the character's name was changed to Grutan . [176]

Like my friend and sometimes colleague Harold Pollack of the University of Chicago, I've tended to get a lot angrier at Mitt Romney for policy positions that will undoubtedly hurt millions of American than for the past practices of Bain Capital that hurt thousands. So I note with interest Harold's latest piece at Ten Miles Square, where one piece of information about Bain got his attention in a big way:
The story comes from the Crooks and Liars website citing a story by Jason Cherkis and Zach Carter at Huffingtonpost, via UCSF's essential library of Legacy Tobacco Documents. The story concerns Bain's role helping Philip Morris in the U.S., and helping British American Tobacco hawk cigarettes in post-Soviet Russia. Mitt Romney was the CEO who oversaw this business….
Bain provided a variety of strategic services and advice for Philip Morris, including this nugget from Huffingtonpost:
“In one document labeled ‘Corporate Affairs,' Bain argues that the cigarette maker needs a ‘coordinated, long-term approach to legal/regulatory/public opinion opportunities and challenges to maximize shareholder wealth.'
“Bain's advocacy amounted to an early example of corporate ‘astroturf' tactics that are now commonplace…. In the same ‘Corporate Affairs' document, under ‘mobilizations,' Bain consultants encourage the company ‘to conduct federal and local grassroots programs in support of the company's legislative and regulatory efforts.'
For one such mission, Bain called on the company ‘to initiate and execute programs to support smokers' rights, combat regulatory moves and improve corporate image.'”
And as Harold notes, smoking is a big part of the ongoing public health nightmare in post-Soviet Russia.
He concludes:
Bain is hardly the only firm to court tobacco money. It still deserves scorn for being an enthusiastic partner in the sale of addictive products that damage and shorten millions of lives. To my mind, helping tobacco companies sell cigarettes and evade regulatory constraints is no better than orchestrating a plant closing, breaking implicit contracts with employees, and the other catalog of questionable activities Bain is accused of having done.
This story is important for its own sake. Tobacco also reveals the amorality with which too many entrepreneurs and firms approach the business enterprise.
Need we add that Mitt Romney belongs to a church that has particular objections to tobacco use?
Guess if it's legal, it's “wealth-creation,” right? And that's always beyond questioning.
Excerpt: "Obama has decided to campaign as the anti-Romney," and "Romney has decided to campaign as the anti-Obama. ... Neither candidate wants to take any chances by offering any large, serious proposals. Both are banking instead on negative campaigns that convince voters the other guy would be worse."

Anti-Election of 2012
By Robert Reich, Robert Reich's Blog
he the worst economy since the Great Depression and you might think at least one of the candidates would come up with a few big ideas for how to get us out of it.
But you'd be wrong. Neither candidate wants to take any chances by offering any large, serious proposals. Both are banking instead on negative campaigns that convince voters the other guy would be worse.
President Obama has apparently decided against advancing any bold ideas for what he'd do in the second term, even if he has a Congress that would cooperate with him.
He's sticking to a worn script that says George W. Bush caused the lousy economy, congressional Republicans have opposed everything he's wanted to do to boost it, it's slowly on the mend anyway, the Bush tax cuts shouldn't be extended for the rich, and we shouldn't take a chance electing Romney.
Yet the public wants bigger ideas from the President, and wants to know what he'll do in his second term to get us out of this mess. A New York Times-CBS News poll released last week showed that a majority of voters believe the president "can do a lot about" the economy. That's a double-digit jump from the fall of 2011.
The President could propose a new WPA, modeled after the Depression-era jobs program that hired hundreds of thousands of jobless Americans to rebuild the nation's infrastructure, or a new Civilian Conservation Corps.
He could suggest permanently exempting the first $25,000 of income from payroll taxes, and making up the lost revenues by eliminating the ceiling on income subject to it. He could propose resurrecting the Glass-Steagall Act and breaking up the big banks, so Wall Street doesn't cause another financial collapse.
But you won't hear any of this, or anything else of this magnitude, because the White House doesn't want to take any risks. Polls give Obama a slight edge in the critical eight or so battleground states, so, the thinking goes in the Obama camp, why say anything that might give Romney and the GOP a target?
Besides, polls also show Romney isn't well-liked by the electorate.
So Obama has decided to campaign as the anti-Romney.
Mitt Romney is playing it even more cautiously. His economic plan is really a non-plan: more tax cuts for the rich, undefined spending cuts, and no details about how he'd bring down the budget deficit. No presidential candidate since Herbert Hoover in 1928 has been more vague about what he'd do on the critical issues facing the nation.
Romney's advisors assume Obama can't possibly be reelected with the economy this bad. Just 44 percent of registered voters in a Washington Post-ABC News poll earlier this month approves of the job the president is doing on the economy, while 54 percent disapprove. Even more encouraging for Romney is that 41 percent of those polled "strongly" disapproved of Obama's economic performance, while just 21 percent "strongly" approved — an enthusiasm gap of major proportion.
So Romney's advisors have concluded that all Romney has to do between now and Election Day is avoid a mistake that might give Obama and the Democrats something to shoot at.
Romney has decided to campaign as the anti-Obama.
The two anti-the-other-guy strategies fit with a ton of negative advertising that's just begun but will reach mammoth proportions after Labor Day. Much of it will be financed by super-PACs and by political fronts already taking in hundreds of millions of dollars in secret donations. Romney's camp hopes to out-negative Obama by almost two to one.
So whatever happens on Election Day, the next president will have to contend with two handicaps. The public won't have endorsed any new ideas or bold plans, which means he won't have a clear mandate to do anything on the economy.
The only thing the public will have decided is it fears and distrusts the other guy more. Which means the winner will also be burdened by almost half the electorate thinking he's a scoundrel or worse.
The worst economy since the Great Depression, but we're in an anti-election that will make it harder for the next occupant of the oval office to do a thing about it.

The European Commission has rejected a plea to abolish animal research across the European Union, saying that doing so would harm biomedical research.
On 3 March, a so-called European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) signed by 1.17 million signatories formally urged the commission to scrap a 2010 directive regulating the use of animals in scientific research and to propose new rules phasing out animal research in favor of “more accurate, reliable, human-relevant methods.” In reaction, many science organizations and a group of Nobel laureates spoke out in defense of animal research.
The commission had until yesterday to consider turning the ECI, called Stop Vivisection, into legislation. In its official response, the commission broadly sides with animal research advocates. As to the petition signers, “we agree with your goal, we share your belief that animal testing should be phased out,” budget commissioner Kristalina Georgieva said after a meeting of the College of Commissioners in Brussels yesterday. However, “it is premature at this stage to abruptly put a stop to animal testing because too many scientific advances are dependent on this form of testing,” Georgieva told reporters.
Several scientists and research organizations praised the decision to stick with the existing E.U. legislation on the protection of research animals, saying it is drafted to help reduce, refine, and replace the use of animals in the lab. “Animal welfare in research settings has made such great strides that the arguments of antivivisection groups have become largely baseless,” said Jan Schnupp, professor of neuroscience at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, in a statement relayed by the Science Media Centre in London. “Hopefully we can start to put their propaganda behind us and celebrate and honor the high ethical standards and the enormous scientific achievements of the biomedical research community.”
The commission said it will seek to speed up the development and uptake of alternative methods, and to better monitor compliance with the directive in member states. But animal welfare groups say that's not enough. The Eurogroup for Animals in Brussels, for one, “is very disappointed that there is not even a minimal commitment to funding alternatives under programmes like [the E.U.'s research funding program] Horizon 2020 in the Commission's Communication.” In particular, “more investment is needed in other areas [than toxicology], such as biomedical research,” which accounts for about two-thirds of animal tests in Europe, said the Eurogroup for Animals' Director Reineke Hameleers in a statement yesterday.
This is the third ECI submitted to the commission since this tool for direct democracy was introduced 3 years ago. (The second one also focused on scientific research: It sought to ban E.U. funding for research on embryonic stem cells.) All three initiatives have now been rejected, adding to the discontent of citizens' groups that say that ECIs lack teeth and that their rules are impractical.
Say, what do you do when your colleague at work struggles to produce his quota? If he's a buddy, you help him out — right? Well, that's all Detective Stephen Anderson did in New York, helping out his friend Henry Tavarez when his drug-arrest quota dropped too low. Anderson admitted in court that he planted cocaine on innocent people to boost Tavarez' arrest numbers — and so did a lot of other police officers (via Instapundit):
Anderson, testifying under a cooperation agreement with prosecutors, was busted for planting cocaine, a practice known as “flaking,” on four men in a Queens bar in 2008 to help out fellow cop Henry Tavarez, whose buy-and-bust activity had been low. “Tavarez was … was worried about getting sent back [to patrol] and, you know, the supervisors getting on his case,” he recounted at the corruption trial of Brooklyn South narcotics Detective Jason Arbeeny. “I had decided to give him [Tavarez] the drugs to help him out so that he could say he had a buy,” Anderson testified last week in Brooklyn Supreme Court.
Just how much did Anderson want to help Tavarez? Not enough to let Tavarez take credit for his own two legitimate busts that night in the same bar. Hey, Anderson had to make his own quota too, you know. Fuhgeddaboudit.
Anderson went on to testify that he personally witnessed the planting of drugs on innocent people “multiple times” as a method to boost arrests and meet quotas. Did it bother him? Not really. He was “seeing a lot of” the practice, even from supervisors. Besides, Anderson told the court, nothing happened to people busted for possession, so what's the big deal? Yes, nothing — except having to hire a lawyer and hope that a judge or a jury would take the word over an accused druggie over a uniformed cop in court. I'm sure American justice prevailed in those cases and that none of those framed don't have convictions on their records now, records that will follow them for the rest of their lives.
The first impulse is to blame this on the war on drugs, and claim that a repeal of prohibition will end these practices. They certainly will in narcotics enforcement, but I'm not so sure that the root cause of this is the war on drugs. This quota-driven approach to law enforcement isn't just limited to drug laws, and it represents a kind of corruption that's even harder to find and extinguish than graft. For the anti-prohibitionists, though, it does serve as an argument that far too much of police effort and attention (at least in New York City) gets directed at users rather than, say, rape, murder, and armed robbery. None of this instills much confidence in the police force, and now the state of New York will have to revisit every drug case over the past several years to find and address the miscarriages of justice that occurred thanks to this environment. That's not going to help the cause of real law enforcement.

James says Fox Sports hit him with a "sucker punch" _ inviting him to join a regional college football show, then firing him and telling the media he was too polarizing for TV. The longtime broadcaster and SMU star has accused Fox of discriminating against him due to his views opposing gay marriage, which he stated during a failed campaign two years ago for U.S. Senate. (AP Photo/Pat Sullivan, File)
Former NFL player Craig James continued to speak out against gay marriage this week, saying most recently support for such is equal to Satanism.
“If I were a current player in that locker room and my livelihood depended on me being quiet or losing it because of my belief system, I worry, I wonder,” James said Monday on a radio program broadcast by the staunchly conservative Family Research Council.
He continued, “So, that's Satan working on us.”
James, a running back who played for the New England Patriots in the late-1980s, made the comments after the NFL franchise along with the MLB's the San Francisco Giants and Tampa Bay Rays, joined 376 other businesses and companies that called upon the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down bans on gay marriage.
James, who joined FRC in 2014, said those who support gay marriage "have a problem with God."
It isn't the first time James has waded into the political arena. In 2011, James left his job as an analyst for ESPN after he announced and ran a failed bid for a U.S. Senate seat in Texas, which Republican Sen. Ted Cruz ultimately won.
During the race, however, James was fired after just one-week as a college football analyst for Fox Sports Southwest. The network said it was due to James' anti-gay stance that the player expressed during his campaign.
Among other comments, James said in a debate that it is a choice to be gay and people who are will have to "answer to the Lord for their actions," according to the Houston Chronicle.
"We just asked ourselves how James' statements would play in our human resources department. He couldn't say those things here," a spokesman for the company said at the time, the paper reported.
James' most recent remarks come less than a week after New York Mets player Daniel Murphy also came out against the gay "lifestyle."
“I disagree with the lifestyle,” Murphy told the Daily News. “But that doesn't mean I wouldn't love a teammate who is gay. I was glad he was here today and to hear his story.”
Murphy, also a devout Christian added that he "completely understand[s]" why those who say being gay is not a choice "would take issue with [his] beliefs, that it is a lifestyle."
He continued, "I feel like acceptance, embracing -- that falls short. You understand what I'm saying? I love this person. The same way I love my wife, even though I don't always agree with everything she does, I love her."
WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions is making light of the grilling he's received over contacts with Russians.
Sessions opened a speech Friday to the conservative Federalist Society by asking if the former Russian ambassador was in the room. Sessions recused himself from the Justice Department's investigation into Russia's election meddling after acknowledging two encounters with the ambassador that he had not previously disclosed.

There have been suggestions Sessions had a third, unreported contact with the ambassador in April 2016, at Washington's Mayflower Hotel. That's where Sessions spoke Friday.
“Before I get started here. Any Russians? Anybody been to Russia?”
“Before I get started here. Any Russians? Anybody been to Russia?”
The crowd roared with laughter.
In testimony to Congress this week, Sessions displayed a hazy memory of the campaign's dealings with Russians in the election, denying he ever lied about those contacts.
The FBI expert in the middle of a political uproar for mocking President Trump in email messages changed a key phrase in former agency Director James Comey's description of how Hillary Clinton handled classified information, it was reported Monday.
Records show Peter Strzok, who led the investigation of Clinton's private email server as the second-highest-ranking official in the counterintelligence division, changed Comey's draft language describing Clinton's behavior as “grossly negligent” to “extremely careless,” a source told CNN.
The shift from “grossly negligent” to “extremely careless” was key because the federal law that covers how classified material should be handled calls for criminal penalties for “gross negligence.”
Writing the memo was a team effort, with numerous officials weighing in and suggesting changes, sources say.
Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) questioned the change last month, but the name of the agent who made the edit was not known until now.
Meanwhile, the Daily Caller reported that Strzok interviewed two former Clinton staffers who gave apparently inaccurate statements about her use of a private email server but did not face legal consequences.
Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin both said they were unaware of Clinton's server when they were interviewed by Strzok — despite the fact that they were involved in emails that talked about a server.
“Mills did not learn Clinton was using a private server until after Clinton's [Department of State] tenure,” read notes from Mills' May 28, 2016, interview, as obtained by the Daily Caller. “Mills stated she was not even sure she knew what a server was at the time.”
Abedin said she didn't know about Clinton's server until she left the State Department in 2013.
“Abedin did not know that Clinton had a private server until about a year and a half ago when it became public knowledge,” the summary of Strzok's interview with Abedin states.
But in an email on Feb. 27, 2010, Mills asked Abedin “hrc email coming back — is server okay?”
During a House Judiciary Committee hearing in September 2016, then-FBI Director Comey defended the conflicting statements.
“Having done many investigations myself, there's always conflicting recollections of facts, some of which are central [to the investigation], some of which are peripheral,” Comey said.
CNN also reported that Strzok was the FBI official who signed the document that launched the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
He was taken off the probe after emails he wrote to another agent apparently mocking Trump came to the attention of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is heading the investigation.
The president took to Twitter over the weekend to slam the agent. “Tainted (no, very dishonest?) FBI ‘agent's role in Clinton probe under review.' Led Clinton Email probe. @foxandfriends Clinton money going to wife of another FBI agent in charge.”

A bid to stop a Cardiff man from being deported to Afghanistan has failed.
Bashir Naderi, 20, has lived in Wales for 10 years, after his mother paid traffickers to bring him to the UK.
His deportation was temporarily halted by a judge hours before he was due to board the plane in October and a 14,000-signature petition was handed into the Home Office in January.
But girlfriend Nicole Cooper said they are "devastated" his leave to remain in the UK has been refused.
She added their solicitor delivered the news on Wednesday but the couple are still waiting to see the Home Office documents.
The Home Office said it did not comment on individual cases.
"I was in work and my mum rang me at 3pm to say the solicitor had contacted Bash," Miss Cooper told BBC Wales.
"We had a call from the solicitor giving more detail, she was in London. It was that he hadn't been granted leave by the Home Office. We're waiting to see the document she received.
"Bash's solicitor is still fighting this, there are grounds for another appeal."

Mr Naderi fled from Afghanistan at the age of 10 after his father was killed by the Taliban.
He went to school in Cardiff and speaks with a local accent.
"He's not taken it well," added Miss Cooper. "He is devastated and has been upset about the whole thing.
"We genuinely weren't expecting it, we thought we had a good chance."
Among the thousands of people to sign the petition were Welsh singers Charlotte Church and Cerys Matthews, as well as local MP Jo Stevens.
The Forth Rail Bridge is often described as one of the wonders of the industrial world. Over 400 photographs in National Records of Scotland document the construction of this Scottish icon.
Taken by assistant engineer Evelyn Carey (1858-1932) throughout the bridge's seven year construction, the glass plate negatives give a unique account of progress on the Forth Rail Bridge, from the building of parts on drill roads to almost completed spans of the bridge.

The bridge was designed by Sir John Fowler (1817-1898) who had extensive experience of railway engineering throughout the world, and Sir Benjamin Baker (1840-1907), an expert in long span bridges and Fowler's chief assistant. Following the Tay Bridge disaster in 1879, the construction of a railway bridge to cross the Forth was suspended. The previous design by the Tay Bridge engineer, Thomas Bouch (1822-1880), was no longer deemed safe and a commission was tasked with considering alternative schemes. In 1881 Fowler and Baker were appointed to engineer their proposed cantilever design. Work commenced in 1883 on the massive steel structure which would become one of the greatest accomplishments in engineering. Each of the three cantilever towers are over 330ft tall and are embedded in granite piers. At the time, the Forth Bridge possessed the longest cantilever span in the world.

It has been calculated that 63 lives were lost during construction on the bridge, perhaps a surprisingly small number considering the work involved, the massive heights and the time spent by construction workers below sea level. The huge scale of the structure, the work and the risks involved are well documented in Carey's photographs.

The Carey photographs are amongst the tens of thousands of British Railways Board records held by NRS. Other documents relating to the Forth Rail Bridge are two volumes of prints (reference BR/LIB/9/49 and 50) and a small collection of photo albums featuring construction workers and members of the Iron and Steel Institute, 1884-1885 (reference GD1/1346). Parliamentary bills and evidence can also be a useful source of information as they contain very detailed engineering information (several concerning the Forth Rail Bridge can be found in series BR/PYB/S/1). Some technical drawings may also be found amongst the NRS collection of maps and plans. For more details, search the online catalogue.

The original photographs are too fragile for consultation but surrogate copies may be made available in the Historical Search Room. Select copies are also available from the NRS Image Gallery.
A federal judge will hear arguments Tuesday over whether a Watergate-era law prohibiting the government from collecting data on how Americans exercise their First Amendment rights bars President Trump's Election Integrity Commission from American's voting records.
U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth of the District set the hearing Monday after Common Cause, a nonprofit government watchdog group, alleged that the Trump administration was violating the Privacy Act of 1974 by seeking the “quintessentially First Amendment-protected political party affiliation and voter history data” of every American.
The court could rule on the request for a temporary restraining order as early as Tuesday.
The action marks the latest attempt by opponents to block the commission's request for the voting information of more than 150 million registered voters. Trump created the commission after alleging that widespread fraud cost him the popular vote in November.
State leaders from both parties have voiced objections to the effort's potential to reveal personal information, suppress voter participation and encroach on states' oversight of voting laws.
Administration officials have said 30 states have agreed to share at least some data, adding that the commission requested only publicly available data and would anonymize any information it released.
[Trump's voter-fraud commission wants to know voting history, party ID and address of every voter in the U.S.]
Earlier in July, another federal judge in Washington rejected an effort by the Electronic Privacy Information Center to block the commission's request. That judge ruled that the commission is not required to review the proposal's impact on privacy because it is a White House advisory panel exempt from such requirements. EPIC has appealed that ruling by U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly.
The Common Cause suit takes a different tack, arguing that the commission's request is substantively unlawful, not just procedurally flawed.
The suit alleges that the commission, led by Vice President Pence, with Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) as vice chairman, recently described new actions that it planned to take that make it less of an advisory board and more like a federal agency.
For example, the lawsuit states that at the commission's first public meeting July 19, Kobach compared its work to an Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck program that he runs as Kansas' chief elections official, under which 30 states pool data to identify, purge, and potentially prosecute voters registered in two states.
The suit claims that Kobach also directed staff to collect “whatever data there is” within the federal government that “might be helpful” to the investigation, including information kept by the departments of Justice and Homeland Security and U.S. Census Bureau, including data about individuals' immigration and citizenship status.
The suit also names as defendants DHS and the Social Security Administration, which keeps records of individuals' deaths.
[Federal judge allows Trump commission's nationwide voter data request to go forward]
“Most of the time, advisory bodies call experts … they don't themselves assemble a national voter file with personal identifying information on more than 100 million people … or broadly compare hundreds of millions of records against data sets of hundreds of millions of other records, ” said Loyola University law professor Justin Levitt, a former U.S. Justice Department civil rights division attorney in the Obama administration who has questioned the commission's request.
“That is much closer to what other agencies might do in the course of their official duties … such as conducting law enforcement duties,” Levitt said.
A spokesman for the commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Monday.
In a statement, Karen Hobert Flynn, president of Common Cause, said, “The commission cannot be trusted, it has already shifted its explanation on where, and how, this First Amendment protected data will be stored. This is an attempt to evade post-Watergate privacy laws and undermines our electoral system and the privacy rights of millions of Americans.”
Trump formed the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in May after repeatedly suggesting that millions of illegal voters cost him the popular vote against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Studies and state officials of both parties have found no evidence of widespread voting fraud.
[Why almost every state is partially or fully rebuffing Trump's election commission]
Trump has championed the commission's work as a way to “strengthen up voting procedures” by identifying “vulnerabilities … that could lead to improper voter registrations and improper voting.” Conservative board members have advocated stricter federal election laws, alleging that a bias in U.S. enforcement has benefited liberals.
The panel's June 28 letter to the states requested that they turn over “publicly available voter roll data,” including names, addresses, dates of birth, party registrations, partial Social Security numbers and voting, military, felony and overseas histories, among other data.
On July 10, the White House clarified that it had scrapped plans to use a Pentagon-operated website to accept the data and had designed a system inside the White House to take the submissions.
[Trump's voter commission hasn't even met — and it's already off to a rough start]
Critics said the proposal would increase privacy risks to every registered voter, including in particular military families whose home addresses would be revealed, people whose partial Social Security numbers are used as passwords for commercial services, and people with felony convictions.
Opponents view the commission's work as forming a pretext for federal laws to suppress voter participation, including by racial minority groups and poor people.
Kollar-Kotelly said EPIC could continue its lawsuit, but wrote that for now, the only added risk to privacy was if the White House computer systems are more vulnerable to security threats than those of the states, or that its de-identification process would be inadequate.
Kollar-Kotelly added, “To the extent the factual circumstances change, however — for example, if the … powers of the Commission expand beyond those of a purely advisory body — this determination may need to be revisited.”
The commission, which had asked states to hold off submitting the voter data the panel had requested pending the court decision, renewed its request on July 27.
[Trump challenges states on voter fraud: ‘What are they trying to hide?']
Although the May 11 executive order stated that the commission would be supported by the General Services Administration — a federal agency subject to privacy requirements — the administration said in fact data would be downloaded onto White House computers, with an employee of Pence's office and White House information technology staff responsible for collecting and storing it.
Common Cause questioned that arrangement, adding that White House Communications Agency, a joint-service military agency under the administrative control of the Defense Information Systems Agency — which is subject to the Privacy Act — provides information services for the president, vice president, and executive office of the presidency.

The pace of technology innovation has been on a tear over the last two decades, as The Economist recently highlighted. Built on open protocols like TCP/IP and accessed through open-source browsers like Mozilla Firefox, the Web has given rise to Google, Facebook, Wikipedia and more. Freedom has been kind to innovation.
That freedom, however, is now under siege. Bluntly stated, the curated mobile experience is killing the Web, app by app, leaving us with a sheltered but increasingly sterile environment for experimentation.
We Prefer Apps To Innovation
We don't really have anyone to blame but ourselves. In large part, since the native app experience has been superior to mobile web browsing, users gravitate toward apps in a big way, as recent Flurry data makes clear:
This jibes with Nielsen data released earlier this year that shows users spend 89% of their time on media in apps, versus just 11% through the Web. While I personally spend as much time in my Chrome browser as I do in apps like Facebook or Twitter, I might be the exception to the mobile rule.
This shift to apps, innocuous as it may appear, will have far-reaching consequences. After all, while anyone could build anything on the Web, the rules for apps are much more tightly controlled, as Andreessen Horowitz investor and Web luminary Chris Dixon warns:
Apps are heavily controlled by the dominant app stores owners, Apple and Google. Google and Apple control what apps are allowed to exist, how apps are built, what apps get promoted, and charge a 30% tax on revenues. Most worrisome: they reject entire classes of apps without stated reasons or allowing for recourse (e.g. Apple has rejected all apps related to Bitcoin).
Users may like the safety of a well-tended app store, but it comes with serious risks to innovation. Union Squares Ventures general partner Fred Wilson confirms this: Upon reviewing the investments his firm has made over the last 10 years (including Twitter, Tumblr, Zynga, Etsy, Boxee and more), he worries the most recent investments, coming in the shadow of the app boom, suggest that “it has gotten harder, not easier, to innovate on the Internet with the smartphone emerging as the platform of choice vs the desktop browser.”
(Don't) Think Different
We can't blame the almighty app for this trend entirely; after all, the Web has been under attack from centralization for some time now. Google, which keeps a tight rein on mobile innovation through its Android platform, has also spent years corralling the Wild West of the open Web into a systematized “stack” that includes Gmail, YouTube, Search and more. But Google isn't alone. Bruce Sterling, a noted futurist, describes the “stackification” of the web in this way:
Stacks. In 2012 it made less and less sense to talk about “the Internet,” “the PC business,” “telephones,” “Silicon Valley,” or “the media,” and much more sense to just study Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft. These big five American vertically organized silos are re-making the world in their image.
We look back on the early Internet and laugh at how CompuServe was ever a thing—that so many people happily used the curated AOL garden. Today, we're madly dashing back into these gated communities. But nowhere more so than on our smartphones.
HTML5 And Blockchain To The Rescue?
There are two reasons to remain optimistic about mobile. The first is HTML5, the development platform that, in theory, makes the mobile web look/feel/act more like native apps. While its promise has always underperformed against reality, HTML5 is good and getting better. It also continues to be the third-most interesting platform to developers:
As Google continues to learn how apps are a serious threat to its search business—difficult to impossible to access content within them—it will hopefully double down on HTML5.
But the brighter hope may be Blockchain.
Blockchain, the open source engine on which Bitcoin is built, is, as TechCrunch's Jon Evans explains, “a new kind of distributed consensus system that allows transactions, or other data, to be securely stored and verified without any centralized authority at all, because… they are validated by the entire network.”
It sounds complex, but it means the server farms that centralize so much power in Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Google and Amazon could one day be replaced by massive distributed peer-to-peer networks. These would be open networks, just like the Internet used to be, and this level of openness would, in turn, breed innovation:
Building The Future On Blockchain
How Blockchain translates to mobile remains to be seen. But arguably we'll see a decentralization of control as inventors route around the gated communities of Apple and Google with Blockchain-based distribution strategies.
For the moment, Apple seems determined to keep Bitcoin out of its App Store, but that's a momentary setback, and not directly relevant. Blockchain isn't about trading virtual currency. No, it's much bigger than that. It's about an open, unfettered platform for innovation.
I previously wrote about Alexander Chier, a Pewaukee, Wisconsin, 17-year-old who was disciplined by his high school for smoking a cigarette. This caused the police to search his vehicle, where they found his hunting rifle. Since the weapon was technically on school grounds, he was suspended and arrested.
Chier spoke with me via e-mail to relate his side of the story. There are no key details in dispute; even so, it's hard not to sympathize with the teenager, who was jailed for a night and denied food for 36 hours, according to his account.
"I had to spend a night in jail after the interrogation, and didn't receive food that I could eat for 36 hours," Chier told Reason. "You see I have life threatening food allergies to the point where legally I have a disability (Anaphylaxis to peanuts, nuts, milk and eggs). 1/8 of a peanut would have me dead in 10 minutes or less. I had 2 different physicians and my allergist call the Waukesha County Jail to convey this and I was still denied edible food."
Other pieces of new information: Chier was caught smoking an e-cigarette, not a regular cigarette, at school; the weapon found in his car was a "bolt action mosin-nagant from 1937," which he uses to hunt coyotes; and he voluntary granted the cops access to all his text messages and social media activity.
According to Chier, he turned himself over to the police, subsequently enduring a four-hour interrogation and a famishing night in jail.
Police agree that Chier was not planning to hurt anyone.
"We have no information at all that would have led us in that direction," a spokesperson for the Village of Pewaukee Police Department told Reason.
The good news is that Chier expects the charges to be dropped.
"Basically as long as I show up to my next court date and commit no crimes I'm a clear man," he said.
He is still suspended, however, and could be expelled. He's not happy about that, obviously.
"The fact that I'm facing expulsion in so extreme in every way," he said. "They will be punishing a hunter who made a mistake, had no ill intent, harmed no one, and never planned to do so; and if the Pewaukee Police Department and the State of Wisconsin both determined I am no threat to anyone I should be allowed to go back to school!"
Whether foraging for food, caring for young, or defending the nest, the worker castes of carpenter ants toil selflessly for their queen and colony. Now, biologists have figured out how to make some of those worker ants labor even harder, or change their very jobs in ant society, all by making small chemical modifications to their DNA.
The finding calls attention to a new source of behavioral flexibility, and drives home the idea that so-called epigenetic modifications can connect genes to the environment, linking nature to nurture. The work is “a pioneering study establishing a causal link between epigenetics and complex social behavior,” says Ehab Abouheif, an evolutionary developmental biologist at McGill University, Montreal, in Canada. “These mechanisms may extend far beyond ants to other organisms with social behavior.”
Insect biologists have long debated whether the division of labor in these sophisticated species with castes is driven by colony needs or is innate. Evidence in honey bees had pointed toward a genetic difference between queens and workers. In the past several years, however, work in both honey bees and ants had indicated that epigenetic modifications—changes to DNA other than to its sequence of bases (or DNA “letters”)—influence caste choices, indicating environmental factors can be pivotal. But subsequent research about one type of change, methylation, led to contradictory conclusions.
Daniel Simola, a computational biologist at the University of Pennsylvania, knew almost nothing about ants when he joined Shelley Berger's epigenetics lab in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. But he did want to explore how epigenetics contributes to an organism's ability to respond to environmental changes, and decided to use one of the ants, Camponotus floridanus, that Berger worked with for such studies. Like other carpenter ants, this species has two worker castes: smaller minors, and bigger majors with larger heads (see photo).
One essential job for workers is foraging, and Simola and his colleagues quantified how much the two castes did by marking individual ants, letting them go hungry for a day, and recording how often they searched for and retrieved food.
Minors foraged a lot more than majors and were fast at the job, particularly when they were young, Simola found. It's not clear what majors do, though some have suggested that given their size, they may defend the nest or carry large food items.
He and his colleagues then tested whether epigenetic differences were responsible for this division of labor.
An earlier study by Berger's group indicated that variations in the number of a chemical entity called an acetyl group on proteins called histones, which serve as the scaffolding for DNA, might be important. Acetylation seems to loosen a histone's tie on DNA, allowing genes nearby to be more active.
So Simola and his colleagues treated different sets of minors and majors with chemicals that affected the addition or removal of acetyl groups from histones. One, a mood-stabilizing drug for bipolar disorders, inhibits the enzyme histone deacetylase, which removes acetyl groups, damping gene activity. Another inhibits an enzyme that adds acetyl groups. When a treatment resulted in greater histone acetylation in the ants, minors revved up foraging and even started taking on the job of the scout caste, looking in new places for food. Young majors also began to forage regularly and scout, something they typically don't do, the team reports today online in Science. “We can reprogram the behavior,” Simola concludes.
“It was surprising that they were able to manipulate the foraging behavior through molecular mechanisms so cleanly,” Abouheif says. Changes in older ants of either caste were more subtle, suggesting a window of malleability exists in younger workers.
Moreover, the work shows the power of histone acetylation, in addition to methylation. “DNA methylation has become nearly synonymous with epigenetics,” says Brendan Hunt, an insect geneticist at the University of Georgia in Griffin. “This research brings needed attention to the importance of other epigenetics marks, like histone modifications.”
“We finally have a mechanism to understand ‘nurture' in molecular terms,” says Gene Robinson, a geneticist at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, who studies caste determination in honey bees. The ant study, he adds, highlights “how the environment gets under the skin to affect gene expression, and consequently, neural activity and behavior.”

Working out of an nondescript brick rowhouse in suburban Virginia, a little-known organization named Donors Trust, staffed by five employees, has steered hundreds of millions of dollars to the most influential think tanks, foundations, and advocacy groups in the conservative movement. Over the past decade, it has funded the right's assault on labor unions, climate scientists, public schools, economic regulations, and the very premise of activist government. Yet unlike its nearest counterpart on the progressive side, the Tides Foundation, a bogeyman of Glenn Beck and Bill O'Reilly, Donors Trust has mostly avoided any real scrutiny. It is the dark-money ATM of the right.
Founded in 1999, Donors Trust (and an affiliated group, Donors Capital Fund) has raised north of $500 million and doled out $400 million to more than 1,000 conservative and libertarian groups, according to Whitney Ball, the group's CEO. Donors Trust allows wealthy contributors who want to donate millions to the most important causes on the right to do so anonymously, essentially scrubbing the identity of those underwriting conservative and libertarian organizations. Wisconsin's 2011 assault on collective bargaining rights? Donors Trust helped fund that. ALEC, the conservative bill mill? Donors Trust supports it. The climate deniers at the Heartland Institute? They get Donors Trust money, too.
Donors Trust is not the source of the money it hands out. Some 200 right-of-center funders who've given at least $10,000 fill the group's coffers. Charities bankrolled by Charles and David Koch, the DeVoses, and the Bradleys, among other conservative benefactors, have given to Donors Trust. And other recipients of Donors Trust money include the Heritage Foundation, Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform, the NRA's Freedom Action Foundation, the Cato Institute, the American Enterprise Institute, the Federalist Society, and the Americans for Prosperity Foundation, chaired (PDF) by none other than David Koch.
In a recent interview, Ball, who calls herself a libertarian, went to great lengths to stress that she's no Koch brothers stooge, and that Donors Trust is not yet another appendage of the almighty “Kochtopus.” She insists, “We were not created by them at all.”
Donors Trust is a so-called “donor-advised fund,” a breed apart from a family foundation like, say, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, which helped build the conservative movement over decades with donations totaling tens of millions of dollars. The people who donate to Donors Trust don't get final say over how their money is spent. But they get to recommend where their cash goes, and in exchange for giving up some control, they get a bigger tax write-off than they would with a family foundation. (And those who wish it get anonymity.)
Ball says she travels all over the country courting wealthy conservatives and libertarians, and attends Koch donor retreats and Cato “shareholder” meetings. The crux of her pitch is this: Rich folks can give to Donors Trust and rest easy knowing that their millions will continue bankrolling the conservative movement long into the future, even after their death. They don't have to worry that, after they die, their heirs and trustees will use their bucks for causes they would never support. Ball points to the Ford Foundation as one example of a major charity that, in her view, drifted leftward over time and away from the ideals of man who started it, industrialist Edsel Ford. Donors Trust promises its funders that conservative money stays with conservatives. “Greenpeace won't get a dime from us,” Ball told the National Review in 2001.
Donors Trust grew out of the fear among right-leaning donors that their family foundations might end up in the hands of those who would fund centrist or, even worse, left-of-center causes. At the behest of the late Bruce Jacobs, a Seattle-area businessman and “paleocon” who didn't want to underwrite a local community foundation, Ball and a conservative strategist named Kimberly Dennis created Donors Trust.
The amount of cash passing through Donors Trust has skyrocketed. In 2002, Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund took in $1.4 million and gave out $1.2 million. By 2010, $44 million was flowing in and $63 million heading out. Donors Trust's board of directors, which ultimately decides who gets funded, reads like a conservative who's-who directory: Arthur Brooks, president of American Enterprise Institute; John Von Kannon, vice president of the Heritage Foundation; William Mellor, president of the Institute for Justice, a libertarian legal firm; and Kris Alan Mauren, director of the Acton Institute, a Michigan-based conservative think tank.
Donors Trust is the only honey-pot of its kind for right-leaning donors. But on the left, there's the Tides Foundation, which gives out tens of millions of dollars each year to thousands of left-leaning groups in the US and overseas (including Mother Jones‘ nonprofit arm, the Foundation for National Progress). Tides is a target of conspiracy theorists such as TV and radio host Glenn Beck, who has featured Tides on his infamous connect-the-dots chalkboard. But Donors Trust's strategic intent is far narrower and more coherent than Tides'. The groups funded by Donors Trust more or less pursue the same agenda—eliminate regulations, kneecap unions, shrink government, and transfer more power to the private sector.
Donors Trust keeps its contributors secret. Funders can ask Donor Trust to publicly identify their donations, but very few do, Ball says. The reasons for preferring anonymity are many. Some donors want to avoid attention; others don't want their mailboxes and inboxes filling up with unwanted solicitations for more money.
Tax records, however, reveal some of the sugar-daddies of the conservative and libertarian movement who funnel big money through Donors Trust. The Knowledge and Progress Fund, a charity bankrolled by Charles Koch, gave $2 million in 2010. The DeVos family charity, another pillar of conservative politics, contributed $1 million in 2009 and $1.5 million in 2010. And yet another long-time bankroller of conservative politics, the Bradley family, donated $650,000 through their charity between 2001 and 2010.
Donor Trust's increasingly important role in the conservative movement is perhaps most evident on the issue of climate change. The group has funded much of the climate-change denier movement—bankrolling, for instance, the Heartland Institute, a torchbearer in the denier movement. (It recently compared those who believe in climate change to terrorists.) At the same time, climate-denier funding from family and corporate foundations—say, Exxon's foundation—has declined, according to Robert Brulle, a sociologist at Drexel University who studies the climate change “counter-movement.”
Across the conservative spectrum, Brulle found that Donors Trust is playing an ever larger role. In 2003, Donors Trust money was the source of 3 percent of the funding for more than 100 conservative groups whose financial records Brulle has studied. By 2010, that percentage had grown to 24 percent. Brulle surmises that financial underwriters of the climate counter-movement and the conservative agenda writ large give through Donors Trust to wipe their fingerprints off donations to Heartland and others. “We just have this great big unknown out there about where all the money is coming from,” he says. And, in the years to come, the unknown will only get bigger.
Pro Football Focus has selected second-year defensive tackle Johnathan Hankins as the New York Giants 'Secret Superstar'. That's a lofty tag to pin on a guy who had not starts in 11 games as a rookie and played less than 200 snaps. The Giants need to hope PFF is right. More importantly, for the defense to remain stout against the run the organization needs to be proven right in putting its faith in the 2013 second-round pick.
The Giants, of course, allowed their best defensive tackle -- Linval Joseph -- to accept a free-agent contract from the Minnesota Vikings while barely making any effort to keep him. Largely, that is because of Hankins. The Giants drafted him 49th overall season ago in part as preparation for the departure of Joseph. Can the 6-foot-3, 320-pound Hankins be the solid run-stuffer and occasional pass-rushing presence Joseph was for the Giants? PFF thinks that Hankins might turn out to be even better:
Overall, Hankins' +9.5 run defense grade for the entire season led all Giants defensive tackles and was +1.5 better than Joseph in one-third the snaps. If you factor in playing time, Hankins had the third-highest grade per run defense snap of any defensive tackle in the entire league. His 10.5 Run Stop Percentage was seventh out of 77 NFL defensive tackles with at least 100 run snaps last season. His pass rush left a lot to be desired (he only had three quarterback pressures the entire season), but he only had three snaps total in 3rd-and-long obvious passing downs. Keep in mind that Joseph himself was never a dominant pass rusher outside his 2011 season. The Giants front office always drafts with a long-term plan in mind, and certainly they were cognizant of Joseph's contract year when they selected Hankins. No team likes to lose a 25-year-old durable player in his prime, but paying a hefty price for a run-stopping defensive tackle isn't a necessity when there's a potentially better one waiting in the wings. Now that Joseph is gone, Hankins is a projected starter and will no longer have to wait for playing time. If his rookie year is any indication, the Giants will wonder why they were so patient in the first place.
The Giants have treated the defensive tackle this way for more than a decade. Cornelius Griffin was replaced by William Joseph. Joseph by Barry Cofield. Cofield by Linval Joseph. Now, Hankins steps in for Linval Joseph.
Will Hankins be the guy who breaks the mold, who plays so well over the next three seasons that he earns the big-money contract the Giants refused to dole out for his predecessors? We begin to find out this season.

A major new sanitary trunk sewer tunnelled through the city's west end came out 10 centimetres too low at the attachment point in the West Jasper Place neighbourhood, but drainage officials say that's not behind the odour issues plaguing the area.
The 10-centimetre gap on the 2.3-metre wide pipe does mean a bit of raw sewage is stuck in the line, but it's a far cry from allegations circling through the neighbourhood. After getting a letter from a person who claimed to be a city employee, community league officials have said they believe the line is off by one metre and there are thousands of litres of sewage pooling in the line.
Clem Yong, the city's drainage director of project delivery, said staff have walked the entire new line and have monitors in the system. They guarantee there are no pools of raw sewage.
“The cause of the odours in the area and the current state of the existing sanitary trunk sewer along 99th Avenue at 151st Street is not a result of the construction of W13 and the connection to the existing sewer,” Yong said Wednesday. “There is a history of odour in the area given that there are major trunk sewers that handle large amounts of sewage coming from west Edmonton to this location.”
The city is continuing to investigate. It has also restarted remediation work on the old trunk sewer in the area, a line discovered to be so corroded one budget document described it as hanging on by “ribs and lagging.”
Coun. Andrew Knack said councillors received a similar letter as the residents and forwarded it to city auditor David Wiun. A city spokeswoman said the auditor received the letter and is looking into it, but it's too early to say what followup is required.
Yong said the 10-centimetre gap on the new trunk line is within allowed tolerances on such a project. It will be fixed during the remediation of the old trunk line and within the original $14-million budget.
Residents in West Jasper Place have complained about sewer odours in the area since late spring. They say the gas has left them feeling breathless, woken them in the middle of the night, caused headaches and even vomiting.
Alberta Health Services has reviewed the city's air monitoring data and interviewed affected residents. Officials say there are no health concerns.
Drainage communications staff said the department has been open with residents and is setting up a community task force to ensure they are kept in the loop as odour problems are investigated and maintenance on the old sewer trunk line is completed.
Rather than reopening the shaft at 151st Street and 99th Avenue, drainage officials are drilling a shaft at 151st Street and 100th Avenue and creating shallow bypass pipes to pump sewage around the corroded old line. They'll repair the old line while it's dry. That should significantly reduce odours for the community.
Drainage officials are also adding air scrubbers in the pipes and an extra odour control stack to vent sewer gas in the line in a more controlled manner.
“We have communicated extensively with the West Jasper Place and Sherwood communities about the sewer rehabilitation project and will continue to do so,” Michelle Kauffman said. “We will continue to be open and transparent with the community.”
Knack said the drainage department has promised to bring in high-quality equipment to analyze the air in the neighbourhood and determine exactly what gases the residents are being exposed to. The department has already installed a hydrogen sulphide monitor to measure the main component of sewer gas.
Drainage also installed a carbon monoxide monitor at the residents' request after doctors found one woman had high levels of carbon monoxide in her blood and no obvious source in her home. There is also no obvious source of carbon monoxide in most sewer gas.

Researchers at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine have discovered a mutant form of the gene, Chk1, that when expressed in cancer cells, permanently stopped their proliferation and caused cell death without the addition of any chemotherapeutic drugs. This study illustrates an unprecedented finding, that artificially activating Chk1 alone is sufficient to kill cancer cells.
"We have identified a new direction for cancer therapy and the new direction is leading us to a reduction in toxicity in cancer therapy, compared with chemotherapy or radiation therapy," said Dr. Zhang, assistant professor, Department of Pharmacology at the School of Medicine, and member of the university's Case Comprehensive Cancer Center. "With this discovery, scientists could stop the proliferation of cancer cells, allowing physicians time to fix cells and genetic errors."
While studying the basic mechanisms for genome integrity, Dr. Zhang's team unexpectedly discovered an active mutant form of human Chk1, which is also a non-natural form of this gene. This mutation changed the protein conformation of Chk1 from the inactive form into an active form. Remarkably, the research team discovered that when expressed in cancer cells, this active mutant form of Chk1 permanently stopped cancer cell proliferation and caused cell death in petri dishes even without the addition of any chemotherapeutic drugs.
The biggest advantage of this potential strategy is that no toxic chemotherapeutic drug is needed to achieve the same cancer killing effect used with a combination of Chk1 inhibitors and chemotherapeutic drugs.
Cells respond to DNA damage by activating networks of signaling pathways, termed cell cycle checkpoints. Central to these genome pathways is the protein kinase, called Chk1. Chk1 facilitates cell survival, including cancer cells, under stressful conditions, such as those induced by chemotherapeutic agents, by placing a temporary stop on the cell cycle progression and coordinating repair programs to fix the DNA errors.
It has long been suggested that combining Chk1 inhibition with chemotherapy or radiotherapy should significantly enhance the anticancer effect of these therapies. This idea has serves as the basis for multiple pharmaceutical companies searching for potential Chk1 inhibitors that can effectively combine with chemotherapy in cancer therapy. To date, no Chk1 inhibitor has passed the clinical trial stage III . This led Dr. Zhang's team to look for alternative strategies for targeting Chk1 in cancer therapy.
Future research by Dr. Zhang and his team will consider two possible approaches to artificially activating Chk1 in cancer cells. One possibility is to use the gene therapy concept to deliver the active mutant form of Chk1 that the team discovered, into cancer cells. The other is to search for small molecules that can induce the same conformational change of Chk1, so that they can be delivered into cancer cells to activate Chk1 molecules. The consequence of either would be permanent cell proliferation inhibition and cancer.

The Portuguese was announced as Luciano Spalletti's replacement at Zenit on Tuesday and officially took the reins on Thursday after the Russian outfit's elimination from the UEFA Champions League at the hands of Borussia Dortmund.
And former Porto and Chelsea coach Villas-Boas - sacked by Tottenham in December - feels he has a wealth of experience to bring to the role.
"I've always had success wherever I've been," he is quoted as saying.
"With Academica I got to the semi-finals of the League Cup, with Porto I won four titles in one year, and at Spurs we finished the season with a club record points total.
"When I didn't finish the season with Chelsea, the club ended up winning the Champions League.
"You have to give the players credit but I was the one who built the team."
Zenit currently sit second in the Russian Premier League, three points adrift of leaders Lokomotiv Moscow.
WASHINGTON — Still stinging from the Todd Akin debacle in 2012 that ended their hopes of knocking off an extremely vulnerable Senate Democrat, Republicans are taking no chances this time around in their bid to defeat Alaska's Democratic Sen. Mark Begich.
With the state party engulfed in an internal war and an ugly primary fight underway, the Republican National Committee is opening four field offices in the state before the GOP primary and will devote significant resources to the state for the 2014 election.
"Nobody can remember ever putting this many resources into Alaska before," RNC spokesman Raffi Williams acknowledged of the decision to open offices in Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau.
State Republicans can use the help: establishment and Tea Party leaders have been at war with each other, and in the last year alone there have been three different chairmen, cycling between Ron Paul boosters and old guard Republicans. One chairwoman only lasted 10 weeks in her post, while the chairman before that never actually officially took control of the party.
Adding to the problems facing Republicans is the three way primary race that's underway in Alaska.While two candidates — Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell and Natural Resources Commissioner Dan Sullivan — are vying for the role of "establishment" candidate, Tea Party darling Joe Miller is looking to reprise his role as the conservative spoiler that almost sent him to the Senate in 2010.
Officially Republicans say the state party is back under control and the primary isn't anything to worry about — and that the presence of the RNC is merely business as usual.
"We had some problems that gained national attention very early in the year, but that's mostly history," Alaska GOP Chairman Peter Goldberg said. "We're well on the right track," insisted Goldberg, who pushed Debbie Brown out of the party's top slot in April.
But state Democrats offer a different view of what's going on between the state party and the RNC.
"There are people that have clearly been sent here to clean up the mess," said Zack Fields, communications director for the Alaska Democratic Party. "It's a big mess to clean up."
Republicans have identified the Alaska race as a "top target," one they think is winnable as they eye a run on control of the Senate in 2014. Prior to Begich, the late Sen. Ted Stevens was a Republican staple in the Senate. He held his seat for four decades before he lost it in a close election that took place just one week after he was convicted on federal corruption charges.
"We think it's an easy pickup for us," Williams said.
Democrats, however, aren't convinced the early-start grassroots effort will be as effective as the GOP thinks.
"You can't airlift a political operative from DC and expect to win elections," Fields said. "Alaskans have a real problem with outsiders coming in," he added.
Goldberg dismissed that claim. He said the state party has been working closely with the RNC to shore up fundraising operations and make sure they are organized before crunch time. The RNC has had their state director Michael Shirley there since September to scout out locations for offices and lay other groundwork.
"He better start filling out a resume," Goldberg said of Begich.
The RNC's own by-laws prevent it from supporting a candidate in the primary. Rather, the main goal of its field officers will be to strengthen the Republican base by identifying voters, and determining who the community leaders are that can influence them. The idea is that no matter what happens in the primary, GOP voters will be galvanized to come out and vote for whoever ends up taking on Begich in the general election.
Michael Czin, spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, said Democrats aren't worried about Begich even if he's in the crosshairs of the GOP establishment.
"We have one strong Democrat who is well liked and has a great brand, and three Republicans who are going to have a very brutal primary," he said.

It is not possible to overstate the power of certain constituencies and corporate lobbies in the United States. These pressure groups, joined by powerful government agencies, many of which have secret agendas that focus on national security, constitute what is increasingly being recognized as “Deep State America.” Deep State is the widespread belief that there exists in many countries an entrenched and largely hidden infrastructure that really controls the national narrative and runs things. It explains why, for example, a country like the United States is perpetually at war even though the wars have been disastrous failures ever since Korea and have not made the nation more secure.
To be sure, certain constituencies have benefitted from global instability and conflict, to include defense industries, big government in general, and the national security state. They all work together and hand-in-hand with the corporate media to sustain the narrative that the United States is perpetually under threat, even though it is not.
The recent exchanges over the Russia-US relationship exhibit perfectly how the Deep State operates to control the message. American President Donald Trump briefly met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Vietnam. Putin reportedly told Trump that Russia “absolutely had not meddled” in the 2016 US election and Trump then told reporters that he believed the Russian leader meant what he said, “which is good.” As détente with Russia is not considered desirable by the Deep State, there was an immediate explosion of a contrary narrative, namely that Trump believes a Russian “enemy” and does not trust what his own intelligence agencies have told him about 2016 because he is being “played” by Putin. This story was repeated both on television news and in all the mainstream newspapers without exception, eventually forcing Trump to recant and say that he does believe in US intelligence.
Not a single major media outlet in the US reported that it just might be possible that Putin was telling the truth and that the intelligence community, which has been wrong many times over the past twenty years, might have to look again at what it considers to be evidence. No journalist had the courage to point out that the claims of the Washington national security team have been remarkably devoid of anything credible to support the conclusions about what the Russian government might or might not have been up to. That is what a good journalist is supposed to do and it has nothing to do with whether or not one admires or loathes either Putin or Trump.
That the relationship between Moscow and Washington should be regarded as important given the capability of either country to incinerate the planet would appear to be a given, but the Washington-New York Establishment, which is euphemism for Deep State, is actually more concerned with maintaining its own power by marginalizing Donald Trump and maintaining the perception that Vladimir Putin is the enemy head of state of a Russia that is out to cripple American democracy.
Beyond twisting narratives, Russiagate is also producing potentially dangerous collateral damage to free speech, as one of the objectives of those in the Deep State is to rein in the current internet driven relatively free access to information. In its most recent manifestations, an anonymous group produced a phony list of 200 websites that were “guilty” of serving up Russian propaganda, a George Soros funded think tank identified thousands of individuals who are alleged to be “useful idiots” for Moscow, and legitimate Russian media outlets will be required to register as foreign agents.
Driven by Russophobia over the 2016 election, a group of leading social media corporations including Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter have been experimenting with ways to self-censor their product to keep out foreign generated or “hate” content. They even have a label for it: “cyberhate”. Congress is also toying with legislation that will make certain viewpoints unacceptable or even illegal, including a so-called Anti-Semitism Awareness Act that would potentially penalize anyone who criticizes Israel and could serve as a model for banning other undesirable speech. “Defamatory speech” could even eventually include any criticism of the government or political leaders, as is now the case in Turkey, which is the country where the “Deep State” was invented.
Cerebrolysin (CBL) is a neuroprotective agent in central nervous system (CNS) injury and stimulates neurorepair processes. Several studies in our laboratory suggest that CBL administered through nanowired technology may have superior neuroprotective efficacy in CNS trauma. In this investigation, we compared the neuroprotective efficacy of poly-lactide-co-glycolide nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with CBL vs free CBL in a rat model of concussive head injury (CHI). Free CBL or CBL loaded NPs was administered 30 min to 1 h after CHI and animals were sacrificed 5 h later. Changes in blood-brain barrier and brain edema formation were measured as parameters of neuroprotection in CHI after giving CBL alone or as the nanodelivered compound. Our results clearly show that delivery of CBL by NPs has superior neuroprotective effects following CHI as compared to normal CBL. This suggests that CBL delivered by NPs could have robust neuroprotective action in CNS trauma. These findings have potential clinical relevance with regard to nanodelivery of CBL, a feature that requires further investigation.
The world's largest bacterial study of baby poo
Daily samples of baby poo taken throughout a full year will reveal how the bacterial community changes in the gut of infants.
5000 STOOL SAMPLES: Pål Trosvik (left) and Eric de Muinck are set to create a mathematical model of changes to the bacterial diversity in the gut of infants. To achieve this, they will need to run a gene test of 5000 stool samples. Photo: Yngve Vogt
The bacterial diversity of our stools changes dramatically in the course of our first year of life. Newborn babies have no bacteria in their gut. During birth, infants are exposed to the bacteria of their mothers' faeces. Only when children approach their first birthday will their bacterial diversity be as great as that in adults. The composition of bacteria can impact significantly on their health.
In order to gain a deeper insight into the ecosystem of the gut, researchers from Oslo University are investigating how the bacterial community changes in the gut of infants, from the day they are born to their first birthday.
“Generally speaking, the gut flora has a children's profile and an adults' profile. The basic idea of our work is to study the normal development of the bacterial diversity in the gut, and particularly how the gut flora changes when the child starts eating solids, receives medication such as antibiotics, is vaccinated or travels abroad” says researcher Pål Trosvik at the Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis (CEES) at the University of Oslo.
Trosvik is part of the research centre – headed by professor Nils Chr. Stenseth – that recently analysed the genetic material of plague bacteria taken from several thousand victims of the great plague epidemics from the Iron Age to the Black Death. DNA analysis has made it possible to explain the evolution of plague bacteria and predict the next outbreak of plague.
“This time around we will be using DNA analysis to create a mathematical model designed to give us greater insight into the ecological balance of the gut,” says Postdoc Eric de Muinck at CEES.
Daily poo samples
The work is of the yucky kind. The two researchers are receiving daily poo samples from thirteen babies for the duration of a whole year, from birth to their first birthday. In order to ensure sufficiently wide variation, they receive samples from children who live with pets as well as children without pets, from a pair of twins, and from children who were delivered vaginally as well as children who were delivered by caesarean section. The point is that babies who are delivered by C-section are not exposed to the same bacteria at birth as babies who are delivered vaginally.
The parents have been given the unenviable task of collecting the faeces from their baby's nappies.
This is the largest ever infant faeces study of its kind; almost a hundred times larger than earlier studies. In the course of a year, the researchers have been collecting daily faeces samples. We are talking about a total of almost 5000 poo samples.
Cumbersome analysis
The poo samples will be run through an enormous sequencing machine. The researchers have so far been working hard to develop the best possible procedure for extracting the DNA from the bacteria.
“Today, this is a messy and difficult procedure. There are no standardized ways of doing it.”
If they were to use the original method, they would have spent a whole year on sequencing the stool samples, which is too long. They have therefore developed a new genetic sequencing method which is many times faster. From the University of Michigan in the US they obtained a sample containing more than thirty different types of bacteria, and they kept sequencing this sample over and over again in search of the optimal method.
The DNA analyses generate enormous amounts of data. We are talking about several hundred gigabytes of information.
In order to calculate the link between all the different genes, the researchers need to make use of the country's fastest calculator, the Abel high-performance computer cluster at the University of Oslo, which is ten thousand times faster than your average home computer.
Deep diving
Researchers are hopeful that they will learn a lot about the ecological balance in the gut. They also want to establish what bacterial groups have an influence on each other. Our understanding of this is still scant.
“Think of the entire bacterial community as a network. Some bacteria will affect each other positively, others negatively. Some bacteria sustain themselves from large molecules which they break down into smaller molecules that may benefit other bacteria. In other words, these bacteria produce food for other bacteria. Some bacteria are essential to the network and influence many different types of bacterial groups. We call them fundamental bacteria. It is possible to envisage that in future, we will be able to use these foundation bacteria in medical treatments.” But Pål Trosvik points out that for now, this is mere science fiction.
Congolese politicians have agreed in principle to a deal under which President Joseph Kabila leaves office by the end of next year, opposition leaders said, an unexpected breakthrough after more than 40 people died in anti-government protests this week.
However, a mediator said on Friday that an agreement was still not signed and it was unclear if it would be over the coming days.
Kabila's mandate as president of Democratic Republic of Congo expired on Tuesday, but he has remained in office as presidential elections scheduled for last month were postponed until at least April 2018.
In return for Kabila staying on for another year, the constitution will not be changed to let him stand for a third term, and a prime minister will be named from the main opposition bloc.
Opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi will oversee implementation of the deal, politicians Martin Fayulu and Jose Endundo told Reuters news agency.
"Kabila stays for one year," Fayulu said. "He will not try to stand for a new term."
A government spokesman declined to comment on the agreement.
If the deal does succeed, it would be a major achievement for the Catholic church, which has been mediating talks in an attempt to prevent Democratic Republic of Congo sliding back into years of anarchy and civil war.
Millions were killed in wars between 1996 and 2003.
Church leaders have presented the talks as a last ditch effort to prevent violence spinning out of control after a bloody week that saw protesters killed and deadly clashes between various ethnic militia across the country.
At least 40 people were killed and another 460 arrested this week during protests against Kabila's refusal to leave office, the UN said on Friday.
"Some 107 people have been injured or ill-treated and there have been at least 460 arrests," the UN human rights office said in Geneva.
More than two dozen people killed in DRC protests
Kabila has declined to commit publicly to not changing the constitution to extend his term, leading many to conclude this is what he secretly wants to do.
Questions still surround the proposed agreement.
On Friday morning a source in the Congo National Episcopal Conference, which is presiding over the negotiations, told AFP news agency tersely: "There have been complications."
A mediator subsequently said "the signature could now be between Christmas and the New Year".
DR Congo has never witnessed a democratic transfer of power following polls since independence from Belgium in 1960.
Strong magnitude 7.4 earthquake strikes off coast of El Salvador; tsunami threat 'has mostly passed'
Updated
A powerful magnitude 7.4 earthquake has struck off the coast of El Salvador, the US Geological Survey (USGS) says, but there were no immediate reports of damage.
The quake hit 170 kilometres south-east of the capital San Salvador, at a depth of 40km, the USGS said.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had earlier issued a warning for coasts located within 300km of the quake's epicentre, but then said there was no longer a threat.
"The tsunami threat from this earthquake has now mostly passed," the warning centre said in an update.
Wilfredo Salgado, mayor of the city of San Miguel in El Salvador, said on his Twitter account that a man was killed when an electricity post fell on him.
There were no immediate reports of major damage after the quake struck, local emergency services said.
The tremor was felt as far as the capital of Nicaragua, Managua, and other cities. Electricity and cell phone service in some areas have been cut off.

The war in Syria is heating up yet again with signs that the conflict may soon be about to take greater international dimensions. This is all due to greater Israeli participation and aggression in Syria against the Syrian military and on the behalf of terrorist organizations fighting against the Syrian government. The questions that remain, however, are whether or not the Israelis are willing to tempt the resolve of the anti-terrorist coalition of Syria, Hezbollah, Iran, and Russia and how steadfast that resolve of those powers might actually be.
In the past week, we have seen an escalation in the Syrian conflict the likes of which we have not seen in decades in terms of Israeli-Syrian tensions as well as the potential for a clash of nuclear world powers in the Middle East as a combat theatre.
After a mobilization of U.S. troops near Manbij – designed to prevent the Syrian military from retaking the city and as a means to stop combat between Turkish and Kurdish forces – Israel launched an air attack on Syrian targets near Palmyra, the Zionist settler state's farthest penetration into Syria yet. Israel claimed it was bombing an Iranian-Hezbollah weapons convoy while the Syrian government claimed Israel had targeted Syrian military positions who were in the process of combating ISIS. Regardless, Israel clearly violated international law and the concept of national sovereignty.
This time, however, Israel was not able to bomb and bail as they have done eleven times in the past as Syrian air defense systems were mobilized and an Israeli jet shot down as a result. This shoot-down was apparently launched after the Syrian military informed the Russian military of its intention to shoot down the Israeli planes. It is assumed that the Russians did not object to the use of force.
Indeed, Russian Marines were only a few kilometers away from where the Syrian military was attacked. After the attack, the Russian government summoned the Israeli Ambassador, Gary Koren, to demand an explanation for the operation. This, in and of itself, is an unprecedented event.
Very soon after the shoot-down, both Syria and Israel engaged in a war of words and threats regarding any future incidents. For instance, Israeli Defense Minister, Avigdor Lieberman, stated that , “The next time the Syrians use their air defence systems against our planes we will destroy them without the slightest hesitation.”
Syria's Ambassador to the United Nations, Dr. Bashar al-Jaafari, also responded to the incident with statements of his own.
“Putin sent a clear message,” he said. “The fact is that the Israeli ambassador [to Russia] was summoned for a conversation only a day after he submitted his credentials [to the Russian Foreign Ministry last Thursday], and was told categorically that this game is over.”
Jaafari pointed out that the attack has changed the rules of the game and that Syria will not sit idly by while Israel attacks its forces.
But, on Sunday, a new incident arose with the Israelis launching an airstrike in Quneitra, located in the Golan Heights. Syrian news media reported the incident first, saying that a militia commander had been killed in the strike. Lebanese television station, al-Mayadeen identified the man killed as Yasser Assayed, member of the National Defense Militia. He was a commander of the Golan Brigade, a Druze militia fighting alongside the Syrian military against terrorists. The assassination was allegedly conducted by virtue of an unmanned Israeli drone.
On March 19-20, Israel launched more airstrikes on the Lebanese-Syria border, supposedly targeting a Hezbollah weapons supply convoy.
On Monday, March 20, an Israeli drone was shot down over the Golan area allegedly by Syrian aerial defense systems. Hezbollah paraded pictures of the downed drone on its social media pages as proof of the shoot down, forcing Israel to admit that the UAV had indeed been brought down.

And the Israelis have yet to stop their aggression. In fact, despite having been warned by the Syrian government and having apparently angered Russia over the initial airstrikes, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is doubling down on the perceived Israeli right to bomb anyone anywhere anytime without consequences.
“If there is feasibility from an intelligence and military standpoint – we attack and so it will continue,” said Netanyahu during his visit to China. He added that he informed President Putin of Israel's intentions.
On Wednesday, March 22, Israel launched more airstrikes deeper inside Syrian territory, targeting Syrian army posts near the capitol, Damascus. This marks the fourth Israeli airstrike operation in Syria within one week.
Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, stated that Russia is relying on Israel to abide by the agreements that were established during Netanyahu's official state visit to Russia earlier in March where the two men held extensive talks regarding the Syrian crisis.
“We will judge not by their statements, but by their actions, to what extent our Israeli partners are sticking to these agreements,” said Lavrov.
Syrian President Assad told Russian MPs visiting Syrian that he is counting on Russia to do something about any further Israeli attacks on Syria and to assist Syria in avoiding a real full-scale war with Israel.
ALBANY, NY – American Hockey League rosters are constantly changing. No matter if it's the regular season, postseason or offseason moving pieces are inevitable. While Rod Pelley, Max Novak and Kevin Rooney are among players locked in for 2016-17, Matt Lorito and Mike Sislo are among others heading to different cities.
The 2016 Development Camp is a mix bag of New Jersey Devils prospects and college and junior free agents. The Devils could look to those unsigned players make an impact on the AHL roster.
“We probably are going to lose close to two-thirds of our roster, or have already, with guys that are free agents,” said Head Coach Rick Kowalsky. “We lost a lot of guys that have moved on. The positive thing is we have a lot of young guys that played big roles last year and did a good job for us that are now coming into their second season and there are young kids, like potentially a Lappin, certainly a Rooney, and maybe some kid from development camp that are going to play bigger roles and get opportunities.
“This is kind of just a tease before you get into training camp. You get a lot more excited. I've learned my lesson with that, too, not to get too excited quick here because sometimes they don't end up making it my way, which is a good thing. But you certainly start to look at players from this point on and into training camp.”
Of the 34 players attending this year's Development Camp, nine are tryouts: goaltender Matt Morris, defensemen Gavin Bayreuther, Zach Berzolla, Marc Biega, Garret Cockerill, Luke McInnis and Scott Savage and forwards Austin Cangelosi and Chris Shero.
The Oakland Raiders have been cast as villains over the years, but their current star quarterback, Derek Carr, just doesn't fit the role.
He's too nice.
Local DJ and music producer Ron Reeser told Bill Williamson of All.22 that he was driving through Dublin on Tuesday when he ran out of gas. He had a gas can and was about to hike to the nearest filling station when a black SUV pulled up.
"The man asked me if everything was OK," Reeser told Williamson. "I said I ran out of gas. He said, 'Hop in, I'll take you.'"
The man asked what he did for a living, and Reeser told him he was in the music business. After they talked about music for a while, Reeser asked what the good Samaritan did.
"He says 'I play football and is heavily into God and wants to become a pastor some day when he retires," Reeser said. After arriving at the gas station, Reeser filled up his can and got back into the SUV for a ride back to his car.
At this point, Reeser, a life-long 49ers fan, still had no idea who was giving him a lift. He told Williamson the following:
"He said he was a quarterback; I thought he was a college quarterback. I asked him what string he was. He said 'first string.' I asked him his favorite team. He said, 'I may be biased, but the Raiders because I play for them.' I looked at him and said, 'Wait' ... and I asked him his name. He said 'Derek Carr.'
"He couldn't have been more down to earth. He was wearing a hat and basketball shorts. I had no idea. He was just driving by and helped. It really made me feel good that there are good people still out there doing nice things for people."
Reeser said that before they parted company, Carr asked if he could pray for him. He then put his hand on Reeser's shoulder and prayed.
'It was such an empowering moment," Reeser told Williamson. "It's just not something I expected to happen after running out of gas. Some of the people I've told about it said maybe it was a sign to help me restore my faith in people doing the right thing."
This post was updated at 2:50 p.m. with comment from Army spokesman Maj. Justin Platt and Sgt. Micah Turner. It was updated at 5:20 p.m. with comment from Fort Bragg spokesman Sgt. 1st Class Michael Noggle.
Eleven years to the day after U.S. troops first landed in Afghanistan, an American soldier who says he was deployed three times to Afghanistan and once to Iraq tried to give himself up to authorities Sunday after deserting his active-duty unit more than a month ago.
Sgt. Micah Turner, 24, is believed to have first revealed himself as a deserter from Afghanistan in the Washington, D.C., area Saturday, before delivering a speech about his so-called "unauthorized absence" the following day in New York.
Army officials at the Pentagon and at Fort Bragg, N.C, where Turner was reportedly based in a psychological operations unit, said they were working on getting more information to U.S. News about Turner and his UA status.

Turner told the assembled audience in New York Sunday that he was in Afghanistan the night al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden was killed in Pakistan, and remembered his fellow soldiers asking "Is the war over? Should we pack up?"
"But the word never came, and a lot of good men died that year," said Turner. "There is no justification for this war. There is no reason our brothers and sisters should die in the sand... It is my duty to dissent."
According to the activist blog Cool Revolution, Turner and his supporters then drove to the gates of Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn, which calls itself "the face of America's army in New York City," and gave himself over to military authorities. Turner's supporters include liberal anti-war filmmaker Michael Moore, who thanked the soldier online Friday for his "courage" for going public as an "AWOL vet against [the] U.S. war in Afghanistan."
But Tuesday morning, it appeared Turner was still a free man, writing on his Twitter account that he was exploring the possibility of conscientious objector status with his lawyer "since they haven't let me turn myself in."
Alison Kohler, a spokeswoman for Fort Hamilton, confirmed to U.S. News that Turner had "made contact with our installation" and said that he was expected to arrive on Tuesday for processing. It is unclear whether Turner will face charges for his absence, though he previously said he believed he would face felony charges.
Update, 2:50 p.m.:
Army spokesman Maj. Justin Platt tells U.S. News that Turner started his service in 2007. Turner was deployed to Afghanistan from August 2009 to February 2010, according to Platt, and promoted to sergeant in December 2011. He worked as a multimedia illustrator. Platt says he had no record that Turner was deployed four times, but that “it would be possible.”
Turner blames the discrepancy over his number of deployments on the army's records, saying they “aren't very good.” Platt acknowledges that Fort Bragg might have more complete records, but Fort Bragg is still working on the request for more information from U.S. News.
Turner also shared more information about his desertion, saying he left Fort Bragg in North Carolina in his own car soon after completing his alleged fourth tour in Afghanistan.
“I had been planning to go since bin Laden was killed,” he says. In the video of Turner's speech in New York, he mentions bin Laden's death as a turning point for the Soldiers in his unit toward disenchantment with the Afghanistan war.
As a multimedia illustrator in Afghanistan, Turner says he was in the Bravo Company, 9th Military Information Support Division, and that he was part of Army psychological operations.
"I made propaganda," he says. "We used surveillance analysis to attempt to influence local nationals through video or audible means for desired end states. … I did pro-Afghan government stuff, pro-Afghan army. Everything from ‘Don't Hide Terrorists' to ‘Clean Your Water' to ‘Don't do this or we'll kill you.'”
Turner is now headed to Buffalo to meet up with Occupy Wall Street protesters, and says he does not plan to turn himself in to military officials on Tuesday, despite having promised to do so. After consultation with his lawyer, Turner believes he has another 30 days of freedom because the Army let him go when he attempted to turn himself in over the weekend.
But he says that he may not turn himself in even after a month's time.
“I'm on the run right now, and there's a definite possibility that I would still be on the run after 30 days,” Turner says, noting that he is also applying for conscientious objector status. “I think there is something wrong with this system, but I also have faith people will do the right thing.”
Update, 5:20 p.m.:
Sgt. 1st Class Michael Noggle, a spokesman for Fort Bragg where Turner was based, says Turner may be disciplined for his absence.
“When SGT Turner returns to military control, he could face adverse action. ... Absence without leave is punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice,” Noggle told U.S. News, noting that the punishment depends upon the circumstances around Turner's absence and return, and the kind of court martial he faces.
According to military law, Turner could face up to 18 months confinement, a dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay.

In a push that sees Canada move one step closer to a state where being constantly watched, catalogued, and data mined is the norm, the Conservative government recently decided to expand its public surveillance policy to include all protests and demonstrations. The Government Operations Centre sent an email to all federal departments that requested information on even the most mundane social movements. The email then leaked to Postmedia news and opposition parties are now crying afoul, calling the plan a clear blow to democratic freedom.
NDP public safety critic Randall Garrison believes the government's play is a smack in the face of basic democratic rights and freedoms. Though he doesn't feel we've quite moved into a Big Brother state in Canada, he says this issue is proof that the country is undoubtedly heading in that troubling direction under the strong arm of the Harper Conservatives.
“It's a fundamental disrespect for basic rights of freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, to say that they should monitor all the time in case somebody in the future breaks the law. It's shocking,” he told VICE. “They've appeared to take the position now that the government should spy on everyone who protests because there is some possibility in the future that any of us might become violent. That's a big concern, when the government's expressing that kind of attitude.”
In addition to gathering presumptive data for unknown purposes, the GOC will also be making use of bureaucrats and public servants to monitor legitimate protests, big or small, peaceful or vigilant, all on the taxpayer dime. From Garrison's perspective, the most disturbing part of this push is that it is indicative of yet another bullet point on a troubling agenda that has been written over the last eight years.
“I think that's one of its important and unfortunate impacts is that it makes Canadians very cynical and, in a certain way, almost accepting that the Conservatives are going to do things like this,” he says. “I don't think pieces by themselves are as disturbing as the pattern. We see it with online data, we see it with the provisions they are trying to put into Bill C-13… to this order that all government departments spy on protestors. We see it in so many areas, and it's that pattern that's of most concern to me.”
Liberal MP Wayne Easter, also the party's public safety critic, has called this a play one would see in a dictatorship. Easter believes his use of hyperbole, if one can even call it that, is not alarmist in the slightest. He is convinced that the government's move to collect this brand of information is one step closer to creating a closed and fearful society:
“Sometimes you have to over-express to emphasize the danger that's here, so that's why the word was used,” he says, explaining his use of the term "dictatorship" to describe the government du jour. “I emphasized the point because this is in fact what you see in some dictatorships around the world and if you look at our history where a government's spied on its citizens, neighbours spied on each other, people were in fear of each other.”
Blacklisted in the 70s on a count of a radical movement as former president of the National Farmers Union, Easter knows first-hand what it means to be on a government checklist. Shutting down political opposition, using technology to monitor the population, and instilling fear into groups that oppose the powers that be, he says, are draconian tactics being utilized by an insecure government on Parliament Hill willing to go to any length to retain its rule.
“This is all about control. If you look at the way the Harper government has treated charity organizations, for instance, they've gone on a concentrated attack on charities and even the status of women… that is, in a great many ways, creating a loss of expression by those who should speak out in Canadian society. Canada should be an open society where demonstrations are a healthy part of your society. And where is that information? That information is collected and gathered and then, what is done with it?”
The question is rife with controversy. Created in 2004 by Public Safety Canada, the Government Operations Centre was initially set up to deal with ongoing or eventual emergencies of national concern and develop plans to deal with human crises like pandemics. In addition, the centre was also used to monitor issues overseas like that of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan in 2011. But it seems tentacles have continued to be added to its mandate, and critics say the centre has morphed into something of a spy agency that monitors even tame citizens who may not pose a threat to the governing party.
And, while some of the information being tracked could be of national interest and help authorities to shut down dangerous groups, most of the data collected and stored by the GOC is hogwash. Documents obtained by APTN through Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) request showed the centre had monitored a prayer ceremony in Edmonton and a “taco fundraiser” that was planned for Barrie's Native Friendship Centre.
Still, the GOC has of late poked it's neck out into more nefarious affairs. Since the Idle No More movement, the centre has served, as reported by Postmedia news, as an “intelligence clearing house” used to compile data on First Nations protestors. In fact, the GOC prepared a spreadsheet that detailed 32 planned protests as part of a coordinated effort to move against aboriginal demonstrations last year.
The ATIP revelation highlighted the potency of the power the GOC now possesses. As a response to anti-fracking rallies in New Brunswick late last year, the centre had its hand on the dial of a play to push back on protestors, as it held conference calls with DND, CSIS and the RCMP, among other federal departments. What has come clear since that ploy and this most recent play is that the GOC's role is to serve as an administrative, organizing, surveillance group, under a less somber guise.
As seen when Vancouver police raided the home of anti-pipeline activists in Vancouver, confiscating digital devices under the guise of graffiti charges, the ramifications of the government maintaining a database of this type could be far-reaching. A registry of past and planned demonstrations that can ultimately be used to spy on protestors is being viewed by opposition parties, the mainstream media and Canadian citizens alike as a serious challenge to a free-speaking democracy.
A potent opioid analgesic without addictive and respiratory adverse effects has been a predominant goal for opioid medicinal chemistry since the isolation of morphine from opium in the 19th century. Here we report a functional profile of a unique analog, BU08028, targeting a combination of a classical and nonclassical opioid receptors in monkeys. By examining behavioral, physiological, and pharmacologic factors, the present study demonstrates that BU08028 exhibits full antinociception and antihypersensitivity without reinforcing effects (i.e., abuse liability), respiratory depression, pruritus, adverse cardiovascular events, or acute physical dependence. Because monkey models provide the most phylogenetically appropriate evaluation of opioid receptor functions and drug effects, these findings provide a translational bridge for such ligands as effective analgesics without safety and abuse liability concerns.
Abstract
Despite the critical need, no previous research has substantiated safe opioid analgesics without abuse liability in primates. Recent advances in medicinal chemistry have led to the development of ligands with mixed mu opioid peptide (MOP)/nociceptin-orphanin FQ peptide (NOP) receptor agonist activity to achieve this objective. BU08028 is a novel orvinol analog that displays a similar binding profile to buprenorphine with improved affinity and efficacy at NOP receptors. The aim of this preclinical study was to establish the functional profile of BU08028 in monkeys using clinically used MOP receptor agonists for side-by-side comparisons in various well-honed behavioral and physiological assays. Systemic BU08028 (0.001–0.01 mg/kg) produced potent long-lasting (i.e., >24 h) antinociceptive and antiallodynic effects, which were blocked by MOP or NOP receptor antagonists. More importantly, the reinforcing strength of BU08028 was significantly lower than that of cocaine, remifentanil, or buprenorphine in monkeys responding under a progressive-ratio schedule of drug self-administration. Unlike MOP receptor agonists, BU08028 at antinociceptive doses and ∼10- to 30-fold higher doses did not cause respiratory depression or cardiovascular adverse events as measured by telemetry devices. After repeated administration, the monkeys developed acute physical dependence on morphine, as manifested by precipitated withdrawal signs, such as increased respiratory rate, heart rate, and blood pressure. In contrast, monkeys did not show physical dependence on BU08028. These in vivo findings in primates not only document the efficacy and tolerability profile of bifunctional MOP/NOP receptor agonists, but also provide a means of translating such ligands into therapies as safe and potentially abuse-free opioid analgesics.
B.C. should put off its decision on the proposed Site C project to allow time to study geothermal alternatives, says a geothermal industry group, citing a new study that concludes such projects could meet all of the province's future power needs.
In a report released Tuesday, the Canadian Geothermal Energy Association said a "portfolio" of geothermal facilities could be built for less money than the projected $8-billion cost of Site C while generating similar amounts of power. In addition, it would have other advantages over a single, big dam, including a smaller environmental footprint and the generation of heat as a byproduct.
Energy minister Bill Bennett, however, said that while geothermal may have a role in the province, it is not likely to be developed in time to eliminate the need for Site C.

"In B.C., the market has been really slow to pick [geothermal] up," Mr. Bennett said. "There have been a few licences granted over the years and a few million dollars invested but nobody has actually found a geothermal resource that you can convert into electricity. So we are a ways away from actually being able to use it."
The province is currently considering whether to build Site C, a hydroelectricity project on the Peace River that would have a capacity of 1,100 megawatts.
Two existing facilities on the Peace River – the Peace Canyon and G.M. Shrum generating stations – together have a capacity of about 3,424 megawatts and account for an estimated 28 per cent of B.C. Hydro's total capacity.
B.C. Hydro maintains Site C is the cleanest, most cost-effective way to meet future energy needs.
A joint review panel that studied Site C said in its May report that "failure to pursue research" over the past 30 years had left B.C. Hydro without information about geothermal alternatives.
The panel also noted that new sources of energy are not required immediately, CanGEA chair Alison Thompson said on Tuesday in releasing the new CanGEA report.
"So there is time to complete proper due diligence, built geothermal plants and catch up to the rest of the world after 30 years of downplaying geothermal," she said in a statement.

Mr. Bennett said the province has research under way to identify promising geothermal resources.
"It [geothermal] is a good resource, we do want to use it," Mr. Bennett said. "It will be important in B.C. in the future. It is not a replacement – it's not a way to get the 1,100 megawatts of electricity that we need today."
Both the provincial and federal governments issued environment approvals to Site C in October.
The province is expected to announce a final investment decision on Site C before the end of the year.
With a report from Justine Hunter in Victoria
A report from a joint review panel released Thursday urged provincial and federal governments to consider 50 recommendations if they decide to proceed with the Site C hydroelectric megaproject on the Peace River in northern B.C.
Still, it will take several more months for the final decision to be made. Do you support the project? Cast your vote below or click here.

Image caption Many women experience debilitating heavy periods
Around a quarter of women of reproductive age suffer from heavy bleeding which blights their lives every month.
A report by experts at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has found significant variations in the care they are offered.
Sarah, now 44, has experienced severe, prolonged, bleeding ever since she started her periods at the age of 13.
"We had a register for PE and were excused showers if we were on our periods. But because my name was down on the register for the previous week, I was made to go into the communal showers, even though I was bleeding.
"I've suffered on and off from anaemia, and so had to take iron tablets, all my life."
She saw her first specialist at the age of 17, but that was to be the first of many appointments which failed to find a solution.
Sarah, who lives in Cornwall, said: "I particularly remember seeing a male consultant when I was very young. He was really awful, and had no time for me at all. I came out in floods of tears."
She has had two surgical procedures to try to ease her symptoms, one in her early 30s to have polyps and fibroids removed, and a second five years ago to remove the damaged lining of her womb - a procedure called endometrial ablation.
On both occasions, her symptoms abated - but then came back as bad as they had been before.
'I'm 100% ready'
Sarah was recently told she has severe endometriosis (where small pieces of the womb lining are found outside the womb) and adhesions caused by her previous surgery.
She says she is now "100% ready for a hysterectomy".
"My bleeding affects my sleep because I have to get up to go to the toilet in the night, I get chronic diarrhoea, migraines.
"And it affects me at work.
It is possible that the quality of care does vary throughout the country Professor Allan Templeton,, RCOG
"I've had to take in plastic bags to put on my chair in case I leak through. Sometimes I've taken in changes of clothes too."
Sarah has been told she needs an exploratory procedure to assess exactly how surgeons would carry out her hysterectomy, but she hopes to have had it by the end of the year.
The RCOG investigation found significant regional variations in surgical rates.
Between 2003 and 2006, the proportion of women having surgery who underwent endometrial ablation (a less invasive surgical procedure) ranged from 46% to 75% within the 10 strategic health authorities in England.
The rest had hysterectomies.
After April 2006, the proportion varied from 64% in the east midlands to 82% in the north east.
Professor Allan Templeton, from the RCOG, said: "We don't know why there is this variation, and are carrying out further work to investigate further.
"But it is possible that patients' expectations are different, that the range of care and treatments offered are different in different areas.
"What we really want to find out is what women think of their care. Are they satisfied? Do they think they are being offered all of the options? Are people taking their problems seriously? And is their quality of life improving?
"With the regional variations, it is possible that the quality of care does vary throughout the country."
Tech is as much a liability as it is an opportunity, as this election demonstrated. The next few years will be scary for many reasons, and to some more than others, and part of that will be the continued and likely expanded exploitation of the technologies and services we've come to rely on. Communities likely to be targeted by Trump policies may want to take a few steps online to help ensure their safety and privacy.
Trump has gone on the record asking for backdoors to encryption and devices, saying he supports surveillance, and is against Net Neutrality. Policies pursuant to these goals will necessarily put your data at risk.
The following are privacy tips anyone can use, but they are particularly relevant for anyone who, for example, plans to participate in protests or grassroots organizing, or for undocumented immigrants who would like to decrease their online presence. I've listed them roughly in order of importance.
Ditch SMS and use end-to-end encryption
If Trump makes good on his promise to make deportation of undocumented immigrants, you can expect police to bring the same measures they use in serious crimes to bear on this task. One such measure is the interception of mobile phone calls and messages, whether using a Stingray-type device (which imitates a cell tower, causing phones to send it data instead) or more traditional tapping at the network level.
Ordinary phone calls and text messages are incredibly easy to collect this way, and are often also exposed as part of other investigations. It's easily imagined that the police may run a dragnet in areas densely populated by immigrants and watch for keywords pertaining to under the table employment, family across the border, remittances, and so on.
They can't do that if you're using an app like Signal, which uses “end-to-end encryption,” preventing electronic snooping anywhere along the line — including on the service's own servers and while the data is in transit between networks and devices. This type of encryption is the bane of every authority because not only can they not see what is being sent, nor can the company that runs it, so the information can't be subpoenaed or hacked out.
It may be a pain, but getting your family and friends switched over to one of these apps could prevent a lot of trouble down the line.
Some other options, if for some reason Signal doesn't work: WhatsApp is a popular and versatile option, but it's owned by Facebook, and while it's technically independent, that still makes us nervous. Apple's iMessage is reliable and popular, but requires an iOS device or Mac — Apple is also under tremendous scrutiny, having been called out specifically by Trump as a company to put pressure on.
Avoid Allo and Telegram, which have been criticized for their encryption and privacy choices.
Encrypt the contents of your computer and phone
If you're on a major computing or mobile platform, encryption is available but may not be enabled by default. Windows has Bitlocker, Macs have FileVault — turning them on is simple (follow the instructions in those links) and it doesn't change the way you use your computer at all.
It's the same, more or less, on iOS and Android. On Android, go to Settings>Security>Encrypt Phone and follow the instructions there. Some phones may have this enabled by default, but it's good to check. On iOS, if you've set up a PIN or TouchID, your device is already encrypted — but if you skipped that step because you don't like tapping a code every time you check your email, you might want to reconsider that choice now.
Use a get-home-safe app
Trump's naked xenophobia, tacit support of vigilantism, and lack of concern over police militarization and brutality suggest it may soon become far less safe for people of color, Muslims and Sikhs, LGBT individuals and other targeted minorities to walk home alone. Tech can't prevent bigotry and bashing, but it can at the very least help create a safety net.
Apps like Kitestring and Companion let you set emergency contacts, and if you, for example, don't check in at home within 15 minutes, or if you shake the phone hard for 5 seconds, it will send them your location and a message that you need help. (They use SMS, but we'll make an exception in this case.)
It's scary and unfair that this should even have to be recommended, but it's an opportunity to protect yourself using technology you already have. Check with some friends and see what app looks best.
Go private on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Google
Part of the fun of social networks is the idea that you're sharing with the world. But law enforcement also uses them as investigative tools, establishing whereabouts, work history, and anything else that your posts imply. Like anything you say to the police, this can and will be used against you, and if you have reason to think you may be targeted by them, you should make it difficult to get at. Making your account private is an easy way to do that, even if it'll be harder to garner followers.
Be sure to check your preferences and privacy settings in every app and service and opt out of things like default public check-ins or anything with “personalized,” “tailored,” or “curated” in it — it means they're reading your data.
On Google, you should turn off (“pause”) your location history and opt out of other tracking measures in the search and ads areas. On your phone, you can turn off location services or restrict them per app. Using an alternative to Google, like DuckDuckGo, helps keep your browsing habits private.
Install HTTPS everywhere
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has a plug-in for Chrome, Firefox, and other browsers that forces them to make a secure connection even when it isn't the default for the website or service you're connecting to. You'll also be warned when the connection isn't secure (browsers also tell you this, but not very loudly).
Keep your phone and PC software up to date
The latest versions of Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS don't bring just the latest features, but also lots of fixes for serious security holes. These fixes will apply to a few of the previous versions, but not really old ones. Hackers — and the authorities — know this. If your phone and OS are new enough to take full advantage of encryption tools and resist well-known methods for unlocking and hacking, they're secure against adversaries domestic and foreign.
It isn't always easy to stay updated, but keep it in mind when buying a new phone or computer. If you're on an OS more than a year or two old — before things like full-disk encryption were standard — you should consider updating at the earliest opportunity.
Slightly older iPhones will still get the critical updates (mainly iOS 8) that added broader encryption, as will Nexus phones and other flagship devices. Budget (but still modern) phones like the Moto E and G are also great options for those on a budget.
Look into a VPN
Virtual Private Networks obscure your internet traffic from your ISP and others by routing it through other servers first. If all your connections are to your VPN (which then passes it on to wherever it was headed), and your VPN doesn't keep any records of those connections, there are far fewer ways for your browsing to be tracked.
Good VPNs cost money. We don't recommend any VPN in particular, but it should be a VPN that plainly states that it doesn't log your traffic. Examples include ExpressVPN, Anonymizer, and Private Internet Access. There are dozens to choose from, however, and I don't claim to be an expert; many are reviewed here if you want to be careful about the jurisdiction the VPN is based, the extent of its record keeping, and so on.
Get a backup/burner phone
If you attend lots of protests or demonstrations, or often choose to film police encounters, you might want to keep a burner phone around in case yours gets smashed or confiscated. You can get a cheap Android phone for $100 or less, and if you aren't relying on SMS and phonecalls, you can do pretty much everything you need over wi-fi until you get a replacement.
Change your DNS
Should the authorities choose to enforce blocks of certain websites — for your own sake, of course — the easiest way to do it is ordering major domain name services (which connect URLs like beta.techcrunch.com to IP addresses like 155.91.18.66) to simply prevent internet users from getting to them. Fortunately, this type of censorship is as easy to circumvent as it is to put in place.
You can easily change the DNS your computer uses in its network settings. OpenNIC has detailed instructions for various operating systems, and has proven itself trustworthy. Google's Public DNS is another option, and has the benefit of being easy to remember: change the preferred and alternate DNS servers to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 respectively.
Set up Firechat or another off-grid communication tool
Another way governments have quashed dissent is by suppressing mobile communication altogether. It can't hurt to have an app like Firechat installed on your phone, which passes messages directly between devices without the need for a network. This is also useful in case of power outages and other disasters — a good emergency measure to take regardless.
Avoid the “Internet of Things”
Even if the various smart appliances worked well, we'd still have issues with their security and the way data is handled. You're not missing out on much, so just skip the wi-fi front door lock and Amazon Echo for now.
Go end-to-end encrypted on email and cloud storage too
This is harder to do for many people, since services like Gmail and Dropbox have become practically ubiquitous. But if you're really worried about privacy, there are options that provide similar services but with a “zero knowledge” guarantee — basically that the company that runs them never knows a thing about what you use their service for.
ProtonMail is a solid one if you're looking to get away from Gmail, or just have a second email for sensitive topics. SpiderOak One is like a super-private Dropbox.
Install an alternative OS
If you're really worried about snooping, consider using an alternative to the standard operating systems that's designed with privacy and security in mind. This isn't an easy option but it might be good to explore if you have an old laptop or phone lying around.
Copperhead is worth trying if you're used to Android, although it won't have all the conveniences of the usual Google-powered version. Tails is what Edward Snowden has recommended for desktop and laptop work that needs to stay private. It's basically a simple, security-focused OS that deletes itself when you're done.

A growing imbalance between phosphorus and nitrogen fertilizer use in Africa could lead to crop yield reductions of nearly 30% by 2050, according to a new study from researchers at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA).
Underuse of phosphorus-based fertilizers in Africa currently contributes to a growing yield gap—the difference between how many crops could produce in ideal circumstances compared to actual yields. This phosphorus-specific yield gap currently lies at around 10% for subsistence farmers, but will grow to 27% by 2050 if current trends continue, according to a study published today in the journal Global Change Biology.
“This research shows that the imbalance between nitrogen and phosphorus applications has the potential to further limit food production for a growing population in Africa” says Marijn van der Velde, a researcher now at the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, who led the study while working at IIASA.
While nitrogen-based fertilizers can be produced by a process that extracts the element from the air, phosphorus must be mined from rock—and reserves are limited. That makes phosphorus fertilizers expensive, especially in the longer term.
“Farmers with limited money are more likely to buy and have access to cheaper nitrogen-based fertilizers,” says van der Velde. “While this might work in the short term, in the longer term it has a negative effect on crop growth as soil nutrients become more imbalanced.”
As farmers use fertilizers for their crops, nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus build up in the soil, providing a reserve of nutrients that plants need to grow. But fertilizer use remains very low in Africa, and to increase crop production, it is widely recognized that farmers must increase their fertilizer use. And while nitrogen-based fertilizer usage has begun to increase in Africa in the last 10 years, the application of phosphorus to cropland has not kept pace, leading to a growing imbalance between nitrogen and phosphorus levels in soil. The new study shows that increases in nitrogen and phosphorus inputs must happen in a way that provides crops with the balanced nutrient input they need.
The study used data from Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) crop trials as well as an established large-scale crop model to estimate how the imbalance affects current and future crop yields.
“Previous research has looked at these effects on a field and local scale, but this is the first study to do so at the continental scale,” says IIASA researcher Christian Folberth, who also worked on the study.
In order to make optimal use of current nitrogen inputs, the researchers estimated that phosphorus applications would need to increase 2.3-fold. To close yield gaps nitrogen applications would have to increase 5-fold. Phosphorus applications would have to increase nearly 12-fold from 2.2 to 25.9 kg per hectare.
But because of the cost of phosphorus, that remains a challenge. ”While much of the remaining phosphorus reserves are found in Morocco, on the African continent, we need to find better ways for African farmers to access this precious resource” says van der Velde.
The global phosphorus cycle is, besides nitrogen, also increasingly growing out of balance with carbon, the subject of another recent paper by the same group of researchers and a new European Research Council grant for continued research by IIASA and an international team of scientists.
“The change in the stoichiometry of nitrogen and carbon from rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations relative to phosphorus has no equivalent in the Earth's history and the impacts will go beyond the agricultural sector.” says van der Velde.

Not even the winter break is enough to cool down Aron Johannsson.
Playing in AZ Alkmaar's first game since Dec. 21, Johannsson got back on the scoresheet in the club's 3-0 victory over NAC Breda on Saturday. The U.S. Men's National Team forward found the back of the net mere moments from halftime, getting on the end of a cross from the left flank before heading a ball that ricocheted off his body but still rolled past the goal line after kissing the inside of the post.
Johannsson's goal, which gave AZ a 2-0 lead, gives him 19 across all competitions this season. He also now has 12 in league play, which makes him the third-highest scorer in the Eredivisie behind SC Heerenveen's Alfredh Finnbogason (17) and Feyenoord's Graziano Pelle (13).
Here is the goal:
—–
What do you think of Johannsson's latest goal? How many more will he score by season's end? Starting to think every U.S. forward should go to AZ?

IT'S been called “Australia's Ark”, our own Galapagos, with 24 native species found nowhere else on earth. The animals are 10 per cent larger than mainland creatures, because they're not scrawny from running for their lives.
They're friendly, having never known predation from cats, foxes or dingoes, let alone hungry Aboriginal or white hunters.
Barrow Island, 100km off WA's Pilbara coast, has since 1910 been listed as an A-Class reserve, among the most protected type of land anywhere. It is also home to Australia's largest gas project, Gorgon, being built by American company Chevron.
Chevron talks of managing a new kind of Eden, where nature coexists alongside massive industry.
Naturalist Harry Butler, a consultant for Chevron, calls Barrow a “most remarkable place” that has not been subject to “the influences of the pioneers, the colonists, the farmers, the pastoralists, the city dwellers”.
It has however been subject to the influences of Chevron, which Forbes this year named the world's 11th biggest oil and gas company. Butler says Chevron sets world standards for big mining in fragile environments.
Most important are the island's remarkable quarantine procedures, including the shrink-wrapping and fumigation of pallets of incoming equipment, to stop mice, rats, snakes, insects and plant matter from making a break for it and starting new life on Barrow.
They even shrink-wrap and fumigate bulldozers.
“But for ordinary people, Barrow is a place where you can see what Australia was like before the coming of white men,” says Butler in a 2011 Chevron promo, that shows turtles and mud crabs but nothing of the giant LNG gas facility and port now approaching completion.
The problem is that no ordinary Australian can visit the American-controlled island.
Twice in the last 11 months, Chevron has denied requests from News Corp Australia to visit Barrow, to see first-hand the miracle of nature coexisting with big industry.
WA's Department of Parks and Wildlife — who supposedly control the A-Class reserve, that is, more than 95 per cent of the 234sq km island — cannot help. They say any arrangements must be made with Chevron.
Passing sailors or fishermen are not permitted to weigh anchor and stretch their legs for fear of bringing invasive species ashore in their boardshorts and eskies. Local police confirmed that Barrow is off-limits to all Australians, except for the 3000 FIFO workers who live in a closely monitored world of no-go zones.
No work vehicle may leave the island's 1200km of dirt tracks, all strictly speed-limited to save starry-eyed golden bandicoots, spectacled hare-wallabies and Barrow Island euros from becoming road kill — which happens often, according to the available road toll, because they are naive of the motor-car concept.
But the Chevron sparky who is told he may not bring his rod and lure to the island to “minimise the impact to fish” won't complain that he must contain his leisure activities to the two swimming pools, cricket nets, tennis and basketball courts, soccer fields, golf-driving nets, bocce courts and putting greens.
He's earning around $300,000pa for a 26-day-on, nine-day-off shift, and if he has to avert his eyes from one of the cute little hopping things that come by the dorms to say hello of an evening, he can live with that.
He knows he faces instant dismissal if he's seen throwing the merest Twistie to one of them. He can't even eat outside of a designated mess. That's sackable, too.
Night lighting in the camps is dull orange in order not to disorient easily confused turtles; leftover food is frozen and taken to the mainland; drinking water is made from seawater. Sewage is buried, deep.
Prior to arrival on Barrow, workers are put through a privately run customs-style inspection of his or her belongings. Pockets are turned out, the undercarriage of runners examined, bags searched.
They're looking for seeds or any personal food items that could turn into unwelcome plants, or the bloke who cannot stand to leave home his axolotl on his long shift.
Chevron is desperate to protect its reputation on the island, saying it has built “the world's largest non-government quarantine initiative”. It's hugely expensive — and is part of the reason for the project's huge cost blowouts, which last year reportedly upped from the original $37bn to $54bn.
Worker gossip on the reason for the extraordinary quarantine measures goes like this: “Chevron is using Barrow Island to show that big industry can coexist on an A-class reserve to prove that it can manage drilling and extraction in other pristine areas such as Alaska, the Arctic and Antarctica.”
Piers Verstegen, director of the Conversation Council of WA, says it's not scuttlebutt but sound business logic: “I think it's well-accepted that's the reason why Chevron is prepared to incur such significant added costs. It's a long play that will improve their ability to have developments in sensitive areas.”
The company was not coy when asked about this, stating: “Chevron has proven that with proper management and the right workforce culture, developments the size of Gorgon and the environment can co-exist.”
Yet there are always breaks in any quarantine wall. Chevron and the WA Government refer to non-specific “critical breaches” and give little detail. Most assume this means mice, rats, buffel grass and other weeds.
A cat would constitute the most critical breach of all. So far no worker — the kind that anonymously tips off the Wilderness Society, unions and the Greens about dead animals and invasive weeds — has ever mentioned a cat.
“If a cat was found on Barrow Island,” a former FIFO told me, “that info would be harder to get out of Chevron than a list of ASIO's current operations.”
There is admiration in the workforce for the sheer doggedness of Chevron's quarantine blockade, where the future of the burrowing bettong — aka, the Barrow Island boodie — is treated straight-faced as seriously as billions in gas revenue.
“They've done a great job avoiding impact,” says the ex-worker. “But it's massively impacted anyway.”
Robin Chapple from the WA Greens is the mosquito heard most often whining in the ears of Chevron and the WA Government over Barrow.
He remembers how in 2003 the Environment Protection Authority recommended against the Gorgon LNG expansion and how Premier Colin Barnett, then in Opposition, opposed Chevron bringing gas onshore to Barrow from its Jantz and Gorgon deep-sea fields, northwest of the island.
He wanted the gas piped to the mainland. Barnett said there was “no technical reason that the LNG plant — or, indeed, any future gas processing plants — needs to be on Barrow Island. An LNG plant is a helluva large plant.”
His views have since changed.
Chevron has been on Barrow since the early 1960s, when Caltex (owned by Texaco and Standard Oil, later known as Chevron) joined with Ampol to form West Australian Petroleum Pty Ltd (WAPET). Now Chevron runs the show.
Back in WAPET times, they pulled oil from the 400 or so “nodding donkey” land rigs, but these days those donkeys mostly pull saline water. Offshore gas is the game.
Chapple, who once worked reviewing environmental conditions on the island, recalls extraordinary measures to protect the island, back when Harry Butler was very hands-on (he's now 85).
“They spent thousands of dollars tracking down one mouse,” says Chapple.
“It was seen running out of pipe that was being offloaded from a barge. They established a 300m perimeter, sent a group of people in who caught every animal they could, then fumigated the area and everything was killed.
“And they found that mouse and nailed it. Now we know there have been more ‘critical' breaches in recent years. What they are, we don't know, because they haven't been able to provide the information.”
Some believe it refers to invasive buffel grass. It could be a rat, or two. Now, escapee beetles, rodents, snakes and seeds are harder to manage as work intensifies in anticipation of the arrival of the first gas coming ashore on Barrow, later this year.
Marsupials are being relocated to other remote islands and the mainland. This is part of Chevron's requirement to undertake environmental “offsets” by starting new colonies in other places where they've disappeared.
With no independent observer permitted on the island, Verstegen says it remains “an open question” whether animals are also being shifted because they're not coping under pressure.
In 2011, our sister paper, the Sunday Times, used Freedom of Information to reveal that more than 1500 animals died natural and unnatural deaths on the island between 2009 and 2011, several “mown down” each day by work vehicles.
It's not the numbers that are shocking. It's that you need to FOI a marsupial road toll on an Australian island.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) changed a rule in December that will make it harder to capitalize the cost of cloud set-up and implementation expenses, a change that may encourage some enterprises to opt instead for traditional on-premise software.
The FASB Accounting Standards Update to “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-use Software (Subtopic 350-40)” addresses “Customer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement.” And while the update didn't set out to address how to account for cloud migration costs, the new rules, combined with the FASB's decision “not to provide additional guidance on the accounting for upfront costs,” will mean enterprise shops can no longer depreciate some fees involved in a cloud migration.
Hugo Vasquez, Deputy CIO and VP of Technology and Services for AES, a Fortune 200 global power company, said prior to the change his company was able to capitalize the cost of a cloud migration project and write off that investment over three years. “Now with the new rules, the project itself cannot be capitalized,” Vasquez says.
How big a deal is that? Vasquez says AES last year migrated to Workday's cloud-based human resources tool. “We were able to capitalize around $4.46 million to implement the project, which went live at the beginning of this month. Our integrator was Deloitte, and we capitalized those costs and the labor of our own people, so we had an incentive to move forward with a cloud solution. But today I couldn't capitalize that $4.46 million. And that change is resulting in a reduction in projects in our company to move to a cloud computing model.”
Google, one of many companies that commented on the suggested change before it went into effect Dec. 15, agreed that the shift will dampen interest in cloud computing services. In a comment letter to the FASB submitted by Google, Director of Finance Amie Thuener wrote: “We believe that the Proposed Standard could result in a disincentive to purchase hosted cloud computing arrangements if companies interpret the wording … to mean that implementation costs should be expensed as incurred” (versus capitalized and depreciated).
A host of other large companies, from Visa to Salesforce to Groupon, also weighed in on different aspects of the rule change, collectively suggesting, at the least, that more work needs to be done on this specific issue, say nothing of the larger question about how to account for cloud services going forward.
The intent of the change
The FASB Accounting Standards Update in question set out to clarify the rules because “existing GAAP (generally accepted accounting principals) does not include explicit guidance about a customer's accounting fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement.” (FASB sets the accounting rules for public companies that the Securities and Exchange Committee enforces.)
In essence the Update concludes that, if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should “account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses.” Regarding the latter, a company with, say, a $30 million license for an on-premise Oracle product, may capitalize that as an asset and depreciate $10 million per year over three years, recognizing that as an expense on their income statement.
The Update continues: “If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract.”
One of the perceived advantages of cloud computing is the ability to shift from capital-intensive infrastructure/software investments to a service subscription model paid out of the operating budget, so in and of itself this guidance isn't too surprising. But the Update goes on to say:
“Some stakeholders wanted the scope of this Update to be expanded to address a customer's accounting for implementation, set up, and other upfront costs that often are incurred by customers entering into cloud computing arrangements. The activities that entities perform in conjunction with entering into a cloud computing arrangement include training, creating or installing an interface, reconfiguring existing systems, and capturing and reformatting data. The board observed that to the extent a cloud computing arrangement transfers a software license, Subtopic 350-40 provides guidance on how to account for costs such as those resulting from training, data capture, and conversion activities.
“In deciding not to provide additional guidance on the accounting for upfront costs incurred by customers entering into cloud computing arrangements that do not transfer a software license to a customer, the Board noted that initial costs incurred in service arrangements are not unique to cloud computing arrangements. Consequently, the scope of that issue is much broader than the scope of this Update. The Board decided that the scope of this Update should not be expanded to address the range of implementation and setup costs incurred by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement.”
There is, however, disagreement in the comment letters about whether a license is the proper litmus test for cloud service accounting. In HP's comment letter, Senior Vice President, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer Jeff Ricci writes, “as a vendor, HP generally believes its customer is paying for a hosted service, not the acquisition of software or a software license.”
And if no license is involved, the new rules mean companies can no longer capitalize upfront cloud project costs.
Google urges the FASB to delve deeper on this core issue: “We encourage the FASB to consider issuing explicit guidance with respect to the accounting treatment of implementation costs, as these costs can be significant,” Thuener wrote. “We believe capitalizing the software implementation costs and amortizing the corresponding asset over its useful life better reflects the economics of the transaction as expenses are recorded in a manner that reflects the consumption of the economic benefit from the software implementation costs, and therefore is more helpful to readers of financial statements in the analysis of assets and expenses.”
Even companies that agree with using the license model to figure out how to account for cloud services want the FASB to clarify its position on upfront costs given that the “costs can be substantial.” James Hoffmesiter, Corporate Controller for Visa, writes: “While we are supportive of the FASB's proposal for how to evaluate the arrangement to determine if it is a software license or a service contract, we respectfully request that the FASB consider expanding the proposed standard to include guidance on the accounting for one-time set-up fees incurred by a customer under a cloud computing arrangement.”
Visa goes on to add another wrinkle to the upfront cost discussion. Instead of capitalizing those costs, Visa argues that the “set-up/integration costs should be considered part of the total service cost and recognized over the term of the service agreement,” because the set-up costs “provide a future benefit to the customer in the form of continuous connectivity to the service provider.”
Bigger question going forward
The FASB more or less admitted there is more work to be done when it determined the “scope of this Update should not be expanded to address the range of implementation and setup costs incurred by a customer,” but some of the companies that commented on the update are pushing for a more fundamental review of cloud computing accounting, and more specifically, the role of licenses in that accounting.
Joseph Allanson, Chief Accounting Officer at Salesforce.com, wrote: “We do not agree with the Board's proposal that a cloud computing arrangement should be accounted for as a service contract if the arrangement does not include a software license. We believe that the delivery mechanism, or the customer's ability to take possession of the software, should not determine whether a software element is present in a cloud computing arrangement as the functionality of the underlying software is the same regardless of whether the software is delivered via the cloud or on-premise software license. We encourage the board to develop an accounting framework that is based on the economics rather than the form of the software arrangements.”
Groupon's Chief Accounting Officer Brian Stevens also called for a broader review: “We believe that accounting guidance resulting in a more consistent presentation of software costs, regardless of whether the purchaser elects to maintain the underlying software on its own servers in an on-premise arrangement or contracts to have it maintained on a third party's servers in a cloud computing arrangement, would reduce complexity for users of financial statements by increasing comparability between economically similar transactions.”
And in a comment letter filed with the FASB, Jay Buth, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer with Northeast Utilities System, argues that “both [software] licenses and cloud rights represent intangible assets, and we believe that … these two economically similar types of arrangements should be given similar accounting treatment. We do not believe an entity's lack of ownership, title or license to software should preclude capitalization.”
Vasquez of AES hopes the FASB reviews the decision soon because it is “affecting our costs and our projects, which is affecting our people, our morale.”

Or not. The band make instrumental just as transcendent and crushing as it should be. Today we get a glimpse at the video for “Palisades” from the new EP. Of the video, the band;s label, Deathbound Records, has this to say:
“The video was assembled from footage taken during the recording sessions for the Wave II EP. It showcases the band in their favourite environment to create and work in: Pavillon Noir Studios in Montreal. Using guerilla style filming coupled with superimposed black and white imagery; they keep things nebulous, only allowing the viewer to get a slight glimpse of their inner workings. These reclusive musicians choose to remain as anonymous as possible while letting the music do all the communicating.
With its call to arms feel, “Palisades” encapsulates the listener with its haunting melancholy. The military-inspired breakdown launches the track into a serene convulsion of incendiary melodies with a burst of never ending white light. Like electric church serving to remind music fans that post rock can still dangerous, combining both grandiosity with neck splitting riffs, finesse with raw emotion.”
Single “Palisades” will be available through digital media outlets (iTunes, Spotify, etc) this Friday, March 17. Wave II will be available in its entirety on April 7.
Add SPF records to all domain on Plesk server
Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an email validation system designed to prevent email spam by detecting email spoofing, a common vulnerability, by verifying sender IP addresses. SPF allows administrators to specify which hosts are allowed to send mail from a given domain by creating a specific SPF record (or TXT record) in the Domain Name System (DNS). Mail exchangers use the DNS to check that mail from a given domain is being sent by a host sanctioned by that domain's administrators.
Plesk stores all the information including DNS entries in database. So if you manually edit the zone files and add the SPF record it will be wiped out when DNS record is updated next time. So You will have to add the SPF records for the domains from the Plesk interface. For a few domains you can do that manually but if you have to add SPF records for all the domain then it's going to be a problem. You can run the below commands to add SPF records to all the domain on the server.
First of all add the SPF entry in the database
mysql -u admin -p`cat /etc/psa/.psa.shadow` psa -e "select dns_zone_id,displayHost from dns_recs GROUP BY dns_zone_id ORDER BY dns_zone_id ASC;" | awk '{print "INSERT INTO dns_recs (type,host,val,time_stamp,dns_zone_id,displayHost,displayVal) VALUES ('\''TXT'\'','\''"$2"'\'','\''v=spf1 a mx ~all'\'',NOW(),"$1",'\''"$2"'\'','\''v=spf1 a mx ~all'\'');"}' | mysql -u admin -p`cat /etc/psa/.psa.shadow` psa
Then force plesk to update all the dns zone files.
mysql -Ns -uadmin -p`cat /etc/psa/.psa.shadow` -D psa -e 'select name from domains' | awk '{system("/usr/local/psa/admin/bin/dnsmng --update "$1)}'
An exclusive sex party run by an elite erotic club based in Los Angeles is being headed to the Hamptons this summer.
Snctm, which reportedly counts Bill Maher, Gwyneth Paltrow and several musicians among its fans, is planning a black-tie 'Masquerade' event in the Hamptons on August 5.
The club, which recently held a sex party at a downtown Manhattan hotel, will be keeping attendance small - with a guest list of only 99 people.

The location of the party, and the identity of the property owner, will be kept secret until the last minute, when party guests are notified where to go, according to Page Six.
Organizers say they usually get more than 1,000 applications for invitations on their website, but there are just 99 spots available for the party.
Membership to Snctm comes at a price: interested parties must submit an application and pay an annual feel of between $12,000 and $75,000, while highest level members take part in a 'blood oath', according to the New York Post.
To attend each party, male members pay between $1,500 and $1,875 (less if a female partner is brought). VIP annual membership is $75,000.
Women do not pay but are required to submit an application in the form of full-body photographs.
Privacy is an important consideration for the club. Mobile phones are banned and everybody is required to wear masks on entry.
Snctm creator Damon Lawner, 45, said earlier this year that only 11 men and one woman have been bestowed with the highest level membership.
Snctm creator Damon Lawner (left), 45, said members include Grammy-winning artists and said Gwyneth Paltrow (right) has attended their parties with her boyfriend, Glee producer, Brad Falchuk
This includes entry to every party - including access to private rooms - a special silver necklace and the advice of sex experts.
Alternatively, there is a lower level membership that offers discounted party tickets and networking opportunities.
Lawner claims its members include Grammy-winning artists and said Gwyneth Paltrow has attended their parties with her boyfriend, Glee producer, Brad Falchuk.
'[Gwyneth is] not a crazy-kinky person, like people think,' Lawner said. 'She's a down-to-earth total sweetheart...They are exploratory with each other.'
Lawner, who is a father-of-two and divorced, founded the club four years ago.
He said some members attend parties to learn 'how to give better [pleasure]' while others see it as a place 'for primal urges to be explored'.
Last year Scntm held a secret party in New York to coincide with fashion week where guests were required to collect keys engraved with the location address.
Organizers say they usually get more than 1,000 applications for invitations on their website, but there are just 99 spots available for the party. Pictured above, an ad from the company's site
Lawner claims that his 20 employees and himself are banned from engaging in sex at the parties but, according to the New York Post, he likes to watch.
A promotional video shows women in lingerie crawling around the floor and on their hands and knees serving and licking a masked man sat on a chair in a tuxedo.
Despite the focus on eroticism of the club, Lawner claims it has 'never been about sex'.
He told Paltrow's lifestyle website Goop: 'There are sex parties out there and I've honestly never been to one, nor desire to.
'Snctm is a place to get turned on, to explore, to hold hands, to realize that sex doesn't have to be hidden away. It can be open and celebrated, and that's all right.'
Meanwhile, Showtime is working on a reality show about the erotic club, and sources told Page Six that eight episodes have already been filmed.
As Fox News continues to ponder its stance on immigration and other issues relevant to the Latino community, Fox News chief Roger Ailes suggested to The New Republic that the recently-launched Fox News Latino is designed in part to turn Latino audiences into political conservatives.
Ailes told The New Republic on Monday that he "sees the Latino audience as a 'tremendous business opportunity,'" which helps explain the 2010 launch of Fox News Latino, a mostly English-language website aimed at younger Hispanic generations. From The New Republic (emphasis added):
"The contributions being made by Latinos are extraordinary, and we need to talk about them," Ailes says. The Fox News Latino stylebook uses "undocumented immigrant," and the site downplays immigration stories compared with some of its rivals. "Fox News Latino has a mission to point out the positives of the Latino population, operating within the framework of making America great," Ailes says. That's not as blandly neutral as it sounds. "Hispanics who get on government programs are doing only a little better than they were in the old country," Ailes elaborates. "Fox News Latino will show people how opportunities exist, that whenever we are overregulated, or there is too much government, we lose freedom. We lose power. That is, historically, one hundred percent true."
Fox News Latino often reports the same stories as other Fox outlets, but with a far more pro-immigrant tone. Its coverage is frequently at odds with other Fox entities, specifically the notoriously anti-immigrant Fox Nation.
Ailes denied allegations of Fox's pandering coverage in his interview with The New Republic, stating,"'There's an assumption that Fox News Latino is softer on Latinos than Fox News in general ...That's ridiculous.'"
Ailes' admission of political motive comes as no surprise following Fox's recent change of tune on immigration after the GOP's poor showing among Latinos in November's election. Though News Corp head Rupert Murdoch has long advocated for immigration reform, Fox News hosts only arrived at the same conclusion after Latinos came out in record numbers to vote for President Obama.
Another day, another controversy surrounding Toronto mayor Rob Ford.
When Ford is not defending his new, extravagant Cadillac Escalade or getting kissed in the entertainment district, he's watching the price of a Welcome to Toronto T-shirt depicting him giving the finger while talking on the phone go through the roof on eBay.
And don't even start on his tussle with a streetcar driver or slipping off the scale during a media weigh-in. It's enough to make Torontonians long for the days of Mel Lastman.
Today he's taking heat for a photo taken at the 2012 New Year's Levee at Toronto City Hall with a white supremacist. The photo, which appeared on a blog called Anti-Racist Canada, shows Ford proudly smiling in his chain of office shaking hands with Jon Latvis, dressed in a military uniform.
Latvis posted the photo to his Facebook profile with the caption "Me meeting Toronto's Mayor, Rob Ford to get an endorsement for the Latvian Homeguard - at Toronto City Hall."
Latvis was a former member of the neo-Nazi band RAHOWA (Racial Holy War).
Ford's press secretary, George Christopoulos, was quick to dismiss the photo according to the Toronto Sun.
"The mayor of Toronto meets and poses for photos with thousands of residents each year," Christopoulos said. "Over the past two years, he has hosted two New Year's levees. Both of these events welcomed thousands of visitors to City Hall. Many of those visitors were greeted and posed for a picture with the mayor."
Fair enough. However, Ford also met with Latvis in March to discuss "transit issues."
"During both the levee and the March meeting, the gentleman identified himself using a name different from the one attributed to him in the recent blog article," a statement from the mayor's office read. "Once the photograph was posted online today, mayor's office staff recognized the individual as someone who had met with the mayor at the levee and again in March."
Getting photographed next to a questionable character during public functions isn't unusual. It happened to former mayor David Miller, who was snapped with Daniel Katsnelson, who was found guilty in 2010 of two counts of sexual assault. And, of course, Mayor Mel was once photographed with various Hells Angels when they were in Toronto celebrating the gang's one-year anniversary in Toronto.
But to have a follow-up meeting with a guy who was wearing a Nazi-like uniform during a New Year's photo opp is something that should have gone through some level of pre-screening before it happened.
"I can confirm (Ford) did not endorse the Latvian Homeguard," Christopoulos said.
Well, thank goodness for that, at least.

The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank face fresh criticism today as campaigners blame their privatisation policies for the devastating famine in Malawi earlier this year.
In a report, published this morning, the World Development Movement attacks the programme of market reforms imposed on Malawi by the IMF and the World Bank over the past decade. It singled out the privatisation of the government's grain stocks, for which it specifically blames the IMF.
"Structural Damage - The Causes and Consequences of Malawi's Food Crisis" says that despite years of liberalisation and deregulation policies, Malawi this year faced its worst famine since 1949.
The WDM says the decision to privatise Malawi's agricultural development and marketing corporation - which maintained a central stock of grain and regulated prices - was pressed on the government by IMF staff at several meetings since 1996, and left the country unable to meet its emergency needs.
Kwesi Owusu and Francis Ng'ambi, the report's authors, accept that the corporation was ripe for reform, but argue that "rather than ensuring that social aims are achieved through accountable government, the IMF and the World Bank and other donors have pursued an agenda of austerity, deregulation and privatisation. Not only have the outcomes been disastrous but also the agenda of good governance and accountability has been abused by donors."
In 2002, Malawi will spend $70m (£49m) servicing debt. That is 20% of the national budget and more than it will spend on health, education and agriculture combined. The authors call on foreign creditors to cancel all of its debt, so that "the money could be used to develop the country to be self-reliant in food".
Malawi's debts contributed to the recent food crisis, concludes the report.
The IMF yesterday defended its role in this year's famine, accusing the government of failing to organise a large enough grain reserve to see Malawi through the emergency, which was first declared in February.
"The causes of food shortages in Malawi are complex, including lapses in the government's early warning systems, distortions in domestic markets, and mismanagement of food reserves."
United States Attorney Danny C. Williams, Sr. announced today that Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) Charles M. McLoughlin will lead the efforts of his Office in connection with the Justice Department's nationwide Election Day Program for the upcoming November 8, 2016, general elections. AUSA McLoughlin has been appointed to serve as the District Election Officer (DEO) for the Northern District of Oklahoma, and in that capacity is responsible for overseeing the District's handling of complaints of election fraud and voting rights abuses in consultation with Justice Department Headquarters in Washington.
United States Attorney Williams said, “Every citizen must be able to vote without interference or discrimination and to have that vote counted without it being stolen because of fraud. The Department of Justice will act promptly and aggressively to protect the integrity of the election process.”
The Department of Justice has an important role in deterring election fraud and discrimination at the polls, and combating these violations whenever and wherever they occur. The Department's long-standing Election Day Program furthers these goals, and also seeks to ensure public confidence in the integrity of the election process by providing local points of contact within the Department for the public to report possible election fraud and voting rights violations while the polls are open on election day.
Federal law protects against such crimes as intimidating or bribing voters, buying and selling votes, impersonating voters, altering vote tallies, stuffing ballot boxes, and marking ballots for voters against their wishes or without their input. It also contains special protections for the rights of voters and provides that they can vote free from acts that intimidate or harass them. For example, actions of persons designed to interrupt or intimidate voters at polling places by questioning or challenging them, or by photographing or videotaping them, under the pretext that these are actions to uncover illegal voting may violate federal voting rights law. Further, federal law protects the right of voters to mark their own ballot or to be assisted by a person of their choice.
The franchise is the cornerstone of American democracy. We all must ensure that those who are entitled to the franchise exercise it if they choose, and that those who seek to corrupt it is brought to justice. In order to respond to complaints of election fraud or voting rights abuses on November 8, 2016, and to ensure that such complaints are directed to the appropriate authorities, United States Attorney Williams stated that AUSA/DEO McLoughlin will be on duty in this District while the polls are open. He can be reached by the public at the following telephone number: (918) 382-2700.
In addition, the FBI will have special agents available in each field office and resident agency throughout the country to receive allegations of election fraud and other election abuses on election day. The local FBI field office can be reached by the public at (918) 664-3300.
Complaints about possible violations of the federal voting rights laws can be made directly to the Civil Rights Division's Voting Section in Washington, DC by phone at 1-800-253-3931 or (202) 307-2767, by fax at (202) 307-3961, by email to voting.section@usdoj.gov or by complaint form at http://www.justice.gov/crt/complaint/votintake/index.php .
United States Attorney Williams said, “Ensuring free and fair elections depends in large part on the cooperation of the American electorate. It is imperative that those who have specific information about discrimination or election fraud make that information available immediately to my Office, the FBI, or the Civil Rights Division.”
What do linting, building and testing have in common? They all work best when automated. With services like GitHub's webhooks, it's easy to subscribe to certain events on your repository and be notified by a HTTP request. These might be commits being pushed or pull request landing at your repo when you can trigger a build or run your tests.
Apart from a webhook, you'll need a server that will listen at the other end to make it work. Node.js with Express are pretty good at handling requests and you can have them up an running in minutes. What's left is processing the repository itself.
This post is about how to do that with Node.
Meet nodegit
A quick search through npm reveals no shortage of packages that provide access to the functionality of git in Javascript either by wrapping around the git binary or implementing the functionality directly.
The one that caught my eye is nodegit — native bindings to the libgit2 library made by GitHub. The package gets lots of development activity and seems to be well supported.
You can install it as any other Node.js package using npm:
$ npm install nodegit
The maintainers provide pre-built binaries of libgit2 for the most common architectures. However, if yours isn't amongst them, the installer might need to build the library from source and you'll be required to install a C toolchain to proceed.
Done installing? Let's take a look at a few examples. There's quite literally a million things you can do with nodegit, and while this post can't possibly cover everything, we'll go though a few to give you an idea of how the library works.
All the snippets below were made with nodegit 0.5.0. When in doubt, please refer to the official API docs.
Clone a repo
The first step is pretty obvious: you can hardly do anything with the repository without cloning it first. To do that, we'll use the Clone class:
var nodegit = require ( 'nodegit' ), path = require ( 'path' ); var url = "https://github.com/pazdera/scriptster.git" , local = "./scriptster" , cloneOpts = {}; nodegit . Clone ( url , local , cloneOpts ). then ( function ( repo ) { console . log ( "Cloned " + path . basename ( url ) + " to " + repo . workdir ()); }). catch ( function ( err ) { console . log ( err ); });
Cloning will return an already initialised handle to the repository (an instance of the Repository class) that you can use to access its contents.
The library uses promises to manage the asynchronous calls. If you're unsure what the weird chain of .then() and .catch() functions mean, checkout this quick introduction.
Authentication
In case your repository isn't openly available, you may need to authenticate via http or ssh. Nodegit can do that via CloneOptions that you can pass to Clone as an argument. Like this:
var cloneOpts = { fetchOpts : { callbacks : { credentials : function ( url , userName ) { return nodegit . Cred . sshKeyNew ( userName , '/Users/radek/.ssh/id_rsa.pub' , '/Users/radek/.ssh/id_rsa' , "<your-passphrase-here>" ); } } } };
The credentials function is called when the remote requests authentication. The implementation will vary for http, ssh and other types of authentication. Check out the Cred class in the docs for more ways to authenticate.
Open it up
If you already have a local copy of the repo, you can open it with nodegit using the Reposiotory#open function:
var nodegit = require ( 'nodegit' ); nodegit . Repository . open ( './scriptster' ). then ( function ( repo ) { console . log ( "Using " + repo . path ()); }). catch ( function ( err ) { console . log ( err ); });
Just as Clone , it returns an instance of Repository that you can use to manipulate it.
Read the commit history
One thing that you may need is going through the last few commits on a branch and extracting metadata from each one. This can be done through the Commit#history event emitter that iterates through the revisions, generates events for each commit along the way and returns an array of all the Commit objects at the end.
The following promise chain will retrieve the name of the current branch, walk through its history and print the hash and commit messages for the last 10 commits on it:
var nodegit = require ( 'nodegit' ); var Promise = require ( 'promise' ); nodegit . Repository . open ( './scriptster' ). then ( function ( repo ) { /* Get the current branch. */ return repo . getCurrentBranch (). then ( function ( ref ) { console . log ( "On " + ref . shorthand () + " (" + ref . target () + ")" ); /* Get the commit that the branch points at. */ return repo . getBranchCommit ( ref . shorthand ()); }). then ( function ( commit ) { /* Set up the event emitter and a promise to resolve when it finishes up. */ var hist = commit . history (), p = new Promise ( function ( resolve , reject ) { hist . on ( "end" , resolve ); hist . on ( "error" , reject ); }); hist . start (); return p ; }). then ( function ( commits ) { /* Iterate through the last 10 commits of the history. */ for ( var i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i ++ ) { var sha = commits [ i ]. sha (). substr ( 0 , 7 ), msg = commits [ i ]. message (). split ( ' \ n' )[ 0 ]; console . log ( sha + " " + msg ); } }); }). catch ( function ( err ) { console . log ( err ); }). done ( function () { console . log ( 'Finished' ); });
Here's the output in the terminal:
nodegit: Listing the last 10 commits on a branch.
Checkout a different branch
Besides manipulating metadata, nodegit has no problems working with trees. You can check out different branches, modify your files and even create new commits. For the sake of keeping the examples simple, this is how you check out a branch:
var nodegit = require ( 'nodegit' ); nodegit . Repository . open ( './scriptster' ). then ( function ( repo ) { return repo . getCurrentBranch (). then ( function ( ref ) { console . log ( "On " + ref . shorthand () + " " + ref . target ()); console . log ( "Checking out master" ); var checkoutOpts = { checkoutStrategy : nodegit . Checkout . STRATEGY . FORCE }; return repo . checkoutBranch ( "master" , checkoutOpts ); }). then ( function () { return repo . getCurrentBranch (). then ( function ( ref ) { console . log ( "On " + ref . shorthand () + " " + ref . target ()); }); }); }). catch ( function ( err ) { console . log ( err ); }). done ( function () { console . log ( 'Finished' ); });
All the work here is done by the Repository#checkoutBranch function, the rest is just printing the name of the current branch before and after the checkout.
Note that you need to specify a preferred checkout strategy. I picked FORCE which will ditch any local modifications of the working tree in favour of the version from the repository.
The output of the above should look something like this:
nodegit: Checking out a different branch.
Search through the tree
When you clone a repository with nodegit , it will look exactly the same as if you did it with the git command and you can read and modify the working tree as you wish.
Here's an example that will print all the files from the scriptster repo that I cloned earlier:
var rr = require ( "recursive-readdir" ); rr ( "./scriptster" , [ "scriptster/.git/**" ], function ( err , files ) { for ( var i = 0 ; i < files . length ; i ++ ) { console . log ( files [ i ]); } });
For simplicity, it uses the recursive-readdir module from npm and ignores all the files within the .git/ directory. Here's the output:
Iterating through the contents of the working tree.
Summary
This was nodegit, a useful library if you need to manipulate git repositories with Node.js. Under the hood, its calling GitHub's libgit2 to do the heavy lifting. It works particularly well if you need to automate various parts of your workflow — like building, testing and deployment using git on your server.
It's open-source, distributed under the MIT licence (libgit2 is licensed under GPLv2). Do get in touch with the maintainers if you'd like to contribute!

LSU athletic director Joe Alleva spoke briefly with reporters on Monday afternoon before Ed Orgeron's press conference and was adamant that the Tigers would play a home game on Nov. 19.
Nov. 19 has been mentioned as one of the possible make-up dates for LSU's postponed game against Florida because of Hurricane Matthew.
"One thing we're going to hold very firm on," Alleva said, "is that we have a home game on Nov. 19 and we're going to have a home game on Nov. 19. We are going to have a home game on Nov. 19. We're not going to change that situation.
"It's a tough situation. It's a very tough situation to reschedule this game. We'll have to see how it shakes out down the road."
To be able to play on that date, LSU would have to buy out a home game scheduled against South Alabama - which is also the day the Tigers plan on honoring its seniors.
Florida would have to buy out a game against Presbyterian, which they have shown a willingness to do.
The options Alleva discussed were Oct. 29 - LSU's scheduled open date before the Alabama game a week later - and Dec. 3.
Oct. 29 would require Florida and Georgia moving their game up one week but Alleva said he didn't want to play a game on that date unless Alabama also had to play. "I'm not in favor of playing a game on that day, unless Alabama also plays a game on that day," Alleva said.
Dec. 3 is the SEC Championship Game and Alleva acknowledged how difficult that would be because of TV contracts and site contracts. "I think it's going to be very difficult to reschedule this game," he said.
Alleva also said how much he hoped the game would have been played this past weekend especially as he watched the SEC's other game pushed back because of the storm.
"I watched Georgia play South Carolina yesterday and I was wishing we were playing too," Alleva said. "Somewhere, either here or there."
LSU also no longer controls its own destiny in winning the SEC West if the game is not made up. The Tigers could run the table and still finish 6-1 with wins against Alabama and Texas A&M but the Crimson Tide or Aggies could finish 7-1 and be deemed the champion, even if they lost to LSU.
Alleva mentioned the possibility of using the SEC West standings alone to decide the champion - currently the complete SEC standings are used - but said he's had no formal discussions about making that happen.

Speaking in Paris after talks with his Russian counterpart, Kerry said the two world powers, whose relations have hit a post-Cold War low over Russia's role in Ukraine, had a “major responsibility” to find ways to work together on global issues, despite their stark differences in a number of areas.
While leaving little doubt that mutual distrust remains, Kerry stressed that the search for common ground between the two countries against Islamic State, which has seized large swaths of Iraq and Syria in a brutal campaign.
“We both recognize the need to destroy and ultimately defeat ISIL, to degrade their efforts and ultimately to defeat them,” Kerry told a news conference, using an alternative name for the group.
“No decent country by any definition could support the horrors that are perpetrated by ISIL, and no civilized country should shirk its responsibility to stand up and be part of the effort to stamp out this disease.”
Kerry said the United States and Russia had agreed to “intensify intelligence cooperation with respect to ISIL and other counterterrorism challenges of the region.” He said Moscow would also explore whether it could do more to help arm and train Iraq's embattled military.
However, Kerry stopped short of saying that Moscow would join the U.S.-led international coalition against Islamic State. In recent years, as U.S.-Russian relations have deteriorated, intelligence cooperation has suffered.
Moscow has made clear it suspects Washington's ulterior motive is the removal of its ally, Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, and has insisted that U.S. air strikes there need Syrian government and United Nations approval. Washington rejects this.
DIFFERENCES ON UKRAINE
Lavrov has recently called for a new “reset” in relations between Washington and Moscow, referring to an initiative President Barack Obama pursued early in his first term but which has since faded.
Signaling just how difficult it could be to make such a positive shift, Kerry called on Russia to do more to help fully implement a ceasefire in Ukraine between the Western-backed government and pro-Russian separatists rebels fighting in the eastern part of the country.
The truce has come under strain at times since it took effect last month
He said “foreign forces and weapons” must be withdrawn and Russia must complete the pullback of its troops, including heavy equipment, from its border with Ukraine.
Kerry also warned that the United States and the international community would not recognize any referendum held in separatist-held areas of Ukraine, and acknowledged this was a “point of disagreement” in his more than three hours of talks with Lavrov.
Kiev and its Western backers accuse Moscow of backing a pro-Russian separatist revolt in eastern Ukraine by providing troops and arms. Russia denies the charges but says it has a right to defend the interests of the region's Russian-speaking majority.
The West has introduced a wide range of sanctions against Russian banks, energy companies and individuals for Moscow's role in the Ukrainian conflict, which has claimed the lives of over 3,000 people.
In the fight against Islamic State, the United States and Russia have common ground in their concern about fighters from their countries joining the group's insurgency and then returning to carry out attacks at home.
“ There may be as many as 500 or more from Russia,” Kerry said.
These include fighters from Russia's predominantly Muslim North Caucasus, a region where militants wage daily violence to establish an Islamic state.
The European Court of Justice has determined every single national and regional parliament across the European Union must approve a new trade deal with Singapore. This poses a worrying precedent for Theresa May and her Brexit ministers who had hoped only the European Commission would be needed to secure approval. This means the UK's post-Brexit trade deal will need to be approved by dozens of parliaments across the bloc - including those in several countries who said the country must be punished for leaving the union.
GETTY The European Court of Justice will make a landmark ruling today with Brexit implications
It risks a repeat of the calamitous EU-Canada trade deal, which was initially vetoed after being opposed by just one Belgian regional parliament. The ruling by the ECJ said approving the Singapore deal does not “fall within the exclusive competence of the EU”. It said: “The free trade agreement with Singapore cannot, in its current form, be concluded by the EU alone. “The free trade agreement with Singapore can, as it stands, be concluded only by the EU and Member States acting together.” READ MORE: Which countries want to make Brexit trade deals?
Today's ruling could set a precedent for how the UK will be treated during its EU negotiation. Steve Peers, a professor of EU law at the University of Essex, said it was not all bad news however as most of the Singapore deal DID fall withint he EU's control. He Tweeted: "Most of EU/Singapore free trade deal within exclusive competence of the EU. "Only the provisions on portfolio investment are shared competence with the Member States. "This makes most EU trade deals easier. Especially a Brexit deal, as UK and EU side have expressed no interest in investment in future FTA."

Psychedelic drugs, such as psilocybin have been of interest to psychologists due to their ability to induce altered states of intense well-being and profound personal significance. A recent study asked people, some who were psilocybin users and others who were not, about the best, most wonderful experiences of their lives. Some users said that the most wonderful experience occurred under the influence of psilocybin. Other users, who had their most wonderful experience while not under the drug's influence, nevertheless reported a profound alteration of consciousness that was similar in some ways to the effects of psilocybin. For example, they described unusual visual hallucinations in addition to transcendental mystical states. Both groups of users said their most wonderful experience involved a more profoundly altered state of consciousness compared to the experiences of non-users. One possible implication of this study is that psilocybin could have lasting effects on a person's ability to enter altered states of consciousness without drugs. However, further research is needed to confirm if this is actually the case.
Psychologists have long been interested in the human capacity for intense well-being. Abraham Maslow, a pioneer of humanistic psychology, in particular coined the term “peak experiences” to refer to states in which a person feels intensely positive emotions such as great ecstasy, wonder and awe (Klavetter & Mogar, 1967). He considered peak experiences to be a sign of psychological and thought that such experiences were particularly common in people who were fulfilling their deepest human potentials. Maslow conceptualised peak experiences as a perception of “Being” or “ultimate reality” in a mystical sense, although other researchers have used the term more broadly to refer to the most wonderful or best experiences in a person's life.
Pioneering studies in the 1960's investigated the potential of psychedelic drugs such as LSD to induce peak experiences. For example, one study on LSD-assisted found that under the influence of LSD some people had experiences involving feelings of intense , a sense of deeper perception of reality, and of self-transcendence (Klavetter & Mogar, 1967). Furthermore, those who had such experiences believed that they had gained lasting benefits, including greater insight into themselves and their , and that they had become clearer about their values in life. On the other hand, some of the participants in the study did not have a peak experience and reported that they found the experience disappointing and confusing, or felt that they had temporarily gone mad. Hence, some people seem more likely to benefit from psychedelic drugs than others. For example, people who are highly open to new experiences seem to benefit most, while people who are emotionally unstable or rigidly conventional in their views are prone to greater and negative, disturbing experiences (Studerus, Kometer, Hasler, & Vollenweider, 2011).
Research on psychedelic drugs was unfortunately suppressed in the 1970's and has been resumed only in more recent years, and today uses somewhat more rigorous scientific methods. One well-known study, which I have discussed elsewhere, also found that psilocybin, the active component of magic mushrooms, can induce profoundly positive experiences in certain people (Griffiths, Richards, McCann, & Jesse, 2006). In this study mentally stable adults volunteered to take psilocybin under supportive conditions. About two-thirds of participants had a “complete mystical experience” involving feelings of intense joy, timelessness, a sense of oneness with the universe and ego-transcendence, and feelings of profound insight into reality. In a fourteen month follow-up, nearly all of the participants who had a mystical experience said they regarded it as one of the most personally significant moments of their lives.
The effects of psychedelic drugs are sensitive to features of the setting they are taken in. In the Griffiths et al. study psilocybin was administered in a safe comfortable setting with an assistant present to provide emotional support as needed to the volunteers. This helped to maximise the chance that they had a positive outcome. However, recreational users of psilocybin may be more casual about the kind of setting they create so the outcomes could be more variable. A recent study attempted to understand the outcomes of psilocybin use in more naturalistic recreational settings (Cummins & Lyke, 2013). In particular, the authors wanted to know how common peak experiences are among users and how they might compare to peak experiences reported by non-users. They gave a survey to 34 psilocybin users and 67 non-users, asking them to recall a peak experience, defined as the best experience or group of experiences in their lives. They then completed a questionnaire assessing the degree to which their peak experience involved alterations in their state of consciousness. Altered states of consciousness were assessed along three dimensions: oceanic boundlessness, which involves subjectively positive, mystical or transcendental experiences; visionary restructuralization, involving visual hallucinations and synaesthesia (crossover of sensory experiences, e.g. seeing music); and dread of ego dissolution, which includes negative experiences such as anxiety about one's mental processes. Additionally, participants were asked if the peak experience had been induced by psilocybin and if they were under the influence of any other drugs at the time.
Among psilocybin users, 47% reported that their peak experience had occurred under the influence of psilocybin, while the other users said that it had not. Consistent with previous research, those who reported that their peak experience occurred under psilocybin said that it involved very high levels of oceanic boundlessness and visionary restructuralization, as well as relatively high levels of dread of ego dissolution. This is comparable to the findings of the study by Griffiths et al. in which about a third of participants experienced a high level of anxiety at some stage even though they rated their overall experience as being highly positive. Perhaps more interesting was that psilocybin users whose peak experience had not been induced by psilocybin also reported that their peak experience involved high levels of oceanic boundlessness (their questionnaire scores being nearly as high as those who had their peak experience under psilocybin), as well as moderately high levels of visionary restructuralization (although somewhat lower than the other psilocybin users) but very low levels of dread of ego dissolution. For both groups of psilocybin users, their peak experiences involved considerably higher levels of oceanic boundlessness and visionary restructuralization compared to the peak experiences of those who had never used psilocybin. This indicates that lifetime peak experiences of psilocybin users involved more profound alterations of consciousness, whether they had or had not been induced by psilocybin, compared to the lifetime peak experiences of people who had never used.
These results raise some fascinating questions that the study design was not able to answer. For example, it is unknown why some psilocybin users had the most wonderful experience of their lives under psilocybin while other users did not. Situational factors, such as the setting in which the drug was taken might have played a role, plus characteristic of the users themselves might also be a factor. For example, differences in the personality trait of absorption, one's propensity to experience episode of “total ”, are strongly linked to how profoundly a person responds to psilocybin (Studerus, Gamma, Kometer, & Vollenweider, 2012), so it is possible that the two groups of users might have differed on this trait. However, what I find even more intriguing is the fact that psilocybin users who had peak experiences without drugs nevertheless reported that these peak experiences involved intense alterations of consciousness that included visual hallucinations as well as mystical states. It would be interesting to know whether these peak experiences were spontaneous or deliberately sought. For example, there are specific practices designed to produce altered states without drugs, such as shamanic rituals, which can induce visionary experiences.
It is also possible that people who have non-drug peak experiences involving visual phenomena might have distinctive traits compared to those who are not prone to such experiences. One study found that people who reported having peak experiences tend to have particular traits such as being more imaginative, less authoritarian and dogmatic, more tender-minded and more experimenting than people who had not reported such experiences (Mathes, 1982). People high in fantasy proneness have a natural tendency to have very vivid imaginative experiences, and it is possible that such people are more inclined to use psilocybin. Hence, the unusual results found by Cummins and Lyke might reflect the pre-existing characteristics of people who use psilocybin.
However, another intriguing possibility is that psilocybin use itself might result in long-term changes in a person's propensity to experience unusual visual phenomena. In a web-based survey, over 60% of people who had used psychedelic drugs reported that they had had unusual visual experiences while not under the influence of any drug (Baggott, Coyle, Erowid, Erowid, & Robertson, 2011). Furthermore, 23.9% said that such experiences occurred constantly or nearly constantly. Most people said that they were not bothered by them, although 4.2% said such experiences were sufficiently troublesome to warrant seeking treatment. These experiences came in a wide variety of types, including seeing halos or auras around things, things appearing to move or breathe, moving objects leaving after-images, seeing things with eyes open that are not really there, and more. The number of different visual phenomena a person experienced was proportional to the number of times they had taken psychedelic drugs, particularly LSD and psilocybin, although ketamine and salvia were also indicated. The reasons for these findings are not really known, although it could well be the case that taking psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin might increase a person's propensity to experience hallucinatory visual phenomena in the long-term. If this is true, then it might explain why psilocybin users who had a peak experience that was not induced by drugs reported unusual visual experiences.
In a previous article I speculated about the possibility that psilocybin use could alter the sensitivity of neuroreceptors that underlie individual differences in the trait of absorption, a trait associated with having altered states of consciousness. A related possibility is that psilocybin and similar drugs might also alter the long-term sensitivity of neuroreceptors that underlie the experience of hallucinatory visual phenomena, which might explain why some users experience persistent unusual visual experiences. There is an additional and related possibility that psilocybin use increases a person's tendency to have mystical peak experiences even when not using drugs. These are very speculative ideas and longitudinal research studies in which people are tracked for some time before and after initiating usage would be needed to determine if psilocybin does have long-term effects on a person's consciousness. Further research on psychedelic drugs could help provide a deeper understanding of the nature of experiences associated with profound levels of well-being.

Things I learned this month:
The fountains on the Howling Abyss map apparently shoot Poros?? What??
Hello! Welcome to the first blog post in a month. Oops. I decided to bring back the “things I learned” feature for that golden nugget I just read today…I may reintroduce it as a permanent feature since I'm not posting as frequently, who knows.
Today I'm going over my League Year in Review with you all! I'm sure you're all sick of seeing these as it seems that everyone and their mother feels the need to share theirs with the world, but supposedly you WANT me to share things with you, so here we are.
BUT FIRST!
I must make two exciting announcements!
The first is that League of Love TV (the stream) is now on hiatus for the holidays! (Can you even really call it a hiatus if it's so short?) And we will return on January 2nd at 8pm EST! We also have a brand-new schedule starting then – it's not wildly different, but it's different enough that we hope that a lot of new people will be able to join us. Thank you to everyone who filled out our poll; your feedback is indispensable! View the new schedule here.
The second is that I finally got a job! Some of you will remember from this post that I'd been unemployed for some time and it, along with other things, was really getting me down. But this week I started a new job at the head offices of a large Canadian bank. So far it's been challenging but I'm actually quite enjoying it because everyone has been so nice to me. All this is to say that the erratic-ness (I'm sure there is a word for this but it escapes me at the moment. I'm a writer!) with which I've been uploading videos and blog posts will probably continue, but hopefully eventually I will settle into some sort of schedule, even if it is less frequent. Thank you to everyone who has stuck with me during this time, and if you are interested in our content, I highly recommend actually subscribing both to our Youtube channel and this blog and/or following us on other social media so that you are notified when I DO upload content.
So, let's get started, shall we?
First, let's look at my average stats for the support role compared to other Silver players. I was placed in Silver 5 earlier this year, so let's see how I really measure up.
The most notable gap is probably in ‘wards per game' – on average I place 8.6, and other Silver players place twice that many. It's worth noting that none of these statistics are completely reflective of my current skill level because I improved so rapidly within the first 6 months of the year, but still. I'm sure that's something that I can continue to work on.
There are also large gaps in ‘average damage mitigated' and ‘average damage healed', but I attribute those differences to the fact that I most often play Soraka, versus other supports with fewer healing capabilities but more shielding capabilities.
Otherwise, though, I'm pretty on par, which is surprising to me, particularly regarding the KDA stat. Sometimes I feel like I belong in Silver, but I often feel like my true rank is probably closer to mid to high Bronze, and that if I had continued playing ranked I eventually would have ended up there.
Next, let's take a look at how I compare to Gold players in the support role. I would be happy just to end up in Silver again at the end of next season, but my ideal goal is to finish in Gold. Let's see what I would have to improve to make that happen.
Surprisingly, the stats are…basically the same? Not the exact same, obviously, but they reveal the same insights, which is mainly that I need to place more wards. I feel like something is off here. Surely there must be larger gaps between the Silver and Gold average stats, even for the support role. What do you all think?
I also looked at my average stats compared to Silver players for mid-lane. I definitely don't think I'm up to par on that one. And I'm not, but it actually wasn't as bad as I thought.
Again, the largest gap is for wards placed – this I already knew. tect is always telling me to buy control wards when I play mid. I also do 1000 less damage per minute, probably because I play too cautiously. I mitigate less damage, but I also heal more, so I feel like that kind of evens itself out.
There's also the CS per minute gap – we all already knew that I was bad at CSing. But that is not nearly as large as I thought it would be either. It's only 1.6 – I would have thought it would be at least three times more than that.
And then there's the KDA, the part that makes me feel like something about this MUST be wrong – only 0.2 lower?! Are you kidding?! The vast majority of my mid games feature me dying more than 5 times with very few kills or assists. DEFINITELY not meeting my old goal requirements.
Now here's some other stuff that I don't really have much to say about, but I thought you might find interesting anyway.
ARAM average stats
League confirms what we all already knew
The reason why I hate support Lux so much (and to add insult to injury, 184 is my favourite number!)
I guess I should start banning Xerath…? Definitely not what I would have guessed.
Most played champion stats
Second most played champion stats (this must include ARAMs and/or bot games, I don't know how else Ahri could be my second most played champion…)
Third most played champion stats
And finally, Summoner's Rift average stats
I'd be interested to know how my results compare to yours and others you know! Let me know what your thoughts are.
There will be a new post next week that will focus on my personal life so I hope you'll come read that – it will be a lot more positive than like…anything I've written in the past several months.
Happy holidays – I wish all of you the best (and so does tect!). We will see you back here and on our Youtube channel next week, and on stream in January! Take care of yourselves, travel safe, and if you are having a hard time this holiday season, please know that you're not alone.

The default implementation for KeyStore, the system in Android designed to store users credentials and cryptographic keys, is broken, researchers say.
The default implementation for KeyStore, the system in Android designed to store user credentials and cryptographic keys, is broken, researchers say.
In a academic paper published this week, researchers argue that the particular encryption scheme that KeyStore uses fails to protect the integrity of keys and could be exploited to allow an attacker to modify stored keys through a forgery attack.
KeyStore, which performs key-specific actions through the OpenSSL library, allows Android apps to store and generate their own cryptographic keys. By storing keys in a container, KeyStore makes it more difficult to remove them from the device.
Mohamed Sabt and Jacques Traoré, two researchers with the French telecom Orange Labs, claim the scheme associated with the system is “non-provably secure,” and could have “severe consequences.”
The two point out in their paper “Breaking Into the KeyStore: A Practical Forgery Attack Against Android KeyStore,” that it's the hash-then-encrypt (HtE) authenticated encryption (AE) scheme in cipher block chaining mode (CBC) in KeyStore that fails to guarantee the integrity of keys.
In a forgery attack, an attacker could exploit the weakness to reduce the length of symmetric keys protected by the system. The crux of the attack is based around tricking a victim into installing a malicious app on the device that can be granted read-write permission on the KeyStore directory.
For instance, if an attacker got an application to trust its symmetric key and transform 256-bit HMAC keys into 32-bit ones, a third party that controls the network could break any protocol based on the weak keys. The attack “lulls users into a false sense of security” by transforming the keys, undetected, the researchers say.
“The purpose of the forgery attack is that given a ciphertext of a symmetric key, the adversary can fabricate another ciphertext that decrypts to a shorter key,” the paper reads.
When the app asks KeyStore to generate a cryptographic hash function, or HMAC tag, over each message, KeyStore returns a weak key. Since the system refuses to store weak, short keys, it's easy for a party to modify the content of those messages before forwarding them to a server.
Sabt broke down the scenario for Threatpost in layman's terms on Wednesday:
“The scenario works as follows: An application generates a key for its own purposes. The malicious application cuts the key down using our forgery attack. Then, the application protects its data using the weak key. It sends its protected data to a synchronization server (or a cloud storage server). Naturally, the server does not have the key, so it cannot have access to the data. Later, the application tells the server that it needs its data. Here, an attacker can modify the data because they were protected by a weak key.”
Sabt understands why some may question the practicality of the attack; after all, a user would have to agree to install an app that requires KeyStore read/write permissions. What makes it an interesting attack, Sabt claims, is that in principle Android restricts access to the folder, meaning only the KeyStore user is allowed to see or modify its contents.
“The success of our attack depends on how likely the malicious application is to bypass the access control mechanisms of Android,” the two say, adding that this could be done by executing arbitrary code, through code injection or reuse, or obtaining root or kernel-level privileges.
According to the paper, the researchers have been able to carry out their attack on the latest Android build, android-6.0.1_r22 and that to their knowledge, it's the first cryptanalysis-based attack against KeyStore.
“Intuition often goes wrong when security is concerned,” the two write, “Unfortunately, system designers still tend to choose cryptographic schemes not for their proved security but for their apparent simplicity. We show, once again, that this is not a good choice, since it usually results in severe consequences for the whole underlying system.”
The researchers caution the scenario is only an example, but stress a new “class of threat” could stem from the attack.
“In the paper, I only described one scenario exploiting the vulnerability concerning the KeyStore AE encryption,” Sabt told Threatpost, “However, experience shows that such vulnerabilities could be exploited in unexpected ways years after being discovered.”
Sabt, a PhD candidate working at Orange Labs and Traoré, a research engineer at Orange Labs, plan to present their research in Greece in September at ESORICS, the European Symposium on Research in Computer Security.
The two disclosed their research to Google in January and while the Android security team acknowledged the attack and confirmed the encryption scheme is slated for removal, Sabt claims that he hasn't received an update from the team when exactly the fix will come.
The two recommend that system designers keep the hash-then-encrypt scheme but use it with another encryption mode, working alongside cryptographers to find the best option.
“A key lesson from this paper is that cryptographers and system designers must work closely together,” Sabt and Traoré write, “Bridging the perilous gap that separates these communities will be essential for keeping future systems secure.”
Like many Android systems, KeyStore does receive periodic updates from Google. Last year the company patched a privilege escalation vulnerability in the system that could have been abused if a malicious app called on a specific API in the system, something that could've led to memory corruption and code execution. In 2014, researchers fixed a nasty stack-based buffer overflow in KeyStore that affected most Android users. An attacker could have exploited the vulnerability in Android 4.3 and earlier devices to gain access to a device's lock credentials, encrypted and decrypted master keys, and so on.
While Google has updated KeyStore with new features recently, Sabt and Traoré claim the company hasn't reviewed the system's “security correctness” and argue that security by “feature-enhancing is disappointedly misleading.”
“Security in modern systems still does not withstand a simple cryptanalysis,” the two say, “Our attack demonstrates that any theoretical weakness concerning the security of a cryptographic scheme could be utilized to break the whole system.”
Researchers discovered a flaw in a popular mobile processor used in Android devices last week. Researcher Gal Beniamini described how the encryption in devices running Qualcomm chips, more than half of Android devices currently in use, can be bypassed. The KeyMaster module, a layer inside KeyStore designed to protect keys from extraction, is dependent on an environment powered by Qualcomm. In a write-up, corroborated by Duo Security, Beniamini claimed attackers can reverse engineer code used by both.
I thought I knew all of the Hurst special edition cars, but I was wrong! Have you ever heard of the Jeepster Commando Hurst Edition? This model apparently came about due to the need to add some pizzazz into the Jeepster lineup and was Hurst's first attempt and adding performance to a 4WD vehicle. You can find a lot of information on this special model here, here and here. This particular Jeepster has been stored for the last five years in Birmingham, Alabama, and is up for sale here on eBay with an opening bid of $3,000 and no reserve. Yes, that warped hood scoop is stock, and this one is warped a lot less than some I saw in pictures. All the Hurst equipment is present, including the unusual Hurst dual-gate automatic shifter and the original striping. I happen to like Jeepsters a lot, so this one to me would be nice to restore. Share your Hurst special edition experiences here with the rest of us!
A search is under way for a 49-year-old “expert mountaineer” reported overdue from a solo climbing trip in the Maroon Bells Wilderness outside of Aspen.
David Cook, from Albuquerque, is a former Marine who authorities say has a wealth of experience in the backcountry. A woman called rescuers on Tuesday night when she had not heard from him.
The Pitkin County Sheriff's Office says Cook was climbing by himself with a plan to summit Pyramid Peak on Monday and then Maroon and North Maroon peaks on Tuesday.
Mountain Rescue Aspen was alerted to the situation about 10 p.m. Tuesday. Officials determined it was plausible Cook got a late start after his car was found at the Maroon Bells entrance station with a ticket indicating he had arrived later than he had planned to be in the area.
That discovery meant that a search wasn't initiated until Thursday morning, when two helicopters launched to find him.
One of the choppers ended their efforts early because of high winds on Thursday, while the other remained, scouring areas around Maroon Peak and North Maroon Peak until 4 p.m.
Searchers resumed their operations at 7 a.m. Friday.
The Bastard Executioner had a somewhat modest opening in the ratings Wednesday night. The two hour premiere debuted to 2.1 million viewers and a 0.8 among adults 18–49.
By comparison, last year FX premiered The Strain to 4.7 million viewers (8 million after encores were added), Fargo opened to 2.7 million and Tyrant similarly debuted to 2.1 million viewers. The year before, The Americans and The Bridge both debuted to around 3 million in the overnights. So Bastard is firmly on the low side of FX series openers in recent years.
Obviously, these ratings will rise, and perhaps dramatically so, via DVR playback and repeats, which continue to have a growing impact on series performance.
The Bastard Executioner is creator Kurt Sutter's follow-up series to his hit Sons of Anarchy. Set in the early 14th century, the story follows a knight (Lee Jones) in King Edward I's army who tries to escape the horrors of war.
Bastard has taken some lumps by critics, with EW giving it a “C”. At the Television Critics Assocation's press tour In August, FX chief John Landgraf defended Bastard and urged critics to be patient, noting Sons of Anarchy likewise had a slow start.
“With Kurt, he's just not a guy who loves exposition and setting up these really complicated multi-layered worlds,” Landgraf said. “If you went back and watched the first half dozen episodes of Sons of Anarchy, I think you would see it's a fairly forboding entry point for that show too. It's really around the middle of the first season that you're in and he's got you. The great thing about Kurt is once you're in his world and once you're into his storytelling, I've never worked with a storyteller that was better at holding your interest. He's Dickensian in that regard … One of the reasons we're airing a two hour pilot on the first night of air is because we agree with you. We came to the assessment that essentially the first episode, the first 45 minutes, was not going to get you to the point where you started to really understand the breadth of the vision behind this show … If people stick with it, he's going to get his hook into you. And I think once he does, he's not going to let go.”

FILE - In this Sept. 26, 2012, file photo President Barack Obama campaigns at Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio. As the population gets older, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are eating up more and more of the federal budget, squeezing the ability of the government to pay for other programs.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Presidential campaigns are long in the making, quick to be forgotten. But one part of them lives on for years: the victor's promises.
President Barack Obama paved his path to re-election with fewer promises than in 2008. The ones he did lay down, though, are meaty, legacy-shaping for him and consequential to ordinary lives today and for generations to come, for better or worse.
They also are extraordinarily difficult to achieve in a time of gridlock grief and budgets that are tight when they are not paralyzed.
He's promised to set a course in law against global warming, stop Iran from gaining the ability to make nuclear weapons, slash America's use of foreign oil, restrain college costs, take a big bite out of the national debt even while protecting the heart of the big entitlement programs and overhaul immigration law.
He's promised to make health insurance not only universally accessible, but "affordable," through a 2010 health care law that is finally entering prime time and will be tested soon.
It's a sure bet that many who voted Republican want some of Obama's promises to fail. They didn't sign up for tax increases on the wealthy or a path to citizenship for immigrants living in the country illegally.
But as closely divided as the country is, most Americans support Obama's ends, if not the means. Who doesn't want a lighter national debt or better health care for less?
In that sense, everyone's got a stake in seeing him make good on his broad-brush promises.
Whatever a candidate's promises, legacies are made by how a president manages matters of war and peace, economic growth and weakness, social change and traditional values, and whatever crises come out of the blue.
If this decade somehow becomes the Roaring Teens, history may not care much about a big broken promise or two. If jobs are demolished, that's what will be remembered, not that 9 out of 10 promises might have been kept.
But Obama made a pact with voters, not historians, and he's got IOUs outstanding.
Republican lawmakers do, too.
They don't inherit the promises of GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney and did not campaign with one voice. But they presented themselves unmistakably as the party of smaller government, low taxes, a strong military capability and fiscal restraint. They have to answer to voters in 2014 for what they deliver and fail to do.
So must Democrats.
Voters can't throw Obama out of office if he botches his job this term. But the president still has skin in the game.
With a chunk of the Senate and all of the House up for grabs in 2014, Obama would have an easier time making good on his promises if Democrats were able to hang on to the Senate, win back control of the House or both. That's a tall order, given that the party holding the White House historically has lost seats in the sixth year of a presidency.
In this series, Associated Press writers who cover subjects key to Obama's agenda and that of the GOP examine his main campaign promises, their chances of being kept and their likely impact on people.

There's a great Ruby gem called Boom by Zach Holman for managing text snippets via the command line. I've used it since it was released and have even contributed to it a few times. But after using it for a long time, I realize that I don't really need the "lists" feature – the ability to store snippets with keys two levels deep. Because of Boom's syntax, I often accidentally create lists because I can't quite remember the name of the key I'm looking for.
I decided this was a good prompt for a new program, so I created Bang. Bang is a module for Node that gives you a very simple key value store with one level of depth. I use it to store all sorts of things: articles I refer to often, simple code snippets, Imgur links to animated GIFs, and strings with Unicode characters that are a pain to type.
For those, like me, who are experimenting with Node, CoffeeScript, testing using Jasmine, and annotated source using Docco, you will want to check out the source on GitHub to see some examples of all of these.

The hotly debated “Prawer bill,” regulating Beduin settlements in the Negev narrowly passed in its first Knesset reading Monday, with 43 in favor and 40 opposed.
The discussion of the bill was marked by loud arguments and demonstrations by Arab MKs, who began the debate by walking out when Welfare Minister Meir Cohen (Yesh Atid) presented the legislation.
“This is not a bill, it's a strangling,” MK Jamal Zahalka (Balad) said as he left the plenum.Soon after, while MK Muhammad Barakei (Hadash) argued against the bill, Culture and Sport Minister Limor Livnat (Likud) shouted out that he is “obnoxious,” and Barakei told her to shut her mouth. Then, Barakei tore up a copy of the legislation, leading Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein to say he will file a complaint against him to the Knesset Ethics Committee.“This is a Mark of Cain on the forehead of anyone who supports the bill,” said MK Ahmed Tibi (UAL-Ta'al) as he poured water on the document. “This is a usurping bill! It expels people from their lands and homes for the second and third time after the tragedy of 1948 [Israel's establishment].”MK Zehava Gal-On (Meretz) took a more diplomatic approach, saying that she is sure former Likud minister Benny Begin meant well in drafting the plan – on which the bill is based – but does not recognize the Beduin's historical rights.“You need to praise this law, and [the coalition] should oppose it, because it gives the Beduin what the courts wouldn't,” said MK Ayelet Shaked (Bayit Yehudi). Calling the Beduin “squatters,” Shaked said that a sovereign state cannot allow illegal settlements built by Jews or Arabs, and when illegal towns are built they must be evacuated.MK Meir Sheetrit (Hatnua), who led negotiations with the Beduin on land issues during Ehud Olmert's premiership, expressed careful optimism about the bill: “For the first time, this law creates an opening for an agreement. It's unfortunate that people are so angry. The goal here is to regulate [the land] and find the best solution.”Earlier Monday, the coalition almost stopped the vote from taking place, when it was discovered by Bayit Yehudi that the draft submitted to the Knesset differed from the one agreed upon by the party and the Prime Minister's Office. After several hours of negotiations, the Prime Minister's Office and Begin agreed to reinstate a clause limiting the timetable in which Beduin can lay claim on land.The current Prawer-Begin plan calls for legalizing around 63 percent of Beduin land claims. It has drawn opposition from both the Right, which argued that it would give away too much and not solve the problem, and the Left, which claims that it is not generous enough.The legislation follows a plan proposed by Begin in 2012 that calls for regulating the land of the Bedouin. It was based on a previous plan drawn up by a team headed by Ehud Prawer in 2011, which in turn was based on recommendations of a committee chaired by former Supreme Court justice Eliezer Goldberg. Construction and Housing Minister Uri Ariel (Bayit Yehudi) came to an agreement last month with Begin, who has been responsible for putting together the plan for resolving the Beduin issue.The first, main demand in the redrafted proposal was an agreement to draw up a specific map that includes exact details of the plan, which delineates the areas that would be given to Beduin and those reserved for the state or Jewish settlement.Second, a ministerial committee headed by the prime minister will monitor the implementation of the plan. Third, the timetable would be shortened from five years to three and finally, a Jewish settlement would be established on the outskirts of Arad in the Negev.NGOs supporting the Beduin land claims argue the government should agree to a solution with the Beduin and recognize their settlements to insure their rights, and oppose expulsion or forced relocation.Maj.-Gen. (res.) Doron Almog, the director of the headquarters for the economic and community development of the Negev Beduin in the Prime Minister's Office told The Jerusalem Post last week that a legal solution is required to solve the Beduin issue.

The deception tactics employed in making a supposedly controversial video that purports to show an ob/gyn doctor offering to sell fetal body parts from aborted fetuses are, of course, as shady as the means used to take down ACORN.
...as Charles Johnson from Little Green Footballs pointed out, in what universe are human body parts sold for $30-$100? Perhaps Planned Parenthood is the Dollar Store of fetus organ trafficking, but I doubt it. It turns out that what the official was describing was a standard and very legal process of donating remains to bio-medical firms for research. The $30-$100 the official quoted was the cost of the travel and expense reimbursements given to Planned Parenthood workers who transport the specimens. In a statement, Planned Parenthood confirmed:
In some instances, actual costs, such as the cost to transport tissue to leading research centers, are reimbursed, which is standard across the medical field.
The creator of the video, by the way, is a group called Center for Medical Progress, run by a guy named David Daleiden, who happens to be friends with video con-artist James O'Keefe.
Daleiden, and his Center for Medical Progress, is not exactly oozing with credibility.
But the only thing the Center for Medical Progress appears to have done in the past two years is produce this undercover video investigation into Planned Parenthood. David Daleiden, a longtime anti-abortion activist and the center's founder, previously served as director of research for Live Action, the group that has released several sensational sting videos of Planned Parenthood over the past few years and appears to be solely dedicated to destroying the family planning provider.
Even Mitt Romney's portfolio contained a sizable investment in a fetal disposal company known as Stericycle, as fetal disposal is something that is highly regulated and supervised. This is not an industry based on black market sales of fetal tissue, this is an integral industry that has legitimate functions. But, the panel on Wallace's Fox News Sunday addresses this video (and the need for fetal tissue disposal) as if it were a legitimate reason to be outraged, as Fox is wont to do.
↓ Story continues below ↓
Not until 2:34 into the discussion does former Democratic Congresswoman, Jane Harman suggest that the video is doctored, and that mention receives absolutely zero recognition from the 'pro-life,' anti-woman panel. Jane simply said she won't support any manipulation of tissue from fetuses in the respect that they are sold on the black market. This bogus propaganda video elicited horror in Brit Hume, as this is a video that he claims, represents 'the culture of abortionists.'
Naturally, the panel gravitates to the potential impact this (fake) video has upon Hillary Clinton's campaign. The AP's Julie Pace said that Hillary most definitely will have to address this video, but this is based on the assumption that the video is a genuine production, not created using the sleazy tactics associated with GOP sting operations. Yet, several days before this segment aired, Planned Parenthood indicated this video was bogus.
“The promotional video mischaracterizing Planned Parenthood's mission and services is made by a long time anti-abortion activist that has used deceptive and unethical video editing, and that has created a fake medical website as well as a fake human tissue website that purports to provide services to stem cell researchers,” Planned Parenthood said in a statement Tuesday.
Michael Needham, the CEO of Heritage Action, the lobbying arm of the Heritage Foundation, was discussing how this is simply something that reallocates credibility to the Susan B. Komen Foundation, which attempted to defund Planned Parenthood, which backfired significantly. Needham was the 'mastermind' behind Ted Cruz's government shutdown which cost taxpayers $24 billion. Needham is steeped in white privilege and has never had to make a life or death decision based on financial means. He is the last person who should be addressing a woman's right to do what she wants with her own body. Michael Needham smugly predicts that Planned Parenthood will be defunded this September.
Jane Harman, much to my chagrin, went along with the panel like a good little Fox News 'liberal,' never again readdressing the bogus nature of the video. Harman tried to defend Planned Parenthood, but didn't go so far as to assert what she knew with respect to the fraudulent nature of the sting video. It was impossible to defend Planned Parenthood without defending the shocking practices of a doctor, but she had the means to do so and chose to keep quiet about it.
China is the world's largest arms exporter, after the US and Russia. At the same, Chinese arms producers are still in pursuit of their niche in the global market.
The Chinese newspaper The People's Daily recently published an article about possible buyers of Chinese-made weapons, particularly the new FC-20 jet fighter.
"Among the potential buyers are developing nations which have no military ties with the West," the article read. Those regions are Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America.
At the same time, the US considers arms exports as a "diplomatic indicator" distinguishing friends and foes, the newspaper noted.
On the contrary, China is free from political prejudices in its arms trading.
© RIA Novosti . Pavel Gerasimov China Shock: Beijing Almost Doubles Arms Sales Around the World
Chinese-made weapons are high in demand due to their low price tags and high quality, close to their Western analogues.
The J-15 jet fighter was a copy of the Russian-made Su-33 aircraft, while the J-31 was based on the American F-35B. And there are many more of such examples. The Chinese defense industry has been copying many types of military hardware, including tanks, artillery, combat vehicles, guns etc.
Beijing is not concerned with the place in the market China is currently holding. This month, the government has announced two major initiatives on the issue.
First, the Chinese defense industry is going private, but of course, in the Chinese sense of the term. The industry is strictly controlled by the government, and any company employing over 50 employees is supervised by a party official.

Second, China is set to create a defense research agency (an analogue to the US DARPA), Popular Science reported. Unlike the US agency, the Chinese agency will supervise the industry.
The agency will run research programs, promote innovation and integrate them with the Chinese Armed Forces.
The possible scenario is that the bulk of Chinese defense research would be done by state-owned companies, not by private firms.
Currently, there are some 1,000 private defense companies operating in China, 127 percent more than in 2010. They are controlled by the State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND). This year, SASTIND will intensify efforts to build up Chinese arms exports and develop an export-oriented defense industry.

Maybe all President Obama needs to break through the GOP's wall of opposition to ending the Bush tax cuts for the super-rich is a new sales strategy. Michael Ettlinger of the Center for American Progress has a suggestion: pitch the expiration of the cuts as a temporary pay freeze for America's wealthiest individuals.
Here's how the math works out, according to Ettlinger. Assuming high-end incomes continue rising at the same rate they have over the past ten years, allowing the Bush cuts to expire at the end of 2012 would have the equivalent effect of a 10-month pay freeze for the richest 1 percent:
Does that matter to the Republicans of 2011? Probably not.
But rich GOPers who are terrified by the potential long-term effects of S&P's downgrade of the US' credit rating should think hard about whether their party's hardline anti-tax stanch is really in their best interests. Absent a long-term solution for plugging the deficit—and any solution short of America's transformation into libertarian fantasyland is going to require more revenues—America's debt will eventually be downgraded again. If that happens, the cost of borrowing money, expanding businesses, and creating jobs will spike. Do rich Republicans really want that? Probably not. In the long run, allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire is about keeping the rich… rich.
VSCO Cam Alchemy Collection Emulates Cross-Processed Film
When it comes to applying the analog “look” to digital photos, VSCO is one of the heavies. Now, they have added a new set of ten filters to their popular VSCO Cam mobile app to emulate the look of cross-processed film.
In case you aren't familiar with film terms, cross processing involves taking a certain film stock and then developing it in chemicals for another type of film. As a result, you can get a wide variety of interesting effects on the color and contrast of the photos. For instance, shooting slide film and then processing it with C-41 (negative film) chemicals was a popular method for giving photos an interesting aesthetic when printed. The new filters have a lot of the high-contrast typically associated with cross-processing, and also employ the lively color shifts you'd expect.
There are 10 new filters in all, which show up in the app labeled Q1-Q10. The pack costs $2.99. Getting toward the later filters, the effect is actually quite strong, which is a little much for my personal style, but I actually quite like the effect found in the filters early on in the series. I'm a fan of contrast rather than the washed out “fade” look that's also popular at the moment, so these appeal to my eye.
Ecuador prepares a side event for March 19 or 20 in the framework of the 28th Session of the Human Rights Council to deal with the case of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange who is wanted in Sweden and the US.
MOSCOW, (Sputnik) — Ecuador's mission to the UN is preparing a side event in the framework of the UN's 28th Human Rights Council Session to deal with the case of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange who is wanted in Sweden and the US, the country's envoy to the UN Maria Fernanda Espinosa told Sputnik Monday.
"We are preparing a side event for March 19 or 20 in the framework of the 28th Session of the Human Rights Council to deal with the case of Mr Assange, together with a team of lawyers directed by Dr Baltazar Garzon and a friendly NGO [non-governmental organization]," Espinosa said.
This initiative is in addition to two recommendations made by Ecuador to Sweden during the last Universal Periodic Review (UPR), a system within the UN Human Rights Council that assesses countries' compliance with international standards in this area.
The Ecuadorean mission recommended that Sweden take measures to limit the period of pretrial detention, or an equivalent situation of liberty being deprived, without formal charges and for investigation purposes.

The mission has also recommended streamlining mechanisms for international legal cooperation in judicial and prosecutorial bodies, to ensure due process specifically in cases where the person concerned is protected by an asylum decision of refugee status.
Sweden has rejected the second proposal and agreed to study the first in the period given by the UPR which extends until July.
According to Espinosa, her government is ready to collaborate with Swedish authorities in the investigation, and is willing to let Assange be interviewed either by video or Swedish officials visiting the Ecuadorean embassy in London, where the Wikileaks founder is staying.

"The possibility to collaborate with the Swedish authorities could extend to Ecuadorian territory, if necessary," Espinosa said.
Assange is wanted for questioning in Sweden regarding an alleged sexual assault since 2010, but has never been formally charged by the court. The founder of WikiLeaks has repeatedly denied the allegations, stating they are politically motivated and fearing that his extradition to Sweden could serve as a pretext for transferring him to the United States.
The government of Sweden has agreed to study Ecuador's proposal to reduce the preventive detention of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, wanted in both Sweden and the United States, and will respond before July, Ecuadorian envoy to the UN Maria Fernanda Espinosa told Sputnik Monday.
The proposal reflects Ecuador's interest in breaking the deadlock on the situation with Assange, who has been a refugee in the Ecuadorean embassy in London for over two years.

"The Swedish government informed us that it will reply…before the 29th Regular Session of the Human Rights Council," Espinosa said.
The current proposal was formulated to "support the Swedish state in improving its mechanisms, policies and institutions of the defense and protection of human rights," according to Espinosa.
Julian Assange has been wanted in Sweden for questioning since 2010, regarding an alleged sexual assault, but has never been formally charged by a court. He has repeatedly denied the allegations, stating they are politically motivated and fearing that his extradition to Sweden could serve as a pretext for transferring him to the United States for charges of espionage following the WikiLeaks publication of thousands of classified US government documents online.
Following the WikiLeaks publication of thousands of classified US government documents, Assange is wanted in the United States on charges of espionage.
Assange has been living in the Ecuadorean embassy in central London since 2012, where he faces extradition to Sweden should he leave. December 7, 2014, marked four years since Assange was arrested without charge and almost 900 days that he has spent inside the Ecuadorian embassy.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not going to be the Democratic nominee for president in 2016, barring any extreme or abnormal occurrences. On the surface, it also appears that his "political revolution" -- that is, the election of progressive candidates to local, state and national offices -- is also not succeeding as his supporters might have hoped.
But it has been successful in one key area of interest: making key left-wing economic issues -- such as inequality, the minimum wage, and the disproportionate power of billionaires within the political system -- mainstream again within the Democratic Party. While this message has largely been championed by President Barack Obama during his presidency, Sanders' message is more urgent and less compromising, and it provides an almost left-wing alternative to the kind of right-wing anger which exploded with the formation of the Tea Party in 2009-2010.

Sanders has undoubtedly moved Hillary Clinton's arguments to the left over the course of the campaign season, although the practical policy differences between the two candidates' Senate records is minimal. Sanders' opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and his advocacy of a $15 minimum wage proved to be very popular and arguably forced Clinton to renege on positions she had held in the past.

Rolling Stone's Kate Aronoff also pointed out that the base of any potential Sanders-esque "political revolution" in the future -- namely, millennials -- is becoming more political savvy and approaching politics in radically different ways than their parents' generations. Through a series of interviews, Aronoff concluded that as far as progressive politics are concerned, movements -- such as Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, Fight for $15, etc. -- seem to be the preferred vehicle of political advocacy for a great many left-leaning millennials. This change alone, which was validated and bolstered by Sanders, will undoubtedly shape the future of the Democratic Party.
Right now, the number of potential "Sanders Democrats" who may be elected to Congress in the near future -- such as Nevada's Lucy Flores, New York's Zephyr Teachout, and Pennsylvania's John Fetterman -- seems fairly small. But that number will grow as millennials age and shed their apathy towards politics; this is accompanied by the fact that members of the current Democratic establishment are generally quite old. Sanders, despite being the oldest candidate in the presidential race at 74, has gotten young people excited to vote for Democrats again.
So, perhaps Sanders' "political revolution" has not come to fruition so far in 2016. But his candidacy was itself fueled by an emerging progressive streak within the Democratic Party, and his campaign has only fed into the desire for more progressive candidates within large sections of the party. For the near future, at least, Sanders represents the way forward for the Democratic Party.

Just before the 2015 Santos Tour Down Under kicked off, we spotted the AG2R team testing prototype SRAM wireless bits on a training ride. Now, it looks like up to four of the team bikes are running the system in competition, too, and we've snagged quite a few more detail (albeit phone cam quality) pics, including a look at what's (not) under the bar tape!
Video and tons more photos below…
The video shows the bike being tuned and having its limit screws set, hence the dropped chains. Note how quickly and smoothly the shifts between chainrings are!
We speculated on the battery charging, but now we're all but certain the batteries will simply be removed to charge, likely in some sort of docking station. Comparing the images above and below of front and rear mechs, the batteries appear identical, suggesting they're interchangeable.
Our guess is that top hatch is simply the release/locking lever for the battery.
Up front, the large box we've seen attached to the stem on early prototypes is gone, as are any hint of wires. That lack of visible wires suggests each shifter has it's own battery, too. And that there's no junction box or other central command center that needs to be installed, hidden or otherwise clutter up your bike.
One of our non-SRAM contacts (who wished to remain anonymous) that's had their hands on it said it has a 50m range, meaning it could easily be controlled by a team car or other remote device. Not that it would, but it could. That range also suggests it could be communicating on something like a WiFi network, since 50m is about the max range of a good router, which could mean wireless updates and tuning. That's pure speculation, and perhaps it'll just require a wireless transmitter plugged into your computer or just something plugged into a single component of the system to update the entire group.
Another view we hadn't seen before is the back and underside of the rear derailleur. Where Shimano and Campagnolo have placed the motor off the back and running the mechanical bits between the parallelograms, these SRAM units use a different tack.
Note the large box behind the P-knuckle, between it and the pulley cage.
We're guessing that's the motor since there's not much going on at the back.
The fact that the system is being put into use in a major UCI tour, and reportedly on up to four of the AG2R team bikes at a time, suggests it's getting close to final. Jayson said the SRAM tech rep on site at the TDU wasn't saying anything other than that it was a prototype, but I spoke to another SRAM rep closer to our office that said they're spending as much time as they need to make sure that it's absolutely flawless when it launches. He suggested that there wasn't much point in being the last party to the electronic shifting game unless they could make something that's better than the others. Makes sense, and makes us all that much more excited to try it if/when it finally comes available!
Huge thanks to Jayson for the pics and info, check him out at GravelCyclist.com and on Facebook here. Now, more random photos:
Luis Molina Martinez was fatally shot by police on April 21, 2015 after he had stabbed himself and allegedly lunged at officers with a knife. The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday, Oct. 11, 2017, agreed to pay $1.9 million to his family, who insisted that Martinez was not armed when officer arrived to the report of him stabbing himself.
The Los Angeles City Council agreed Wednesday to pay $1.9 million to the family of a man who was shot to death by police officers after he had stabbed himself in the abdomen during an apparent suicide attempt.
Police said Luis Molina Martinez, 35, was shot because he lunged at officers with a knife in his hand, but a lawsuit claimed that Martinez was no longer armed by the time officers arrived and that evidence at the scene was staged.
The City Council approved the payment on a 12-1 vote, with Councilman Joe Buscaino, a former police officer, voting against the settlement.
The Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit alleged wrongful death, negligence, civil rights violations and assault and battery. The plaintiffs were Martinez's widow, Monica Ramirez, their three biological children and their stepdaughter.
Report Criticizes Police Tactics in LAPD Shooting
A police commission report has criticized the tactics of LAPD officers in the shooting death of a wheelchair bound man last April. Ted Chen reports for the NBC4 News at 5 & 6 on Wednesday, March 9, 2016. (Published Wednesday, March 9, 2016)
"I think Monica Ramirez was the most beautiful client I have ever had the pleasure of serving. And what happened to her husband was an unfortunate reality of the time that we live in now," Gabriel Avina, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, told City News Service.
Rob Wilcox, a spokesman with the City Attorney's Office, said he had no comment on the settlement.
Along with the city, the suit named as defendants Los Angeles Police Department officers Ricardo Huerta, Rudolph Rivera and Aldo Quintero.
Police said previously that Martinez was shot after he allegedly charged at them about 4:30 p.m. on April 21, 2015 with a large hunting knife at his apartment in the 3400 block of Manitou Avenue in the northeast Los Angeles neighborhood of Lincoln Heights.
According to a report on the case by Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey, Martinez had fallen or jumped out of a third-story window on Jan. 22, 2015, and was mostly confined to a wheelchair as a result of a broken hip, but could stand and walk.
The report stated that Ramirez had called 911 after her husband had stabbed himself in the abdomen. After arriving on the scene and trying to give aid to Martinez, who was sitting in a wheelchair, officers reported that he pulled out a knife that had been hidden under his leg, stood up and moved toward them while failing to obey commands to drop the weapon.
Rivera, Huerta, and Quintero all fired at Martinez, who was later pronounced dead in an ambulance, according to the report. Lacey did not specify what Martinez's injuries were, but the suit said he was shot five times, including three times in the back while he was lying face-down in his doorway.
"One officer then kicked Mr. Martinez twice and none of the officers made any attempt at providing medical attention," the suit said. Lacey declined to press any charges against the officers and ruled that their use of force was justified.
"The evidence examined shows that Martinez was depressed and intent on committing suicide. Prior to the officers' arrival, Martinez had stabbed himself in the chest and refused to go to the emergency room," Lacey wrote.
She added, "Martinez refused any assistance from the responding officers after Ramirez called 9-1-1 for assistance. Instead, Martinez purposefully engaged in threatening behavior that had no rational explanation other than it assured the use of deadly force against him."
According to the lawsuit, Martinez was no longer armed when officers arrived.
The suit also alleged that Martinez's body was taken away to allow the officers to move and destroy the evidence of the homicide, and that the knife was planted at the scene near Martinez by officers.
"The city offered $1.9 million because they wanted to sweep things under the rug," Avina said.
Although people are always trying to play fast and loose with Back To The Future's time-warping anniversary, there's concrete proof that Ferris Bueller's actual day off in Chicago (as depicted in John Hughes' 1986 film) happened 30 years ago today: June 5, 1985. By process of elimination, the super-sleuths over at Baseball Prospectus used the players and uniform numbers seen in the movie's Wrigley Field game to zero in on a Braves-Cubs game that took place on this very date. (The site even reconciled filming questions by citing an email from the second assistant director on the film, who cleared up any discrepancies and solidified the June hypothesis.) In honor of this momentous day, perhaps making dinner reservations tonight under the name Abe Froman (“The Sausage King of Chicago?”) is in order.

A new bill on minimum pricing for alcohol will be introduced at Holyrood within the next month, the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon has promised.
She delivered the message in a speech to the party faithful attending their annual conference in Inverness.
A first attempt by the SNP to push through a similar alcohol bill failed during the last parliament.
Scotland's health secretary also said "we will win" the independence referendum.
The 1,300 gathering heard Ms Sturgeon say: "Delegates, I can tell you today that our minimum pricing bill will be reintroduced to parliament within the next month.
"When that bill is passed, Scotland will become the first country to introduce a minimum price per unit of alcohol. The world is watching us.
"Being first with a policy means that it comes with no absolute certainties.
"I know that. But I also know that the evidence, the real life experiences of doctors, nurses, the police, and sheer common sense tell us it can work to reduce the dreadful damage that alcohol misuse does to our communities.
Scottish government health plans
"So, it may not be the politically easy thing to do, but I believe in my heart that it is the right thing to do."
During her speech, Ms Sturgeon said that she would introduce a two-week maximum wait for hospital discharge by 2015.
The current target for discharging someone from hospital when they no longer need hospital care is six weeks.
But under the new targets there would be a four-week maximum wait for discharge, to be achieved by April 2013, followed by a two-week maximum wait by April 2015.
Ms Sturgeon said: "Ten years ago over 2,000 patients were delayed in leaving hospital by more than six weeks.
"By July 2011 that figure was less than 100. But the reality is that too many patients, many of them older people, are still waiting too long to be discharged.
"We must take action to cut these unnecessary waits, which are bad for patients and a waste of hospital resources, particularly when beds need to be available for those who need them."
Delegates, I believe that we will win the independence referendum Nicola Sturgeon, Health Secretary
Ms Sturgeon told part members that hospital bed-blocking costs the NHS more than 200,000 bed days each year - enough patients to fill a 600-bed hospital, at a cost of up to £60m a year.
She also announced plans for 25% of all type 1 diabetic sufferers, under the age of 18, to have access to insulin pumps.
The politician informed the conference that such devices made a real difference to the ability of diabetics to manage their condition and prevent complications.
Ms Sturgeon added: "They don't work for everyone but clinical guidelines say that far more people in Scotland should have access to them than is currently the case. Right now, only about 2.5% of patients have them."
The health secretary also plans to triple the total number of pumps available to sufferers of all ages to more than 2,000.
On the issue of independence and the planned referendum, Ms Sturgeon said the SNP was winning the argument.
However, she cautioned that the party could take nothing for granted.
'Right decisions'
Ms Sturgeon said: "The decision on Scotland's future rests with the Scottish people. Our responsibility is to persuade them that independence offers a better future for our country."
She added: "We know that the campaign against independence will be relentlessly negative. For the UK parties, the independence debate is not about the best interests of Scotland.
"Our case for independence will be based on the simple but powerful belief that, as a country, we are better placed than anyone else to take the right decisions for our future."
To rousing cheers, Ms Sturgeon said: "Delegates, I believe that we will win the independence referendum."

Today, we continue our ongoing new series “SFF in Conversation” with a thoughtful guest post from 2014 Hugo Award nominee John Chu on the topic of language.
“Stand Back! I'm Going To Quote Junot Díaz (Thinking about language)”
The use of language that is not, for lack of a better term, Standard English in English-language stories can be a thorny topic. Given that I've published work where characters speak in Chinese where that dialog is rendered in Chinese, it's probably not a surprise where I stand on this. The differences between writing in dialect and writing non-English text are important enough that I want to make it clear that I'm mostly talking about the latter. Before I get where I'm going to, though, I think it's important to get a sense of where I'm coming from. Let's start with accents:
For decades, my parents owned and operated a Chinese restaurant in Lockport, NY. Like my sister before me, I waited on customers and bussed tables. Some kids grow up having to mow the lawn and do the laundry. I did that too, but I also worked at the family restaurant.
When people called to order take-out, I always answered the phone with the name of the restaurant. Sometimes, callers, rather than order right away, would first check whether they'd called the right place. They'd expected me to have an accent. I know this because they'd always tell me.
Meanwhile, the people who ate in, when I took their orders, would sometimes tell me that I “barely have an accent at all.” I'm sure they meant it as a compliment just as a lot of people thought it was funny to ask whether I was my dad's “Number One Son.” I got asked that a lot.
So, that's what I think of accents. I'm, of course, not saying that there's no such thing. Unless you're a linguist, though, it doesn't matter whether you pronounce the word “bed” as [bed] or [bɛd]. Many times, complaining about an accent or dialect is to use that accent or dialect as a proxy. People just use that as an excuse to think what they want to think. In my experience, they'll think those things anyway even when you pronounce “bed” exactly as they do.
Even when the complaint really is about the accent or dialect itself, the complaint can still be problematic. Many accents and dialects have historically been treated as something less than, as though there were one true way of speaking or one true grammar and everything else were corruptions. Reality, of course, is messier than that. The line between a dialect and a language can be completely arbitrary. The putative worth of an accent has more to do with the judgment imposed on it than anything intrinsic to it.
This is probably a good place for the inevitable use of that awesome Junot Díaz quote:
“Motherfuckers will read a book that's one-third Elvish, but put two sentences in Spanish and they [white people] think we're taking over.”
Too often, using dialects or foreign languages in fiction is demeaned as a trick. Often, the implication is that those words are optional and that the writer can simply remove them or water them down without doing harm to the story. That view gives short shrift to the experience of anyone who understands the dialect or foreign language in question.
What's actually happening when a story spans multiple dialects is much more interesting. To explain, at least by way of a parallel, I'm going to talk about the history behind the orchestration of The Carousel Waltz from the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical Carousel:
In American musical theater, the composers rarely orchestrate their own scores. Even those composers who have the skill rarely have the time while they are writing a show. More often than not, they hire orchestrators to turn their score into something that instrumentalists in a pit can play.
The great Robert Russell Bennett was originally supposed to orchestrate the whole of Carousel. He orchestrated parts of the score, including the 8-minute long Carousel Waltz that opens the show, before dropping out due to prior commitments. Don Walker took over. He did the much of the remaining work himself as well as farming out pieces of the score to other orchestrators. Carousel has a lot of music.
Months after the show opened on Broadway, Richard Rodgers asked Don Walker to reorchestrate the parts of the score that Robert Russell Bennett had originally orchestrated, including the Carousel Waltz. Walker would eventually replace most, but not all, of Bennett's work with his own. Some of Bennett's work still remains in Carousel but not his orchestrations for the Carousel Waltz (which is now lost).
The new theatrical orchestration of the Carousel Waltz obviously had to match Carousel‘s existing pit instrumentation, but Rodgers also needed an orchestration suitable for an upcoming concert performance. Rodgers did not want Walker to write two different orchestrations. Rodgers wanted one orchestration which incorporated a set of additional instruments. Without those instruments, the instrumentation matched that of the Carousel pit. With those instruments, the instrumentation matched that of a concert orchestra.
The result had to be an orchestration that sounded complete and satisfying either way. Those additional instruments had to sound integral to the waltz when they were used. The waltz couldn't sound like it's missing something when they weren't used.
Don Walker is quoted as saying, “This was the hardest thing I ever had to do.”
Now, this is just a parallel, not an analogy. Whereas listeners might reasonably experience that orchestration both ways, readers either understand a foreign language or they don't. However, like how the orchestration of the Carousel Waltz must be compelling in either instrumentation, a story that makes use of dialect or foreign language must be compelling either way. Non-fluent readers must never feel as though something is missing but fluent readers must never feel as though anything is extraneous.
The text tells two different, albeit related, stories. They both have to work for their respective audiences.
And audience is important. Perhaps I feel this way because I'm working with non-English text and, without some help, a monoglot English reader would be lost. Perhaps it's as a friend suggested that the work is a vector between performer and audience. Rather than some platonic thing that exists in isolation, the work is actually a negotiation between performer and audience.
Again, there are parallels in theater. Two plays by David Henry Hwang come to mind: Golden Child and Ch'inglish. Not to mention Mark Medoff's Children of a Lesser God.
Golden Child covers two generations of a Chinese family, one in 1998 America and one in early 20th century China. Linking them is the titular character whom we see both as a 10 year old in China and as a grandmother in America.
In theory, all of early 20th century China scenes ought to be in Chinese. All the characters are Chinese and those scenes are steeped in Chinese culture. For example, shifting attitudes toward foot-binding is used to reflect shifting attitudes in society.
Practically, scenes conducted entirely in Chinese was never a possibility. Golden Child played on Broadway (for about two months) and, in the performance I saw, there were likely more people of Asian descent on stage than in the audience. What Hwang does instead is have his characters speak in what amounts to a very literal English translation.
Characters say things like “eat bitter,” a Chinese idiom that means “to suffer” or “to bear hardship.” If you recognize this, lovely. If you don't, Hwang expects you to work this out from context. He doesn't take literalizing idioms very far, but far enough for the audience to understand those characters are speaking another language.
Ch'inglish is literally about translation and metaphorically about the difficulty of any communication between two people. The main character is an American in China who doesn't speak the language. The play generates its meaning, in part, from mistranslations in both directions. In this case, the actors have to speak in the same language the characters speak in. The play does not make any sense unless the audience witnesses how impossible communication can be when characters lack a shared, fluent language and unless they see mistranslations happen before their eyes.
In this case, any dialog not in English is surtitled in an English translation. The play generates some of its humor from the mismatch between surtitled translations and translation that characters actually make in real time. The surtitling is both a concession to the audience and a virtue made out of a necessity. However, it also admits that to speak the Mandarin dialog in Mandarin is, in fact, a necessity.
One thread running through Children of a Lesser God is the right of deaf people to communicate however they want whether it's via American Sign Language (ASL) or spoken English. In this case, the ASL is not surtitled in translation. Playgoers unfamiliar with ASL understand the deaf characters through context, character reactions, and spoken translations as part of other characters' dialog.
In the performance I saw, the folks in the audience who understood ASL got the jokes before everyone else. This meant a lot of double-barreled laughter, one wave from the initial joke in ASL and a subsequent wave from the on-stage reaction. On one hand, the ASL fluent were watching a different play than I was. On the other hand, I never felt as though I was not part of the intended audience. What was happening on stage worked for everyone in their own ways.
The ways these plays demonstrate how to handle non-English dialog all take their audience into account. Golden Child and Ch'inglish might be different plays if David Henry Hwang assumed his audience understood Mandarin. Likewise, Children of a Lesser God might be another play entirely if Mark Medoff had assumed everyone in the audience understood ASL. Still, in each case, the non-English dialog is integral to the work. Remove, water down, or have the actors speak their non-English dialog in translation instead and the plays fall apart.
The same holds for the use of non-English language in English-language fiction. It is at once both integral to the work and not understood by some portion of your audience. For example, “The Water That Falls on You from Nowhere” is set in one version of the Chinese-American immigrant experience. Multilingualism is intrinsic to that. It's not the main point of the story but there is meaning in various ways characters communicate or can't communicate with each other. The story I was interested in telling had to reflect that. I wanted as wide an audience as possible to understand that without me also betraying that in some way.
Presenting a straightforward translation next to non-English dialog is, for me, the choice of last resort. (This is not to say that I've never done this. There is, in fact, one instance of this in “The Water That Falls on You from Nowhere.”) No one actually enjoys reading the same text twice in a row even if they are in different languages. At least, the translation could interact with the original.
Perhaps the translation can differ noticeably in nuance or be faithless to the original. The combination of the original and the translation ought to say something that neither says by itself. Or, in the case of my story, when Matt translates his mom's words for Gus, there is meaning in the fact that Matt does not hold back. His translation is exactly what his mom intended. Yes, the reader sees a translation, but it plays in the story as an act of love and trust. The meaning of the translation is not merely the original words rendered in a different language.
Sometimes I don't supply a direct translation at all. Instead, subsequent text gives the reader additional information. For example, in my story, Matt's reactions to the questions posed to him at dinner make it clear what he's being asked. Everyone else's reactions as well as his own state of mind makes it clear how he answers. Non-fluent readers read what functions for them like a translation. Fluent readers read questions followed by reactions followed by answers and they are all integral to the story.
Unlike Don Walker and orchestrating the Carousel Waltz, this is probably not the hardest thing I ever had to do. It does take time and care, though, to avoid losing anyone along the way. Like Golden Child, Ch'inglish, and Children of a Lesser God, taking this time and care allows me to create characters, establish situations, and tell stories that would be too difficult or impossible some other way.
Much has been made these days of how one carries along those who don't understand all the language used in a story. As I hope these examples have made clear, though, the focus ought to be on those who do. Present to them a rich, satisfying experience and a wide variety people will understand and, I hope, enjoy the story.
Now, it's not quite as simple as just this. “The Water That Falls on You from Nowhere” also spends time integrating the reader into its version of a slice of the Chinese-American immigrant experience. This is something that, for example, makes a Chinese translation of this story a challenging task. A version aimed at Chinese readers may need different things explained.
Still, if I've done my job right, I've told “The Water That Falls on You from Nowhere” to as many people as possible. And I've done it not by treating the use of Chinese as this optional extra, but as an element integral to the work.

Developers at Microsoft's Build conference severely underestimated the popularity of their experimental app, which guesses how old you are after you upload a photo of yourself.
Microsoft's How-Old.net will analyze any photo you upload, detect any faces, and guess the person's gender and age.
It's powered by Face APIs, a new tool that launched at this week's Build Developer Conference. The program's page describes it as "a cloud-based API that provides the most advanced algorithms for face detection and recognition." Proposed uses include verifying whether two faces in separate photos belong to the same person, or using one person's photos to find him or her in multiple other photos.
Microsoft's Machine Learning Blog team said that they emailed "several hundred people" asking them to try out the API, and expected about 50 people to use it. Instead, they logged more than 35,000 tests in only a few hours.
Clearly, they underestimated the general public's interest in age and appearance.
Nearly 30,000 of their hits came from Turkey. "Apparently there were a bunch of tweets from Turkey mentioning this page," they wrote.
The page also includes a series of stock photos to test the API. The Microsoft team said they assumed more people would use these instead of uploading their photos. Instead, they found that fewer than half of the tests were done with the stock pictures.
It's still very much a work in progress, though: users online described getting a wide range of ages with multiple photos, thanks to differences in resolution, lighting or framing.
That's probably part of the fun, though. "Forget Minesweeper or Solitaire — this is the best game Microsoft has bestowed upon humanity," writes The Verge's Josh Lowensohn.

LexisNexis acknowledged Friday that criminals used its information retrieval service for more than three years to gather data that was used to commit credit card fraud.
LexisNexis has started warning about 32,000 people that "a few" customers used its service to help them illegally obtain credit cards. "These individuals were operating businesses that at one time were both ChoicePoint and LexisNexis customers," the company said in a notification letter that it began sending out Friday.
To perpetrate the scam, the fraudsters would set up fake mail boxes and then use information obtained on LexisNexis to open credit cards in the victims' names. The criminals were able to obtain names, dates of birth, and even Social Security numbers from the data broker.
In 2006, ChoicePoint paid US$15 million to settle a lawsuit with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission after scammers allegedly used ChoicePoint's data services for ID fraud. LexisNexis's parent company, Reed Elsevier, purchased ChoicePoint last year for $4.1 billion.
LexisNexis apparently waited a long time to notify victims at the request of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. The fraud was stopped on Oct. 10, 2007, LexisNexis said, but the breach notification letters were not sent out until now. A LexisNexis spokesman could not say definitively when the company became aware of the breach.
If LexisNexis withheld disclosure for a year-and-a-half it was "far too long," according to Beth Givens, director or Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. "A lot of damage can be done in 18 months," she said.
The U.S. Postal Inspection Service did not return calls and e-mail messages seeking comment Friday.
LexisNexis has tightened up the way it verifies customers since the incident, the company said in the notification letter.
LexisNexis was involved in other data breaches in 2005 and 2006, according to data from Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a privacy watchdog group.
According to CBS News, which first reported the breach, another company, Investigative Professionals, was also hit by the scammers, who were ultimately able to obtain information on 40,000 victims, including those targeted using the LexisNexis data.
Investigative Professionals could not be reached for comment.
BELLEFONTE, Pa. – Shortly after he arrived at the courthouse here to learn the verdict of a jury weighing the 48 child sex abuse charges lodged against him, Jerry Sandusky's attorney said he attempted to prepare his client for the almost certain prospect that he would not be going home.
Attorney Joe Amendola said he told the former Penn State University assistant football coach, while the two waited to be ushered into a packed courtroom late Friday night, that it was "more than likely'' that the 68-year-old defendant — once celebrated for his collegiate football coaching prowess and nationally acclaimed for his role in founding a charity for troubled children — would be convicted on at least some of the criminal counts.
Despite those warnings, Sandusky's face appeared to turn blank as a cascade of guilty verdicts — 45 in all — were read by the jury foreman, standing only a few yards away.
As the prosecution's overwhelming victory began to wash over the courtroom gallery, one of the coach's victims who offered wrenching testimony of Sandusky's abuse during the seven-day trial wept quietly.
On the other side of the room, where Sandusky's wife, Dottie, sat with her family, each pronouncement of "guilty'' seemed to land like a hammer.
When it was over, Sandusky, offering a slight wave to his wife, was ushered out of the courtroom in the custody of sheriff's deputies to begin what his attorney said will likely be a life prison sentence.
Judge John Cleland, who told Sandusky that he had been "convicted by a jury of your peers,'' said formal sentencing would take place in 90 days.
Video playlist: Sandusky trial
In developments Saturday:
•Sandusky's lawyers said they asked to resign the case on the eve of trial but the judge turned them down. Defense attorney Karl Rominger said he and co-counsel Joe Amendola made the motion as jury selection began but Judge John Cleland ruled against it. Rominger says the exchange took place in chambers and the motion was filed under seal.
•A juror said the credibility of the accusers who testified at the trial solidified the case against Sandusky. Joshua Harper told NBC's Today show, "It's hard to judge character on the stand because you don't know these kids. But most were very credible — I would say all. It was very convincing."
Sandusky's own impassivity as the verdict was read was also a confirmation that the jury's decision was the right one, Harper said. Sandusky appeared to be accepting his fate, Harper said, "because he knew it was true."
•Sandusky is one of 272 inmates at the Centre County Correctional Facility, just seven miles from the Pann State campus, and was kept under watch overnight. A jail spokesman would not say whether anyone had come to see him Saturday.
On Friday, the jury of seven women and five men concluded more than 20 hours of deliberatyions over the course of two days before reaching the decisions that triggered a thunderous celebration outside, where hundreds of spectators had gathered on the century-old courthouse steps. Some of them, accompanied by their children, waved homemade signs expressing their appreciation for a jury that included eight members who had deep ties to either Penn State or were familiar with some of the witnesses in the case.
AP Jerry Sandusky is shown in this booking photo released early Saturday morning by the Centre County Correctional Facility in Bellefonte, Pa.
The reaction was similar in nearby State College, the home of Penn State University and a powerful football program that Sandusky helped build.
An overflow crowd at Bill Pickle's tap room in downtown State College erupted in cheers with the announcement that Sandusky had been found guilty. Patrons had gathered around the bar's five TV sets, all of which were tuned to the cable news broadcast.
Outside, the usually bustling campus town was relatively quiet, with the first summer school session having just ended and many students back home.
Penn State graduate Thomas Wardrop, 22, said, "For both Penn State and State College it's important to have closure to an event that brought so much negative light.
"Now that we have reached this step," he said, "we can begin to address the issues that preceded this and build upon it both as a college and a community to improve and make sure that things like these don't happen again."
Audrey Leonard, 22, of Oakton, Va., who graduated last month, said: "With everything that this man has put the community, college and especially the victims through — I think any other verdict would be unfathomable."
In a statement released after the verdict was announced, the university said it wants to move quickly to see that victims in the case are compensated.
"Now that the jury has spoken, the university wants to continue that dialogue and do its part to help victims continue their path forward," it said. "To that end, the university plans to invite victims of Mr. Sandusky's abuse to participate in a program to facilitate the resolution of claims against the university arising out of Mr. Sandusky's conduct.
"The purpose of the program is simple - the university wants to provide a forum where the university can privately, expeditiously and fairly address the victims' concerns and compensate them for claims relating to the university."
Addressing the crowd gathered on the Bellefonte courthouse square, Amendola said that his client's attempt to "climb Mount Everest'' had failed. "We just didn't make it,'' Amendola said.
"There was a tidal wave of public opinion against Jerry Sandusky."
Amendola, however, was angrily shouted down by the crowd when he suggested that his client may have been wrongly convicted. "There are a lot of people sitting in jails around the country who are innocent,'' the attorney said, adding that Sandusky would appeal.
Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly, surrounded by the prosecution team, described Sandusky as a "serial child predator who committed horrific acts.''
"Now,'' Kelly said, "he is being held accountable for his crimes."
Kelly said the verdicts represented an "overwhelming'' affirmation for the eight victims who testified at trial and the witnesses who described abuse against two other victims who have never been found by investigators.
"Most of us can not comprehend what they have endured," she said. "We hope our search for justice helps the victims and others."
An attorney who represents one of Sandusky's victims who testified during the trial said that his client is "grateful."
"He is gratified that there are people in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania who took this seriously," attorney Tom Kline said. "This has been very, very difficult for him. There is something deep in his soul that has suffered an horrific injury."
The jury sustained convictions on charges involving all 10 victims, including some of the most disputed charges involving a 2001 assault of a young boy witnessed by Penn State football assistant Michael McQueary, whose accounts of the incident were strongly challenged. While the jury found Sandusky not guilty of sodomizing the boy, the panel returned guilty verdicts on four other related counts, including indecent assault.
The incident, perhaps the most explosive in the criminal case, ultimately led to the ouster of Penn State University President Graham Spanier and head football coach Joe Paterno. The incident also is at the heart of a related perjury prosecution against Athletic Director Tim Curley and retired university Senior Vice President Gary Schultz. Both are accused of lying to a grand jury when they testified that McQueary's initial report of the incident did not include an account of sexual conduct by Sandusky. Both men have denied any wrongdoing, as they await trial. Paterno, who was never charged, first reported McQueary's allegations to Curley and Schultz. Before he died in January, Paterno suggested he should have done more to pursue the allegations.
The trial's conclusion also seemed to resolve questions about why Sandusky did not testify on his own behalf, after Amendola signaled in opening statements that the jury would hear directly from the former coach.
Amendola said he elected not to call Sandusky after the defense was threatened with the prospect that one of Sandusky's own adopted sons would testify against him.
The attorney for Matt Sandusky, 33, issued a statement Thursday, claiming Sandusky also had been abused by his father and was prepared to testify for the prosecution.
Amendola said the younger Sandusky met with prosecutors after they had presented their case and as defense lawyers weighed the possibility of calling the former coach to testify.
Defense lawyers did not call Sandusky, Amendola said, because prosecutors could have offered Matt Sandusky as a rebuttal witness to counter his father's testimony. Amendola said the family was "crushed'' by the son's action. The attorney said that Matt Sandusky had been listed on the defense witness list and had been seated with the family during the start of the trial.
In the end, he was not called by either side.
The jury's decision came nearly four years after a wide-ranging criminal investigation was launched and seven months after the first of the 48 charges were announced, detailing abuse involving 10 victims over a 15-year period.
Eight of the victims testified during the trial, providing often graphic accounts of abuse, ranging from fondling to forced oral sex and sodomy.
One of the victims recalled how he screamed for help while Sandusky allegedly assaulted him in the basement bedroom of the coach's State College, Pa., home.
In closing arguments earlier Thursday, lead prosecutor Joe McGettigan said Sandusky "accommodated" children to "sexual touch."
"He displayed the full spectrum of predatory pedophile behavior," he said, referring to previous testimony from victims who said their contact with Sandusky routinely began with the former coach putting his hand on their legs during car rides.
In a voice barely audible in the courtroom, McGettigan concluded his argument saying: "I feel like I have 10 souls in my pocket."
He then marched to the defense table and stood beside the defendant, who appeared to be startled by the move.
"You can't give them back the pieces of the souls he took," McGettigan said, as two of the alleged victims watched from the front row.
"Find him guilty of everything. Give him the justice he really deserves," McGettigan said.
Earlier, Sandusky attorney Amendola said the charges against his client came from alleged victims who sought financial gain for their testimony and who were improperly coached by police investigators.
"The system decided that Mr. Sandusky was guilty and the system set out to convict him," Amendola said, referring to police investigators and the prosecution.
Sandusky was an assistant coach at Penn State from 1967 to 1999, during which time Penn State won two national championships and was nicknamed "Linebacker U" because it kept churning out All-American defensive players like LaVar Arrington, Matt Millen and Lance Mehl. Sandusky was the defensive line coach, then linebackers coach, then defensive coordinator of the iconic defense.
Sandusky was, at one point, the heir apparent to Paterno. And indeed, their names will forever remain linked - because of Sandusky's role in the scandal that stained the university's reputation.
The Paterno family released a statement after the verdict, saying: "Although we understand the task of healing is just beginning, today's verdict is an important milestone. The community owes a measure of gratitude to the jurors for their diligent service. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the victims and their families."
Audio Push have come a long way since their "Teach Me How to Jerk" days, and that's evident on their debut album 90951. The rap duo out of Inland Empire, Calif. showcase their versatility throughout the 12-song project with music that caters to the youth as well as the older heads.
Today, they share an early stream of 90951 ahead of its Sept. 23 release. Audio Push also stopped by the Complex offices this week to talk about their new album, receiving a shout-out from Kid Cudi, and how they feel about whether new school rappers need to be hip-hop scholars. Stream 90951 and check out their responses below. 90951 is available for pre-order on iTunes and will be released Sept. 23. If you're in the Pomona, Calif. area makes sure to catch Audio Push at the Glass House tonight for their debut album concert.
You guys were signed to Interscope, now you guys are releasing 90951 independently. What did you learn from that process of being signed to a label?
Oktane: The good side of it is there's an actual budget; it's basically like a bank. Other than that the upside to being independent is now when we want to release music I don't have to get a phone call back like, “No, we have to wait for this date.” I can go, “Are you ready? I'm ready. Let's go.”

Price: They can get your stuff on the Super Bowl or touch certain things you can't touch, certain radio plays or things that are extremely difficult to make happen; a label can do it with a button press. But a lot of why we were making music that wasn't true to us I believe was us trying to cater to the label, and the label is trying to cater to hits, cater to trends. They're trying to sell music; they are not trying to innovate. That's what I love about being independent, ‘cause we've got full control on innovating.
On the album you have “Black Man,” which is your guys delivering socially conscious raps. What you guys were trying to accomplish with that record?
Price: Michael Jackson gave you “Thriller,” “Remember the Time,” and “Black or White.” Marvin Gaye gave you “What's Going On” and “Sexual Healing.” So don't look at Audio Push and think you're finna just get bars or just get conscious spiritual music.
Oktane: Just respect the art.
POST CONTINUES BELOW
Price: Just press play and only expect prestige.
Oktane: We treat audio art like visual art. You don't go to Basquiat expecting any type of picture, you're just going to enjoy what Basquiat did. Just come and enjoy it, and if you don't enjoy it, skip it. But you are gonna find something you do love on this album.
Price: With “Black Man,” the purpose of it is us wanting to speak on that topic hands-on. On top of bringing awareness to everyone, more so bringing the awareness to other black men. Like wake up black man; wake up. We all gotta do it collectively. We can sit here and speak on the problems, but after we do all that, after all that is done, what are we going to do as a collective to make a change? Not a protesting change, not all that shit that we've been doing for years that hasn't done anything. What realistically are we going to come together to do to put our minds, money, and movements to make happen? Because without those three nothing is going to change. Keep your protests, keep all that shit, keep your shirts, keep your Black Lives Matter crap. Without movement, money, and minds there's not going to be anything. So that's what “Black Man” is about.

Let's cut the sh*t, there wouldn't have been no 808s & Heartbreak without Cudi, period.
Kid Cudi recently shouted you guys out.
Price: Cudi is awesome; he just shows us mad love. That isn't even his first time shouting us out. He did a radio interview like a year ago and the person on the radio was like, if you could put a super group together of rappers, and he named us and Logic and that was just huge for us. To know how much of an innovator he is, to know he is that person who will put his album out and know he's going against everything everyone else is doing but he loves it and owns that shit, that's what I rock with.
Let's cut the shit, there wouldn't have been no 808s & Heartbreak without Cudi, period. There was already a Kanye, no question, but what created Yeezy was 808s & Heartbreak. What created So Far Gone was 808s & Heartbreak. Wouldn't have been none of that without Cudi, and that's just fact. Price deals all with facts.
Oktane: A lot of OGs are getting to the point right now where they're just forgetting a lot of shit. But that's why I fuck with Cudi though because Cudi is not saying anything that's…
POST CONTINUES BELOW
Price: Fake.
Oktane: Fake. Everything he's saying is the truth. For Kanye to get mad Cudi said ‘you're in the studio with 30 other people,' that's just the truth. What are you mad about?
Price: Yeah, you can't really get mad when people respond with facts.
One hot topic right now is this idea that new school rappers have to be knowledgeable about hip-hop; for example Lil Yachty not knowing Pac and Biggie songs. What's your guy's take on that?
Oktane: I don't feel like you have to know shit like that, because we're in a different era. If the kids don't spit bars then you just gotta let them go live. Now, would Lil Yachty win in a battle? Lil Yachty obviously don't got any plans of battling niggas so what are we talking about that for? I feel like too many people compare apples to oranges instead of just accepting this kind of art for what it is and if you don't like it, just leave it the fuck alone. I think that would make a lot of things more simple. And you gotta understand we're dealing with a youth that don't care about what the big homies think; that's just the rules now. There are no rules, and a lot of people don't like that.
POST CONTINUES BELOW
Price: I totally get that, but another part of me want to slap these lil niggas too. Not saying slap Lil Yachty; they all cool we know them. But I'm saying as far as me I didn't grow up on... like niggas weren't banging just Rakim and banging Eric B, but what I did was go back and researched it and went back and listened to all of it and sharpened my tools on the Jungle Brothers and different things like that. Why? Because I consider myself a rapper. I consider myself a hip-hop artist. I consider myself a great in this field I'm in.
Oktane: And then it's also… Lil Yachty started rapping when?
Price: That's something you hear from people who say they've only been rapping a year.
Oktane: “I've been rapping a year!” What do you expect?
Price: The people I'm madder at—no disrespect to you—but it's the news media, the people who are actually co-signing these people as greats and putting these people on the covers of magazines and shit, which is awesome. I'm not hating on nobody but don't get mad at these kids who are feeling themselves.

They're not justing throwing anybody in the NBA. You can't just get on the Lakers or on the Cavs. You can't just make it to the NFL. You have to be of some type of prestige, you have to have some type of history and a level of skill. Period.
Oktane: This is the one game where you can hit a lucky shot or kick it off your knee, and now you're known for that and get to wear a jersey. I'm not hating on any of that, but I'm just taking it for what it is.

Now that Hillary Clinton has locked up the Democratic nomination for president, she is one step closer to breaking the “highest, hardest glass ceiling” in American politics. If she wins, would her presidency bring more women into political office in the United States?
[Hillary Clinton's lead in the polls may be larger than it seems. Here's why.]
That's very possible — even probable. At least, that's what we can conclude from my new paper about the 50 countries where, since the 1950s, women have held the highest office, such as president or prime minister.
On average, when a woman becomes a country's chief executive, that country starts electing more women to the legislature
The graph below shows that the number of countries with a woman holding its highest office has generally been increasing since 1960. In the spring of 2014, 18 countries had a female leader. Although the figure has dropped recently, women are now leading as many countries today as they did at any point before 2009. Some female leaders, like Clinton, come from powerful political dynasties. But without exception, each of the women currently serving in her country's highest office was elected in her own right and did not inherit the position from her father or her husband.
But of these 50 countries, only 12 — including Norway, Bangladesh and the Philippines — have had a second woman as the country's top leader.
In other words, electing a female leader doesn't vastly increase the likelihood that it will happen again. But electing a female leader does appear to boost the number of women those nations elect to their legislatures. Let's look at the data.
Once a nation has a female leader, it elects more women to its legislature
According to the World Bank's Gender Data Portal, women make up an average of 20.6 percent of democratically elected parliaments, assemblies and congresses. In countries where a woman has never been in power, that number is 18.6 percent — but in nations where a woman has held the highest office, the number is 24.1 percent.
We know that correlation doesn't equal causation. There could be other reasons these legislatures have more women. For instance, the kind of countries that elect a woman to the top office might also have gender quotas for political lists, greater economic opportunities for women, or a more progressive political culture that encourages people to see women and men as equals. To check, I did a statistical analysis that models women's representation while accounting for those and other factors across more than 100 democracies from 1997 to 2014. And what I found was that — all other things being equal — yes, electing a female leader appears to result in that country electing more women to the legislature.
[Would Clinton really appoint a cabinet that's half women and half men?]
Once democracies have had a female leader, they have on average about 4 percent more women in their legislatures than those that have not. And 4 percent is a lot. In most countries, that's dozens of legislators, enough to potentially influence what legislation gets passed.
That boost in female representation in legislatures persists for at least a generation after the breakthrough female executive leaves power. Or to put it differently, 10 years after a woman has been a nation's top executive, it has the same percentage of women in its legislature as does a country in which a woman currently holds power.
Consider the Philippines. During Corazon Aquino's presidency (1986-1992), only 9 percent of the country's legislators were women. This figure remained between 10 and 12 percent for a decade after she left office, increasing sharply to 18 percent when the country's second female president, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, was elected in 2001. It has since climbed to 27 percent, well above the global average. In nearby Indonesia, only 8 percent of the country's legislators were women when Megawati Sukarnoputri took office in 2001. This increased to 12 percent by the time she left office in 2004 and has since reached 18 percent.
[In 6 graphs, here's why young women don't support Hillary Clinton as much as older women do]
Of course, we know that average increases don't mean inevitable increases. In some countries, female leadership has not resulted in having more women in the legislature. For instance, women make up just 17 percent of South Korea's National Assembly — only 1 percent more than before President Park Geun-hye, the country's first female head of state, took power in 2013. But on average, having a woman serve as president or prime minister leads to higher numbers of women in the legislature.
Why does having a female president or prime minister result in women in office?
Many countries have only recently elected women as their top leaders. As a result, not much research has been done on what then happens that brings more women into politics.
Here are some possibilities. Having a female president as a model could encourage more women to get politically involved. She could serve as a role model and attract more women to the polls, women who might then be more likely to vote for other women elsewhere on the ticket. By appointing women to cabinet positions — as Clinton has promised to do — a female president could bolster the credentials of those who might run for higher office in the future, or simply inspire women to run.
[In Clinton's run, the ‘woman card' works in surprising ways. Here's how.]
But will that effect continue? Maybe the additional number of female legislators and cabinet members increases the pool of viable female candidates for high offices for decades to come. Maybe that increase becomes self-perpetuating, as having more female legislators diminishes gender stereotypes, leads people to expect to see both women and men in office, and strengthens the ambitions and credentials of women who may later try for higher office.
[These charts show how much sexism Hillary Clinton faces on Twitter]
Or maybe the shattered glass ceiling gets repaired and replaced as that leader's legacy fades from political memory. Maybe the processes are different when women are elected as part of a family legacy and when they reach the top office on their own efforts. We just don't know yet.
But even if electing Hillary Clinton wouldn't necessarily bring us a second “Madam President” anytime soon, we should expect more women in Congress for at least a decade.

Some statements by Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte are making some observers go “hmmmm,” specifically his decision to not allow any women to accompany him on an official trip to Hong Kong and jokes he made on that trip that if he does “turn gay” it'll be because of all the selfies men take with him.
Yahoo
“Those taking selfies, males with moustaches, when they take the ‘selfie,' they press their face against mine,” he joked, and the crowd of supporters in Hong Kong cheered in response, reported Towleroad. “I might turn gay if they press their face too close to mine. Some of them did not even shave.”
And we're sure that was just a terribly horrible experience for him to endure.
Duterte, who told a TV interviewer in 2015 he was gay but was now “reformed,” was quick to tell the cheering crowd, “If your president becomes gay, we can't do anything about that. Blame the selfie.” Uhhuh. Riiiight.
Martin Romuladez
What's comforting to know is that in that 2015 TV interview, Duterte made a point to note he had nothing against gays, because two of his brothers-in-law and some of his cousins are gay. But not him.
Unless he takes too many selfies with unshaven men.

KENDALL — When asked how important it was to him that this Heat team stayed together this offseason, Tyler Johnson flashed his toothless grin.
Johnson was happy to see the Heat re-sign James Johnson and Dion Waiters, and find room to retain Wayne Ellington. As it stands right now, the Heat have 11 players returning from last year's season-ending roster.
Johnson spoke to a few reporters on Tuesday afternoon at the Heat's summer youth basketball camp at Miami-Dade College. He answered questions on the Heat's potential for this upcoming season, first-round pick Bam Adebayo and even the toothless look he keeps going with.
Here's what Johnson had to say …
Q: How important is it to you that the Heat decided to keep this team together this offseason?
Tyler: “I remember [Pat] Riley telling us after the trade deadline he wanted to keep the team together just to give us a chance. He wanted to give us the opportunity to compete and try to make the playoffs. Obviously we fell short of that goal. But with the way that team was headed and the way we bonded and the way things have been going this summer, all I was hoping for during free agency was that we brought back the guys who were in the trenches last year.”
Q: You hear people talking about Cleveland, Boston, Washington and Toronto. Do you feel the current Heat roster has the talent to crack the top four in the East?
Tyler: “Yeah. We're not worried about that. We know what we're capable of. If we continue building on the habits that we picked up last season, we're not putting no numbers on it. We just know that we're going to be in every single game that we play in. So who's to say that we couldn't make it and crack that top four.”
Q: Were you surprised the Heat were able to keep this team together this offseason?
Tyler: “I won't say surprised. But in this business nothing is guaranteed, as far as guys coming after James [Johnson], coming after Dion [Waiters], whether the team picked up Wayne [Ellington's contract] or not. Once all those pieces fell into place, I was definitely excited. But obviously, nothing is guaranteed in this league. But I wouldn't say I was surprised when we brought everybody back.”
Q: Not only do you have the chemistry of a returning cast, but having a style that you guys established that works for you in terms of spreading the floor around Hassan Whiteside. How much of an advantage does that give you guys?
Tyler: “It's a huge advantage. Hassan has been putting in work. If he picks up where he left off last year, he has the potential to be an All-Star. When he plays the way he's capable of playing, he's the best center in the league hands down. There's nobody who can do what he does on both ends of the floor, in my opinion. His stats kind of went down in the later part of the season, but he was probably more important to our team during that stretch than he was the first 11-30 stretch.”
Q: What was your first impression of first-round pick Bam Adebayo in summer league?
Tyler: “I didn't realize how versatile he was. He was pushing the floor, grabbing rebounds and then leading the break. I wasn't expecting that, especially for a guy as big as he is. So that kind of caught me off guard, and then his athleticism. You throw the ball anywhere, and he's going to go up and go get it. And also how mature he was for being 19. I was definitely surprised by that.”
Q: How do you see Kelly Olynyk fitting in with this Heat team?
Tyler: “I know I hated playing against him. I'm assuming he's one of those guys that you hate to play against but you love to have on your team. I saw how important he was to that Boston squad, so I think he'll be a good fit for this team.”
Q: You keep telling us that you're going to replace your missing front tooth, but the toothless look is still there. Is this just your look?
Tyler: “I don't know. My mom's been pushing me, too. So I think she might be the one to finally get me to get one. But I don't see why it's necessary right now, because I'm sure eventually it's going to get knocked out again. I mean, if I play 10 years in the NBA, I'm pretty sure I'm going to lose it two, three more times.”
Q: You said you've lost seven teeth. Did they all come while playing basketball?
Tyler: “Yeah. I had one incident in college where I dove on the floor. Somebody fell on top of the back of my head and all my teeth went into the court. So I lost five or six at that time. And then when I broke my jaw, I think that was my seventh.”

Ndamukong Suh couldn't remember anything quite like what he experienced on Sunday, a performance so one-sided that it almost looked unfair.
“I'd have to think back to college,” he said.
That's exactly where Nick Fairley found his comparison.
“Auburn,” he said.
Never in the NFL?
“This is the first time since I've been in the league that I've seen a game like this,” Fairley said.
The Vikings offensive line, including John Sullivan, right, and Matt Kalil, center, allowed eight sacks of rookie Teddy Bridgewater.
How about you George Johnson?
“Never have I been a part of a game like that,” he said. “I've watched games like that but never been a part of one.”
So there you have it. Even members of the Detroit Lions defensive line found it somewhat absurd the degree to which they smashed their counterparts in a 17-3 victory over the Vikings at TCF Bank Stadium.
The entire game could be stripped down to that singular matchup: Detroit's defensive line vs. the Vikings offensive line.
The verdict: Uncle!
NFL parity didn't apply to that particular matchup. Picture a road paver rumbling over pebbles.
The Lions sacked Teddy Bridgewater eight times — four in each half. They hit him 12 times. Bridgewater dropped back 45 times, and it felt like he was under pressure 45 times.
The Lions front four were relentless, and the Vikings' line wilted under the pressure.
“Once we smell blood,” defensive end Jason Jones said, “we're attacking.”
The Vikings line didn't have a prayer against the NFL's best defensive front. Bridgewater's supposed protectors should apologize to him. Or offer to draw him a warm bath because the kid took a beating.
On one play, tackles Matt Kalil and Phil Loadholt whiffed on their blocks simultaneously, allowing two Detroit rushers to make a Bridgewater sandwich.
Suh collapsed the pocket so forcefully on one run that Matt Asiata barely received the handoff before he was hit for a 3-yard loss. Suh burst through the line so fast that he engulfed Asiata.
“That's what we're supposed to do — go out there and attack them,” Jones said. “Feast on the quarterback.”
They treated it like an all-you-can-eat buffet. The Lions defensive line is big and fast and strong and tough. And it works well as a unit.
Suh and Fairley are immovable in the middle, and their edge rushers keep heat on opponent's tackles. Five different linemen recorded at least a partial sack of Bridgewater.
“Our defensive line is always in competition with each other,” said Johnson, who posted 1½ sacks and two hits. “It's a friendly competition of who can run the fastest, who can get to the quarterback. That's actually what makes us play the way we play. It's always a competition.”
They were all winners Sunday. Every guy took home bragging rights. The Vikings offensive line received a participation medal.
The Vikings offense could've played until Halloween and it wasn't going to a score a touchdown because its line offered no resistance. The Lions front four stuffed the run and then teed off on Teddy.
“That was our game plan,” Fairley said. “Every time that he dropped back, somebody has to get a hand on him, push him, knock him down. Let him know that we're here.”
Oh, he definitely knew. The rookie will have nightmares about that group for a long time.
The Lions noticed on film Bridgewater has a tendency to hold onto the ball a little too long. That might work against the Atlanta Falcons, but the Lions own the NFL's top-ranked defense. And they smothered Bridgewater in the pocket.
On the field, the Lions kept telling themselves the same thing before every snap.
“Keep hunting,” Johnson said. “When we started getting him, we were like, ‘Man, we're getting after it right now.'”
Offensive players love to talk about getting into a “rhythm” when everything just flows perfectly. That's what happened with Detroit's defensive line. The Lions were so dominant with their rush that it just clicked. They kept the Vikings on their heels all game.
“We're relentless the way we rush the passer,” Fairley said.
The Lions were careful not to disparage the Vikings offensive line afterward, but they didn't need to brag. What more could they say? They had never seen anything like that, either.
“Overall,” Suh said, “I think it's a dominant performance across the board.”
Medical Marijuana Bill Introduced in Iowa
DES MOINES – State Rep. Bruce Hunter (D-Des Moines) introduced a bill Wednesday that would allow Iowa residents with debilitating medical conditions to obtain and use marijuana without fear of arrest.
H.F. 22 would allow patients with certain qualifying conditions, who have received recommendations from their physicians, to privately possess limited amounts of marijuana and grow – or designate a caregiver to grow – up to six marijuana plants in their homes.
A February 2010 Seltzer & Co. poll found that 64% of Iowans think the state should enact a law allowing seriously ill patients to use medical marijuana if their doctors recommend it. That same month, the Iowa Board of Pharmacy voted unanimously to recognize marijuana's medical value.

“Iowans clearly want our state policy to be sensible and rooted in evidence, that's why I'm introducing this medical marijuana legislation,” said Rep. Hunter. “At this point, there's no denying that marijuana helps alleviate the symptoms of a host of terrible diseases, many of which are notoriously difficult to treat.”
Qualifying conditions under the proposed law include: cancer; glaucoma; HIV/AIDS; hepatitis C; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); Crohn's disease; agitation of Alzheimer's disease; nail patella; intractable pain that has not responded to ordinary medical or surgical measures for more than six months; wasting syndrome; severe nausea; seizures; and severe muscle spasms.
“There is a wealth of scientific evidence demonstrating marijuana is significantly less addictive and has far less severe side effects than the opiates and other narcotics these patients are taking now,” Rep. Hunter said. “Common sense – and a vast majority of Iowans – dictates that we allow these seriously and sometimes terminally ill patients to use medical marijuana without fear of arrest or prosecution.”
Under current state law, Iowans who use marijuana to treat their debilitating conditions and symptoms face up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine for a first-offense possession conviction. Subsequent arrests for possession of any amount can be punishable by up to two years in jail and a $6,250 fine. Private cultivation of a single marijuana plant in one's home is a felony in Iowa that carries a penalty of up to five years in prison.

“The bill introduced by Rep. Hunter will bring Iowa in line with a growing number of states that recognize the medical efficacy of marijuana,” said Robert Capecchi, deputy director of state policies at the Marijuana Policy Project, the nation's largest marijuana policy organization. “There is no reason to let seriously ill patients continue to suffer in Iowa while the rest of the country adopts this type of sensible legislation.”
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia allow patients with qualifying conditions to use medical marijuana with recommendations from their physicians. At least 10 more states are expected to consider similar legislation this year, and such bills have already been introduced in Alabama, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, New Hampshire, and New York.

Have a compact rear-wheel-drive car and want to traverse vast stretches of unpaved snowy wasteland? Russia has the solution. We bring you "Snow Foot Car," a 1-hour conversion system capable of turning a Lada into a radical snowmobile.
The system works like this: Take your rear-wheel drive car and drive it up on to what's basically a car trailer with balloon tires at the rear and a snow ski at the front. Lash the rear end to a support and take off the rear wheels and replace the rim with an offset chain sprocket. Run a chain around sprocket and to the rear wheel gears then lash strap the front wheels into a cradle that's hooked up to the ski's steering system.
The next step is to go driving around in the snow to make a video you set to porno music. Snow Car Foot. This idea and execution might be perfect right out of the box, anything more would be ridiculous, less would be underwhelming. They even did it with a wagon. (Thanks Ian)

Vuugo.com presents
What's up guys !
Hope you are all ready for this kickass event, it will all happen on Sunday November 20th, Doors will open at 11:00 A.M this time for more action !
We have been reading every single comment made from the previous event, and here is how it'll work: Rooms: Due to the large amount of people that we're all expecting for this BarCraft, all three rooms will be open instead of one, to hold up to 1500 people.
Seatings. The blue room will contain a massive amount of seatings for those that will want to sit. We will have an HD projector in that room as well.
Vuugo.com Main Hall. Finally, where world's sickest ambiance lives, the Vuugo.com Main Hall, will have many standing bars, but very few seatings in order to maximize the capacity and keep the same unique ambiance we had previously. Our BarCraft was that crazy because of the good games, but mostly because of our vibe and ambiance. That room will be quite awesome, we've rented a Giant full HD 1080p projector for the screening (see picture[s] below for example). We've also rented CO2 canons to make this event the most epic as possible (See picture below). The 2 screens we had for the last time will still be there, with the walls covered, there won't be any issues with the bricks this time. The Vuugo.com Main Hall will be spectacular.
Evil Geniuses GrandMaster Lair: We are very excited to announce the making of the "GrandMaster Room", that room will have a buffet with fruits & bites, 3 Big HD TVs, Media coverage from a few TV networks, contact with press members & sponsors crew. Tickets for that room will be at 30$, including a free drink. We will have a good amount of seatings in the EG GM Lair. With this ticket you will have access to all 3 rooms. Food will be available in a good quantity, but maybe not enough to fill you up for the entire day. Again, it'll be Fruits, dips, bites & all kinds.
Tickets for the Evil Geniuses GrandMaster Lair are SOLD OUT
Attendies. We are expecting 1000 people+ for this event. On November 20th, we're taking BarCraft & eSports to another entire level.
Food. Food/BBQ will still be available with Hot-Dogs, chips & donuts. We will also have coleslaw, ketchup, mustard & relish. We won't be out of stock this time, really didn't know what to expect last time ! You guys were hungry !
Pictures & Video. Professional photos & video will be done, I've rented a crane as well so the camera goes over people's head in the Main Room. Also got a better webcam so our shout out live on MLG streams look a bit more sexy.
SC2 Drinks. StarCraft Drinks Menu will be re-done, send me all suggestions, what you liked or not, Also, if you do not want ice in your drink, simply request it !
TVs. Will also have a few amounts of TVs around the venue in the corridors so you know what's going on in the venue, budget will have an effect on the quantity of those.
Hotels: We have a guy driving down from Chicago, he needed an hotel close to the club, I've a corporate deal at Novotel Hotel, it's 15 seconds away of walk from the club, and I've a price at 125$ for a 2 bedroom instead of 175$ in case any '' foreigners '' need a room, email me.

Sometimes you've just GOT to get that double-double.
Peel Regional Police tweeted a couple of photos Monday morning that not only defy logic, they appear to defy gravity.
According to police, the incident happened at Ray Lawson Boulevard and McLaughlin Road in Brampton.
Police say the driver was a father who was in a hurry to get his kids to school and decided to take a shortcut through the parking lot of a nearby strip mall.
“This is the result earlier this morning when an impatient driver sped through a parking lot,” PRP Tweeted.
“There are a lot of impatient drivers at that parking lot trust me,” one commenter responded. Drivers regularly cut through strip malls on both sides of the intersection to avoid long streetlights.
The two pillars are at least four feet tall and have been at the mall for some time. They had been erected to prevent people from parking there.
Two children were in the car at the time of the accident, but no one was injured.
Rappler compiles the moments Duterte let loose his foul mouth in 2016
Published 3:56 PM, December 10, 2016
MANILA, Philippines – One distinguishing characteristic of 2016 is, it's the first year the country experienced almost daily doses of President Rodrigo Duterte's passionate speeches.
These speeches, more often than not, were peppered with the curses and insults that are partly why Duterte has become controversial.
The Philippine leader has deployed a panoply of bad words (can you guess which is his favorite?), directed at a variety of groups and individuals, including US President Barack Obama, the European Union, Senator Leila de Lima, and even priests.
His foul mouth has elicited different responses from his audience – from embarrassed laughter to outright disgust.
Duterte must've realized the effects of his expletives because he himself joked that God threatened to take his plane down if he refused to clean his mouth.
Will the next 5 years of the Duterte presidency be just as foul-mouthed? We'll just have to wait and see. – Pia Ranada/Rappler.com
Lionel Richie's famed 1984 ballad is the centerpiece of Taco Bell's current TV ad, but it's sung as "Hola."
"It's surprising that even 20-year-olds know the song," said Taco Bell CMO Brian Niccol. "They might not know Lionel Richie, but they'll recognize the tune."
Though it seems like an odd song for Taco Bell, especially in Spanish, the ad is introducing its new Cool Ranch Doritos Locos taco, which will be available March 7, and is part of Taco Bell's largest marketing campaign to date. Using what Mr. Niccol called an iconic song translated into Spanish is the latest iteration of the chain's larger "Live Mas" campaign, which is meant to convey Taco Bell's food "not just as fuel, but food as an experience," he said.
Said Mr. Niccol: "This is one of those [songs] you get without having to understand Spanish. It adds another level of context to the brand around the experience we're providing. It's blending cultures. We're a Mexican-inspired brand and we continue to push the boundaries of what that means."
The spot, created by Interpublic's Deutsch, is the third of its kind for the chain. Taco Bell for its 60-second Super Bowl spot earlier this month used Fun.'s "We Are Young" and translated it into Spanish. Taco Bell also aired another spot, which is still running, during the pre-game for its Cantina steak burrito that featured Notorious B.I.G.'s 1995 hit "Big Poppa," which, for Taco Bell, was "Grande Papi." That spot was created by Deutsch. "These are songs that are iconic," said Mr. Niccol. "Even if they aren't familiar, the feedback we're getting is the tune connects with people. We're purposeful with music we're using."
Though Taco Bell has been using "Live Mas" for a year now, Mr. Niccol said Taco Bell has taken some insights learned from the launch of the Doritos Locos taco last year and applied it to the new launch. "The biggest learning is that this is a product that people are truly passionate about and want to have a dialogue about."
He said Taco Bell plans to have more outlets online for fans to have a dialogue, as well as more ways for them to participate in events with the brand. At this year's SXSW, for instance, Taco Bell will be working with a documentary filmmaker and Twitter -- as well as the bands Passion Pit and Wild Cat, which are part of Taco Bell's long-running "Feed the Beat" program, which provides nascent bands with $500 worth of Taco Bell food -- to produce a "consumer-generated documentary," which will be comprised of video and photos created by fans. "The idea is to get people closer to the music and experience it," said Mr. Niccol.
For the Cool Ranch taco launch, Taco Bell has also executed what it calls "speakeasies" in New York, Dallas and Los Angeles, in which the chain identified fans and "social-media influencers" and invited them to sample the product early by giving them a "secret pass code." Once fans given the pass code unlocked it, they were then prompted to spread the word via social media so that others could try the product as well. "We've learned a lot on how we can engage them sooner rather than later," said Mr. Niccol.
In 2012, Taco Bell spent more than $102 million on U.S. measured media for the Doritos Locos taco -- more than one-third of the chain's measured-media total for the year.

CORRECTION: The original version of this article stated that DraftFCB was responsible for Taco Bell's "Grand Papi" ad. In fact, Deutsch is the agency behind the spot.
Austria's nine governors. Photo: APA/Eggenberger
Austria's federal states have agreed on a common approach to dealing with the current influx of asylum seekers. At a governors' conference in Klagenfurt they approved admission quotas and the establishment of new asylum ‘distribution centres'.
The Interior Ministry will remain responsible for the initial reception of refugees. All nine states have pledged to fulfil their quotas by January 31st.
Carinthia's governor Peter Kaiser chaired the conference but did not say where or when the new distribution centres would be built. However, he did say that in future it should take no longer than 48 hours to process and house new refugees.
Burgenland will cooperate closely with Vienna, its governor Hans Niessl said.
Lower Austria's governor Erwin Pröll said that as his state is already meeting its quota, in the overcrowded Traiskirchen refugee camp, there would be no need to build further centres, but that the other states would strive to meet their targets.
Pröll said that the size of the distribution centres would depend on the size of the state. In Vorarlberg, with a population of just over 373,000, a centre for between 30 and 40 refugees would be enough.
Kaiser said that it would make sense to build a new reception centre in Tyrol, as many refugees arrive there after crossing the Italian border and Tyrol's Brenner Pass is already a known refugee route.
Styria's governor Franz Voves rejected the idea of sanctioning states which failed to meet their asylum quotas but agreed that states should be allocated a figure by the Interior Ministry.
He said he sympathised with Vienna mayor Michael Häupl's viewpoint that “the Viennese should not be treated like the nation's idiots”, as Vienna has already more than fulfilled its quota.
Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner welcomed what she said was a "historic realignment" and said that the refugee crisis would no longer be primarily borne by the centres in Traiskirchen and Thalham (in Upper Austria).
She added that in the future Traiskirchen would not accommodate more than 500 refugees - it is currently home to more than 1,600.
Austria, with 8.5 million residents, received around 17,500 asylum requests in 2013, mostly from Russia, Afghanistan and Syria, according to official statistics.

Thanks for being an amazing community and showing support for this event!
- Yvan, Darren, Colin, Alex and Ruan, your BSidesVancouver organizing team
Security B-Sides is returning to Vancouver on March 10th and 11th, 2014, and this year you have been given the chance to help make it happen!
Watch this short video to learn why Yvan and Darren worked so hard to launch BSidesVancouver last year:
This is our second year bringing this exciting, FREE, two-day information security conference to Vancouver and this year we have grown the format! In addition to the single-track of speakers we will also host registration for a set of free and low-cost (think cost-recovery for electronic parts, not profit margin!) workshops.
The speakers, workshops and ideas shared will provide the opportunity for security enthusiasts of all levels of skill and experience to learn new techniques, understand emerging threats and collaborate on opportunities to tackle these challenges as a community!
One of the key objectives is to create a low cost, sponsor funded, vendor neutral environment to share ideas and information that is useful and valuable to security enthusiasts. Don't take our word for it, look at the dozens of events happening all over the world!
By funding BSidesVancouver you will receive two benefits: the knowledge that your support of this event helps keep it free and accessible to students and the community, and a reward that recognizes your contribution!
See members of the Vancouver Information Security Community describe what they expect at BSidesVancouver 2014:
If it's free, why are you selling tickets?
Most free technical conferences are marketing events. In exchange for speaker slots, access to attendee lists, and other fun things, vendors hand over bags of money. At a Security B-Sides event the organizers try to find a balance by protecting attendees privacy, giving users control over how vendors get their information, and only permitting speaker slots that are technically relevant. The trade off is that it is very, very hard to find sponsors! In order to make this event awesome and enable community access (comparable security conferences can cost up to $1200 per ticket), we wanted to give the community the opportunity to fund the event and reduce the amount of influence vendors have.
If you want a free ticket, then by all means, register for free (ticket registration opens on January 27th), but if you really want to help us make this a community event that is by the community and for the community, you have the opportunity to help us out!
What should you expect?
Our Call for Papers and Workshops are still open, but we will start to reveal some of those talks over the coming weeks as we finalize details! If you want to see the types of talks we had last year, please take a look at the BSidesVancouver 2013 page!
Some things we are thrilled to announce:
One of our keynote speakers this year will be Mark Curphey of SourceClear, with his talk "Jack-3: Autonomous Developer Hacking Drone"
Drones being what all the cool kids do these days, we are pleased to announce our first approved workshop: "Build and fly your own quadrocopter!", led by Ruan Müller (This workshop has a $175 fee for hardware, but you get to keep your drone!)
We are in talks to announce a CTF/Bughunt at our event! (more to come!)
In addition to the technical talks, last year we had a social room featuring an impromptu lock picking camp, folks from the Vancouver Hack Space demonstrating 3D printing and talking about HAM radio, and many games of Munchkin. A big part of conferences is the social aspect, meeting new people, networking, etc. Having games and activities helps smooth introductions and facilitates conversation and interaction, especially for people who are new to the scene, or don't know anyone at the event. Since the social room was a hit, so we are expanding it!
In the works:
More Munchkin! (and other games)
An official lock-picking camp!
More Vancouver HackSpace folks! (with moar MACHINES!)
Lightning talks and hackathons!
How do we know you can do this?
This isn't our first rodeo :)
We launched BSidesVancouver in 2013, and ran a two-day event for 80 people (we had more than 80 people!) with refreshments, lunch, t-shirts, programs and badges. The total cost was $6,700. This year we aim to do the same for at least 200 people, with workshops!
A special note: BSidesVancouver is a part of the larger Security B-Sides community. If we somehow manage to raise more money via crowd-funding than is needed to help out with BSidesVancouver, we will run a survey and allocate additional funds to future Security B-Sides events, either locally, or in other regions based on feedback from individuals who fund this event!
[Author's Note: This is a satirical piece meant to (hopefully) give you a couple of cheap laughs, considering that games 1 and 2 didn't go particularly well for the Grizzlies. As far as I know, there are no secret underground chambers below the Alamo, though you can never be one hundred percent certain about these things. #Illuminati #StayWoke]
Bill Miller Bar-B-Q is an institution in San Antonio. It began as a poultry and egg business in 1950, before eventually evolving into a friend chicken restaurant, a burger joint, and then, finally, a barbecue restaurant. It's done, to put it mildly, quite nicely. The restaurant now boasts 69 super nice locations in Texas, and you can hardly turn a corner in San Antonio without seeing one of their trademark, orange-lettered signs.
Today, I've found myself at one of the locations in downtown San Antonio, at the corner of Pecan and St. Mary's, inside a squat, nondescript brick building. It's not much to look at from the outside, but inside, the simple wooden tables and rustic decorations make for a cozy, if somewhat kitschy, atmosphere, and the smell drifting from the ovens permeates the entire restaurant.
At two-thirty on a mid-April Monday afternoon, it's quiet apart from the clatter echoing from the back of a dishwasher making their way through the lunch rush's cutlery casualties. A handful of customers are scattered throughout the main dining room, lost in conversation or their phone screens or the food in front of them. Everyone's too busy to spare so much as a second glance at the man seated across from me, the one clad in the purple hound's-tooth suit. No one stops to wonder if maybe the face beneath the brim of a feather-accented fedora looks a little bit too much like Tim Duncan to be coincidence.
After all, who would ever think to find the man who accepted his 2002 MVP award in baggy denim shorts and a t-shirt dressed so extravagantly. If it were really Duncan, he'd certainly be in something much more mundane: khakis and a polo bought at a 40% off sale at the GAP; blue jeans and a pearl snap; cargo shorts and plain t-shirt.
But that's what makes the choice of clothing so perfect. Duncan is hiding in plain sight. Inconspicuously conspicuous.
The food here is served cafeteria style, and Duncan and I have already taken our trays bearing barbecue platters — as fundamental a meal as you can get at Bill Miller — to a table in a back corner. Duncan is munching quietly on his potato salad and glancing around the room, at the SMOKE HOUSE sign near the order line, at the cactus-obscured license plate hanging on the wall, at the one bulb in the center of the ceiling that's burned out.
I've just started to wonder if he's forgotten about my presence when he says, around a mouthful of brisket, “I wish I'd come here more often. I like it here. Not too expensive. It's simple.”
He glances at his watch, and I ask him about his flight. “Not for a few hours,” he says, dismissing the question with a wave of his hand. “I'm going straight to the airport from here. Bags and passport are already in the car. Nah, we've got plenty of time.”
I leave the answer at that. I don't need to ask why he's leaving. That much is obvious. As soon as he reveals what he's already promised to tell me, he'll have to leave the country. When the public finds out, there will be hell to pay, and, as he told me over the phone, he's just too tired to deal with those burns. He never asked for this, he said.
Duncan doesn't speak again until his plate's been cleared of brisket and potato salad and only a few picked-over strands of coleslaw remain. Pushing his plate to the side and his hat to the back of his head, Duncan leads forward. “You probably already guessed this,” Duncan says in a voice as quiet as his suit is loud, “but like everything else here in San Antonio, it all centers around the Alamo.”
In all likelihood, the Battle of the Alamo is the most famous in Texas history. During the war that would eventually lead to Texas' independence, Mexican troops, led by President General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, led a thirteen day siege to the mission-turned-Texas-garrison in the heart of San Antonio de Bexar. All told, there were about 250 Texians (as the residents of Mexico-controlled Texas were called) in the site. The Mexican army numbered over seven times that.
In the early morning hours of March 6th, 1836, the Mexican forces led their final assault. With ladders and crowbars and sheer force of numbers, they scaled the walls into the grounds. The Texians fought back valiantly, firing whatever metal they could find from their cannons, swinging empty rifles into crowds. They repulsed the initial two attacks.
But eventually, the size of the Mexican army won out. One hour of bloody battle later, every Texian — outside of women and children — lay dead. Mexico had won, but not without cost. Historians estimate that Mexico lost close to 600 soldiers, a full third of their forces.
Today, all that remains of the historic battle site are the chapel and the Long Barracks, which has been turned into a museum commemorating the battle. Visitors can walk through the halls and look through the encased artifacts. And there's plenty to be found: letters; polished weapons; paintings; miscellaneous relics of the era.
And, according to Duncan, something else.
“There's a door,” he tells me. “It sort of blends into the wall, and it's buried behind displays anyway, so if you don't know what you're looking for, you'll never find it.”
I try to ask him which wall, which room, which display, but Duncan just shakes his head each time. “I told you, it's too hard to explain. I've got a drawing,” he pats his breast pocket, “that I'll give you when we're done. For now, it's not about where the door is that's important. It's where it leads.”
Behind the door there's a stairwell, Duncan explains. It's pitch black inside, so you'll have to take a lamp or a flashlight or a torch to light the way. The stairway winds like a corkscrew into the earth below the chapel, coming to a halt in a cave, he says, “like nothing you'll ever find on this earth.”
“The cave sort of has its own glow. Like, there's this weird, greenish light coming from nowhere and everywhere at once. There's an 1824 flag and a long-bladed knife that everyone just assumes was Jim Bowie's hanging on the wall. And, in the center of the room, there's this pool.”
I ask Duncan what he means by “pool,” and he pauses for a moment, considering his words. “Do you like Batman?”
“Yeah,” I say, caught slightly off guard. “Why?”
“You're familiar with the Lazarus Pit, then?”
There's a moment of silence, and I wait for Duncan to tell me that he's joking, but he never flinches. He's dead serious.
“So you're telling me the Spurs dynasty,” I say slowly, “was built on a real-life version of the secret weapon for Batman nemesis, Ra's al Ghul?”
Duncan chuckles. “I thought you wouldn't believe me. That's why I brought this.”
From within another pocket, Duncan pulls out two vials. One, which he quickly empties onto the table, holds a dead bug. The second holds a few drops of green liquid that, even in the light of the restaurant, glows a radioactive green.
Duncan first proves to me that the bug his dead. Using his fork, he pokes, prods, and all but dissects the bug. Then, pulling the stopper from the second vial, he pours one drop onto the corpse.
Seconds later, Duncan is forced to smash the bug to bits to keep it from scurrying off the table. As he cleans the entrails with a napkin, Duncan winks at me. “Believe me now?”
I ask if he knows where the pool came from. Did it fuel the men who died boldly attempting the impossible task of defending San Antonio's mission, or did it come afterward, the result of some physical manifestation and coalescence of their fighting spirit?
Duncan shrugs. “I couldn't tell you. It's sort of the chicken and egg debate, I think. The only one who really knows anything about it is Pop. And he never told us anything more than what we had to know.”
The ritual has been the same every year since Duncan joined the Spurs. Before the season starts, the entire team journeys down to the Alamo in the late hours of the night. Popovich has a key, specially gifted to him by the Mayor of the city, and together they trek down the stairs to the cave. Then, one-by-one, they climb into the pool to submerge themselves in the substance.
The result is a team that's been a competitor longer than any other franchise in the NBA by miles. The Atlanta Hawks hold the second longest streak of consecutive playoff appearances at ten seasons. The Spurs' streak is two times that.
“There's one thing I still don't understand, though,” I say. “If you could just keep going back to be reborn every year, why ever stop?”
“Even that doesn't last forever,” says Duncan. “Your body can only take so much before the pool starts to eat away at it. And it's different for every player. For Manu, it went after his hair. For me,” he reaches behind him to touch his back, “it came for the flesh.”
“So the cyborg tattoo…”
“Is just there to cover it up, yeah.” Duncan grimaces. “My last two seasons in the league, I couldn't even step into the pool. The pain was too great. If I'd tried to stay in, there's a chance I wouldn't even be standing here now.”
“”What about the guys who leave?” I ask. “Why hasn't anyone else talked?”
“Pop knows how to keep guys quiet,” Duncan says. “He knows the art of negotiating as well as he knows X's and O's. Whatever makes you tick, Pop knows how to get at it just so to keep you quiet.
“To be honest,” he adds, “we all thought George [Hill] was gonna talk when we traded him. But Pop knew him, too.” He shakes his head, almost disbelieving. “Pop knows everyone.”
“Except for you.”
Duncan wiggles his shoulders in a sort of half-shrug, and in that moment, I realize how tired he looks, the dark circles below his eyes, the heavy slump to his shoulders beneath the wool jacket and silk shirt. “I just think it's not right,” he says. “I spent my career doing what I thought was right. I held this secret because I thought I was doing what was right for the team. But now…I just think everyone deserves to know.”
And at that moment, the weight lifts. Duncan has spent the last hour or so fidgeting nervously with his diamond cufflinks, fingering the lapels of his jacket. Now, finally cleared of his charge, he's turned into a completely different person, and in that instance, he dons something even more unexpected than his suit: a smile.
We spend the next few minutes chatting, talking about what's gone on this season without him and his plans for the future, plans that involve being a long way away from here and all of the fallout from what will surely be a national scandal.
In a lull in the conversation, I get up to grab a refill from the drink machine and ask Duncan if he wants anything. He reaches into his wallet, pulls out five, and hands it to me. “I could go for something sweet,” he says. “Grab me a piece of pecan pie.”
Before I can turn for the counter, he stops me. “Oh,” he adds, “remember the la mode.”
