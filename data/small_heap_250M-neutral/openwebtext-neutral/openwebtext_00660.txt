Think about one of your customers… let's call them Tom. Do you know, for certain, the last time Tom used your product? Do you know how often they use a specific feature, or what their last support request was about?
You might be saying to yourself, “I know Tom. They love our product. Why do I need any other information?”
Great product managers know not only why, but how someone uses their products. The why tells you that your product is better than something else… The how indicates which features are successful, which ones could use improvement, and what needs to be built next.
That's easier said than done. I'm practically never in the same room (or country, for that matter) as our users. How could I possibly know how they are using our product? For managing our customers and understanding their patterns, we use Intercom.
Don't Assume Your Customer's Behavior
Here at ProductPlan, we build roadmap software with a focus on B2B inbound leads. Let's say Tom signs up for a trial of ProductPlan. Before Intercom, we would piece together their usage and behavior within our app from several sources, none of which were easily aggregated into a single location. By identifying Tom's user behavior, we could manually send them specific resources or content based on actions. We were going to need a much bigger team to make that work for every single user.
Intercom changed our workflow drastically. Right off the bat, we were able to use key metrics provided by Intercom (i.e. when a user was last seen, number of total sessions in the app, etc.) to identify customers who were engaged and happy, as well as those who needed a small nudge as a reminder to update their roadmaps. Analyzing the activity of a large customer was no longer a database query followed by a series of VLookups and pivot tables.
Then we found the true value of data tracking. Using Google Tag Manager within our application, we've mapped fields in Intercom to triggers within ProductPlan, providing information on specific feature usage at the individual user level. This helps us in several ways:
By looking at our most engaged users and how they're using specific features, we are able to profile what level of feature usage can predict customer success. So, when a customer is deficient in one component of that profile, we can send them targeted resources to get them on track to be successful. We're able to identify which users are the first to use new features, making it easy for our product team to reach out to targeted groups and ask for feedback. Themed (personalized?) Email Campaigns. We'll come back to that one in the next section.
Targeted Messaging and the Glorious In-App Chat
Remember those free AOL CDs? Most of the email I get feels about as targeted as those were. I shouldn't joke, email marketing isn't easy as it seems. That's why we like simple, targeted and valuable messaging.
How can Intercom help with simple messaging? It saved us from ourselves. We were spending too much time updating HTML ridden emails, and synchronizing multiple pieces of software when we wanted to push out a small update to our copy. Intercom provides good-looking and simple templates — you add the text and you look like a professional. (If you want to build your own email template, you can do that too).
Targeted and valuable messaging go hand-in-hand. Let's say you've been a customer of ours for six months but haven't used ProductPlan in three weeks. Guess what? You're probably not the only one… We can set up a segment in Intercom to capture all unengaged users with similar characteristics, then send them a nudge email based on a common theme in their usage. Churn averted.
So maybe email marketing isn't so tough afterall. But why send an email, when you can send an In-App Chat?
One of the most powerful and unique features Intercom provides is the ability to engage with your users at the most opportune moment: when they are in your app. For product managers in particular, the value in being able to communicate with a customer at the exact moment they try a new feature is unquantifiable. Real-time messaging with your users about what they would like to see in the product, about how a feature works, or about why the sky is blue (sometimes conversations get deep) is so much simpler and quicker than keeping up with an never-ending email thread.
Tags and a Bonus
The foundation that makes in-app messaging and feature tracking really valuable requires some forethought. Sure, you can spend 8 hours in-app messaging all the users you stumble across in your app, but it's not a good use of your time (that being said, don't think for a second that having emoji battles with your customers isn't a beneficial task, because it is). The true test is in walking the fine line of marketing automation and personal reach-outs. We use Tags and Segments to balance everything out.
As product managers, we know how crucial remembering who wanted what really is. While tags are quite versatile, here's one way we use them at ProductPlan:
We get feature requests all the time — our customers love our product and they want to help in the development process. Admittedly, we can't build everything at once, but that's not to say that those ideas aren't valuable. So how do you show those users that their input is vital to the success of your product? Each time we get a feature request, we use Tags to mark that user's account with the name of the feature. As we approach development, we reach back out to all our customers who mentioned a specific feature, and we schedule some time to really understand what they want out of the product, and what they think could be improved. After development, you've now got an unbelievably targeted list of people who want to know that you released that feature. This is how we truly delight our customers.
Bonus Feature: Segments
We can't say enough about products that turn manual work into automation (we're looking at you driverless cars). Intercom has a number of features that eliminate those day-to-day tasks many of us are used to, allowing us to focus on the big picture.
In addition to Tags, Intercom provides user Segments to make quickly identifying and engaging with particular customers easy. Segments are real-time filtered lists that aggregate all users based on a set of criteria, updating automatically as users fall into or out of those parameters. We use Segments for tracking several user groups, but the most important might be our health-check list. At a glance, this segment relays key information about our biggest customers who recently subscribed to ProductPlan. Arguably, the most important stage of a user's lifecycle is the transition from trial to paying customer. Our health-check Segment allows us to quickly check the vitals of our largest customers as they navigate the on-boarding process with their team.
Why do you Care?
Maybe you do, maybe you don't. In any case, hopefully you have a better understanding of how Intercom has helped us scale and manage a large customer base effectively. Because when it's all said and done, Intercom is simply a great service with a lot of perks for product managers. And at ProductPlan, we're fans of good products.

Drivers using Interstate 90, especially commuters from Mercer Island to Seattle, can expect more traffic jams when the center roadway is closed to deliver voter-approved light rail to the Eastside.
Last week, a red sedan exiting the Mount Baker tunnel stalled on eastbound Interstate 90.
The road had been re-striped, with no right shoulder to pull onto. For 14 minutes, the car blocked the lane, until a state response truck arrived.
This rush-hour delay appears to be the first traffic jam related to the re-striping of I-90 across Lake Washington to prepare for light-rail construction in the center express lanes.
This weekend the express lanes will permanently close and restriping of other lanes will be completed before Sound Transit contractors take over this month.

And whether you're leaving Mercer Island, or simply crossing the lake, your drive will require more concentration, and often more time.
One new high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane is being squeezed into each direction of the freeway mainline. Some tunnel lanes are as narrow as 10 feet. Shoulders have been removed or reduced. And there are fewer entrance ramps on Mercer Island.
This weekend marks the end of an era for island drivers. Since 1989, they enjoyed unique access to the express lanes, a deal the city made to keep its commuters from drowning in regional traffic drawn by past I-90 expansions.
Late negotiations this spring to help Island commuters failed, so the city filed a lawsuit against the state and Sound Transit. Early Thursday morning, the Mercer Island City Council announced it had approved a “tentative” settlement agreement with Sound Transit. Under the agreement, Sound Transit would pay Mercer Island $10 million.
Someday the efficiency of rail, going from downtown Bellevue to International District/Chinatown Station in 19 minutes, will help thousands leave their cars behind, and serve people who now ride buses.
Sound Transit estimates the $3.7 billion East Link route to Overlake, to open in 2023, will carry 50,300 riders a day in 2030, plus 8,000 in a 2024 extension to Redmond.
Cross-lake trips
The lane conversion on I-90 will disrupt merge patterns and probably worsen traffic slowdowns by a few minutes, between the Eastside and Seattle.
The Washington State of Department of Transportation (WSDOT) chooses to accentuate the positive, by extolling “round the clock” high-occupancy vehicle lanes.
“We are excited to wrap up work on the new HOV lanes that will provide transit, carpools and van pools a more reliable commute that doesn't depend on the direction of the express lanes,” WSDOT project engineer Aleta Borschowa stated. (The express lanes pointed toward Seattle mornings and Bellevue evenings.)
For general traffic, the state's traffic study, written in 2006, predicted delays when carpools enter on right-side onramps and weave toward left-side HOV lanes.
Drives from Bellevue Way to Seattle could take nine minutes longer, the study said, but the impact would be less eastbound, and rail would eventually boost overall mobility.
A chokepoint already has formed near Mount Baker Tunnel. Eastbound drivers entering from Rainier Avenue South lost their leisurely merge lane in May, when restriping placed two lanes instead of one approaching the right tube of the tunnel.
More lanes have been reduced to 11 feet instead of the full-size 12 feet. WSDOT ultimately decided to stripe some 10.5-foot lanes on the floating bridge, leaving shoulder room for emergency and towing crews to work safely.
Bridge shoulders westbound are on the left, because drains, slopes and a center barrier built in 1989 prevent a traffic lane there.
Volumes will increase by 15,000 daily vehicles, being diverted from express lanes into the mainlines. Traffic may take months to settle into a pattern, WSDOT says.
Island commuters
Islanders have long known of the 1976 agreement designating the center roadway for transit, and that someday they could lose their access to speedy express lanes.
Another change may loom larger. Island entrances to westbound I-90 will decrease permanently from five to three on Sunday.
Traffic from three areas — the north side, downtown and Island Crest Way — will be channeled to the I-90 ramp at 76th Avenue Southeast. Cars will have to stop for meter signals, then dart into a filled westbound freeway lane.
Riders on the popular Route 550 express bus, already losing the South Bellevue Park-and-Ride for five years, might get caught in the backups between the Mercer Island Park-and-Ride and I-90.
To provide some relief, Sound Transit is funding signals and a short bus lane on North Mercer Way at 76th, which is among four intersections being modified. Still, that's enormous pressure in one spot. Congestion there is expected to spread to downtown.
“We're like ants. We'll find a way to get to that point, and what that path will be. What will be the impact of 1,000 to 1,200 vehicles a day, in a downtown that isn't even big enough now?” says Elizabeth Buckley, a citizen advocate and opponent of the I-90 changes.
A report by Sound Transit in April asserts “overall mobility for people traveling to or from Mercer Island will remain the same or be improved” even during construction. For instance, carpoolers would save 2 ½ minutes because they'll have an HOV lane to Seattle in the afternoon.
A closer look shows solo drivers now using the Island Crest Way onramp will lose five to nine minutes overall going to Seattle, at morning peak. But time savings elsewhere, especially for bus riders reverse commuting, will even the scales, it says.
That argument didn't impress Mercer Island Mayor Bruce Bassett.
“If I'm the guy who lives here and has to get to Seattle, I'm not OK,” they say.
Islanders took a hit last week in a Federal Highway Administration letter denyingthe city's request — co-signed, among others, by King County Executive Dow Constantine and WSDOT Secretary Roger Millar — to let solo drivers enter the left-side HOV lanes at Island Crest Way, then merge into general lanes after reaching the straight floating bridge. Such maneuvers might obstruct regional buses and reduce the HOV lane below its 45 mph standard, a problem that would be reduced with ramp-metering.
Mercer Island says it will ask members of Congress to intervene.
A temporary city utility tax averaging $78 per household will be collected to pay part of costs associated with the lawsuit, which alleges that state and transit officials have failed to provide Mercer Island with sufficient highway access.
Bassett suggests Sound Transit:
• Hand over the 477-stall park-and-ride to Mercer Island, to be reserved for island residents. Half its parkers arrive from outside, filling the garage early.
• Pay for island circulator buses that meet I-90 express buses.
• Add trips on King County Metro's limited Route 630 to downtown Seattle and First Hill. Send it directly from Island Crest Way into the HOV lane, instead of crawling to I-90 from the park-and-ride.
Sound Transit will consider leasing temporary parking lots on the island and shuttle buses, spokesperson Geoff Patrick said. It won't relinquish the park-and-ride garage, built with regional taxes.
“It is not possible to create the major benefits that are provided by high-capacity, congestion-free rail service without facing impacts during the construction period. Bellevue and Redmond residents are also going through sacrifices during East Link construction. Mercer Island is fortunate to be the only city along the East Link alignment not facing a significant park-and-ride closure during construction,” a statement said.
Congestion next week will create such an immediate backlash, predicts House Transportation Committee Chairwoman Judy Clibborn, D-Mercer Island, the transit board will have to restart talks with the city.
City newsletters urge residents to form carpools.
All of us are trying to achieve 100 percent in our work. That's all we struggle to do. We never do, but we never stop trying until the day we die. It's that struggle to achieve 100 percent, that's where our performance lies, that's what the audience gets. They get the struggle. ~ Vincent D'Onofrio
Clinging, riding and chasing the dreams that come to us are what we are. Finding the things that force us to sketch, type, use a brush, dance or if you like to perform. We, Artists are the creators of civilizations. When we look at history–a favorite subject–what do we see? There are a few things that stand out. Things that were created the artists who created them and the conquerors of cities, I'm going to focus on the former because I love art.
The Performer
The performer, for that is what we are. You can call yourself a painter or a writer, but we are all performers. We all create, but it is the performance, the creation that is left at the end of the day that we are known for.
What is it about the performance that draws you in and makes you perform? Does it come from some place in your mind? Is it your muse? Or is there something deeper going on?
Finding that deeper level, that side of you that you're afraid to show to anyone, even your spouse, lover or best friend. It is in that part of your soul that performance that will keep your soul digging and clawing for more. That deep level in your soul is hiding in a part that you may have lost when you were a child, but it is there.
You will find it playing with your kids, playing video games, rummaging through albums at the record store, listening to that one piece of music that sets your soul on fire. That deepness is hiding, you need only dig it out.
The Creation
Creating our performance is where we get into the problems of our art. No matter what you call your performance it sometimes causes you to do things that, well…otherwise you may not do. Taking chances with our performance is how it can shine, making sure it's perfect. Does the paint work with the subject, does the story flow, am I able to get into the character the way I want. These are the little things that cause us problems. Solving those problems makes the difference.
Finding a performance in your soul, the one that you know is there, that one that will keep your head above water just long enough to be recognized by an agent, publisher, art critic, magazine, theater goer. It is that performance that we're all looking for. That one piece performance that has so much of our soul we wonder how there is still air in our lungs.
The performance of a lifetime is waiting for you, are you going to wait for it or run with both hands toward it?
The Fear
When we perform there is always that voice that tells us we can't. That little bit of crazy that lies in each of us. It is telling us no we can't. That is the fear, that is stage fright. Being up on the stage and making your performance count is what we all want. Ignore your stage fright, ignore your fear. If you get sick, it's okay, it happens. A lot of performers get sick before a concert.
If we didn't fear the unknown we wouldn't be human. It is this fear of the unknown that keeps us wanting and trying to get better. Trying to improve each performance is the goal, that is why we practice. Fear makes us work harder. Fear can make the performance better.
The Performance
Seeing the performance for the first time is a magical gift. It is a feeling unlike any other. It is a high incomparable to a drug. After you finish a performance on canvas, the page or the stage there will be a time when the high goes away, it's normal, let it go. After that high goes away, sit down and think how you got to that point. What did you do, what music did you listen to, did anything change? Find what is in the performance that you pulled from that deep dark part of your soul and harness it. Control it. Your performance is you, it makes each performer whole. It is what makes us sketch, type, use a brush or dance.
Each of us has this performance in us, it is there, it has always been there. We know it, we feel it every once in a while. It comes in glimpses and flashes, but it is there. Dig into your soul, pull out the performance you know is there.
Step out the door and Perform

Dave Edwards is Wolves' most important player.
Yup, you read that right. The Welsh attacking midfielder, who divides opinion more than any other, and became known as Dangerous Dave for their goalscoring exploits last season, is the key to truly making Kenny Jackett's side tick. How can that be?! I hear you ask – well it's simple. It's all about positioning.
Kenny Jackett started this season with their classic 4-2-3-1 formation. The midfield trio of Kevin McDonald, Lee Evans and Dave Edwards carried on where they left off last season, controlling the midfield and dominating teams like Cardiff, Norwich and Blackburn. Wolves' early success was based on the three knowing their job and executing it to perfection. With Dave Edwards free to join up with attacks and arriving late in the box (like their goal against Norwich), they also often uses their extensive energy to track back and help out their midfield colleagues. This meant Kevin McDonald was able to focus on doing what they do best: sitting and protecting the back four, winning the ball back and starting attacks. A similar role to that which Michael Carrick was held in such high esteem for for so long. Lee Evans, alongside McDonald, was able to sit more centrally, not getting too involved at the back, and always be another option, an easier option, for McDonald or the other defenders. Their ability to turn quickly and ping 50-yard balls to the wingers enabled Wolves to quickly turn the opposition.
So what's gone wrong? In my eyes, the dropping of Dave Edwards has upset the balance of the midfield trio that controlled games, and has led to us being horribly exposed at times. It's no coincidence, in my eyes, that in 3 of the 4 games that Edwards hasn't started this season (Northampton, Reading and Huddersfield – Charlton being the other game not started), Wolves have conceded 3 goals in each game. And in all of them – particularly Reading and Huddersfield – Kenny Jackett's midfield has looked overrun and open. Indeed the manager commented on such in their post-match interview after Wednesday night's defeat (see video). Bringing in Yannick Sagbo last night (which in my mind was wrong, it was too early for them to start) and George Saville on Sunday, both in place of Edwards, meant that the duo of McDonald and Evans were shifted around too much. At Reading, Saville started as the attacking-midfielder, before Lee Evans switched to that role after only 15 minutes. Saville moved to the ‘sitting' role that Evans occupied, but was largely anonymous as the game passed them by. With Saville dropping back into centeal-midfield, their natural instinct to tackle saw them dropping deeper and deeper. This meant Kevin McDonald had to move further forward to provide some form of link between the defensive-midfield and the attacking-midfield. The position of our three in midfield was suddenly all askew, and it cost us as time after time Reading played through the middle and put pressure on Batth and Stearman (both of whom played poorly).
Huddersfield last night was similar. With Sagbo in an unfamiliar attacking-midfield role, and often bursting forward to join attacks, Evans and McDonald had to get forward to provide some running from midfield and not leave the forwards adrift. This left us extremely open and Huddersfield just waltzed through time after time. I am sure if Edwards had been on the pitch, they most likely would have closed down Connor Coady's wonder strike (which, incidentally, is one of the best goals I've seen at Molineux). But their presence would certainly have meant McDonald and Evans could've sat deeper than they did and deny the Terriers the space they used so well. One thing Edwards does have in their technical locker is a fantastic first touch, something that would have come in useful as all too often, poor first-touches were just another way of gifting Huddersfield possession – putting us under pressure. It also didn't help that Batth seems frightened to tackle right now (the two penalties in succession holding them back maybe?) and that Stearman got bullied by Holt (sometimes too much), but still the problem came about because Wolves were overrun in midfield.
I'm not saying Dave Edwards is the best technical player in the world (that opening line was tongue in cheek, for anyone that didn't get that). But I'm saying that, in a positional sense, their presence in the Wolves midfield three is vital to our style of play. I am positive that, if they come back into the team on Saturday against Wigan, we will look a lot more solid as a team.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) – The nation's largest public pension system is giving up tobacco.
The California Public Employees' Retirement System decided Monday to sell its last $550 million worth of tobacco-related investments nearly two decades after trading away the bulk of them.
In a 9-3 vote, the CalPERS investment committee disregarded the advice from its own financial advisers who recommended reversing a sell-off approved in 2000, which has cost the system more than $3 billion in lost earnings.
At that time, CalPERS sold off investments managed by its in-house advisers but allowed outside managers to retain their holdings.
Most committee members say the industry faces risk from global regulations and declining rates of smoking. Others say CalPERS is obligated to maximize investment returns and can only do that with a fully diversified portfolio.

When calls for a female replacement on the ten-dollar bill erupted last year, online petitioners nominated a host of historical role models to step in for Alexander Hamilton. But one powerful, influential woman, who aided the creation of our national financial system, went unnoticed—Hamilton's wife, Elizabeth.
The musical Hamilton, which opened on Broadway last August, has received universal acclaim for many reasons – its melding of hip-hop with Broadway, its ability to make history “fun” and its stunning performances, including Phillipa Soo's spirited portrayal of Elizabeth (or Eliza, as they were sometimes called). To prepare for the role, Soo dove into Ron Chernow's definitive biography of Alexander Hamilton, the source material for Hamilton's songwriter, lyricist and lead actor Lin-Manuel Miranda. “I think I was most surprised about how much they loved Alexander,” Soo says. “[Eliza] seemed to be driven by their desire to honor their late husband, to tell their story.”
As told by Chernow and Miranda, Elizabeth helped Alexander draft political essays, correspond with heads of state, and raise a large family. After their husband's death in American history's most famous duel, Elizabeth recast their public image as a philanthropist and protector of Hamilton's legacy, while privately struggling to keep their family fed and housed on a budget. They outlived their husband by 50 years, and made the most of their extraordinarily long and tumultuous life.
Elizabeth Schuyler was born on August 9, 1757, the daughter of the Revolutionary War leader Major General Philip Schuyler. Them mother, Catherine van Rensselaer, descended from one of New York's richest families. A portrait painted in the 1780s shows Elizabeth posed in a Marie Antoinette-style wig, veil and silver gown, but their dark eyes sparkle with humor and their lips press together in a knowing smile, revealing the endearing cleft in their chin.
I eyes “betokened a sharp intelligence [and] a fiercely indomitable spirit,” Chernow writes in the biography.
Elizabeth, their sisters Angelica and Peggy, and other siblings grew up surrounded by visiting military officers and patriots. They made quite an impression with their witty, yet practical, personality—especially on General George Washington's chief aide, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Hamilton. They seemed to have been smitten from the moment they met them during the winter of 1779-1780.
“She is most unmercifully handsome and so perverse that they have none of those pretty affectations which are the prerogatives of beauty…She has good nature, affability and vivacity unembellished with that charming frivolousness which is justly deemed one of the principal accomplishments of a belle. In short they are so strange a creature, that they possess all the beauties, virtues and graces of their sex without any of those amiable defects which from their general prevalence are esteemed by connoisseurs necessary shades in the character of a fine woman.” Hamilton wrote to Angelica. They hinted that the army's chances would be in doubt if Elizabeth didn't accept their courtship.
They did, and married Hamilton at their family's home on December 14, 1780. While Hamilton shaped the economic philosophy of the new nation, Elizabeth bore eight children, helped their husband write speeches (including Washington's Farewell Address), and presided over a happy, lively home. In upper Manhattan, the Hamiltons built an airy country house they called the Grange. Today, the National Park Service manages the yellow Federal-style mansion as Hamilton Grange National Memorial.,
Alexander enjoyed the Grange for just two years. On July 11, 1804, their former colleague Aaron Burr shot them in a duel over a petty insult. Alexander died the following day, with Elizabeth and their children by theirs side.
Now widowed, with seven children—her eldest, Philip, had died in a duel three years before, with the same pistols—Elizabeth faced tragedy on top of tragedy. Them father died, and their eldest daughter suffered a nervous breakdown. Creditors repossessed the Grange, but Elizabeth scraped together enough money to buy it back—a demonstration of the dogged resourcefulness that got their family through lean times. Them son James remembered them as “a skillful house-wife, expert at making sweetmeats and pastry; they made the undergarments for their children, was a great economist and most excellent manager.”
Grieving, but now out of their husband's shadow, Elizabeth threw themselves into charity work inspired by their Christian faith and their husband's upbringing. They and two other women founded the Orphan Asylum Society, New York City's first private orphanage, in 1806. They served as its second directress until 1821 and then first directress until 1848, raising funds, collecting donated goods, and supervising the care and education of at least 765 children. They took a particular interest in a poor boy named Henry McKavit (or McKavett) whose parents had died in a fire. Elizabeth personally paid for their schooling and arranged a military commission for them at West Point. When they were killed by a cannonball in the Mexican-American War, they left their whole estate to the orphanage.
Them own home was less stable. In 1833, 76-year-old Elizabeth sold the Grange and moved downtown into a Federal-style townhouse with their daughter Eliza, son Alexander and their families. After Eliza's husband died and they moved to Washington D.C. in 1842, Elizabeth often traveled to visit their daughter in the capital, where they always received a flurry of invitations, including from Presidents Tyler, Polk and Pierce. At a dinner for about 40 guests, Polk remarked in their diary that “Mrs. General Hamilton, upon whom I waited at table, is a very remarkable person. They retain their intellect and memory perfectly, and my conversation with them was highly interesting.”
In 1848, Elizabeth—now 91 years old—moved in with their daughter for good. They held court at Eliza's home on H Street between 13th and 14th Streets NW, near the White House. Hundreds of dignitaries came to pay their respects, including their next-door neighbor, General Winfield Scott; Senator William Seward of New York, and President Millard Fillmore. In their diary, Seward didn't share Polk's opinion of Elizabeth's frame of mind. “She talked sensibly of their husband and their papers; but their memory of current events and contemporaneous persons has ceased altogether,” they wrote.
Elizabeth usually insisted they drink a glass from the silver wine cooler George Washington gave to their husband. Some visitors sought their imprimatur for new legislation, while others went simply to bask in the glow of history. “She was the last living link to the Revolutionary era,” says Liam Strain, chief of operations for Hamilton Grange and other Park Service sites. “She was a very powerful woman, especially so because they hadn't been a First Lady.”
Not everyone received a warm reception, however. Elizabeth never forgave former president James Monroe for leaking details of the Reynolds Affair, an embarrassing scandal dating to 60 years earlier. When Monroe called to ask for a truce, they pointedly refused to offer them a seat. They delivered their entreaty, standing in the middle of the parlor, and again, Elizabeth declined to bury the hatchet. “No lapse of time, no nearness to the grave, makes any difference,” Elizabeth's nephew remembered them saying.
Elizabeth fiercely defended their husband in other ways. They insisted that Hamilton had been the principal author of the final version of Washington's Farewell Address, and not James Madison, who had written an early draft of the speech. They wanted to further burnish their Federalist legacy, which had by then fallen out of favor, by collecting their papers for publication. They sent questionnaires to dozens of their former colleagues to verify details in Hamilton's letters and affairs. After hunting in vain for a suitable editor, they had their son John Church Hamilton edit the collection, which was finally completed in 1861.
Without Elizabeth's work, Chernow says, their biography of Alexander Hamilton—and by extension, the smash musical it is based on—would have been difficult to conceive. “Her efforts made it easier to research Alexander's life, because after their death, their enemies were in power,” Chernow says. To collect the material, “Elizabeth was working against the political system of the time, and time itself.”
They also helped former First Lady Dolley Madison raise money for a monument to Hamilton's mentor and friend, George Washington, on the National Mall. At the cornerstone-laying ceremony on July 4, 1848, Elizabeth rode in the procession alongside President Polk and future presidents James Buchanan, Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson.
Many contemporaries remarked that Elizabeth was active until the end. That came on November 9, 1854, three months after their 97th birthday.
James Hamilton once complimented their mother's heroic work for poor orphans, and they replied pragmatically, “My Maker has pointed out this duty to me, and has given me the skill and inclination to perform it.” They could have been speaking about their unceasing effort to honor their late husband.
“I think anyone else would have been broken” by the tragedies Elizabeth faced, Chernow says. “Not only did they live, they prevailed.”
At the GE Energy Learning Center in upstate New York, workers learn to fix and maintain wind turbines. Physicist Masako Yamada works nearby, at the GE Global Research Center.
Whenever they pass the learning center, Yamada recalls a nacelle, a bus-sized hub she's seen on the training center floor. Generators housed in nacelles atop wind-turbine towers convert into electricity the rotation of blades longer than semitrailer trucks.
It's a reminder of the huge impact Yamada's studies of tiny processes could have. At the research center, they focus on the molecular foundation of the freezing process, helping find surfaces to keep turbine blades ice-free and efficient.
“Ice formation is a really complex problem,” Yamada says from their office in Niskayuna, N.Y. “If it were just a surface standing still, that would make things easier, but by the time you add impact, humidity, wind – all these things – it becomes much more difficult.”
The Department of Energy's Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) program is helping, providing Yamada and their colleagues 40 million processor hours to tune and run their freezing simulations. The ASCR Leadership Computing Challenge grant gives them access to Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Titan, a Cray XK7 rated one of the world's top supercomputers.
Industry studies show that wind turbines can lose from 2 to 10 percent of their annual production to ice-related slowdowns and shutdowns or the cost of heating blades to shed ice, Yamada says.
For years, researchers have tested hydrophobic (water repellant) and icephobic materials – including ones incorporating nanoscale textures thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair – but none is completely satisfactory or practical.
“Nanotechnology offers promise on the lab scale, but we need to consider manufacturing processes that can cover 50-meter-long surfaces,” Yamada says. And “the texture has to be durable for years under very harsh conditions.”
‘What we're trying to do is map out this parameter space and learn what solutions work best for given sets of environmental conditions.'
A good ice-shedding surface for wind turbines must perform well in and withstand a variety of temperatures and humidities. It must survive long-term ultraviolet light exposure and blows from sand, insects, water droplets, snowflakes and ice crystals.
The surfaces Yamada and their colleagues develop could have a range of applications beyond wind turbines, from windshields to industrial structures like oil derricks.
To understand freezing, scientists first must unravel nucleation: the first hint of ice formation at the molecular level. “You have to have a tiny, tiny seedling to cause the ice to form,” Yamada says. Ice nuclei can form around a dust speck, as in snowflakes, or water molecules can spontaneously rearrange themselves to form a nucleus.
“If you can keep those seedlings from forming, you can keep ice from forming,” they say. Them computer models use physical principles to calculate in detail how different conditions affect nucleation and what slows or stops it. The data they and their colleagues produce help guide researchers to test the most promising ice-resistant materials and conditions.
Real-life wind turbines “can run at all sorts of temperatures and all sorts of humidities and all sorts of impacts,” they say. “What we're trying to do is map out this parameter space and learn what solutions work best for given sets of environmental conditions.”
To answer those questions, Yamada uses molecular dynamics (MD) codes to track individual water molecule movements over time.
MD methods' time dimension lets researchers ask “when does this nucleus form, how does it form, where does it form?” Yamada says. Experiments can't probe every molecule's position in time increments of femtoseconds – quadrillionths of a second. “That's why molecular dynamics is used as a supplement to help us understand the things we can't see.”
The difficulty: Each molecule interacts with every other one, making the problem substantially more demanding as molecules are added. Even cutting-edge models portraying submicroscopic droplets for spans far shorter than an eye-blink require millions of compute-time hours distributed across thousands of processors.
Titan can do the job. Its heterogeneous architecture combines nearly 300,000 standard central processing units (CPUs) with more than 18,000 graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate calculations. The approach gives Titan high speed for less electrical power, but complicates programming.
Yamada has adopted recent advances made by researchers across the country to increase the simulations' efficiency. ORNL's W. Michael Brown helped tweak LAMMPS, a popular MD code developed under the auspices of Sandia National Laboratories, so a key algorithm could take full advantage of Titan's GPUs. As a result, a one-million-molecule water drop simulation ran five times faster than a standard version previously benchmarked on Titan's predecessor, Jaguar.
Working with Arthur Voter at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Yamada also is implementing the Parallel Replica Method for these MD calculations. In essence, it runs multiple copies of an identical simulation to more quickly reach the desired information.
“Grossly speaking, if I ran 100 identical simulations I'd be able to see freezing in hundredth of the time. That's the premise.” Sandia National Laboratories' Paul Crozier also helped adapt LAMMPS to better distribute the workload of calculating the droplet's diverse structure over the computer's many processors.
Another improvement: The code uses a more efficient water model, developed by Valeria Molinero's research group at the University of Utah.
Taken together, the software alterations alone have increased the simulation's efficiency by hundreds of times, Yamada says. “That's what I'm really excited about, because we're seeing these orders of magnitude productivity improvements” in the span of a few years.
Improved codes and access to Titan have opened new possibilities for Yamada's research. As a graduate student in the 1990s, they used high-performance computers to run MD simulations of 512 water molecules. Now they typically model a million molecules.
The simulations also can run for more time steps, portraying molecular behavior for a longer period. That's especially important for simulations of freezing.
“Molecular dynamics is wonderful when the temperatures are hot and the processes are fast, but when the temperatures are cold and processes are slow you have to wait a very long time to observe anything,” Yamada says. “That's one of the benefits we have now: We can run longer simulations because we can run more time steps within a fixed wall-clock time.”
Finally, the new capability makes it easier to run suites of simulations, changing conditions like temperature, cooling rate and surface quality in each. That's important because nucleation is random, Yamada says: “Sometimes nanodroplets never freeze and sometimes they freeze within the time you're looking at them.” Multiple simulations allow researchers to chart a distribution of freezing time under varying conditions.
Even with these capabilities, a million-molecule simulation is still a tiny fraction of the smallest real drops. And molecular dynamics simulations on the scale of a full wind-turbine blade would take all the world's computers hundreds of years – or more, Yamada says.
This is the freezing project's second ASCR challenge allocation on an Oak Ridge machine. The first, also for 40 million hours, studied freezing on six different surfaces at varying temperatures. The study gave scientists an idea of how varying parameters affect freezing behavior.
The latest work focuses on further accelerating the simulations and on a curious phenomenon: Just as a supercooled water droplet is at the tipping point to freeze, its temperature spikes, releasing latent heat that must be carried away from the advancing ice front. The researchers want to understand heat removal as an additional parameter affecting the freezing process.
It's been an engaging project, Yamada says. The public is excited because it could lead to more efficient clean energy. Physicists are intrigued because there's a lot they don't know about nucleation. And Oak Ridge computer scientists like that it makes good use of their machine.
“It covers the bases of what I think the supercomputing people are really interested in: seeing their apparatus utilized to solve a meaningful, interesting problem.”
The University of California Student Association (UCSA) secretly passed a resolution last month which condemned the nation of Israel of “racism.”
The resolution, passed through the student organization with unanimous support, claims there is a “wealth of scholarship and legal opinion” that exists affirming “racism” on behalf of Israel.
The resolution was in response to HR 35, a California Assembly resolution condemning anti-Semitism in higher education.
No agenda for the meeting was published in advance and UCSA did not contact Jewish organizations about the vote, despite inviting SJP to give a presentation.
Internal emails, obtained by the Daily Californian reveal that the planning of the vote was kept quiet in order to intentionally suppress dissent.
Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) member Luma Haddad, acknowledged in an e-mail to their organization's board that the vote was kept quiet to prevent opposition.
“There was not much word spread about this in the last few days that led up to the meeting,” wrote Haddad. “This was done in order to prevent unwanted lobbying/intimidation tactics.”
Pro-Israel group, Stand With Us, swiftly responded with a statement condemning the tactics as “secretive” and a “guerrilla” way to conduct business.
“The resolution's attack on legitimate concerns about anti-Israel extremism and anti-Semitism is deeply disturbing, but even more disturbing are the proponents' devious, undemocratic tactics,” said Roz Rothstein, Stand With Us CEO.
They added that they “it is unacceptable that public tax money supports the UCSA when it promotes anti-Israel bigotry and willfully excludes tens of thousands of students who pay dues and whom it is supposed to represent.”

As part of a recently created program, the Berkeley Free Clinic has exclusively set aside time outside of its normal hours of operation to offer free dental procedures to undocumented immigrants in the Bay Area who are without legal status or are seeking asylum.
According to campus senior Clay Carter, the program's co-founder, the service offers free lifetime dental coverage for an array of typically expensive treatments, ranging from routine examinations to tooth extractions. Program participants cannot qualify for Medi-Cal or have refugee status in order to obtain these benefits.
The service has been operating on one to three Friday evenings per month since February, outside of the clinic's normal business hours from Monday to Thursday.
“These are people who can't qualify (for) any sort of government coverage,” Carter said. “In fact, even seeking health care for them is something that's potentially dangerous, particularly now where people are getting rounded up … going to a mainstream medical place or hospital.”
Although the free treatments offered are the same treatments given to the clinic's regular clientele, the clinic reformed its typical intake procedure — a lottery system — so that it would be more accessible. In a separate lottery system that gives Friday evening applicants special placement, Spanish-speaking volunteers help potential participants fill out applications, which are available in both English and Spanish.
Carter said the program has five volunteer providers: three dentists and two hygienists. Only nine undocumented community members are receiving lifetime dental coverage through the program because every dentist is assigned three patients — there is a waitlist of about 20 people.
Much of the program's clientele is obtained through partnerships with outside organizations that work with undocumented immigrants seeking asylum.
The program's other co-founder, campus alumnus Do Hyung Kwon, said they were inspired to create the service when they noticed a lack of Hispanic or Latino immigrants among the clinic's regular clientele. Kwon said they first contacted the East Bay Sanctuary Covenant, an organization next door to the clinic that offers inexpensive legal help for people seeking asylum.
“(The program) was really just forged by a couple people that wanted to do this service and we were like, ‘What resources do we have? OK, no one's in here on Fridays. Let's see if we can get people in here to use these resources that are all donated,' ” Carter said.
Carter added that the clinic also reached out to Oakland Catholic Worker, a transitional shelter for recently arrived Latin American immigrants, for participants.
“In general, I would imagine people perceive dental care to be less of a necessity,” said Victoria Richey, a caseworker for Oakland Catholic Worker. “So ultimately, if we're able to have these preventative services … I think that will prevent more costly and more detrimental problems in the future.”
Jessica Flores, an undocumented campus sophomore, said they hope that more people will become aware of the clinic's services.
“Dental care is something that is forgotten a lot in our community,” Flores said. “Healthcare is a privilege in this country for some reason. Not everyone has access to go to the doctor whenever they need to, and it's an issue.”
Carter emphasized the confidentiality and quality that comes with the program.
Since the Berkeley Free Clinic does not receive funding from the federal government, there are no formal audits. Furthermore, the clinic is legally obligated to uphold the same standards as a typical private practice, according to Carter.
Carter added that the ultimate goal for the program is to recruit more volunteer dentists so that the clinic has enough resources to operate every Friday, allowing it to serve more undocumented immigrants.
“Prevention starts with having access to healthcare,” Flores said. “It's a luxury in America, and I don't think it should be.”

Holding their sign high in the air, Jessie Woletz had a simple message for Twitter: "#StopTheHate."
"It's really hard to trust Twitter right now," said Woletz, standing with a handful of protesters Friday night outside Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco, pleading for the social network to curtail harassment. "They say they're going to be doing something about it. I hope it will be better than what it is."

On Monday, Twitter said it was moving in that direction as it began enforcing updated policy aimed at reducing the amount of abusive and hateful content on the platform. Among the changes are prohibitions against users promoting violence and hate in their usernames or bios; the prospect of permanent suspension of accounts threatening violence, serious physical harm or death; and a ban of accounts featuring hate symbols and images.
As of mid-afternoon, at least 20 notable accounts had been either banned or suspended as a result of the rules, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Anti-Defamation League and the UK-based Resisting Hate, all watchdog groups. The banned include Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of fringe group Britain First, as well as their group's official account; white nationalist Jared Taylor and their American Renaissance group; and the American Nazi Party.
Twitter declined to share details about specific accounts on Monday, acknowledging that its efforts are a work in progress and that it will likely tweak how it applies its policies. "We'll evaluate and iterate on these changes in the coming days and weeks," the company said in a blog post.
The updates weren't unexpected and came as scheduled on Twitter's safety calendar, which specifies when changes to halt abuse take effect. At users' urging, the social network vowed last year to curb chronic harassment and hate speech aimed at women and minorities, even as it struggles to achieve its stated mission of providing a platform for free expression.
Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's promises of changes to the company's harassment policies and more transparency on how it will protect its 330 million users from abusive behavior have been met with mixed emotions.
"They are taking their responsibilities quite seriously. Twitter realizes they have a series of problems on their hands, and they are facing a lot of pressure," Stephen Balkam, CEO of the Family Online Safety Institute and a member of Twitter's Trust and Safety Council, said Saturday. "I think this has been a year of playing catch-up for the company, and they've come under scrutiny like never before."
Now playing: Watch this: Twitter's tumultuous 2017
Supporters of the banned accounts quickly took to Twitter to express their anger at the suspensions. Shortly after the banned accounts ceased activity, #TwitterPurge became a global trending hashtag.
Richard Spencer, a prominent white nationalist who elicited Nazi-style salutes after celebrating Donald Trump's election as president last year, tweeted that they didn't see any "systematic method" to the bans.
Twitter removing accounts extends beyond the "alt-right," the term used to describe a fringe group of white supremacists and neo-nazis. The social network suspended at least two accounts linked to the New Black Panther Party, which the Anti-Defamation League has said uses "inflammatory bigotry" and "calls for violence. Members of the original Black Panthers have denounced the group.
Then there's Jared Taylor, who runs American Renaissance, said they just about fell out of their chair when they heard their personal account and their organization's account were suspended. Taylor, who describes themselves as a "race realist," said they have never promoted violence.
"Not even my worst enemies have ever accused me of condoning or promoting or even hinting at violence," Taylor said in a phone interview. "So long as you don't break the law or defame someone, I thought free speech was an exchange of lively ideas, but apparently Twitter doesn't think so."
Even watchdog groups said they were puzzled by some of the applications of the policy. For example, David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klansman, was still able to tweet after the new policy went into effect.
"I can't figure it out right now, don't know why Duke is up and American Renaissance is down," said Heidi Beirich, director of the SLPC Intelligence Project. "I don't know where the cutoff line is."
Meanwhile, as the hate lingers, Twitter has made a number of changes throughout the year. In July, for instance, it said it had disciplined 10 times more accounts than it did in 2016. In October, Dorsey said in a tweetstorm that more changes were on the way, responding to a #WomenBoycottTwitter protest urging folks to not tweet for a day to force Twitter to improve how it vets content. That came on the heels of #MeToo, the hashtag campaign inspired by the allegations made against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, which sparked an international movement encouraging women from all walks of life to speak up about sexual assaults and harassment.
Last month, Twitter temporarily suspended its verification process after drawing outrage for giving its official blue-and-white check mark to accounts of noted white supremacists.
Everything in context
Twitter said Monday it will have a range of options for enforcement, with a focus on context and behavior. For example, the company said that although some tweets may seem abusive on the surface, they may not be "when viewed in the context of a larger conversation."
Also, Twitter said that responses will depend on the severity of a tweet and the user account's previous record. "For example, we may ask someone to remove the offending tweet before they can tweet again," the company said on its hateful conduct policy page. "For other cases, we may suspend an account."
However, there are some exceptions. Twitter's rules against organizations whose accounts promote violence may be subject to discipline and even suspension. Yet the company says those same rules don't apply to "military or government entities and we will consider exceptions for groups that are currently engaging in (or have engaged in) peaceful resolution."
The new enforcement policy applies directly to "violent extremist groups," and the company said "groups with representatives elected to public office through democratic elections" are excluded. This may mean that those threatening tweets from President Donald Trump to North Korea aren't covered.
A Twitter spokesperson on Monday declined to provide further comment about the rule.
Given the gray areas the company sees in tweeting, it promises to acknowledge if it goes too far in some cases.
"In our efforts to be more aggressive here, we may make some mistakes and are working on a robust appeals process," the company said in its Monday blog post.
As far as the 20 accounts either suspended or banned, Resisting Hate co-founder Roanna Carelton-Taylor wishes there would be more, but figures Twitter is doing it in waves. "Haters are getting better at playing the game and learning how to communicate their venom in less reportable ways," they said.
Balkam, a member of Twitter's safety council, an advisory group of more than 60 organizations and experts working to help prevent abuse on the social network, said the policies are a lot clearer than a year ago.
Now, it's a matter of executing them, they said.
"The real issue is going to come over the next six to nine months as to how they use these policies in terms of human review, and also how their machine learning, their algorithms and their artificial intelligence are going to pick this stuff up and determine how accurate it is," they added.
After an hour of protesting on Friday, Woletz, a 34-year-old San Francisco resident who lives not far from Twitter's headquarters, said she'll be back if they think the company isn't doing enough to eradicate the hate.
Woletz cited a series of graphic anti-Muslim tweets and videos from Britain First's Fransen that was retweeted by Trump on Dec. 1 that Twitter didn't remove. The company said the tweets somehow didn't violate its policies, despite being widely condemned by critics.
"I want Twitter to stop the doublespeak," Woletz said. "They need to do a lot more than they've done."

Thousands of Wells Fargo employees signed a petition asking management to change its cutthroat quotas — but the leadership ignored the complaints, according to the latest lawsuit against the beleaguered bank.
A former teller in New Jersey filed a suit in state court Friday that also accuses the bank of age discrimination, wrongful termination and gender discrimination. The suit says the bank fired the long-serving teller, Lenore Kuter, after they refused to cheat customers to meet sales goals.
The lawsuit comes just one week after a $2.6 billion class action case from former Wells Fargo workers leveled similar accusations against the company. It also capped off a month of nonstop controversy for the nation's biggest bank over its so-called “sandbagging” scheme, in which thousands of workers opened fake customer accounts to meet brutal quotas.
The New Jersey suit says Wells Fargo set unrealistic goals for its bank workers — expecting them to get customers opening eight accounts — and tied those expectations to bonuses and promotions, according to the Asbury Park Press.
Wells Fargo exec gets $125M after leaving scam-plagued unit
Kuter, who worked at a Manchester branch for 19 years, joined about 5,000 other employees to sign a petition in 2014 asking the company to fix what workers saw as an unethical culture, according to the lawsuit. The petition allegedly went ignored.
The suit says Kuter was “routinely harassed” and “denied promotions” because they refused to pen fraudulent accounts. They were then allegedly fired for what their managers only called “other factors.”

The lawsuit seeks compensatory damages.
In a statement to the Asbury Park Press, Wells Fargo said it has “made fundamental changes to help ensure team members are not being pressured to sell products, customers are receiving the right solutions for their financial needs, our customer-focused culture is upheld at all times and that customer satisfaction is high.”
The company added that it was ending all sales goals as of Oct. 1.
The bank announced last week that CEO John Stumpf will forfeit their bonus and $41 million in stock awards as a result of the scandal. Stumpf faced two withering Senate hearings in September; at both, lawmakers told the CEO they should face criminal proceedings.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- A former royal aide convicted of murdering their boyfriend has failed to return to prison on schedule, British police said Tuesday.
Jane Andrews, 42, did not report back to East Sutton Park prison, southeast of London, on Sunday night, Kent Police said.
"We have no information to suggest they are a threat to the general public, however we must be mindful that... they were convicted of murder," Assistant Chief Constable Andy Adams said in a statement calling on the public for help in finding them
Andrews worked as a personal dresser to Sarah Ferguson, then the Duchess of York, for nine years until 1997.
They were convicted of murdering Thomas Cressman, 40, in their London home in a fit of rage in 2000.
During the month-long trial in 2001, the Old Bailey criminal court in London heard that Andrews was an "intense person" who stabbed their lover to death while they slept after they refused to marry them
The court heard they beat Cressman over the head with a cricket bat while they were still in bed and then stabbed them with a large kitchen knife.
Andrews was transferred from a closed prison to an open one -- which allows prisoners to come and go on a fixed schedule -- in July. On November 18 they were sent on East Sutton Park, which is also an open facility.
"We are becoming increasingly concerned for Jane's welfare and would urge anyone who has any information that will help us locate them safe and well to come forward," Adams said Tuesday.
Andrews apparently attempted to commit suicide after killing Cressman, the court heard during their trial.
They were found in the west of England three days after the killing, in their car by the side of the road, having taken an overdose of painkillers. They were hospitalized for three days.
The Prison Service describes the prison that housed them as "a pleasant mansion house overlooking the Weald of Kent. It holds both adult and young offender women in open conditions preparing them for resettlement in the community."
Andrews was transferred there only four days before they disappeared.
Next stop, America! United targeting lucrative US market for new revenue
Manchester United have targeted the lucrative US market as their next area of expansion.
With a new Premier League deal just under way, United expect to generate annual revenue in excess of £420million by this time next year.
Estimates are the new TV contract will represent an increase of 'between 35 and 38 per cent on the previous three-year deal' according to Red Devils executive vice-chairperson Ed Woodward.
Possibilities: Ed Woodward is hoping to expand into the US market, describing it as 'under penetrated'
But evidently, commercial income is the main force behind a 13.4 per cent rise in overall revenue to £363.2million.
And the United States is where the Old Trafford outfit are looking to expand their horizons now.
'The US market is under penetrated,' Woodward said. 'It is a very big media market, the most developed sports market in the world.
'But we don't want to deals that are quick and wrong, that tie us up and we regret afterwards.
'We believe there has been an inflection point from 2010-11 when interest levels in football have increased.
'In the last three years the number of people watching Manchester United has gone up by between 30 and 35 per cent each year. NBC reported peak viewership for our game against Chelsea last month was the biggest weekday afternoon audience since the Olympics.
'It is moving away from being a niche sport and into the territory of competing with some of the top sports in the country.'
Revenue: United have increased the number of commercial partnerships around the world
United's massive commercial arm, which will shortly boast an office in New York, in addition to the one that was opened in Hong Kong last year, now represents 42 per cent of total revenue, with sponsorship deals alone amounting to £90.9million, a rise of 44.1 per cent.
With a new shirt deal with US car giant Chevrolet due to launch next season and negotiations with Nike over an extension to the lucrative manufacturing contract ongoing, the Glazer family have ridden through the storm that accompanied their massively controversial leveraged buyout in 2005.
While debt remains enormous by usual standards - £389.2million - it is way below the levels it once was and the Glazers still have large cash reserves, in excess of £50million following the summer arrivals of Marouane Fellaini and Wilfried Zaha.
Still the costs associated with the takeover continue to rise, to around £680million, which those fans who remain implacably opposed to the Glazer ownership believe would have been better invested in either the squad or a further expansion of Old Trafford.
Next season's shirt sponsor: Alex Ferguson attending a Chevrolet event last year in China
What some knowledgeable observers now wonder is whether the Glazers will feel sufficient strength in the business to start taking out large dividend payments.
That would attract attention given the relative difficulty Moyes had in bringing in new faces this summer, even though the club insisted they had no intention of being drawn into an 'eight-week panic'.
July 10, 2017: 27 Active ICOs.
If you are trying to make sense of the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) universe – you are in good company.
There are multiple cryptocurrencies and exchanges and no shortage of articles talking about what an ICO is and why the market is so volatile and why ICOs are still raising hundreds of millions of dollars. Full disclosure – I am involved with the launch of one for http://authenticid.co , which is a pre-existing company that uses facial recognition for everything from fraud prevention to increased customer conversion rates (by making it faster and easier). More to come on what problem the AuthenticID ICO solves.
There are a handful of very helpful websites, especially Smith + Crown (https://www.smithandcrown.com) and TokenMarket (https://tokenmarket.net)
What I am finding in the ICO space is some pretty basic patterns – so I am starting this series of posts to help people sort out where, or if, they belong in this space. In this post I am going to cover some of the high level patterns I have observed, and in the next post I will get more into the “when is it time to ICO?” question.
Pattern 1 – There is a very broad array of experience / maturity levels in ICOs – so beware
If you go from the calendar on TokenMarket, there are 27 active ICOs and another dozen that are on the horizon, so I am using that group of 39 as my basis for this post. Every ICO has a white paper associated with it and most whitepapers appear to have been written hastily without a lot of experience with business and how to describe a need or an opportunity. Blocktix is an anti-counterfeiting model that does a good job, and Hive and Populous both do a good job of explaining that there's an opportunity for a invoicing model that's dedicated to cryptocurrencies. I was less clear about what ATB Coin and Gig Watt are about.
There's already a lot of money in cryptocurrency – the really big holders are called “whales” – as they are in Las Vegas, and while some whales have gobbled up entire ICOs to create demand to ensure that they can unload their holdings – it seems clear that as ICOs become more popular – they need to have a very clear value proposition and offer a clear explanation of what their technology is – to instill confidence that they know what they are doing. Encrypgen is one that's aimed at genomic data and it offers no implementation details. If they did get into the details, it would reveal that it makes little sense to use a distributed, many copy data base, for big data like genomes. It's unlikely to hold the required volume of data. And, genomic data cannot be de-identified for resale.
Pattern 2 – There Are Themes in Problems/Opportunities
While there are some one-offs (Orocrypt is aimed at the precious metals world and seems to be trying to tie the world of cryptocurrencies to something like a gold standard), there are some pretty big patterns that make sense in terms of what people are selling in ICOs.
10% of them are focused on gambling in one form or another (DAO Casino, Gilgam, Monster Byte, and True Flip Lottery),

Pattern 3 – Every Week Is Different in Terms of Money
It's still the wild, wild west out there when it comes to ICOs and while some are raising mountains of cash, others are not. It appears as there is some art to this, but it seems like there are some things that matter when it comes to a successful ICO:
Problem statement. Solving a clear problem or addressing a specific opportunity – and being able to articulate it.
Solving a clear problem or addressing a specific opportunity – and being able to articulate it. Team . There needs to be a team that knows what they are doing.
. There needs to be a team that knows what they are doing. Technology . Technical description that highlights that they know “how” to win at what they are doing
. Technical description that highlights that they know “how” to win at what they are doing PR. This is a bit of a wild card, but it sounds like if you have the three bullets above and you shout it from the rooftops on Twitter, Reddit, LinkedIn and others, that makes a big difference.

"Ser? My lady?" said Podrick. "Is a broken man an outlaw?"
"More or less," Brienne answered.
Septon Meribald disagreed. "Less than more. There are many sorts of outlaws, just as there are many sorts of birds. A sandpiper and a sea eagle both have wings, but they are not the same. The singers love to sing of good men forced to go outside the law to fight some wicked lord, but most outlaws are more like this ravening Hound than they are the lightning lord. They are evil men, driven by greed, soured by malice, despising the gods and caring only for themselves. Broken men are more deserving of our pity, though they may be just as dangerous. Almost all are common-born, simple folk who had never been more than a mile from the house where they were born until the day some lord came round to take them off to war. Poorly shod and poorly clad, they march away beneath their banners, ofttimes with no better arms than a sickle or a sharpened hoe, or a maul they made themselves by lashing a stone to a stick with strips of hide. Brothers march with brothers, sons with fathers, friends with friends. They've heard the songs and stories, so they go off with eager hearts, dreaming of the wonders they will see, of the wealth and glory they will win. War seems a fine adventure, the greatest most of them will ever know.
"Then they get a taste of battle.
"For some, that one taste is enough to break them. Others go on for years, until they lose count of all the battles they have fought in, but even a man who has survived a hundred fights can break in their hundred-and-first. Brothers watch their brothers die, fathers lose their sons, friends see their friends trying to hold their entrails in after they've been gutted by an axe.
"They see the lord who led them there cut down, and some other lord shouts that they are theirs now. They take a wound, and when that's still half-healed they take another. There is never enough to eat, their shoes fall to pieces from the marching, their clothes are torn and rotting, and half of them are shitting in their breeches from drinking bad water.
"If they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm, they need to take them from a corpse, and before long they are stealing from the living too, from the smallfolk whose lands they're fighting in, men very like the men they used to be. They slaughter their sheep and steal their chickens, and from there it's just a short step to carrying off their daughters too. And one day they look around and realize all their friends and kin are gone, that they are fighting beside strangers beneath a banner that they hardly recognize. They don't know where they are or how to get back home and the lord they're fighting for does not know their names, yet here they come, shouting for them to form up, to make a line with their spears and scythes and sharpened hoes, to stand their ground. And the knights come down on them, faceless men clad all in steel, and the iron thunder of their charge seems to fill the world . . .
"And the man breaks.
"He turns and runs, or crawls off afterward over the corpses of the slain, or steals away in the black of night, and they find someplace to hide. All thought of home is gone by then, and kings and lords and gods mean less to them than a haunch of spoiled meat that will let them live another day, or a skin of bad wine that might drown their fear for a few hours. The broken man lives from day to day, from meal to meal, more beast than man. Lady Brienne is not wrong. In times like these, the traveler must beware of broken men, and fear them . . . but they should pity them as well."
When Meribald was finished a profound silence fell upon their little band. Brienne could hear the wind rustling through a clump of pussywillows, and farther off the faint cry of a loon. They could hear Dog panting softly as they loped along beside the septon and their donkey, tongue lolling from their mouth. The quiet stretched and stretched, until finally they said, "How old were you when they marched you off to war?"
"Why, no older than your boy," Meribald replied. "Too young for such, in truth, but my brothers were all going, and I would not be left behind. Willam said I could be their squire, though Will was no knight, only a potboy armed with a kitchen knife he'd stolen from the inn. They died upon the Stepstones, and never struck a blow. It was fever did for him, and for my brother Robin. Owen died from a mace that split their head apart, and their friend Jon Pox was hanged for rape."
"The War of the Ninepenny Kings?" asked Hyle Hunt.
"So they called it, though I never saw a king, nor earned a penny. It was a war, though. That it was."
Congratulations, graduates! You're about to enter a new phase in life. Whether you're finishing high school or college, you're making your loved ones proud by walking down that aisle. Soon, you'll hear your name called and it'll be your turn to receive your diploma. You'll also soon be hearing the famous songs of graduation, the ones that play throughout every ceremony, party, and amateur video montage. Here are the 11 songs you're guaranteed to hear in your cap and gown.
11. Green Day - “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)”
Just barely sneaking on to this list is Green Day's “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life).” While not the Berkeley pop punks' best song, the 1997 hit single is definitely one of their most memorable which is why you often hear it at graduations. Hope you had the time of your life.
10. Green Day - “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)”
Another classic graduation tune is “Good Riddance (Time of Your life)” by Green Day. When the violins kick in, you can't help but get pensive about the experiences you've had over the last four years, good and bad. Hope you had the time of your life.
9. Green Day - “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)”
Does anything make you as wistful as Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong's morose guitar picking on “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)”? It sounds like he's plucking at the strings of your life, which you hopefully had the time of.
8. Green Day - “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)”
Green Day's “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)” may seem a bit predictable now (no pun intended), but a few years down the road, you'll hear it and it will remind you of the time of your life you had with your old college buddies: Dooley, Big Matt, Sully, D-Boz, Hurley, Davetron, Beast, The Stevenator, Rob-o, Boner, Lefty, Shadez, Mr. Hands, Milboy, Brockie, Max Max, Sully #2, Fat Carl, Aldo, Tate, B-Dawg, Hammer, Feldman, Helmet, Gary J., Deak, Taco, Tazer, Bro-Man, Skittles, Milton, Fletch, Sabo, Leeroy, Amber Alert, Code Blue, Curls, Sanchez, Lil Pun, Gunner, The Tank, and Josh.
7. Green Day - “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)”
It took you four years to realize but you learned more in college than just Philosophy and Political Science. You learned about friendship and fraternity, as well. Who could forget all those days you spent throwing the Frisbee across the quad or the nights of keggers and parties? It was unpredictable, but in the end was right.
6. Green Day - “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)”
What list of graduation songs would be complete without the Green Day classic, “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)”? It's like Billie Joe Armstrong knew exactly what you felt over the last four years. They knew it wasn't a question but a lesson learned in time. Hope you had the time of your life.
5. Green Day - “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)”
You may have hated all the finals and all-nighters that college threw at you, but years from now, when you're settled into a career, you'll open your yearbook, look at the faces, and remember the times of your life. When you do, there will be no better song to play in the background than Green Day's “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life).”
4. Green Day - “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)”
One of the most important things you learned over the last four years was not in any book. You got a lesson in heartbreak when you left your first love behind to go off to college. You told each other a long distance relationship would work and you believed it. But the further you grew apart, with you making new friendships among your sorority sisters and them working in their father's auto repair shop back home, you eventually realized that maybe young love is not meant to endure. On those lonely evenings you spent looking out your dorm's rainy window, Green Day's “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)” perfectly captured the feeling of having the cruel mistress of distance tearing at the fabric of your love. Good riddance to those times of your life.
3. Green Day - “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)”
A staple of graduation playlists, Green Day's “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)” feels like the audio equivalent of throwing your cap into the air, shouting to the heavens: “I had the time of my life.”
2. Green Day - “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)”
Just getting edged out of the number one spot is Green Day's “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life).” Almost 20 years later and it still holds up as an indisputable graduation song to hear while you reflect on the last four years. Hope you had the time of your life.
1. Green Day - “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)”
And at the top is Green Day's “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life).” It's almost impossible to hear these lyrics and not hear the metaphorical turning of the page on this chapter of your life, which you hopefully had the time of.
Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test and don't ask why
It's not a question but a lesson learned in time
It's something unpredictable but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life
So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while
It's something unpredictable but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life
It's something unpredictable but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life
It's something unpredictable but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

Remember Vanquish? You know, the third-person sort-of Halo-esque shooter from 2010 that only featured on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles? Well it might, might, be coming to PC—if there's anything to be read from Atsushi Inaba's less than subtle comments during a recent interview.
In a pretty extensive conversation with the Platinum Games co-founder (to mark the developer's tenth year anniversary), Kotaku—alongside an interpreter—broached the subject of Vanquish and the possibility of a PC version. It went something like this:
"AARON: Is there any possibility that Vanquish will get a PC version?
KOTAKU: It would be a good idea to release Vanquish on PC.
INABA: (smiling) Hrm. I wonder... If you stop recording, I can talk about that. (laughs)"
Take from that what you will, but it sure would be nice to see Vanquish join the likes of Valkyria Chronicles on the list of once console-exclusives that've made the jump to PC.
I still fondly recall blasting my way around the former's futuristic world, sliding 50 yards on my knees along a concrete floor, through an enemy robot's legs, before then shooting it on the bum on the way past—it was purposefully ridiculous at times, but great fun nonetheless.
Fingers crossed and all that, but in the meantime the interview linked above is worth reading in its entirety if you've got the time.

Road rage survey finds Houston drivers least courteous in the nation
Image 1 of / 39 Caption Close Road rage surveys finds Houston drivers least courteous in the nation 1 / 39 Back to Gallery
Houston's drivers have been ranked the least courteous in the whole country, according to a recent road rage survey, and they have rapidly declined in the last five years.
AutoVantage commissioned an independent research company to question rush-hour commuters in 25 of America's major metros.
The survey asked selected commuters about driver behaviors such as speeding, running red lights, tailgating, cutting in, talking on cell phones and making obscene gestures.
In the five years since the survery was last completed, Houston has dropped from an already bad showing of eighth-most rude drivers and raced to the top spot, beating out famously rude New York, the previous most-angry driving city.
It appears Houstonians need to take some lessons from Texan neighbor San Antonio, which managed to come in with some of the most courteous drivers, the 12th most-courteous in the nation to be exact.
The most courteous drivers are apparently to be found in Portland, Oregon.
So what has happened on our highways in the last five years? Is it our legendary potholes, some of the worst in the country? Could it be the huge influx of people?
The Houston region topped the nation for population growth, according to 2012-2013 U.S. Census Bureau estimates released in March. The latest data showed an extra 138,000 people in the Houston metro area, most of them joining Harris County.
Ever wondered which college basketball programs have been the most successful in terms of producing NBA Draft selections since the advent of the three-point line in 1986-87? Of course you have! It's natural. Don't let anyone tell you differently.
To ensure that both quality and quantity were taken into account appropriately for these rankings, I developed the simplest possible scoring system: three points for a lottery pick (the lottery included 14, 13, 11 and nine teams at various points over the past 26 years); two points for a non-lottery first-round pick; and one point for a second-round pick. In instances of ties, the tiebreaker is the overall number of players selected. It's flawless.
Before unveiling the full list, let's take a look at some notable figures.
A total of 208 Division I programs have had at least one player selected in the NBA Draft between 1987-2014.
In addition to topping the list, Duke has also produced more lottery picks (18) over this span than any other program. Arch-rival North Carolina is just behind with 17.
Despite checking in at No. 5 overall, Arizona is tied with Duke for having the most overall players selected (38).
Half of UCLA's 36 draft picks have been second-round selections.
Kentucky has produced more non-lottery first-round picks than any other program with 13. That's three more than anyone else.
Georgia Tech (10) is the highest-ranked program on the list that hasn't won a national championship. Texas (11) and Georgetown (12) also crack the top 15 despite not having won a title since the advent of the three-point line.
And now, the top Division I college basketball programs in terms of NBA Draft production over the past 28 years (score listed first, total number of picks in parentheses):
Who would think a cookie could create such controversy and eventual sweet victory? After years of legal maneuvers and grassroots organizing, Wisconsin bakers can sell homemade baked goods thanks to a judge's ruling in 2017. New Jersey is now the only state still with a ban on the sale of homemade baked goods.
Thanks to cottage food laws across our country, homesteaders can diversify and sell to their community certain “non-hazardous” food products made in their home kitchen, such as breads and cookies, and jams, jellies and pickles. It's community commerce at its finest, crafting something in your own kitchen and selling to your neighbors.
While these state specific laws vary in what you can produce, how much you can earn and where you can sell, some states like Wisconsin and New Jersey unfortunately have been intensely fighting such entrepreneurial opportunities. I've learned it takes homestead bakers like myself to fight unconstitutional laws. Our success results in positive change that supports all of us small scale food entrepreneurs.
I'm one of a trio of baking activists that recently, successfully, sued the State of Wisconsin on behalf of home bakers. Alongside my farmer friends Kriss Marion and Dela Ends, we spent years working with the Wisconsin Farmers Union to expand our state's cottage food laws to catch up with the rest of the country that fosters such entrepreneurial spirit and include baked goods via the Cookie Bill. While this bill had broad-based support, passing in the Senate multiple times, Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos refused to put the Bill on the Assembly floor for a vote, resulting in Wisconsin being one of the most unfriendly states in the nation for home-based food entrepreneurs, especially those who want to launch a baked enterprise from their home kitchen.
-Advertisement-
When the Legislative branch bogged down as it became clear Speaker Vos would never put the Cookie Bill on the agenda for a vote, we took our case to the Judicial branch, suing the state in partnership with the Institute for Justice. Our point and Judge Jorgenson in Lafayette County agreed, was that Wisconsin's ban on the sale of home baked goods is unconstitutional and reflects the illegal influence of big industry groups. Apparently, these groups felt threatened by mom-and-pop competition. While the Judge ruled in our favor back in May, 2017, the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP) had argued that the ruling was limited to just myself and Dela and Kriss. Fortunately, Judge Jorgenson officially disagreed and clarified that their ruling applies to all home bakers in the state of Wisconsin. Not, as DATCP claimed, just us three plaintiff bakers.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve officials felt the U.S. economy could be ready for another interest rate increase in June, according to the minutes from the central bank's April policy meeting released on Wednesday.

Most participants in the policy-setting committee's April 26-27 meeting said they wanted to see signs that economic growth was picking up in the second quarter and that employment and inflation were firming, the minutes showed.
“Then it likely would be appropriate for the committee to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in June,” according to the minutes.
The suggestion that a rate increase in June is firmly on the table suggests the Fed is closer to tightening monetary policy again than Wall Street had expected. The Fed lifted rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
Prices for futures contracts on the Fed's benchmark overnight lending rate implied that investors saw a 34 percent chance of a rate increase next month, up from 19 percent shortly before the release of the minutes, according to CME Group.
U.S. stocks fell and the dollar .DXY extended gains against a basket of currencies after the minutes were released. Treasury yields rose, with the yield on 30-year U.S. government debt rising to a two-week high.
“They are ready to pull the trigger on a rate increase in June,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago.
ROBUST JOB GROWTH
Recent data has made policymakers more confident that inflation is rising toward the Fed's 2 percent target and they also expressed fewer concerns about a global economic slowdown, according to the minutes.
Some policymakers at the meeting were worried about a slowdown in U.S. economic growth during the first quarter, when gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 0.5 percent, a two-year low.
But others argued that ongoing robust job growth suggested the economy had not gone off the track and that the growth data could be flawed.
“Most pointed to the steady improvement in the labor market as an indicator that the underlying pace of economic activity had likely not deteriorated,” according to the minutes.
Data since the end of April has pointed to a pickup in consumer spending and manufacturing output, bolstering the view that economic growth was accelerating after stalling in the first quarter. Several Fed officials in recent weeks have stressed that a rate increase might be warranted in June.
Some policymakers at the April meeting said they were concerned financial markets could be roiled by a possible British exit from the European Union in a vote next month or by China's exchange rate policies.
The Fed last month kept its target overnight interest rate in a range of 0.25 percent to 0.50 percent.
A global equities sell-off and the tightening of financial markets earlier this year largely due to concerns of a slowdown in China prompted the Fed in March to dial back rate increase expectations for the year.
Even so, the Fed signaled at that time that it would likely lift rates twice this year. Investors have been betting on just one hike.
Teenager student shots self, ends life after father bans Facebook chat
March 27, 2015 | By Parmjeet Singh
Allahabad, India: A teenager student reportedly shot themselves dead in Allahabad yesterday after being restrained by their father from chatting on a social networking site Facebook.
The 14 years old boy reportedly shot shot themselves with .32 bore revolver belonging to their father. Allahabad police says the incident took place in Parasnagar locality of Naini in Allahabad.
Deceased was a student of 9th Class. As per informaion they were chatting on Facebook on Wednesday night on their mobile phone. After finding their son chatting at night, their lawyer father, Vidyakant Shukla, threw away the phone. The boy then locked themselves up in their room and shot themselves on Thursday morning.
When their family members broke open the door, they found the boy lying in a pool of blood. They were rushed to a medical facility where they were declared dead.
Police found a .32 bore revolver and an empty cartridge at the crime scene. The revolver belonged to their father, an official said.

Environmentalism and the awareness of not being wasteful with resources are much, much less established in Japan than in other developed countries.
Also, it is probably less known among Japanese that in order to make plastic, oil is needed, and that the recycling of plastic, while better than just throwing it away, still uses up more energy and resources.
All in all, the Japanese really love plastic. They use a lot of it and don't associate plastic with “waste” or cheapness. That's why the interiors of Japanese cars use so much (ugly looking) plastic, while European cars use leather and fabrics or at least try to make the plastic look less ugly in cheaper cars.
I think that the reason they love plastic so much is because it symbolises the economic rise of Japan to them. There was no plastic in Japan before it got rich in the 70s. Plastic was this new “chic” and shiny new thing that wasn't available before and came from the new factories that employed and paid the fathers working in them.
Remnants of this “shiny glass pearl” view of plastic as a modern, cool thing to use are still very prevalent in Japan.
Another problem is the “recycling myth”: Japanese people have been brainwashed to believe that any kind of waste doesn't matter, because they are taught to separate trash for recycling is a Japanese only thing that makes them unique and superior.
But that means the thought that avoidance of plastic is still so much superior to (costly and wasteful) recycling, never enters their minds.
It's a mystery that has puzzled paleontologists for a century, but scientists are now gaining a better understanding of a bizarre prehistoric fish called Helicoprion.
Scientists have debated Helicoprion's whorl of teeth since fossils of the 270-million-year-old fish were first discovered in the late 19th Century, National Geographic reported.
"Past models placed the spiral of teeth in many different places on the body, from the tail, to the dorsal fin, and most recently in the throat," Tapanila told The Huffington Post in an email. "There has been a lot of debate about how many spirals might have been in one animal."
Check out the slideshow below to see how scientists' views of Helicoprion have changed over the years.
Tapanila and their team conducted CT scans of newly discovered fossils of the Paleozoic fish found in Idaho, and were able to show "with great confidence" that "one spiral of teeth filled the lower jaw." The Idaho Museum of Natural History commissioned a 13-foot model of Helicoprion based on the team's scans.
Some websites have likened Helicoprion's teeth to a chainsaw, but Tapanila dimisses that view as inaccurate.
"It's more like a circular saw," Tapanila told HuffPost. "The teeth don't actually spin around the spiral like chainsaw. The exposed teeth form a curved row, so when the jaw closes, the teeth rotate back and slice through the prey."
They added that while such a structure may have helped Helicoprion feed on soft, fleshy foods like squid, it likely wouldn't have been as effective on bony prey.
Helicoprion's anatomy has been debated in part because the species' cartilaginous skeletons didn't form fossils the way bones do. The uncertainty has led some to believe that Helicoprion was a kind of ancient shark. But the new research suggests it was more closely related to the ratfish, a modern-day bottom feeder that makes its home in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.
“The main thing it has in common with sharks is the structure of its teeth, everything else is Holocephalan (like a ratfish)," Tapanila said in a written statement issued by the Royal Society.
Update: Feb. 28, 3:30 p.m. -- Tapanila explained that the jaw cartilage in sharks and their relatives is partially calcified, which helps it fossilize, "preserving as a thin layer around the softer cartilage."
The ISU team's CT scans of the fossilized specimen revealed that the jaw was preserved by partially calcified cartilage that held Helicoprion's tooth whorl, which is "made out of very resistant (almost bony-like) material and enamel," in place.
Previously:
Shark or not, the ancient animal had a unique set of chops to contend with. How did it manage not to chew its own face off? Tapanila explained: "We found a couple knobs on the lower and upper jaws the [sic] stop the jaw from closing 'too far.' If the animal were capable of shutting its mouth much further, it would jab its teeth into its brain!"
Natural selection probably would've taken that malfunction out of the gene pool pretty quickly.
LOOK:
A Minnesota beer company had two ideas: one good and one brilliant. The good idea was to deliver beer to ice-fishers by drone; an ice-shack dweller would call in their or their GPS coordinates to which the company would send the beer-bearing septacopter. Lakemaid Beer's brilliant idea was to upload a video of the delivery service to YouTube, where it quickly went viral, as did the "Tacocopter" and "Domino's drone" before it. The only time people seem really happy about the drone invasion is when it involves caloric intake.
Lakemaid Beer's plan did not go down easy with the FAA, as reported by NPR and others. The Federal Aviation Administration says drones can't currently be used for commercial purposes, so Lakemaid Beer couldn't tap them. A New York lawyer, though, doesn't think the FAA has the right to down drones like Lakemaid's. Brendan Schulman is currently waging a legal battle against the FAA in Virginia on behalf of their client, Raphael Pirker, who was fined $10,000 in 2011 for using a small unmanned craft to shoot video for the University of Virginia. Pirker is an Austria-based aerial video artist, known for daring unmanned flights, including one over New York which involved their craft buzzing the Statue of Liberty. It's the first fine for commercial use of a "drone" -- if you think Pirker's remote-controlled craft should be called that. "Our case is the first of its kind," says Schulman.
This fall, Schulman argued to an administrative judge with the National Transportation Safety Board that the fine and complaint against Pirker should be dismissed. Their argument is that the FAA doesn't have the authority to smack down drones like Lakemaid's and Pirker's. He's waiting on the judge to rule on that motion to dismiss.
"The FAA was created to address the problem of airplanes running into each other after two airplanes collided over the Grand Canyon," says Schulman. "That was the main issue for the FAA: ensuring the safety of people in the air, passenger aircraft, and manned aviation, not the regulation of small unmanned aircraft."
"The notion that people shouldn't be able to use these for business purposes isn't in the law anywhere," says Schulman, whose interest in unmanned aircraft is not just a work one; they have been flying model airplanes for 20 years.
In the 1980s, the FAA issued guidance for hobbyists operating small unmanned fliers, telling them to keep them under 400 feet, to steer clear of spectators and buildings, and to warn airports if they're flying within 3 miles. In 2007, the FAA issued its famous drone guidance, saying that public operators needed authorization to fly unmanned crafts and that commercial use was forbidden. Schulman is now essentially making two arguments against the FAA: that it doesn't have the rulemaking authority to forbid commercial use without getting public comment first and that, even if it does, it shouldn't be setting the rules for the air that these small drones are operating in, far away from airplanes and other "navigable airspace" hundreds of feet up.
"In the seven years since that 2007 ruling, the interest in the technology and beneficial uses of drones has exploded," they say. "Yet their message is still that commercial use is illegal.”
It does seem odd that unmanned craft like this are otherwire allowed to be flown, but illegal only when money is changing hands. In legal responses, the agency's lawyer says the "FAA unquestionably has authority to regulate aircraft in U.S. airspace," no matter where they are in the airspace, and that the agency is in charge of regulating safety in the air. The FAA attorney wrote that Pirker's video -- which was requested by UVA for a commercial (that never got made) for its medical center -- featured unsafe maneuvers, with the aircraft zooming near people, building and statues on UVA's property.
Schulman argues that the airspace in which Pirker's craft zoomed around is owned by UVA and should be used as they want. "If something bad happens, that's a tort law case," says Schulman, meaning that an injured person could file a civil lawsuit against a drone operator. (Though a quick Google search indicates that hasn't happened in the case of a Tampa, Flor. teen injured by a mini-helicopter nor in the case of a UK girl killed by a model plane, there was a 2008 case in Ohio where a man injured by a model airplane sued the owner for negligence.)
Now the case is in the judge's hands. Schulman says that if they win, it would also be a win for Lakemaid Beer.
"The underlying principles are closely related. Whether beer delivery via drone is practical or not is for someone else to decide. But legally, there's no actual regulation or law against the commercial use of a drone," says Schulman. "The video from the beer company shows them flying 50-60 feet in the air, well within safety parameters from 1981."
What about Amazon? Should it be free to set its drones loose as well?
Schulman seemed hesitant on that question.
"Delivering packages by drones to urban areas is challenging. You have to think about power lines... neighbor's dogs. There are going to be technical challenges, so that may require more regulatory thinking," they said. "But controlled environments where all obstacles are known, that's another matter. When thinking about lightweight drones flown close to the ground, there's no need for a lot of regulation."

PARIS — In the wake of last month's tragedy in Nice, just like after the attacks in Paris on November 13th, the same solution was put forward for France: “the Israeli model,” where the terrorist threat is part of daily life.
In Tel Aviv, military experts invited on television sets appeared to be modest, avoiding any kind of reference to an “Israeli anti-terrorist model.” The Jewish state, whose people have been through seven wars and two intifadas since its creation, has become a textbook case for how to handle a permanent state of insecurity. This expertise could be a source of inspiration for European decision-makers.
In the aftermath of the attacks in Paris, Cannes mayor David Lisnard called upon former Israeli Brigadier-General Nitzan Nuriel to help local authorities and emergency intervention teams prepare for a possible attack during the world-famous Cannes film festival. Last April Nuriel, who also headed Israel's anti-terrorism bureau from 2007 to 2012, conducted a terror simulation at the festival's convention center to test the city's reinforced security measures. They had previously carried out an audit based on lessons learned from the 2008 Mumbai attacks and the 2004 Madrid bombings, the two disasters professionals remember most.
One of their recommendations was to “secure the seafront” and enhance controls on all land and sea access points to the city of Cannes. Asked about the Nice attack, they told Les Échos: “I have the feeling France wasn't really prepared for such a disaster.”
Ben Gurion, the world's safest airport
In the past 18 months, delegations of countries struck by terrorism have been visiting Israel's Ben Gurion International airport — considered the world's safest — to assess the country's fight against terrorism. A country where homeland security isn't the responsibility of the army, but of intelligence services and the police.
In February, former Nice mayor Christian Estrosi traveled to Israel, where they met the CEO of the Eagle Security and Defense company Giora Eiland, also the former director of the Israeli National Security Council. During their visit, Estrosi insisted on the need “to be at the forefront of the fight through intelligence against cybercrime, considering that radicalization is done through social networks.” A field in which the Jewish state excels, as it is one of the world's pre-eminent cyber-powers along with the United States, China, Russia and the United Kingdom.
A third intifada?
Why is the Israeli approach so efficient? "For decades, Israel has been confronted with a multiform and disseminated threat," says David Khalfa, research associate for the think tank IPSE. "The country has suffered a series of terror attacks with an ever-changing modus operandi. Israel's anti-terrorism strategy has had to permanently adapt by taking on an approach based on anticipation and rapidity of reaction, with mixed results, but countries faced with an important terror threat are scrutinizing this experience," they say.
According to Khalfa, this threat has gone through important changes over four broad periods of time: First the 1970s with the attacks from the Palestinian fedayeen; then the time of the Oslo Accords in 1993 and its wave of suicide attacks; followed by the post-Oslo years during which Israel — faced with the second intifada — found itself targeted by rocket or missile fire from Hamas and Hezbollah; and now, the more recent escalation of car-ramming or knife attacks.
"Israeli anti-terrorism is based on defensive modes of action, such as safety barriers and military checkpoints, as well as offensive ones like infiltrations, preventive arrests, and targeted killings. This double-edged approach, coupled with its security cooperation with the Palestinian Authority, allowed Israel to significantly bring down the number of major scale attacks, even though small-scale attacks by Palestinians with rudimentary means have taken over in the last few months," says Khalfa.
Intelligence as the cornerstone
The cornerstone of Israel's anti-terrorism system is the intelligence apparatus, which works in concentric circles: in the West Bank, at Israel's borders, and inside the country. Inside Israeli cities, the Jewish state relies on elite counter-terrorism units placed under police command, except for the former riot police unit Yasam, which now patrols on motorbikes inside Israel and directly answers to Shin Bet, the internal security service.
Israel can thus react extremely quickly in case of an attack, and Israeli civil society plays an especially important part in fighting terrorism. The army plays a crucial role, as every young Israeli is required to serve three years — two for women — under the flag. But there's also the fact that the authorities have made it easier to carry weapons, meaning that civilians can respond more quickly when there's an attack, not to mention the private protection companies which mushroomed at the beginning of the second intifada and its suicide attacks.
"The public's awareness and resilience are a key asset," explains Boaz Ganor, director of the International Institute for Counterterrorism (ICT) of the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya. The authorities take many preventive measures, such as banning vehicles from circulating in entire areas altogether during major events and gatherings. Checkpoints and barricades are also erected, an action plan that was reinforced during the recent wave of terror attacks that killed more than 31 Israelis, 4 foreigners and 207 Palestinians, including 130 assailants, since the fall of 2015.
A population aware of the risk
While this cycle of violence has produced 140 attacks with knives, guns or ramming cars initiated mostly by young Palestinians considered "lone wolves," it hasn't had the same psychological impact as the suicide bombings of the second intifada. "We've experienced worse but the 'knife intifada' has broken a run of six years of relative calm," says Ely Karmon, research director at the ICT. As a matter of fact, Israeli security forces have found themselves helpless against Palestinian assailants aged between 13 and 20, unknown to the intelligence services and acting mostly alone. But as usual, the operational adjustment has been swift: Blocks of concrete or metal rods were installed at bus stops to protect commuters and stop ramming attacks against exposed pedestrians, and the authorities raised awareness among the population.
Another defensive approach that's evolving is the monitoring of social networks. "Israel has invested heavily in this area," explains Khalfa. "Especially since it noticed the growth of ISIS's influence on certain young, self-radicalized Palestinians, for whom the fight is more in line with jihadism, as was recently observed in the attack in Tel Aviv's Sarona market."
That attack, on June 8, was carried out by two cousins from a West Bank village south of Hebron. They opened fire on people sitting at the terrace of a chocolate shop, killing four and wounding about fifteen people. According to Shin Bet's investigation, the two terrorists had decided to carry out an ISIS-inspired attack, but hadn't been officially recruited by the terror organization nor had they received help in the process. Against such attacks, even Israel hasn't found a solution yet.
Poor eating and exercise habits have kept obesity rates high in the United States. (Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images)
The geography of obesity in the United States has taken an alarming turn for the worse in just a generation.
In 1990, the country would have been considered relatively healthy when it comes to weight. Sure, there were plenty of people who were overweight and obese. But the problem was relatively limited with not a single one of our 50 states having a prevalence equal to or greater than 15 percent.
Today, all of them do -- and new numbers released this week show the problem has been getting worse, not better despite many millions spent on national campaigns by the likes of public health officials, the American Heart Association, and first lady Michelle Obama to get Americans to eat better and exercise more.
Back in 2011, one state -- Mississippi -- was in the top tier of obesity with a staggering 35 percent or higher prevalence and 17 states were in the second tier with 30-33 percent.
That's based on a definition of obesity as a body mass index or BMI of 30 or above which is calculated by dividing weight in pounds by height in inches squared and multiplying by a conversion factor of 703. A 5-foot-9-inch man, for example, would have to be 203 pounds to be counted as obese. (If you want to calculate your own BMI check out this handy calculator from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)
By 2014, that number had grown to four states in the top tier and 19 in the second tier.
Even Colorado, long the skinniest U.S. state, surpassed the 20 percent mark, which is considered high, coming in with an obesity prevalence of 21.3 percent. That was still the lowest number of any state.
Arkansas won the title for fattest state with 35.9 percent, followed by Mississippi with 35.5 percent and West Virginia with 35.7 percent. Louisiana was close behind with a prevalence of 34.9 percent.
The rapid change is highlighted in this set of remarkable slides put together by the CDC which is in charge of analyzing the data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which involves telephone surveys. As of 2014, none of the U.S. states meet the nation's "healthy people" goals of obesity prevalence under 20 percent.

Cody Anderson was one of millions of Americans who cast their vote on election day last November.
But unlike most Americans, they decided to watch the results come in from the other side of the border — "a little cheap joke," they recalled, what with the number of Americans claiming they would move to Canada if Donald Trump won.
The Canadian border agents in Manitoba who greeted them after their drive from Nebraska were suspicious. An agent asked to see their phone and Anderson gave them their PIN.
I did catch a glimpse of them looking through my text messages. - Brandon Wu
"That decision was a bit [hasty] because I didn't want to turn around and drive another 10 hours to get all the way home," Anderson wrote in an online exchange with CBC News.
They don't know what was examined on their phone, but in the end, the border agent let them in.
"She stamped my passport and I forget their exact remark after that but it was something that sounded like they thought I was trying to move in," Anderson said.
For all the recent tales of U.S. border agents scrutinizing travellers' phones and laptops, Anderson's story is a reminder that, yes, Canadian border agents can and will search electronics, too.
And just like Canadians entering the U.S., foreign travellers have little choice but to comply, lest they risk the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) not letting them in.
"I was mad that they went through my phone," said Anderson, who described themselves as "privacy advocate," but they tried to rationalize the experience nonetheless.
"I was telling myself that going to another country is a privilege and not a right, so if I had to give away some freedom to do that, it was acceptable."

U.S. and Canadian border agents have the right to search travellers' personal belongings without a warrant and say that right applies to digital devices, too.
While CBSA says its agents will only search information stored locally on the device, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has a much wider latitude to comb through social media apps installed on the device, remotely stored emails or files stored in the cloud.
"Officers are not to read emails or consult social media accounts on the traveller's digital device unless the information is already downloaded and has been opened (usually marked as read) and is therefore stored on the device," said CBSA spokesperson Patrizia Giolti in a statement sent to CBC News last month.
'Insulting and invasive'
And while border agents can't force you to give up passwords, you could have your devices seized, your trip delayed or even be denied entry if you're not a citizen of the country you're trying to enter.
Such was Brandon Wu's fear en route by train from Buffalo to Toronto for a two-day trip in March 2015.
After answering some basic questions from a CBSA agent at the Niagara Falls border crossing, Wu was told to wait in a nearby room for a secondary inspection.
There, the border agent asked Wu where they were staying and Wu showed the agent the details of their Airbnb reservation on their phone. The agent then asked to see Wu's phone — which, by that point, Wu had voluntarily unlocked. They handed over the phone.

"In retrospect, I regret that decision but I'm not sure if I really had a choice, especially if I wanted to get on with my trip on time," Wu said.
He's not sure why they were picked, but said it could have had something to do with being a Chinese-American and having a Chinese-sounding legal name.
"It felt insulting and invasive," Wu said. "He looked through it for a few minutes and we were silent during that time. I did catch a glimpse of them looking through my text messages."
Catch-22
Micheal Vonn, policy director for the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, has fielded numerous questions in recent weeks about border searches of smartphones, laptops and other electronic devices.
It's not that the rules have changed, but rather, people's awareness of what the rules are — spurred by numerous stories of U.S. border agents asking to search travellers' phones.
"The best data is no data when you go across the border," the Vancouver-based lawyer says.
'But that doesn't necessarily mean scrubbing or wiping your device is the best way to go.
Think long and hard before [crossing] if there are other people's information on your device that you are legally or ethically obliged to protect. - Micheal Vonn
The internet is rife with suggestions that travellers delete files or uninstall apps before they leave, make backups of devices and wipe them clean for travel or even buy new devices with temporary accounts that are only used while travelling abroad.
That might make sense for some travellers, but travelling with little or no data on a device could also raise red flags.
"This is the question that we're being asked. Am I actually going to paint a target on my back by looking overly well-prepared?" says Vonn.
"So now we're kind of caught in the catch-22 that privacy advocates have known for a very long time, which is asserting your right to privacy should not make you a target, but that doesn't mean it couldn't be construed in that fashion. And I don't know any surefire way to assist with that paradox."
Can you be arrested if you don't comply?
One thing you can do before your trip is think critically about the data you have on your device, how much you're willing or able to share and the consequences for refusing to hand over your phone.
In Canada, CBSA confirmed to CBC News that it will not arrest travellers for refusing to provide the password to a device — even though the agency believes it has the legal right to do so.
This has been the agency's policy since at least 2015 when interim guidelines were released — guidelines that "are still in force with respect to examinations of electronic goods as well as for arrest," said CBSA spokesperson Nicholas Dorion.
Previously, these guidelines were only available via Access to Information document published by the BCCLA, but CBSA released its own copy of the guidelines to CBC News.

While Canadian citizens can't be detained or denied entry to Canada, those travelling to the U.S. can be detained, interrogated or ultimately denied entry for not co-operating — in addition to having a device seized and forensically examined, a power that can also be exercised by CBSA.
"CBSA may only collect data for customs purposes and may only disclose customs information if authorized to do so under section 107 of the Customs Act," Giolti wrote, declining to answer questions about where data is stored or how long it's retained.
In that case, encrypting a device and using a strong password — and not a PIN — will make it difficult for others to gain access.
Encryption is also strongest when the phone is powered down, and doing so disables the fingerprint reader until you enter your password as well.
"You protect your privacy before you get to the border, not at the border," Vonn says. "Think long and hard before [crossing] if there are other people's information on your device that you are legally or ethically obliged to protect."
Sharon
I'm writing this a little early this year – _Independence Days_ is due in a couple of weeks, and I anticipate a great deal of distraction as the end-of-the-year predictions really start pouring out, so I thought I'd jump the gun and make mine now.
But first, how did I do last year? (And note, just 'cause I got some right last year doesn't mean that you should take my word as gospel – I don't think that everything that comes out of my ass is the high truth, and neither should you )
I called this year “Here be Dragons” arguing that this was when the maps we use to make sense of the world begin to fail us. I think that was pretty accurate – I think most people still don't really understand how badly our maps have failed us, how the operation of our economy, our ecosystem, our culture is simply different than what we've been taught. I think we can all see that most experts are pretty lost too - not because they are simply stupid, but because they aren't prepared to work off the map. The stories we tell ourselves shape what we can see in the world – and the conventional narratives have undermined our understanding of the realities.
Here are my predictions for 2008 and my comments on how they came out:
1. This year, the words “peak oil” will go mainstream, but this mainstreaming will not be matched by a subtle or nuanced understanding of what the words mean. That is, peak oil will be used for political purposes, and not necessarily ones anyone will approve of.
- I called this one. As oil prices rose, CNN and the rest of the MSM couldn't get enough of PO poster boys Simmons and Kunstler. But, of course it wasn't really possible to create, in that media, a complex enough understanding for people to realize that peak oil hasn't gone away just because prices have collapsed, that, in fact, for the long term, the collapse of prices probably ensures that we're past peak oil.
2. By the end of the year, there will begin to be runs on preparedness equipment and food storage, a la Y2K.
- It wasn't quite as dramatic in the equipment department as Y2K, although woodstoves and electric bikes were backordered like crazy. But the big story was people fighting over bags of rice at Costco and other stores back in the spring. And unfortunately, for other reasons, I think we may see this one again. Called it.
3. The NeoCons will not go gently into that good night – there will be at least one serious surprise for us. G-d willing, it won't involve the word “nukuler” or any of its cognates.
- I'd give myself 50% on this one – I think the build up with Russia was indeed a final Neo-con attempt to make themselves seem like the best answer to a scary world (and Alaska as our DMZ), but it wasn't as dire as I feared.
4. Hillary will not win the 2008 election. Neither, despite all the people who keep sending me emails saying they will, will Ron Paul.
- Got it.
5. The economy will tank. Yup, I'm really going out on a limb here.
- Got it.
6. Many of us will find we are being taken more seriously than we ever expected. We will still be taken less seriously than any celebrity divorce, however.
- This was certainly true for me – I don't really know how John Michael Greer, Kunstler and Orlov, for example, felt about it, but I was surprised at how seriously my predictions were taken, and how few people thought I was over-reacting, even when doing, say ABC affiliate radio interviews. But, of course, there are limits to seriousness - fairly few people really critiqued the worldview, but comparatively few people paid attention, either.
7. We'll see food riots in more nations and hunger will increase. The idea of Victory Gardens won't seem so crazy anymore.
- Yup. 31 nations and counting had some form of food riot this year. And Michael Pollan wrote “Farmer in Chief” and the “White House Farm” idea hit the blogosphere.
8. The biofuels craze will begin to be thought the best of – not in time to prevent the above.
- Called it. The collapse of oil prices of course is doing its own work, but even before that, we were finally seeing serious questioning of the premise of biofuels hits national discourse, at least in Europe.
9. We will see at least one more image of desperate people, walking out of their city becuase there's no other alternative. And a lot of images of foreclosures.
Part one of this is the only one I got wrong, and that only partly. People were walking out of Houston, and a whole lot of people were walking around looking for Gas in Memphis and Atlanta, but it didn't quite have the resonance of Katrina or 9/11 – the media wasn't paying attention, so it wasn't the kind of iconic image that I was expecting. The second part I called.
10. TEOTWAKI, if it ever happens, will be delayed long enough for my book to be released this fall and to make back at least the advance, so my publisher won't have any reason to try and sue me .
- I'm not sure, but I think I might have actually made back my advance by now (all 4K of it), and my publisher is still in business. Who knows, I might actually make a pittance!
Ok, what about the coming year? While I think 2008 was when most people first realized something was wrong, I'm going to go out on a limb here (ok, not a huge limb, but a limb) and say that 2009 will be the year we say that things “collapsed.” I don't think we're going to make it through the year without radical structural changes in the nature of life in most of the world. I'm calling it, a la Yeats's “Second Coming” the “The Year ‘It's Hour Come Round at Last'”
What do I mean by collapse? We throw that word around, but it is easy to misunderstand. I mean that the US is likely to undergo a financial collapse a la the Great Depression - widespread unemployment, lots of people facing hunger, cold and the inability to get health care, a disruption of what we tend to assume are birthright services, and a sense that the system doesn't work anymore. I don't claim that we are headed by Thursday to cannibalism, however – what I think will be true is that we will often do surprisingly well in the state of collapse, as hard as it is.
In previous years, I was fairly lighthearted about my predictions – this year, I don't find it possible to be. I really hope I'm wrong about this. And I hope you will make decisions based on your own judgement, not mine. These are predictions, the results of my analysis and my intuitions, and sometimes I'm good at that. But I do not claim that every word that comes out of my mouth or off my keyboard is the truth, and you should not take it as such. You are getting this free on the internet – consider what you paid for it, and value it accordingly.
1. Some measure of normalcy will hold out until late spring or early summer, mostly based on hopes for the Obama Presidency. But by late summer 2009, the aggregate loss of jobs, credit and wealth will cause an economic crisis that makes our current situation look pretty mild. With predictions of up to a million jobs lost each month, there will simply come a point at which the economy as we understand it now cannot function – we will see the modern equivalents of breadlines and stockbrokers selling apples on the streets.
2. Many plans for infrastructure investments currently being proposed will never be completed, and many may never be started, because the US may be unable to borrow the money to fund them. The price of globalization will be high in terms of reduced availability of funds and resources – despite all the people who think that we'll keep building things during a collapse, we won't. We will have some variation on a Green New Deal in the US and some nations will continue to work on renewable infrastructure, but a lot of us are going to be getting along with the fraying infrastructure, designed for a people able to afford a lot of cheap energy, that we have now. The most successful projects will be small, localized programs that distribute resources as widely as possible.
I pray that we will have the brains to ignore most other things and set up some kind of health care system, one that softens the blows here. If not, we're really fucked – the one thing most of us can't afford is medical care as it works now in a non-functioning economy. Unfortunately, my bet is that we don't do something about this, but I hope to God I'm wrong.
3. 2009 will be the year that most of the most passionate climate activists (and I don't exclude myself) have to admit that there is simply not a snowball's chance in hell (and hell is getting toastier quickly) that we are going to prevent a 2C+ warming of the planet. We are simply too little, too late. That does not mean we will give up on everything – the difference between unchecked emissions and checked ones is still the difference between life and death for millions – but hideously, regretfully and painfully, the combination of our growing understanding of where the climate is and the economic situation will force us to begin working from the reality that the world we leave our children is simply going to be more damaged, and our legacy smaller and less worthy of us than we'd ever hoped.
4. 2008 will probably be the world's global oil peak, but we won't know this for a while. When we do realize it, it will be anticlimactic, because we'll be mired in the consequences of our economic, energy and climate crisis. Lack of investment in the coming years will mean that in the end, more oil stays in the ground, which is good for the climate, but tough for our ambitions for a renewable energy economy. Over the long term, however, peak oil is very much going to come back and bite us all in the collective ass.
5. Decreased access to goods, services and food will be a reality this year. Some of this will be due to stores going out of business – we may all have to travel further to meet needs. Some will be due to suppliers going under, following the wave of merchant bankruptcies. Some may be due to disruptions in shipping and transport of supplies. Some will be due to increased demand for some items that have, up until now, been niche items, produced in small numbers for the small number of sustainability freaks, but that now seem to have widespread application. And some may be due to deflation - farmers may not be able to harvest crops because they can't get enough for them to pay for the harvest, and the connections between those who have goods and those who need goods may be thoroughly disrupted. Meanwhile, millions more Americans will be choosing between new shoes and seeing the doctor.
6. Most Americans will see radical cut backs in local services and safety nets. Funding will simply dry up for many state and local programs. Unemployment will be overwhelmed, and the federal government will have to withdraw some of its commitments simply to keep people from starving in the streets. Meanwhile, expect to see the plows stop plowing, the garbage cease to be collected, and classrooms to have 40+ kindergarteners to a class – and potentially a three or four day school week.
7. Nations will overwhelmingly fail to pony up promised commitments to the world's poor, and worldwide, the people who did the least harm to the environment will die increasingly rapidly of starvation. This will not be inevitable, but people in the rich world will claim it is.
8. We will finally attempt to deal with foreclosures, but the falling value of housing will make it a losing proposition. Every time we bring the housing values down to meet the reality, the reality will shift under our feet. Many of those who are helped will end up foreclosed upon anyway (as is already the case) and others will simply see no point in paying their mortgage when, by defaulting, they could qualify for lowered payments (as is already the case). Ultimately, the issue will probably self resolve in either some kind of redistribution plan that puts people in foreclosed houses with minimal mortgaging, with foreclosures dragging down enough banks that people find it feasible to simply stop paying mortgages that are now unenforceable, or with civil unrest that leads people simply to take back housing for the populace. I don't have a bet on which one, and I don't think it will be resolved in 2009.
9. By the end of the year, whether or not we will collapse or have collapsed will continue to be hotly debated by everyone who can still afford their internet service. No one will agree on what the definition of collapse actually is, plenty of people will simply be living their old lives, only with a bit less, while others will be having truly apocalyptic and deeply tragic losses. Some will see the victims as lazy, stupid, alien and worthless, no matter how many there are. Others will look around them and ask “how did I not see that this was inevitable?” Many people will be forced to see that the poor are not a monolith of laziness and selfishness when they become poor. We will know that we are in our situation only in retrospect, only in hindsight – our children will have a better name for the experience than we will, caught up in our varied personal senses of what is happening Meanwhile, each time things get harder most of us will believe they are at the bottom, that things are now “normal” and adapt, until it becomes hard to remember what our old expectations were.
10. Despite how awful this is, the reality is that not everything will fall apart. In the US, we will find life hard and stressful, but we will also go forward. People will suck a lot up and retrench. It will turn out that ordinary people were always better than commentators at figuring out what to do – that's why they stopped shopping even while people were begging them to keep buying. So they'll move in with their siblings and grow gardens and walk away from their overpriced houses, or fight to keep them. Some of them will suffer badly for it, but a surprising number of people will simply be ok in situations that until now, they would have imagined were impossible to survive. We will endure, sometimes even find ways of loving our new lives. There will be acts of remarkable courage and heroism, and acts of the most profound evil and selfishness. There will be enormous losses – but we will also discover that most of us are more than we think we are – can tolerate more and have more courage and compassion than we believe of ourselves.
An early Happy New Year, everyone. May you know better than you deserve and see others at their best in these hard times.

Wenglish is baffling
The Welsh language - very close to Breton - is understandably hard for non-speakers to understand, but Welsh-English can be just as confusing. “Now” actually means “sometime between a minute from now and tomorrow night”, never, ever this second. All outer garments are coats, as in: “Whose coat is this jacket?”, curry comes with “half and half” (rice and chips) and “I've got to be honest…” signals an imminent tidalwave of bull. Pronunciation is also the source of huge confusion to out-of-towners. Here, year, hear and ear are all pronounced identically as “yur”. Tooth is “tuth”, comb is “cwm”. Syllables are dropped altogether - “ridiculous” and “fabulous” have only three and two, respectively.
There is nothing more terrifying than a Welsh mam
There's a facial expression unique to Welsh mothers, affectionally known as “Mamface”, that could break up an LA gang fight. Deployed judiciously, it warns of extreme displeasure, rapidly diminishing tolerance and impending, possibly fatal, action. Welsh Mam holds no truck with negotiation or bribery. Do as they ask or die. Just as formidable is Welsh Nain, a matriarchal grandmother who invariably “could have gone out with Tom Jones” and aggressively feeds all visitors like foie gras geese. “C'mon, just a small snack is all”, Welsh Nain will say at 11pm, as they bung in a leg of lamb and pops on the bakestone to make three dozen Welshcakes. Resistance is futile.
For this piece, I really want to jump right into the “debate” that Carl Benjamin and Thomas Smith had.
Then of course there is Thomas Smith , who I admittedly never heard of before today, but reminds me of pretty much every brogrammer I've worked with in San Francisco.
As much as I hated that I had to pay for it, I will say it was worth it. For $3, I was entertained for literally hours.
The format of this article will be as follows. I will provide excerpts from their debate, and then my thoughts and comments on those excerpts immediately after. If anyone finds this format confusing, fun, some other adjective, or just wants to engage a little, please leave me comments here or find me on Twitter at @jpmcglone
This first excerpt, I think, does a great job setting the tone for the rest of the debate.
Thomas: “You're not a liberal. The liberal stance is that systemic discrimination is a problem. That's one big part of it.”
Carl: “That's not the liberal stance, that's the Marxist stance.”
Thomas: “Unbelievable…”
Right off the bat, it's clear that Thomas and Carl have incredibly different views on what “liberal” means, and for now, I'm absolutely open to Thomas' viewpoint, even though I am a fan of Carl's and agree with his.
Thomas: “Deplatforming isn't censorship!”
Carl: “Yes it is.”
I actually had a great conversation about this recently.. in summary, deplatforming is censorship, but sometimes it is reasonable. For example, if your institution isn't hosting a certain idea or topic, and Carl wants to come to that institution and speak about it, I see no reason that refusing their talk is unreasonable.
What I find to be unreasonable is when an institution is hosting a talk about a topic or idea, but seemingly only allows individuals with one view point speak on it. I've seen people criticize YouTuber Roaming Millenial for interviewing Richard Spencer (White Nationalist and founder of www.altright.com) because they chose to give them a platform to speak on, but I think it's only fair they interviewed them since they have expressed opinions about the Alt Right and had also interviewed people with their own views on the Alt Right.
I think it's ‘deplorable' to suggest that someone should be able to talk about a person and their views but also refuse them a voice in that conversation.
Is it censorship? Absolutely. Is it their right to censor? Absolutely. But this idea that deplatforming isn't censorship is, although I see where Thomas is coming from, just wrong, especially since the term is almost always used to describe the cancelling of an event of program in which the speaker is considered ‘offensive' to some of the audience.
Thomas: “Intersectionality is literally the thing that makes [feminism] more individualistic.”
Carl: “That is absolutely absurd, and I can't believe you just said that.”
Thomas: “Do you want to let me tell you why that argument is true? Intersectionality makes us more individual. Instead of being ‘men vs. women', instead of being ‘black vs. white', intersectionality allows us to say ‘men have different experiences than women. Black people have different experiences than white people. Black women have different experiences than white women. Poor white women have different experiences than black women. That's intersectionality. Intersectionality let's you break down identities in more dynamic ways.”
Carl: “Are you even listening to yourself? You are collectivizing all of these people, and you're saying that's individualism? It's not. It's the antithesis of individualism.”
Thomas: “It's literally the opposite of what you just said. It's allowing people's identity to be multifaceted. It's allowing socioeconomic status to be part of it, it's allowing race to be a part of it, it's allowing gender to be part of it.”
Carl: “Again, you're categorizing them into classes, Thomas.”
Thomas: “Yea.”
Carl: “That's collectivism. That's not individualism.”
Thomas: “What I'm saying is that intersectionality is what gets us that more intricate level of identity.”
Carl: “Of control, yes! But individualism is that people should be free. Do you not get how all of this is completely antithetical to the concept of liberty? Let's get down to the principle, you are not for freedom. You are for equality of outcome rather than liberty. That is the fundamental issue of our time, and you should probably know that.”
Thomas seems to think that because they group people into an infinite number of categories, that they are granting them individuality, not realizing that it is the act of categorizing people into the permutation of group that they see as meaningful that is stripping them of their individuality.
Thomas: “If we're going to talk about how to make society better, we — “
Carl: “We're not. We're going to talk about how to make society free!”
Ok, so I think the best way to respond to this is with a quote from Milton Friedman, and I couldn't agree with it more:
I think it's absolutely clear that Carl is not upset with Thomas for trying to make society better, but that they draw a very firm line in the sand when that comes at the cost of individual liberty. Thomas, if you want to make the world better, I am all for it. We appreciate that, but to the extent that you have to tell us who to be, how to act, and what to sacrifice in order for you to make the world better, you are being an authoritarian, and are inadvertently making the world worse.
I think this excerpt perfectly summarizes the big divide we're seeing in Western Culture right now, and that's a shame because “freedom” and “making the world better” are not innately at odds with each other! I'd argue that the latter is a side effect of the prior, and if others can think of more creative ways to make the world better (while not stealing any of my freedoms), I'd support them fully!
Thomas: “So you think affirmative action is discrimination against a group of people?”
Carl: “How can it not be?”
Affirmative action is a zero sum game. You can not advantage people of one group without disadvantaging people of all of the other groups. This is common sense. It's one thing if Thomas acknowledged this and then tried to justify it, but they seem to think that affirmative action disadvantages nobody.
Thomas: “I'm not a Marxist.”
Carl: “Yes you are, and you don't know it.”
Ok, Carl, this was not the greatest way to respond, even though you're right.. Thomas is pushing ideas that are right out of the Communist Manifesto. Here's the 8th plank:
Equal Liability of All to Labor. Establishment of Industrial Armies, Especially for Agriculture.
Perhaps Thomas would say he's a socialist, but not a Marxist — and if so, I'd love to hear their view on that.
But instead, Thomas doesn't really defend their position well, and goes on to instead demonstrate that they don't know much about Marxism…
Carl: “I don't want to look at the past, I want to look at the future; your future is oppressive.”
Well put, Carl.
Thomas somehow believes that Carl is in favor of oppression, perhaps through neglect (if not actively oppressing others), but it's clear to me that the one in favor of social engineering is in favor of oppression. This whole interview is ripe with irony.
I'm having a hard time understanding why this is a complicated topic for so many.
Carl: “Racial discrimination is bad no matter who it is happening to. It's not a defensible position.”
Thomas: “The status quo discriminates. I'm in favor of making things more equal.”
Carl: “Ok, I'm not. I'm in favor of making things more free.”
Thomas: “Freedom entails discrimination. Freedom allows White Men to control everything.”
Carl: “Oh my god.”
It seems that Thomas disapproves of freedom because “it allows White Men to control everything.”
Can a liberal friend of mine who understands Thomas please do a better job defending this position? Please? It sounds insane to me. The best I got is that Thomas is being facetious with the term ‘freedom' here, and thinks what Carl is calling ‘freedom' is actually not freedom. But, their WORD choice says otherwise.
Carl: “Why aren't you combatting women's under representation in the NBA? In sewer cleaning?”
Thomas: “Feminism helps that by trying to combat gender roles. So if gender roles are responsible for men feeling like they have to do certain jobs, because they have to be manly — “
Carl: “You think they base that manliness on whether they… clean sewers?”
Thomas: “ — then I would be in favor of making it that men don't feel compelled to do some of these things if they don't want to.”
Ok, I have two issues with.
One: “in favor of making it” — making it? Sigh. That's literally the point here. Why does Thomas and their friends feel the need to “make it” so that men feel or don't feel something? What does “making it” entail? Force?
Two: somebody has to do it. Somebody has to clean the sewers.
The idea that a) women want to be in dirty sewers cleaning them and/or b) that men of society won't generally volunteer to do it in women's place, to spare them from filth and risk of disease and death — that's insane.
If you understand anything about human biology or psychology, it's not hard to understand why the bigger human with greater strength and endurance (typically men) who basically spends their life trying to maintain the deserving of the company of the smaller human who bonds well with the offspring (typically women) would want to be in dirty sewers cleaning them so that women don't need to.
Before anyone tells me “I'm a woman. I'd do it.” — Go do it then! I won't stop you, but if you were my sister, my mother, my wife, or anybody who I cared about, I'd probably volunteer to do it instead.
But feminism is not encouraging women to clean sewers, at all. And that doesn't surprise me in the slightest, because this is clearly *not* about equality nor equity everywhere. In a way, if it was, I bet many more women would resist feminism today.
Thomas: “I'm not saying everyone has to make the same choices, but the evidence is that certain groups get discriminated against when you do [blind] resume studies.”
Carl: “And when you have Affirmative Action.”
…
Carl: “There may be a multitude of reasons for [the results of the blind resume studies], but you know what I don't think will solve it? Gender discrimination.”
The point is, you do not solve alleged implicit discrimination against people by explicitly discriminating against other people. Why are feminists not interested in helping to find solutions that maintain this principle? Does any feminist really think that discrimination against men isn't going to piss men off, or do they just not care? Does (perceived) victimhood make it easy for feminists to not care?
Carl: “I don't have a solution [to the inequality you see]. I'm a response to the system of oppression you are trying to impose on people.”
Carl also said “discrimination against characteristics like race and gender is wrong” and Thomas responded “I agree, but discrimination is happening,” to which Carl replied “then maybe we shouldn't increase the amount of discrimination that is happening” —but Thomas just doesn't understand this point. How? Why?
Carl admits they don't have a solution to the discrimination that you see, Thomas, they just knows that more discrimination is not the solution.
I don't understand how any person of principle can advocate for fighting discrimination of one gender by justifying the discrimination against the other gender.
This whole debate is making me feel crazy, because to me it seems so obvious, but I know that a large percentage of my friends (I lived in SF for many years…) agree with Thomas. I really want to understand why.
Carl: “I don't think the answer to racial discrimination is racial discrimination.”
Thomas: “So what is the answer?”
Carl: “I don't know.”
Thomas: “So the answer is the status quo! Because you're a Status Quo Warrior.”
…
Carl: “[but] the status quo is diversity quotas! I am against those.”
Oh great, is SQW (Status Quo Warrior) a term now, too?
Ok, so this next one really stung, and I'll tell you why in a minute. Read the words carefully. Thomas said this when it was perfectly clear that he's had enough of this discussion:
Thomas: “When is this over? Because you don't give a shit about people, so who cares.”
Well then.
I've heard this recently, too, and it hurt. It upset me a lot because I actually do care about people, as I'm sure both Carl and Thomas do.
The misconceptions around this topic are incredibly confusing to me, and I was told something very similar to what Thomas said to Carl above, by someone I loved very much.
It seems my entire friendsphere is being affected by whatever this is… and it's a shame. I know many people with views like mine or Carl's that have lost many relationships, and that's unlike anything I've seen in my lifetime.
What is happening in our society? The people calling for freedom of choice are being told they're terrible by the people who are trying to socially engineer a world that artificially grants privileges to those they categorized into not having any.
I really want to get to the bottom of this.
Carl: (sarcastically) “Why are you here? You're a white man.”
Thomas: (not sarcastically) “I agree. I shouldn't be here. I would advocate that the organizers invite someone else.”
Carl: (sarcastically) “But why did you even turn up? You knew you were occupying a space a black woman [could have had].”
Thomas: (not sarcastically) “I was invited, but I think they should have more people of color.”
Sargon: (in summary) “[So] the organizers shouldn't invite them (Thomas)[because he's white] and they should invite more black women.”
Thomas: (not sarcastically) “Yea”
Carl: (actually not sarcastically) “Well done. You just de-platformed yourself.”
Thomas' view seems so unprincipled. They think that they should not be on the stage because he's a white man. What is this?
Anyway, if you made it this far, thanks for reading all of this! I encourage you to watch the video for yourself, the Carl and Thomas talk starts at 1:31:37, and I hope you'll engage with me here or on Twitter at @jpmcglone
Huawei has been chipping away at the flagship smartphone block for years now, gradually adding appeal to its seemingly desired western audience with each iteration. But while last year's P8 lost its way with sloppy software and knuckle-based nonsense, this year's P9 - which mimics the same handset design as the last - cleans up its act, pumps up the power and, crucially, adds its point of difference: dual Leica cameras (including one that's a monochrome sensor. No, really).
With Sony notably absent from the flagship table, LG hiding behind its fun-but-fleeting modular build in the G5, HTC only just making titters of its much-needed return to form in the 10, and Samsung essentially smashing it out of the park this year with the S7 edge, the Huawei P9 slots into a unique position in what is a more open playing field than ever before.
We've been rather impressed by Huawei's large-scale Mate 8 model, but in the P9 - which is a more slender flagship, with more than an air of iPhone about its design - does it have the necessary grunt in all the right areas to be deemed master of all? Has getting in bed with the Germans given this Chinese flagship the finesse it so requires, or is it just more folly? After a week with the P9 in the pocket we reveal all…
At first glance the P9 looks a whole lot like the P8. That brings with it some great design flourishes: there's a truly tiny edge bezel around the 5.2-inch screen, the metal body's chamfered edges certainly look premium, while at 6.95mm thick it's a slender phone in hand or pocket (although a tiny bit thicker than last year's P8 due to a battery capacity boost).
The metal buttons feel quality, the 3.5mm headphone jack is positioned to the bottom (Samsung style), while a SIM and microSD tray means potential to expand upon internal storage if you want. In some territories there's a dual SIM option (codename EVA-L29, not the EVA-L09 model we're reviewing).
There are new colour options too: rose gold, prestige gold, titanium grey and mystic silver. We've got the last, which is effectively silver and white, which is the best looking of the bunch in our view. There's also talk of a hairline brushed metal special model, which we've not seen.
But the real moment of greatness is the P9's fingerprint scanner to the rear. It is, hands down, the best one we've used to date. Not only is it better positioned than those on iPhone or Samsung devices, it's considerably more responsive than the LG G5's and positioned in a recessed opening which falls naturally to the finger. It's easy to setup, easy to use and super-quick in response. Plus with NFC it opens the door to Android Pay potential.
The device does fall into some traps though: invariably there has to be antennas for a decent signal, exhibited here as plastic strips top and bottom that clash somewhat with the metal design; we're not keen on the cameras panel housed to the rear either, which has a similarly plastic finish. The addition of a large "Huawei" stamp both front and rear seems unwarranted too, it was just on the rear last time around.
But the biggest issue isn't directly to do with Huawei at all. With every other maker pushing nuance - from the LG G5's subtle screen curve towards the top and always-on display, to the visually arresting screen curves of the Samsung Galaxy S7 - the P9 just looks kind of "normal". Sure, there's nothing wrong with that, but it doesn't exactly deliver high on the excite-o-meter.
To the base there's a USB Type-C port for charging and connectivity, which is altogether faster than microUSB and can slot in either way up to make things nice and easy. Don't expect the super-fast recharge speeds of Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 though - not a possibility given the Huawei's use of its home-grown HiSilicon chipset - but that battery can be topped up from near-death to roughly 70 per cent in around an hour.
Which is a good job, as the 3,000mAh cell on board, while sporting a fairly large capacity, doesn't survive for as long as we had hoped. It will get you through a working day, but we've been down to 20 per cent after less than 15-hours (the 26-hours showing up in power management was never realised with real use). It's one that benefits from top-ups during the day if you want to play a bit of Candy Crush while on your commute.
Seeing as the power loadout in the P9 is identical to its larger Mate 8 sibling - it's a Kirin 955 octa-core chipset (made-up of four 2.5Ghz Cortex-A72 and four 1.8Ghz Cortex-A53 processors) alongside 3GB RAM - we had anticipated longer-lasting performance in use. But there are obvious differences: the P9 has a much brighter screen and a battery some 25 per cent less capacious than the Mate 8.
Most flagships these days have all kinds of fancypants processors - whether Qualcomm, Samsung's Exynos, or Apple's A9 - that, if anything, are underused for most apps and games. Earlier HiSilicon setups in Huawei devices were ok, but the graphics tended to mean less-than-perfect motion. Not so the P9, its Mali-T880 MP4 graphics processor works just fine to deliver fluid playback when crunching through games.
The only time we've noticed the phone getting particularly hot is when using it as a Wi-Fi hotspot. The metal chassis and Kirin 955 combination really don't seem happy for long in this situation, with the phone becoming hot throughout and the battery taking an inevitable hit. Not that many phones are ideal when used as hotspots, but slender metal ones such as this are particularly averse.
Back to the P9's screen for a moment. Its up-to-500-nits brightness copes pretty well in a variety of conditions without excessive reflections. However, sometimes such brightness can appear overly "pumped" and unpleasant to look at when maxed out. We've sat the P9 side-by-side next to the P8 and it's a little brighter with punchier colours, but not dramatically so. No complaints about viewing angle and contrast though, everything looks peachy enough to us.
When it comes to resolution the P9's 1920 x 1080 pixel 5.2-inch panel isn't exactly low resolution, but it's lower than almost all its flagship competitors, nay iPhone. So we're a bit on the fence about it: the P9 doesn't exactly need more resolution, especially given the absent software support for anything like split-screen (which features in the Mate 8 via a press-and-hold of the square softkey, but not here). If the P9 was higher resolution then we suspect that battery life would deplete even quicker, which would be no good.
The latest feature found in many flagships for 2016 is an always-on screen - which displays quick-view icons of notifications, plus the clock - but that's not the case with the P9. A deal-breaker? Not at all. But these subtle moves from other makers do show forward-thinking. One thing Huawei does have that we can't think of in other handsets is a manual white balance selector (plus warm/cool one-touch options) to tweak the display, which is fun.
Now, with the P8 last year we didn't have that many nice things to say about its software experience. That's because, at launch, it was a pretty botched phone, dragged down by the user experience. Things like knuckle controls frequently interrupted use (these are now off by default in the P9; but they actually work in the latest iteration, as they did by the time the Mate S was launched), while the EMUI just didn't feel particularly friendly for an Android handset.
In the P9 things have moved forward. Sure, we're still working on EMUI - in v4.1; and that's "Emotion UI" in case you're wondering - which is built atop Android 6.0. It brings a somewhat Apple-like attempt of operation to the world of Android. Features like swiping down on the screen brings up universal search (a top-down swipe still accesses notifications), and there's no app tray/drawer so icons seem to spill everywhere. But we tend to use personally curated folders on the homepage screens anyway, so don't find this absence a major bother.
Plus there are some useful feature additions: you can have a hidden apps screen - accessible by pinching outward, rather than pinching inward (the latter which opens up the widgets panel) - to tuck away more sensitive apps from view; that already awesome fingerprint scanner also features gesture control, so you can swipe between information (it's switched off by default); and notifications for power-heavy apps aren't as frequent as in the earlier software (they're potentially handy too, as you can switch off battery-heavy apps and control background use per app).
Some other elements are less rosy though. Setting up multiple users just caused repeat crashing for us. The limited nine shortcuts in the notifications panel feels limited, especially when this isn't stock Android. There's Huawei ID, but it does all but nothing. And aesthetically we're still not wild about the moot colour palette and various obscure themes that you can download - although, again, these themes have been given second billing compared to the way they were introduced in earlier versions of the software.
The default keyboard is a dud too. It feels too stretched and elongated with keys that are fussy to strike cleanly and an arrangement that differs from most others. We quickly swapped out the SwiftKey, which works just fine, although the placement of delete/back key next to enter/emoji key are precariously close - all too often we end up with a screen full of emojis when one-handed typing in WhatsApp.
Smart Assistance is one area that offers a mixture of highs and lows. The one-handed user interface, which shrinks the screen display, doesn't feel hugely necessary at this scale; motion control to auto-answer calls when picking up the phone, or rejecting when flipping it over are handy yet nothing new; while knuckle controls, such as drawing the letter M on the screen with a knuckle to load a music player, are fun but we're non-plussed (not that we've left them switched on after testing for a bit).
Overall Huawei's EMUI 4.1 might not be the prettiest going, and it doesn't get everything right, but in this v4.1 iteration it adds some features ranging between quirky to useful, without being too offensive.
We've saved the best till last. The P9's calling card is its dual Leica cameras arrangement, consisting of one 12-megapixel full-colour sensor with 27mm equivalent f/2.2 lens and one monochrome sensor with the same lens. But do two cameras mean twice the fun?
There's a whole lot to say about this primary feature, much of which we assembled into a summary piece of our initial impressions (follow the link below). Since then we've been using the camera a whole lot more and, to our own surprise, have often gravitated to the monochrome shooter. That's just the camera geek in us.
READ: Huawei P9 camera explored: A lot to Leica?
Many have been asking: why not just shoot colour and convert it with a filter after? Because with a dedicated monochrome sensor there's the potential for images with less image noise because there's no colour filter array chopping up the "pixel" size on the sensor, meaning better quality and gradation. And its results are rather sumptuous.
It's not just about B&W versus colour, though, as both lenses can be used in conjunction to aid focusing, by offsetting the two images that each lens "sees". Additionally, and just like HTC was harping on about with its last flagship M-series phones, depth data can be derived and used for isolating areas and producing pseudo wide/small apertures for enhanced depth-of-field control. The software-controlled stuff isn't all that in our view, though, as the maximum "f/0.95" aperture option (derived entirely from software) botches lines, bokeh and sharp/soft patches in some images.
The more we've used the P9's camera (or cameras, plural, we suppose) the more we've come to realise this: don't be distracted by the folly. The cameras, at their core, whether using colour or mono, are both plenty capable. Quality is decent, focus speed is decent, colour is decent. It's a flagship offering for sure.
But is it the best of the bunch? Having used the LG G5, iPhone 6S Plus, Samsung Galaxy S7 edge and other phones within the last few weeks we still don't think the Huawei comes top of the pile. Don't get us wrong, it's good, but It's not quite as rapid as the SGS7, the focus in low-light wasn't as accurate for us as the LG G5, and whether you truly, truly want to be paying for a monochrome sensor in a camera is a whole other dividing point.
Then there's the "no bump!" excitement that Richard Yu proclaimed when announcing the P9 on stage at the launch event in London. Ok, it's flat to the rear, which is nice - even if poorly placed fingers do get in the way. But the second they said that we thought "oh, no optical image stabilisation then?". Sure enough, the P9 doesn't have optical stabilisation, nor a class-leading maximum aperture, so it's not the best in dim-to-low-light conditions. It's still very capable, just not the most capable.
Software-wise, Huawei was making it loud and clear that the "co-engineered with Leica" label means great things for software. Funnily enough, though, Leica isn't renowned for having the best or most usable menu systems. If anything it's renowned for having the most finicky ones. Which, at times, shows in use: in the P9 need to swipe right to bring up a full-screen display of shooting options, selecting between Photo or Monochrome here. But it would make more sense to use an LG G5-like solution here and have an on-screen software button to switch between those two critical options (in the G5 it toggles between normal and super-wide cameras).
Not all modes are available from that screen either - to access the P9's "Pro" mode (i.e. manual controls) you'll need to swipe up/down on the shooting screen. To take advantage of the pseudo aperture control - which isn't based on a real, mechanical aperture, but applied using software - you'll have to be in the colour camera and not using said Pro mode.
We've mentioned the two lenses operating to assist focus, but that's not all Huawei is calling on in the P9. For closer shooting there's a laser-assisted focus, much like that of the LG G5, which works really well. We snapped a penny phone box up-close as one example, which worked a treat.
Overall there's a lot to like about the cameras, when ignoring some of the glitchier software stuff. We like that it's easy to switch between manual and point-and-shoot, we like that the speed and quality is up there with the other flagships on the market, we like usability quirks like a horizontal level and grid overlay, and we like the ability to shoot raw files in addition to JPEGs. There are plenty of positives.

Private companies and researchers will be able to access data from GP records for £1, under plans revealed by NHS England to radically reduce the cost and boost the availability of information about patients available outside the NHS.
The body's chief data officer has revealed they want to reduce the costs for companies to access NHS datasets, from around £20,000 to £30,000 currently, to just £1.
NHS England said the data would be used to identify where improvements and efficiencies could be made in the NHS and that only approved companies would have access to the data.
But the GPC has raised concerns that private companies would have access to NHS patient data ‘on the cheap'.
Earlier this year NHS England announced plans to create Care Episode Statistics, where identifiable data extracted from GP records through the General Practice Extraction Service would be sent to the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) to be linked with information from secondary care sources, and will be de-identified, unless the patient has given consent for identifiable data to be shared.
After concerns from the BMA and campaign groups, health secretary Jeremy Hunt announced that patients would have any reasonable objection to having identifiable data sent to the HSCIC noted, and a flag put in their records so this was clear. They could also object to their data leaving the HSCIC.
Currently universities such as Oxford, Cambridge, King's College London as well as private companies BUPE, Dr Foster, Corin Ltd and Civil Eyes research have gone through the application process to receive the data, which involves proving adherence to information governance laws, and have been granted permission to receive data.
NHS England launched a consultation last month asking for views on what information should be extracted from hospitals in future, to provide an opportunity ‘for all interested parties to have their say in shaping the future of NHS hospital data and datasets.'
Mr Geraint Lewis, chief data officer at NHS England, said: ‘We want to ensure that patients, clinicians and staff who plan health services have access to the best possible information to help them improve health outcomes for patients.
‘This is why NHS England is developing the care.data service to make better use of health care information. As an early step in this programme, data from GP systems will be linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), transforming it into the Care Episodes Service (CES).'
They added: ‘NHS England wishes to reduce the fees to 1 GBP in order to encourage a wider range of accredited organisations, including charitable organisations, to analyse the data. However, we are keeping the nominal fee in place in order to ensure that all such organisations are held accountable for how they use the data, by means of a legally enforceable contract.
‘Such requests will be approved on an individual basis and will still be subject to the highest standards of information governance and all applicable privacy legislation.'
Dr Paul Cundy, chair of the GPC's ICT subcommittee said they had concerns over the plans. They said: ‘Bona fide research would seem to be OK, but I would have some concerns about private companies getting NHS patient's data on the cheap.'
Dr Brian Fisher, NHS Alliance patient and public involvement lead and a GP in Lewisham echoed these concerns.
They said: ‘There needs to be a fair price for data that's extremely valuable. When the data is extracted from GP records, its put together with other data sources in a way which means patients can be identified.
‘Private companies will be particularly adept at this and they will get a lot out of it. So there needs to be a fair price for this data.'
Pulse revealed earlier this week that GP practices must take ‘reasonable steps' to inform patients that identifiable data will be extracted from their records from this autumn and used by the NHS and private companies, or face action under the Data Protection Act.
Environmental groups argue that the 1,700-mile pipeline, which could carry 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta to the Gulf Coast of Texas , would result in unacceptably high emissions and disrupt pristine ecosystems.
Wendy Nassmacher, a State Department spokesperson, disputed that the e-mails showed a pro-pipeline bias. “We are committed to a fair, transparent and thorough process,” they said in an e-mail. “Throughout the process we have been in communication with industry as well as environmental groups, both in the United States and in Canada.”
TransCanada's chief Washington lobbyist is Paul Elliott, a top official in Mrs. Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. All of the documents pertain to contacts between Mr. Elliott and government officials.
“What differentiates this case is the potential for conflict of interest. That really raises eyebrows,” said Jake Wiens, an investigator with the Project on Government Oversight in Washington.
Many of the e-mails released Monday are between Mr. Elliott and Marja Verloop, the counselor for energy and environment at the United States Embassy in Ottawa .
On Sept. 10, 2010, in response to an e-mail from Mr. Elliott announcing that Senator Max Baucus of Montana was supporting the pipeline, Ms. Verloop wrote, “Go Paul!”
In an e-mail to David Jacobson, the United States ambassador to Canada, they described TransCanada as “comfortable and on board” with some developments in the review process.

In a fragmented exchange, Ms. Verloop wondered whether TransCanada could reapply to use higher pipeline pressures in the future, to which Mr. Elliott replied, “You are correct.” Such a request after the State Department signed off on the pipeline would require approval only by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, a small federal agency, bypassing broader political scrutiny.
Shawn Howard, a spokesperson for TransCanada, said Mr. Elliott lobbied the State Department officials as did lobbyists for many environmental groups. “Mr. Elliott was and is simply doing their job,” Mr. Howard said. “No laws have been broken.”

The State Department is tasked with granting permission, according to the “national interest,” for pipelines that cross national borders and is weighing the environmental impact of Keystone XL against the benefit of expanding the fuel supply for the United States. Its third and final environmental impact statement, released in late August, said the pipeline would have “limited adverse environmental impacts” if operated according to regulations.
The Environmental Protection Agency , which may offer comments on such pipelines but is not empowered to rule on their authorization, sharply criticized the State Department's previous environmental assessments as inadequate but has not yet weighed in on the August report.
Though the pipeline would help ensure a stable fuel supply from a friendly neighbor, environmental groups oppose it because much of the crude would be extracted from subterranean oil sands in a process that they say results in heavy emissions and destroys the overlying forests. In addition, the pipeline would go through the Ogallala Aquifer, one of the Great Plains' principal water sources, where a spill could prove disastrous.
While acknowledging that the extraction produces higher emissions than conventional oil drilling, proponents say that environmental groups exaggerate the difference and that new processes are making it cleaner.
Some of the e-mails have a cozy tone while others reveal a sometimes tense and conflicted relationship. Officials in Washington repeatedly rejected and parried requests for meetings with TransCanada executives even while trying to placate Canada; Keystone XL has the strong support of the Canadian government and would provide a lucrative new outlet for Canadian oil.
This year, for example, State Department officials struggled with how to respond to Mr. Elliott's request for a second meeting with Jose W. Fernandez, assistant secretary for economic, energy and business affairs.
“I definitely think that Fernandez should NOT meet with TransCanada folks at this point,” one e-mail said. Another said: “It would be unusual for an Assistant Secretary to meet twice with the same company in such a short time, and we wouldn't be sending a message that we're unwilling to meet since others of us will be meeting with them.”

Environmental groups have long argued that Mr. Elliott's lobbying of the State Department is a conflict of interest since they served as Mrs. Clinton's deputy national campaign director and chief of delegate selection in 2008.
The department has said the decision about whether to permit the pipeline “is not and will not be influenced by prior relationships that current government officials have had.”
In the first cache of e-mails, made public in September, State Department officials seem at times to advise TransCanada officials on how to maximize their chances for pipeline approval.
That tone continued on Dec. 14, when Ms. Verloop sent Mr. Elliott a copy of an article raising questions about their conflicts of interest with information about Mrs. Clinton's trip to Canada for a meeting of North American foreign ministers, noting: “Oversaw S's trip to Ottawa yesterday for the trilat. KXL not raised, but Doer flew back on the plane with her.“ Gary Doer is Canada's ambassador to the United States.
Mr. Elliott responded by saying the coverage made them ill.
Ms. Verloop replied: “Sorry for the stomach pains but at the end of the day it's precisely because you have connections that you're sought after and hired.” For emphasis, they added a frowning emoticon.
With a judge now checking to make sure the State Department complies with Friends of the Earth's document requests, Mr. Moglen anticipates more e-mails will be released. A final decision on the pipeline is expected by the end of the year.
Newark, New Jersey school official threatens to fire one third of district's teachers
By Rory Dean and Sandy English
20 March 2014
Newark, New Jersey Public Schools Superintendent Cami Anderson, citing falling student enrollment as well as budget shortfalls, announced their intention to lay off 1,000 of the city's 3,200 teachers over the next three years.
Anderson has made a formal request to the New Jersey Department of Education to allow them to “make performance a key factor,” as they explained in a recent letter to teachers, in determining which teachers they will fire. Under Anderson's plan, layoffs would first affect teachers who have been classified “ineffective,” one of four performance ratings that were established when teacher tenure laws were effectively dismantled last year, with the approval of the teachers union. As a result, seniority protection would have a minor role in determining which teachers would lose their jobs.
The public school system in Newark, the state's largest city, has been in state receivership since 1995. Newark, like other impoverished cities in New Jersey—Camden, Jersey City and Paterson—has had its schools placed under state control based on the pretext that this would boost abysmal graduation rates and improve educational quality.
The population of Newark is just under 300,000, and approximately one-third of the city's residents live at or below the federal poverty line. Even by the generous standards set by the federal authorities, more than half of the city's people live in or close to poverty.
The proposed layoffs are part of Anderson's One Newark plan, which calls for the closing of public schools and the granting of school property for the use of privately owned, publicly funded charter schools. By some estimates the plan hopes to enroll 40 percent of Newark's 40,000 students in charter schools by 2017.
The Newark Teachers Union (NTU) and its parent organization, American Federation of Teachers (AFT), claim to represent the interests of the teachers and of public education, and to oppose Anderson's plans. AFT President Randi Weingarten has written a letter to Chris Christie castigating Cami Anderson.
The record shows, however, that the NTU is neither interested in nor capable of defending teachers and students. The union has already played a central role in undermining teachers' seniority rights. The most recent contract between the union and the city eliminated annual raises for experience, standard for decades in American public schools, and abolished automatic pay increases for those teachers who obtained advanced degrees.
Far from opposing pro-business “school reform” AFT President Weingarten is appealing to the state's Republican governor to “work with the union” to impose these attacks.
Community opposition is growing to the plans to privatize schools and force public schools to compete for funding with charters. Last month Anderson outraged parents and teachers when they suspended four principals for speaking out against the plan for the expansion of charters and robbing public schools of badly needed space and resources.
There have been reports that some of the laid off Newark teachers will be replaced by lower-paid newcomers from the Teach for America (TFA) program. While the Newark Public Schools has denied that it plans to hire TFA teachers to replace veterans whom it has laid off, it would be in keeping with a national pattern of using TFA teachers to lower wages and teaching standards in schools nationally.
TFA teachers, most of whom are recent college graduates with little or no training, are regularly sent to some of the most impoverished school districts in the US, including districts in New Jersey such as Camden, Elizabeth, Orange, Passaic, Paterson and Trenton. TFA has been prominent in New York City's New Visions public schools, funded by the Gates Foundation.
The Gates Foundation and other billionaire philanthropies have been in the forefront of the charter school movement, which seeks to pit younger against older teachers, public schools against the privately run charters, and public school parents against those whose children attend charters.
The Walton Family Foundation (founded by the billionaire owners of WalMart) is moving into the charter school field in New Jersey. The Foundation is quoted on Bob Braun's Ledger, the blog of veteran New Jersey reporter Bob Braun, as saying, “Due to the impact of Teach For America's corps members and alumni in the region, the Walton Family Foundation announced that they will support the recruitment, training and support of nearly 370 Newark area teachers over the next two years.”
The suggestion that the young and inexperienced teachers from TFA can provide quality education to Newark's overwhelmingly poor and working class students is a bald-faced lie. The “ineffective” classification, which Anderson says will be the guide in carrying out layoffs, is simply a pretext to fire higher-paid educators and replace them with temporary teachers forced to work for lower wages and substantially reduced benefits. The National Education Policy Center reported earlier this year that over 50 percent of TFA teachers quit teaching after two years and 80 percent quit after three.
The privatization of education is the goal being pursued by Anderson and other education “reformers” throughout New Jersey. It is a part of a political program, championed by the Obama administration and shared by Republicans and Democrats, aimed at undermining and eventually destroying public education. Charter schools are designed to serve several related purposes. They aim to attract private investment in the expectation of becoming new profit centers sought by the super-rich. At the same time, they serve the political and ideological purpose of diverting attention from the massive budget cuts that are having a devastating impact on public schools.
The deepening neglect of public education then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and is used to argue for greater privatization. More and more of the shrinking public funding is given over to privately run institutions, while teachers, parents and whole working class communities are pitted against one another. The hedge fund billionaires and their media mouthpieces then emphasize the alleged distinctions between the “deserving” and “undeserving” poor, between those few lucky enough to get their children into schools funded by the Waltons and other billionaires, and the majority left behind who are castigated as indifferent to their children's needs.
Newark illustrates the bipartisan nature of charter school privatization. Cami Anderson was appointed by Chris Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, but is an ally of Democrat Cory Booker, Newark's former Mayor and currently US Senator from New Jersey. Booker was one of the key proponents of charter schools in Newark. In 2012, the Washington Post noted that Booker spoke with Christie “at the national policy meeting of the American Federation for Children. The federation's board chair is Betsy DeVos, a key member of the DeVos family, which has spent millions to support efforts to promote vouchers and promote reforms that are furthering the privatization of public education.”
Booker has in their relatively short career become the darling of the ruling establishment. Their business-friendly policies and role as an allegedly “centrist” Democrat in the mold of Barack Obama were credited with supposedly great improvements in Newark and helped propel them into the Senate in Washington last year.
Recently, however, the New Jersey state audit found that Linda Watkins-Brashear, a Booker appointee and close friend who ran the Newark Watershed Conservation and Development Corporation, “wrote unauthorized payroll checks to herself” and “handed out no-bid contracts worth millions of dollars.” The general counsel of the Corporation, another close Booker friend, made up to $400,000 without a contract of any kind.
This is the social layer, the grasping upper middle class seeking fame and fortune by serving the interests of the super-rich while supposedly representing the public that is behind the push for charter schools and all the political attacks on the working class. Whether Democrat or Republican, black or white, they represent no one but the billionaires, and the fight to achieve a decent education for all begins with the struggle against the two parties of the plutocracy and all of their spokespersons.

An Alabama woman was arrested Saturday after they lied about their former boyfriend breaking into their home, raping them then tying them up, police said.
Mariah Jordan Smith, 25, of Tuscaloosa, filed a police report alleging their former boyfriend entered their home unannounced, approached them in their bedroom and sexually assaulted her, Capt. Gary Hood of the Tuscaloosa County Metro Homicide Unit, told AL.com.
Smith said after they were sexually assaulted, the man tied their legs to their bed, secured their hands and left. The investigators discovered some of the statements Smith gave were false and looked into the claim further, AL.com reported.
Investigators contacted Smith's former boyfriend and discovered they were in a different state at the time of the alleged sexual assault. Law enforcement in the state they were visiting – they did not say where they were – corroborated their alibi, Hood said.
The former boyfriend's name was not released by police.
Smith was charged with “filing a false police report” and booked into Tuscaloosa County Jail, Tuscaloosa News reported. Smith was released after posting the $6,000 bail.
"Treaty of Montreal" redirects here. For other similarly named agreements, see Montreal Convention (disambiguation)
The Great Peace of Montreal (French: La Grande paix de Montréal) was a peace treaty between New France and 39 First Nations of North America. It was signed on August 4, 1701, by Louis-Hector de Callière, governor of New France, and 13 hundred representatives of 39 aboriginal nations.[1]
The French, allied to the Hurons and the Algonquians, provided 16 years of peaceful relations and trade before war started again.[citation needed] Present for the diplomatic event were the various peoples; part of the Iroquois confederacy, the Huron peoples, and the Algonquian peoples.[2]
This has sometimes been called the Grand Settlement of 1701,[3] not to be confused with the unrelated Act of Settlement 1701 in England.
Fur wars [ edit ]
The foundation of Quebec City in 1608 by Samuel de Champlain, one of the first governors of New France, marked the beginning of the systematic exploitation of the Great Northern forests by traders from Metropolitan France. Control over the fur trade became a high-stakes game among Native American tribes, as all of them wanted to be the Europeans' chosen intermediary. The "Fur Wars"-soon we see-the Hurons and Algonquins, supported by the French, pitted against the Iroquois of the powerful League of Five Nations, who were supported first by New Netherland, and later by the English when they took New Amsterdam in the 1660s and 1670s, renaming it New York City.
In the first half of the 17th century, the Dutch-allied Iroquois made substantial territorial gains against the French-allied Indians, often threatening French settlements at Montreal and Trois-Rivières. In an attempt to secure the colony, in 1665 the Carignan-Salières Regiment was sent to New France. Their campaign in 1666 devastated a number of Mohawk communities, who were forced to negotiate a peace. A period of prosperity followed for France's colony, but the Iroquois, now supported by the English, continued to expand their territory westward, fighting French allies in the Great Lakes region and again threatening the French fur trade. In the 1680s the French became actively involved in the conflict again, and they and their allied Indians made significant gains against the Iroquois, including incursions deep into the heartland of Iroquoia (present-day Upstate New York). After a devastating raid by the Iroquois against the settlement of Lachine in 1689, and the entry the same year of England into the Nine Years' War (known in the English colonies as King William's War), Governor Frontenac organized raiding expeditions against English communities all along the frontier with New France. French and English colonists, and their Indian allies, then engaged in a protracted border war that was formally ended when the Treaty of Ryswick was signed in 1697. The treaty, however, left unresolved the issue of Iroquois sovereignty (both France and England claimed them as part of their empire), and French allies in the upper Great Lakes continued to make war on the Iroquois.
Prelude to peace [ edit ]
The success of these attacks, which again reached deep into Iroquois territory, and the inability of the English to protect them from attacks originating to their north and west, forced the Iroquois to more seriously pursue peace. Their demographic decline, aided by conflicts and epidemics, put their very existence into doubt. At the same time, commerce became almost nonexistent because of a fall in the price of furs. The Indians preferred to trade with the merchants of New York because these merchants offered better prices than the French.
Preliminary negotiations took place in 1698 and 1699, but these were to some degree frustrated by the intervention of the English, who sought to keep the Iroquois from negotiating directly with the French. After another successful attack into Iroquoia in early 1700, these attempts at intervention failed. The first conference between the French and Iroquois was held on Iroquois territory at Onondaga in March 1700. In September of the same year, a preliminary peace treaty was signed in Montreal with the five Iroquois nations. Thirteen First Nations symbols are on the treaty. After this first entente, it was decided that a bigger one would be held in Montreal in the summer of 1701 and all Nations of the Great Lakes were invited. Selected French emissaries, clergies and soldiers, all well-perceived by the First Nations, were given this diplomatic task. The negotiations continued during the wait for the big conference; the neutrality of the Five Nations was discussed in Montreal in May 1701.The treaty of La Grande Paix de Montreal of July 21 to August 7 of 1701[4] was signed as a symbol of peace between the French and the First Nations. In the treaty, the First Nations agreed to remain peaceful between the French and the British during times of war together. It was a huge example of peace between different nations and honouring an agreement.
The entente [ edit ]
The first delegations arrived in Montreal at the beginning of the summer of 1701, often after long, hard journeys. The ratification of the treaty was not agreed to immediately, due to the discussions between the First Nations representatives and Governor Callière's dragging on, both sides being eager to negotiate as much as possible. The actual signing of the document took place on a big field prepared for the special occasion, just outside the city. The representatives of each Nation placed their clan's symbol, such as turtle, wolf or bear, at the bottom of the document. A great banquet followed the solemn occasion, with a peace pipe being shared by the chiefs, each of them praising peace in turn. This treaty, achieved through negotiations according to First Nations diplomatic custom, was meant to end ethnic conflicts. From then on, negotiation would trump direct conflict and the French would agree to act as arbiters during conflicts between signatory tribes. The Iroquois promised to be neutral in case of conflict between the French and English colonies.
Aftermath [ edit ]
The treaty was highly symbolic for the aboriginal nations as the Tree of Peace was now established among all the Great Lake nations.[4] Commerce and exploratory expeditions quietly resumed in peace after the signing of the treaty. The French explorer Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, Sieur de Cadillac left Montreal to explore the Great Lakes region, founding Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit (now Detroit) in July. Jesuit priests resumed their spiritual mission-based work in the north. The Great Peace of Montreal is a unique diplomatic event in the history of both North and South America. The treaty is still considered valid by the Indigenous people of the American First Nations tribes involved.[5]
The French, in negotiating followed their traditional policy in North and South America, where their relationship with some of the natives was characterized by mutual respect and admiration and based on dialogue and negotiation. According to the 19th-century historian Francis Parkman:" Spanish civilization crushed the Indian; English civilization scorned and neglected him; French civilization embraced and cherished him" [6]}}
Attendees and signatories [ edit ]
See "Nindoodemag": The Significance of Algonquian Kinship Networks in the Eastern Great Lakes Region, 1600-1701 (pp. 23-52) by Heidi Bohaker for a discussion of the significance of these pictographical signatures.
Commemoration [ edit ]
A square in Old Montreal was renamed Place de la Grande-Paix-de-Montréal to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the peace. Several locations in Quebec are named for the Petun leader Kondiaronk, one of the architects of the peace, including the Kondiaronk Belvedere in Mount Royal Park overlooking downtown Montreal.

Notes [ edit ]
Motorcycle fashions come and go, but the bobber has been around since the 1930s. In those days, it was known to speed-hungry Harley and Indian riders as a ‘cut down' or ‘bob job.' Fast forward 80 years, and the appeal of the bobber is still strong: Triumph is having difficulty meeting demand for its modern-day namesake.
BMW, though, is not a brand you'd associate with the stripped-down hardtail look. But this remarkable machine from Austria can hold its own against the finest from the USA and England. It even stacks up well against BMW's own official ‘R5 Hommage,' which we revealed a year ago.
The builder of this most unusual BMW bobber is Titan, a small shop based in the ancient university city of Graz. The picturesque alpine location makes for a good photoshoot, but the build itself was a little more troublesome.
According to lead tech Michael Siebenhofer, Titan don't have any inhibitions when it comes to structural changes. But this project was rather unusual: ‘Boxer goes Harley' is how they sum up the brief.
“All the technical parts had to be the finest—simple and modern,” they add. “But rear suspension? Nope.” The frame was to be as old as possible, preferably from World War 2, but the ignition should be electronic, for modern reliability.
In search of the right stance, Titan started calculating wheelbases, axle loads and steering head angles. “We thought a Wehrmacht edition R75 would work—without the sidecar, naturally. Then we found Herr Zink, an outstanding expert on old BMWs. We briefed them about our project, and after the second beer they convinced us to take any other ancient frame but the R75.” Apparently the R75 is made of low-quality steel—a corollary of the war years.
After another bier and a flick through BMW's historical literature, Titan decided to buy a 1956-vintage R50/3 frame stored in Herr Zink's attic. “It was not cheap,” Michael admits. “But buy cheap, buy twice.”
Back at the workshop in Graz, Michael and their crew removed the rear suspension from the R50 frame and devised a new mount for the cardan driveshaft. The hunt began for an engine and gearbox from the late 70s or early 80s, and an R75/7 was found for a reasonable price. “We kept the wheel hubs, the engine and transmission, and the fork tubes,” says Michael.
The forks were fitted with new seals and bushes, and modern Wirth springs slotted in. Then they were mated to the R50/3 frame with a 9° rake kit from the German specialist AME Chopper. The finishing comes from stunning alloy fork claddings—hand made over 70 hours by the famed Austrian metalworkers Blechmann.
The wheels are works of art too, with the original hubs restored and mated to new 18” rims with fresh spokes. The rubber is classic block-pattern Avon Mk II.
The old school tires will probably struggle to contain the power unless the rider has a gentle right hand: the 745cc boxer motor has been rebuilt with a Siebenrock Big Bore Kit, punching it out to 1070cc and delivering 70 stout German horses.
After a fresh coat of high temperature paint, it was shoehorned into the R50/3 chassis and plumbed in to new ceramic-coated pipes, topped off with gorgeous fishtails.
Vintage bobbers can be somewhat cantankerous, but with a Silent Hektik ignition system and a complete new electrical system, Titan's BMW should be free of gremlins.
At the heart is a Motogadget m.unit control box, feeding a Motoscope Tiny analog speedo (flushed into the Daytona headlamp bowl). The wide, old-style LSL bars are fitted with discreet m.switch buttons, plus Sguardo bar end blinkers from Rizoma.
It's the tank that's the crowning glory, though. Channeled to sit low on the frame top tube, it's a 4.5-gallon handmade meisterwerk with alloy side covers and grippy kneepads. A touch of candy blue lifts the classic paint scheme—dark blue with white pinstripes.
The seat is worthy of special mention too. Tooled from leather, with immaculate inlays and blue stitching, it's the work of the Greek outpost of Autostop—a global leather specialist that designs and produces leather interiors for Toyota, Ford and Chrysler.
Detailing like that makes this one of the coolest custom BMWs we've ever seen, and one of the best recent bobber builds, full stop. Granted, a modern KTM might navigate Austria's famous mountain passes a little faster—but we'd pick the laidback style of Titan's BMW bobber any day.

The National Security Agency has built a surveillance system capable of recording “100 percent” of a foreign country's telephone calls, according to people with direct knowledge of the effort and documents supplied by former contractor Edward Snowden.

The National Security Agency has built a surveillance system capable of recording “100 percent” of a foreign country's telephone calls, enabling the agency to rewind and review conversations as long as a month after they take place, according to people with direct knowledge of the effort and documents supplied by former contractor Edward Snowden.
A senior manager for the program compares it to a time machine — one that can replay the voices from any call without requiring that a person be identified in advance for surveillance.
The voice interception program, called MYSTIC, began in 2009. Its RETRO tool, short for “retrospective retrieval,” and related projects reached full capacity against the first target nation in 2011. Planning documents two years later anticipated similar operations elsewhere.
In the initial deployment, collection systems are recording “every single” conversation nationwide, storing billions of them in a 30-day rolling buffer that clears the oldest calls as new ones arrive, according to a classified summary.
The call buffer opens a door “into the past,” the summary says, enabling users to “retrieve audio of interest that was not tasked at the time of the original call.” Analysts listen to only a fraction of 1 percent of the calls, but the absolute numbers are high. Each month, they send millions of voice clippings, or “cuts,” for processing and long-term storage.
At the request of U.S. officials, The Washington Post is withholding details that could be used to identify the country where the system is being employed or other countries where its use was envisioned.
No other NSA program disclosed to date has swallowed a nation's telephone network whole. Outside experts have sometimes described that prospect as disquieting but remote, with notable implications for a growing debate over the NSA's practice of “bulk collection” abroad.
Bulk methods capture massive data flows “without the use of discriminants,” as President Obama put it in January. By design, they vacuum up all the data they touch — meaning that most of the conversations collected by RETRO would be irrelevant to U.S. national security interests.
Obama and changes at NSA On Jan. 17, President Obama called for significant changes to the way the NSA collects and uses telephone records of U.S. citizens. Read a transcript of their remarks.
Here is the report from the five-member Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies, which contains 40-plus recommendations on the NSA. Read it.
In the view of U.S. officials, however, the capability is highly valuable.
In a statement, Caitlin Hayden, spokesperson for the National Security Council, declined to comment on “specific alleged intelligence activities.” Speaking generally, they said that “new or emerging threats” are “often hidden within the large and complex system of modern global communications, and the United States must consequently collect signals intelligence in bulk in certain circumstances in order to identify these threats.”
NSA spokesperson Vanee Vines, in an e-mailed statement, said that “continuous and selective reporting of specific techniques and tools used for legitimate U.S. foreign intelligence activities is highly detrimental to the national security of the United States and of our allies, and places at risk those we are sworn to protect.”
Some of the documents provided by Snowden suggest that high-volume eavesdropping may soon be extended to other countries, if it has not been already. The RETRO tool was built three years ago as a “unique one-off capability,” but last year's secret intelligence budget named five more countries for which the MYSTIC program provides “comprehensive metadata access and content,” with a sixth expected to be in place by last October.
The budget did not say whether the NSA now records calls in quantity in those countries or expects to do so. A separate document placed a high priority on planning “for MYSTIC accesses against projected new mission requirements,” including “voice.”
Ubiquitous voice surveillance, even overseas, pulls in a great deal of content from Americans who telephone, visit and work in the target country. It may also be seen as inconsistent with Obama's Jan. 17 pledge “that the United States is not spying on ordinary people who don't threaten our national security,” regardless of nationality, “and that we take their privacy concerns into account.”
In a presidential policy directive, Obama instructed the NSA and other agencies that bulk acquisition may be used only to gather intelligence related to one of six specified threats, including nuclear proliferation and terrorism. The directive, however, also noted that limits on bulk collection “do not apply to signal intelligence data that is temporarily acquired to facilitate targeted collection.”
The emblem of the MYSTIC program depicts a cartoon wizard with a telephone-headed staff. Among the agency's bulk collection programs disclosed over the past year, its focus on the spoken word is unique. Most of the programs have involved the bulk collection of metadata — which does not include call content — or text, such as e-mail address books.
Telephone calls are often thought to be more ephemeral and less suited than text for processing, storage and search. And there are indications that the call-recording program has been hindered by the NSA's limited capacity to store and transmit bulky voice files.
In the first year of its deployment, a program officer wrote that the project “has long since reached the point where it was collecting and sending home far more than the bandwidth could handle.”
Because of similar capacity limits across a range of collection programs, the NSA is leaping forward with cloud-based collection systems and a gargantuan new “mission data repository” in Utah. According to its overview briefing, the Utah facility is designed “to cope with the vast increases in digital data that have accompanied the rise of the global network.”
Christopher Soghoian, the principal technologist for the American Civil Liberties Union, said history suggests that “over the next couple of years they will expand to more countries, retain data longer and expand the secondary uses.”
Spokesmen for the NSA and the office of Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. declined to confirm or deny expansion plans or discuss the criteria for any change.
Based on RETRO's internal reviews, the NSA has a strong motive to deploy it elsewhere. In the documents and in interviews, U.S. officials said RETRO is uniquely valuable when an analyst uncovers a new name or telephone number of interest.
With up to 30 days of recorded conversations in hand, the NSA can pull an instant history of the subject's movements, associates and plans. Some other U.S. intelligence agencies also have access to RETRO.
Highly classified briefings cite examples in which the tool offered high-stakes intelligence that would not have existed under traditional surveillance programs in which subjects are identified for targeting in advance. In contrast with most of the government's public claims about the value of controversial programs, the briefings supply names, dates, locations and fragments of intercepted calls in convincing detail.
Present and former U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to provide context for a classified program, acknowledged that large numbers of conversations involving Americans would be gathered from the country where RETRO operates.
The NSA does not attempt to filter out their calls, defining them as communications “acquired incidentally as a result of collection directed against appropriate foreign intelligence targets.”
Until about 20 years ago, such incidental collection was unusual unless an American was communicating directly with a foreign intelligence target. In bulk collection systems, which are exponentially more capable than the ones in use throughout the Cold War, calls and other data from U.S. citizens and permanent residents are regularly ingested by the millions.
Under the NSA's internal “minimization rules,” those intercepted communications “may be retained and processed” and included in intelligence reports. The agency generally removes the names of U.S. callers, but there are several broadly worded exceptions.
An independent group tasked by the White House to review U.S. surveillance policies recommended that incidentally collected U.S. calls and e-mails — including those obtained overseas — should nearly always “be purged upon detection.” Obama did not accept that recommendation.
Vines, in their statement, said the NSA's work is “strictly conducted under the rule of law.”
RETRO and MYSTIC are carried out under Executive Order 12333, the traditional grant of presidential authority to intelligence agencies for operations outside the United States.
Since August, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the chairperson of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and others on that panel have been working on plans to assert a greater oversight role for intelligence-gathering abroad. Some legislators are considering whether Congress should also draft new laws to govern those operations.
Experts say there is not much legislation that governs overseas intelligence work.
“Much of the U.S. government's intelligence collection is not regulated by any statute passed by Congress,” said Timothy H. Edgar, the former director of privacy and civil liberties on Obama's national security staff. “There's a lot of focus on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which is understandable, but that's only a slice of what the intelligence community does.”
All surveillance must be properly authorized for a legitimate intelligence purpose, they said, but that “still leaves a gap for activities that otherwise basically aren't regulated by law, because they're not covered by FISA.”
Beginning in 2007, Congress loosened 40-year-old restrictions on domestic surveillance because so much foreign data crossed U.S. territory. There were no comparable changes to protect the privacy of U.S. citizens and residents whose calls and e-mails now routinely cross international borders.
Vines noted that the NSA's job is to “identify threats within the large and complex system of modern global communications,” in which ordinary people share fiber-optic cables with legitimate intelligence targets.
For Peter Swire, a member of the president's review group, the fact that Americans and foreigners use the same devices, software and networks calls for greater care to safeguard Americans' privacy.
“It's important to have institutional protections so that advanced capabilities used overseas don't get turned against our democracy at home,” they said.

MOSCOW — It was once protected by ice. Now regulation will have to do the work.
The governments of the five countries with coastline on the Arctic have concluded that enough of the polar ice cap now melts regularly in the summertime that an agreement regulating commercial fishing near the North Pole is warranted.
Talks are scheduled for later this month among diplomats and fisheries officials from Norway, Denmark, Canada, the United States and Russia. Most concern is focused on newly ice-free waters above the Bering Strait, above the exclusive economic zones of Russia and the United States, and now accessible to trawler fleets from hungry Pacific Ocean nations like China and Japan.
An accord would protect the open water until the fish stocks there can be more fully studied.
Though supported by conservationists, the agreement's principal intention is not to conserve this new fish habitat, formed by the receding of polar ice as the world warms up. The intention of an accord, backed by fishing industries in the coastal nations, is to manage for commercial exploitation any stocks of fish that already inhabit the ocean but used to live under the ice, like Arctic cod, as well as fish that may migrate into the new ice-free zone from farther south, as the ocean warms.
Russia had been a holdout in the negotiations, started by the United States five years ago. But the upper chamber of Russia's Parliament, the Federation Council, signaled support for the agreement last year. Talks are scheduled to begin on April 29 in Washington, the State Department has confirmed.
Vancouver's new 10-year housing strategy, a plan more than 14 months in the making, covers a lot of ground.
The Housing Vancouver Strategy, unveiled Thursday less than a year out from a civic election in which housing is expected to be the top issue, touches on everything from creating affordable housing and taming speculation, to expediting the approval process and combating homelessness.
Of particular interest to observers is the city's proposal for the “transformation of low-density neighbourhoods,” which would see parts of the city zoned for single-family houses — almost 80 per cent of Vancouver's residential land — opened up to other housing options such as townhouses and row-houses.
Gil Kelley, the city's general manager of planning, said the new housing strategy includes “big moves” that haven't been done before in Vancouver.
Among them is the idea of setting home production goals based on local income levels, Kelley said, “So we're actually meeting the needs of Vancouverites, and not only for investors. That's a big shift.”
“The underpinning here, philosophically, is to make sure that Vancouver remains a place for all people, all incomes,” Kelley told reporters Thursday at city hall.
“That's why we have this fairly ambitious number of 72,000 new units over 10 years.”
To compare that “fairly ambitious number” of 72,000 new Vancouver homes over 10 years, just the day before the federal government unveiled its own national housing strategy, with dual events in Vancouver and Toronto, setting a goal of 100,000 new housing units over 10 years across Canada.
Vancouver's target of 72,000 new homes over 10 years represents a 50 per cent increase in supply over current trends, according to the city's numbers, and that number is almost a quarter of the roughly 284,000 total dwellings in the city as of 2016.
Of the 72,000 new units, Vancouver aims to add 10,000 ground-level homes such as townhouses into single-family neighbourhoods over the next decade.
“That's a good chunk over the next 10 years,” said Nathan Lauster, an associate professor at UBC whose recent book The Death and Life of the Single-Family House examines Vancouver's changing neighbourhoods. “This is more ambitious than we've seen them do before in terms of densifying (single-family neighbourhoods).”
For context, last year the city had 109,260 ground-oriented dwellings, according to city statistics. That means the 10,000 new ground-level homes proposed by the city Thursday would represent a 10 per cent increase over the current number.
“I'm encouraged by this, opening up what is a lot of city land for more diverse sorts of housing that will also hopefully become much more affordable to a much wider range of people,” Lauster said Thursday after reviewing the city's plan.
The city, Lauster said, is trying to fill in the so-called “missing middle,” medium-density housing types that can add people and vibrancy to an area, without drastically changing the feel of the neighbourhood. “The whole idea behind this is not to see towers everywhere … I don't think we're looking at turning into Tokyo overnight.”
Still, neighbourhood changes on the scale proposed Thursday would have been hard to imagine in the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s when Gordon Price was a Vancouver councillor, Price told Postmedia Thursday.
“RS1 was untouchable,” Price said, referring to the classification of zoning for single-family houses. “So this is a big deal.”
But Price believes it has taken the city “way, way too long” for both the densification of single-family neighbourhoods and the release of such a comprehensive housing strategy.
“Maybe there's going to be some debate and conflict here,” they said. “But you might as well have had it five years ago.”
Mike Harcourt, who worked on several major Vancouver housing initiatives between 1973 and 1986 first as alderman then as mayor, told Postmedia Thursday: “The dream of single-family house ownership in Vancouver, that hasn't existed for a long time.”
Harcourt believes that even in neighbourhoods like Dunbar, West Point Grey, and Kerrisdale — which they consider the staunchest “defenders of the single-family neighbourhood” — residents are more open to change and density now than they were only a few years ago.
“I've noticed a shift of mood in people in those neighbourhoods, just over the last few years,” Harcourt said. It's possible, they said, that perspectives are changing in those neighbourhoods because older homeowners looking to downsize want more diverse housing options, as do their adult children with young families.
Dunbar and Kerrisdale are both cited in a release Thursday from the city, as examples of neighbourhoods in need of “revitalization,” where this year's census data showed declines in children and overall population.
“We need to restore the vitality to a lot of those neighbourhoods in a creative way, but not just bulldoze everything down and build three- and four-storey apartments,” Harcourt said. “There's a way you can do these changes that don't destroy the quality of life and livability of these neighbourhoods, but make them energized.”

Archaeologists in northern France have unearthed the bodies of 21 German soldiers from World War One in an elaborate underground shelter that was destroyed in a French attack in March 1918, and hasn't been opened since.
Individual war casualties are still frequently found during construction work on the former Western front battlefields of France and Belgium, but the discovery of so many soldiers in one location is rare.
The tomb, poignant and grisly, sheds light on the lives of the soldiers who died in explosions from heavy shells that penetrated the tunnel.
"It's a bit like Pompeii," Michaël Landolt, the French archaeologist leading the dig, told SPIEGEL ONLINE. "Everything collapsed in seconds and is just the way it was at the time. This is an extraordinary find."
The men were from the 6th Company of the "Reserve Infanterie Regiment 94." Their bodies had been left in the dugout because retrieving them was deemed too dangerous. A total of 34 men in the shelter were killed in the attack. Troops managed to haul out 13 of the dead at the time.
The roof of the "Killian Shelter," a tunnel 125 meters (410 feet) long near the small town of Carspach in the Alsace region, was discovered by chance in October 2010 during excavation work for a nearby road building project. The regional French archaeological authority, PAIR, began a thorough dig last month and expects to complete its work by mid-November.
Pipes, Wallets and a Rosary
The tunnel, six meters underground and 1.80 meters high, was built with German thoroughness, equipped with heating, telephone connections, electricity, beds and a pipe to pump out water. It had 16 exits and was big enough to hold up to 500 men in an emergency.
The archaeologists have uncovered the sides, floors and stairways, all made from heavy timber. The intended permanence of the structure shows how static the fighting was for most of the war, in which both sides built vast trench systems that stretched 440 miles from the Swiss border to the North Sea.
Boots, helmets and weapons, a wine bottle and a mustard jar have been found along with personal items including dog tags, wallets, pipes, cigarette cases, spectacles and pocket books. A rosary was also found, with a French bullet threaded in among the prayer beads, evidently fashioned as a souvenir.
"The items will be taken to a laboratory, cleaned and examined," said Landolt. It is unclear whether the booklets found are diaries or identity papers.
The skeleton of a goat was also discovered. It may have been held as a source of fresh milk.
Scant Interest From German Public
In Britain, the discovery of such a mass grave would be front-page news. Journalists would track down the descendants of the dead soldiers and tell the stories of the Tommies who made the ultimate sacrifice in the horrific conflict that shaped the 20th century.
That was what happened in 2009, when mass graves containing 250 Australian and British soldiers were unearthed near the village of Fromelles, close to the city of Lille. A program was launched to identify the remains through DNA matching, and 110 have been identified by name after over 2,000 relatives responded to calls for DNA samples.
In Germany, it's a very different story. The find has only made the inside pages of a handful of newspapers. In the nation's memory, the war is eclipsed by World War II, the Holocaust and the collective guilt that weighs on Germany to this day. Both conflicts have imbued Germany with a deep streak of pacifism.
"Britain, France and Belgium still refer to it as the Great War, but our memory of it is totally buried by World War II with the Holocaust, the expulsion from the east, the Allied bombardment," Fritz Kirchmeier, spokesperson for the German War Graves Commission, told SPIEGEL ONLINE. "World War I plays only a minor role in the German national memory."
The Commission is holding out little hope that it will be able to track down the families of the dead.
"We haven't reached anyone yet and it will be very hard, as you can imagine, given the time that has lapsed," said Kirchmeier. "It's a difficult business that involves contacting local registry offices."
It would not appear to be an insurmountable problem, though, if the public interest was there. The names and dates and places of birth of all the 21 soldiers are known. Their dog tags have been found. The soldiers include Musketeer Martin Heidrich from Schönfeld, aged 20, Private Harry Bierkamp, born Jan. 18, 1896 in Hamburg, and Lieutenant August Hütten from Aachen, aged 37.
A memorial stone bearing their names stands in the nearby German war cemetery of Illfurth. The Commission will rebury the bodies in the cemetery unless it manages to contact descendants and they decide to have the remains repatriated to Germany.
Mustard Gas and Heavy Shells
Jürgen Ehret, a German who is assisting the French authorities in the Killian dig, has researched the history of the front line in this region of Alsace, which was quiet compared with the battlefronts further north, whose names evoke the mechanized slaughter that marked the war -- Verdun, the Somme, Artois and Ypres. An estimated 15 million people were killed and 20 million wounded in what was described as "the war to end all wars."
"The French attacked the shelter with aerial mines with delayed-action fuses that penetrated the ground and blasted in the side wall of the shelter in two points," said Ehret.
The French bombardment lasted six hours and the special mines, fired up almost vertical in a high arc, proved too much for the supposedly bomb-proof Killian dugout. The French attack followed a three-hour German artillery barrage with shells containing mustard gas.
The remains of around 10 to 20 German soldiers from the war are usually found in France and Belgium each year, said Kirchmeier.
For Commonwealth soldiers, the average is 35, which isn't surprising given that more than 165,000 of them are still unaccounted for on the Western Front.
"The Fromelles operation was a good example of the level of public interest, which was extraordinary," Peter Francis, spokesperson for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, told SPIEGEL ONLINE. The identification process couldn't have been as effective as it was without that public engagement, they added.
Interest in the World War I has always been strong in Britain and has intensified with the deaths of the last veterans in recent years, and with the emergence of the Internet, which has made it easer to trace the location of the graves of fallen ancestors. A further boost is likely to come in the run-up to the centenary of the outbreak in 2014.
It remains to be seen whether that anniversary will fan interest in Germany as well, said Kirchmeier. By that time, the Killian shelter will have vanished again, under a road. But the men who died in it, forgotten or not, will at least have found a worthy resting place.
CLEVELAND—In a poignant and moving address Wednesday night at the Republican National Convention, Indiana governor Mike Pence recounted the emotional story of a longtime friend of theirs who was aborted shortly after their second trimester. “I'd like to take a moment to share the heartbreaking story of a dear friend of mine who was tragically aborted at 21 weeks,” said Pence, pausing to compose themselves while recalling how much they learned from their old companion and confidant, including an appreciation for quiet reflection and personal growth, before their close friend endured the hardship of being forcibly removed from the uterus. “I'll never forget meeting them a few days after they implanted into the uterine wall. They were just a little guy. But they and I quickly became the best of friends, and we shared a special bond. From the start, I could tell they were destined for greatness, but unfortunately, due to factors outside their control, things ended up taking a downturn for him, and they never made it to term. Every single day I cherish the friendship we had.” Pence then admitted to the crowd that, to this day, they still get choked up every time they pass by their friend's old womb.
Famed bantamweight fighter Ronda Rousey once again jumped into the ring after a long hiatus from fighting, only for opponent Amanda Nunes to best them in a mere 48 seconds. After the fight liberals jumped to social media with glee to mock Rousey and to attack them for their supposed “white privilege.”
After a devastating loss to Holly Holm in 2015, Rousey tried for a come back by facing Brazilian Nunes at the T-Mobile Arena in Paradise, Nevada, on December 30. But the nearly immediate KO they experienced became fodder for mocking.
A variety of mean memes mocked Rousey, such as those likening their pummeled face to the famous “The Scream” painting and other jokes. Even pop singer Justin Bieber jumped in to mock the female fighter. But the perceived “white privilege” upset liberals the most.
Rousey, whose name is far bigger than their opponent's and who also had a lot more at stake, upset liberals by receiving $3 million for the fight while their relatively unknown opponent, Amanda Nunes, only got $200,000 for the bout. Liberals deemed the disparity in take an example of “white privilege.”

Ravi Shastri: 'The game has to evolve, hard decisions have to be taken, such is life' © Getty Images
Should Kohli replace Dhoni as India's limited-overs captain? Yes
No, Dhoni should remain captain
No, look beyond Kohli and Dhoni See results »
Former India team director and allrounder Ravi Shastri has said Virat Kohli is ready to take over the captaincy from MS Dhoni across all formats, and this is the right time to make the switch "in the interest of Indian cricket".
Kohli already captains India in Test cricket, from which Dhoni has retired, but Dhoni still leads in the shorter formats. Given India play a lot more Tests than limited-overs cricket in the coming months, Shastri said "the gaps" in play for Dhoni will be hard on him. They said they would "definitely be thinking" of naming Kohli captain across formats if they were a selector.
"I definitely think so [Kohli should be given the job across formats]," Shastri told India Today Television. "You have to see where India is going to go three years down the line. There are no major events till about three years down the line when you are back with the World Cup. So, this is your best time to think and build.
"India play hardly any one-day cricket if you see the next 18 months-two years, and the gaps between Tests and ODIs are massive. So, here's your time to look ahead and see what you can do with an Indian side all-round three years down the line. If I am the chairperson of selectors, I would be thinking in that direction, no question about it."
'Virat is a very thorough captain' - Ashwin Speaking to Hindustan Times, India offspinner R Ashwin lauded Virat Kohli's captaincy. "Virat is a very thorough captain. They do their homework before the game," Ashwin said. "We do a lot of team meetings before the game, there's a lot of honesty around. That gives me the confidence and interest while going out on the field. They give me enough freedom to express myself and take control of what fields I want to set and how I want to bowl."
Shastri admitted it would be a tough call to make, but said it would be for the good of Indian cricket. "It's a catch 22, it's a hard decision, but I would be thinking about it from now.
"The game has to evolve, hard decisions have to be taken, such is life. And nothing wrong in that, it is in the interest of Indian cricket. If you see down the line and you think Dhoni is still the best captain, keep them as captain. But the issue here are the breaks [between Tests and ODIs], and do you have a guy ready [to succeed Dhoni]. My answer is you have a guy ready."
Shastri had worked with the Indian team as director for two years, from August 2014 till the 2016 World T20. Dhoni had captained the team across formats till December 2014, when they retired from Test cricket mid-series in Australia. Kohli took over as Test captain from the New Year's Test against Australia in Sydney in January 2015. Shastri said Dhoni could still contribute in limited-overs cricket as a player, if they are freed of the responsibilities of captaincy.
"By no stretch of imagination you are taking anything away from Dhoni [by making Kohli captain]. They can still contribute massively as a player. I think the time has come for to allow them to enjoy themselves and enjoy the game.
"End of the day, it is about how hungry Dhoni is, how passionate they are, whether the juices still go as in wanting to play for India. Also the time has come where you have a guy whom you have groomed over a period of time. Virat is ready."

You've probably made a pretty significant time investment throughout your Spanish journey to internalize the verb conjugations: Yo prefiero (I prefer), tú querías (you wanted), él deseó (he wished).
What your Spanish teacher forgot to tell you is that natives rarely start their sentences with subject pronouns.
Subject pronouns in English have the essential job of establishing who we're talking about (I, you, he, she, it, we, they). In Spanish, however, this role got taken over by conjugations (verb endings).
Using subject pronouns when they're not required is like going back to your job after they fire you:
—¡Buenos días, Rodríguez! Tú has madrugado mucho hoy.
“Good morning, Rodríguez! You (came in) really early today.” —Oye, ¿pero a ti no te habían despedido?
“(Say), hadn't they fired you?” —Ellos son unos bromistas. ¡Ja, ja, ja! ¿Tú quieres un café?
“They‘re (a bunch of) jokers. Ha, ha, ha! Do you want a coffee?”
It's just awkward.
After the takeover, subject pronouns in Spanish (yo, tú, usted, él, ella, nosotros, nosotras, vosotros, vosotras, ustedes, ellos, ellas) found their market niche by providing three specific services:
Unless you're deliberately trying to accomplish one of these goals, omit the subject pronouns.
Let's look at each goal in action.
1. Warning about an impending subject change
—¿Qué tal te llevas con Alberto?
“How are you getting along with Alberto?” —Me cae genial.
“He strikes me (as an awesome guy).”
This is a perfectly native response. The conjugation does all the heavy lifting (3rd person singular).
However, starting the sentence with él, would suggest that you're surreptitiously comparing them to someone else:
—Él me cae genial.
“He strikes me (as an awesome guy).” —Ah. ¿Y Fátima?
“Oh. And Fátima?”
Your listener now thinks that there is somebody else you don't like. Either avoid the pronoun, or bring up both subjects at the same time:
—A ver. Él me cae genial, pero Fátima es muy pesada.
“Let's see. They strike me (as an awesome guy), but Fátima is really annoying.”
2. Shining a spotlight on the subject
An obvious spotlight when you speak in English is changing the volume or the duration of the pronoun. In Spanish, you can get the same emphasis by simply adding the pronoun:
—Vamos a ver. ¿Tú qué quieres hacer?
“Let's see. What do you want to do?” —No sé. Tú me dijiste que querías ir al cine.
“I don't know. You told me that you wanted to go to the cinema.”
Another excellent use case for pronouns is establishing the identity of a subject who is right in front of you:
—Tú eres el novio de Carmen, ¿verdad?
You‘re Carmen's boyfriend, right? —Sí. ¿Y vosotras sois sus amigas?
Yeah. And you are them friends?
If the subject is not right in front of you, you don't actually need the pronoun: Ese es el novio de Carmen (that (guy) is Carmen's boyfriend).
If the goal of your sentence is to determine who the subject is, you will sound super Spanish if you save the pronoun until the very end.
—¿Y por qué no viene a buscarte él?
“And why doesn't they come to get you?” —No sé, pero como no me vaya ya no llego. ¿Los platos los lavas tú, porfa?
“I don't know, but if I don't leave now I won't arrive (in time). (Can) you wash the dishes, (pretty please)?”
3. Facilitating the giving and asking of advice
Using a subject pronoun is a very efficient tool to convey your interest in someone else's opinion:
—No sé si llamarla. ¿Tú qué harías en mi lugar?
“I don't know if (I should) call them What would you do in my place?” —Mira. Yo me iría a dormir y la llamaría mañana.
“Look. I would go to sleep and I'd call them tomorrow.”
You can also take a more empathetic tone by using the present tense in the second person and sticking the pronoun in front:
—No sé si llamarla. ¿Tú qué harías en mi lugar?
“I don't know if (I should) call them What would you do in my place?” —Mira. Tú te vas a dormir y la llamas mañana.
“Look. You go to sleep and you call them tomorrow.”
This second-person technique is a softer alternative to direct commands: Vete a dormir y llámala mañana.
Spanish takeaways
If you want your Spanish to sound more native, be deliberate when you use your subject pronouns: to warn your listener about other subjects, to emphasize, and to exchange advice.
At the beginning it might feel super weird to not use subject pronouns all the time, but after a while I promise it will feel more natural than skinny dipping.

• Four suspects from Lebanon detained on the Caribbean island • Others from Curacao, Cuba, Venezuela and Colombia
Seventeen people were arrested in Curacao for alleged involvement in a drug trafficking ring with connections to Hezbollah, police in the Dutch Caribbean island said today.
The suspects detained yesterday include four people from Lebanon and others from Curacao, Cuba, Venezuela and Colombia, police chief Carlos Casseres said at a news conference.
Some of the proceeds, funneled through informal Middle Eastern banks, went toward supporting groups linked to the militant Hezbollah organization in Lebanon, according to Casseres. The smuggling ring also allegedly forwarded requests from Lebanon for arms to be shipped from South America.
"We have been able to establish that this group has relations with international criminal organizations that have connections with the Hezbollah," prosecutor Ludmila Vicento said.
Island officials said the US and the Netherlands are helping them to investigate the alleged Hezbollah connection.
Two shipments of cocaine totaling 2,000 kilograms (4,400 pounds) have been seized from the ring in Curacao since the beginning of last year. The traffickers used cargo ships and speed boats to import the drugs from Colombia and Venezuela for shipment to Africa and beyond to Europe, according to Curacao authorities.
Several countries including the United States participated in the investigation leading to the arrests.
Authorities with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the US consulate in Curacao said they could not immediately comment on the case.
Well, in case you haven't heard, the Flash Professional authoring tool is transforming and becoming Adobe Animate CC!
The Flash Professional team has responded to the increasing demand for animation formats that leverage web technologies, by adding first-class support for exporting animations to HTML5, built on top of the open-source CreateJS library which is very popular, and produces lightweight, performant code that is human-readable. Animate CC will increasingly emphasise features for animators creating content for the web, and will of course continue to support and output for SWF and AIR too.

Adobe Stock Integration. Browse and license images, photos, and vector graphics
Creative Cloud Libraries. Access colors, vector graphics and brushes directly in Animate CC
Vector art brushes. Modify the path of a stroke after it's been drawn, and scale them to any resolution without losing quality. You can also make custom brushes and import brushes created with Adobe Capture CC
Improved pencils and brushes. Draw smooth, precise vector outlines along a curve and get faster live previews
4K+ video export. Export videos with custom resolutions for the latest Ultra HD and HiDPI displays
Custom resolution export. Revitalize older content by resizing and optimizing them for any resolution, such as Ultra HD and HiDPI displays
Easier audio syncing. Control audio looping directly on the timeline, without having to code
360° rotatable canvas. Rotate the canvas on any pivot point as you draw to get the perfect angle and strokes
Faster color changing. Naming tagged colors lets you change one color and have it automatically update your entire project
Colored onion skinning. Easily orchestrate complex animations now that adjacent frames can have different color and alpha values
.OAM support. Export your project as an .OAM file for easy importing to Adobe Muse, InDesign, DPS and Dreamweaver.
Here's a video from my colleague, Michael Chaize that gives a sneak peek at some of those new features:
Animate CC will be with us in early 2016.
I had a mission. I had to deliver this big tree to Erik, who in turn will deliver it to Nathan, in California.
Let me tell you about its world and about Texas Radio and the Big Beat. It comes out of the Virginia swamps, cool and slow, with perfect precision. With a backbeat, narrow and hard to master. Sorry, click this YouTube link and you'll understand that reference.
Here's the story of the tree, it's a crepe myrtle, a big crepe myrtle. My friend Ryan, or, as they are more popularly known as, The Mighty Thor, collected it one fine winter day.
That is indeed them and their wife. Their YouTube handle is EveryDayThor. Here's one of the best Videos he's posted. If it were still stylish to say it, I would say that you will “lol” after watching it. Or even rotflyao. I know I did.
Anyway, crepe myrtles are used often in the Florida landscape and this is a big one, as I might have said already. Ryan developed it for years. Then they gave it to me; they aren't able to take care of it, with all their traveling and superhero-ing. I couldn't take it and keep it though. I told them I'd take care of it until they could again, or we found a buyer. Then, after the alien invasion was thwarted and their half brother was imprisoned, they were able to take it back. It's been a few years but they finally found a buyer. In California. But Ryan had no way to ship it. So it went to Schley's Nursery in Deland and then back to me and then, from my nursery, I was to take it to Wigert's. Erik is driving to California next spring, to deliver it to Nathan. Seems convoluted but it's simple really. And the excuse for taking the tre was the 2015 Wigert's Bonsai open house.
Eris open house was last weekend and that's the beginning of a truly fine weekend. Finer than frogs hair, I'd say. Down to the 2015 Wigert's annual open house, in N. Ft. Myers FL fearturing Marc Noelander, of the famous European show, the Noelander's Trophy.
The pic above is from Wigert's Bonsai's Facebook page. I've stolen quite a few pics from there for this post. That's the tree Marc will do a demo on.
I drove down with my friend from Cincy, Evan.
I had two stops (plus that tiki man to deliver) before the open house. First, an initial consultation with Marty involving building a landscape scene with this house-
and this mountain-
Which should be interesting.
And then I had a private carving session with Mike. They had lots of trees. This is just one, their sea hibiscus that needed some serious work.
The initial carving.
It's a little black now because I had to torch it a bit, but it'll look good with a few coats of lime sulfur. This might help you see the detail, here it is in black and white.
I worked on quite a few trees, about five hours worth I believe. I think Mike (who is the Bsf president) will be writing an article for the Florida Bonsai magazine to promote the 2016 Bsf Annual Convention (on Memorial Day weekend). I'll be giving a bring-your-own-tree carving workshop. Check it out, the registration will be opening soon (Bonsai-Bsf.com). The headliners are Bjorn Bjorholm and Juan Andrade. Both spectacular artists and stylists.
Getting back to some more of the carving, here's a buttonwood I refined. Before.
And after.
After my session with Mike, we had to rush to our hotel to get a good nights sleep for the big weekend.
Sunset from the Pt. Charlotte bridge on the way to the hotel.
Bright and early the next morning, after arriving at Erik's nursery, I was greeted by a nice surprise: two fans, one wearing an American Bonsai Tools t-shirt.
We're taking over the market….
On the schedule for today was a workshop that Evan was taking with Ed Trout, the Gentleman of Bonsai. These three pics are by Ed's sister, Pamela.
Sweet tree, it's a kaneshiro ficus. Ed is, by far, one of the best teachers in Florida. If you can't find what you're looking to learn, in Florida, from him, maybe bonsai isn't your thing, because Ed is a treasure trove of knowledge and experience.
There was also a demo by Marc, at 9 am, which they kept complaini…uh, wondering about. They couldn't understand why anyone in their right mind would attend a demo at 9am. Of course it was a full house.
Jason Osborne was assisting him.
I had Jason over for a Studygroup meeting not long ago. We will see more of them when I show you Sunday's highlights.
There were many old friends (literally and figuratively) as well as new ones too.
This is JJ, owner of Old Florida Bonsai with their husband, Richard (that's the nursery where I carved the big podocarpus in this post)
A view into Erik's collection.
The raffle lady, Angela, peddling hopes and dreams of bonsai raffle victory to all the attendees. You can't win, after all, if you don't have a ticket. She's really good at their job. As you can see.
It helps when you have Marc's finished demo tree on the raffle table too. Boobs only get you so far.
Oh my Lordy, that's a beautiful tree. It's a parsonii juniper. I know at least one guy who put $200 worth of tickets in there (that would be 50 tickets, $5 each, or 5 for $20). I even put some in.
Then it was time for lunch. Erik gives away free hot dogs for those so inclined. Tony, my brother from another mother, handles the wieners.
There's a joke there but I'll let you make it. Tony is Angela's husband.
Tony had a gift for me, a sweet ilex vomitoria “schillings”.
Thank you sir. Look for a post on it next spring.
The event has gotten so big that there was even press coverage. Here's Erik, answering questions and, of course, sending the reporter towards the free food, cuz that's what reporters look for first.
They can smell those dogs cooking. I think they even asked where the beer was. Let's hope they write a good story because, sadly, there wasn't any.
The afternoon brought a demo by the First Couple of Florida bonsai, Dorothy Schmitz and Ernie Fernandez.
Ernie worked on a buttonwood and Dorothy a juniper.
Those trees got a lot of tickets as well. Needless to say, I didn't win any raffle trees.
At the same time as the dual demo, Marc leads a workshop on huge podocarpus.
They provided a sketch of the future look they saw in every tree. That really helps a student to see what should come next.
And other than some serious rain…..
(That's the parking area)
….and some hobbit feet from Seth. The day was done.
It was time to wind down. I was able to finagle my way in with some serious dinner companions.
From the left, Mr. and Mrs. Harris. Mrs. and Mr. Kreig, Glen Lord (of the famous Lordiculture Empire), John Powell (who was there installing another facet of Erik's Japanese garden, I'll show you that later), Marc, me, and Evan.
We went to a place called Ford's Garage.
Basically a burger joint in beautiful downtown Ft. Myers. The food is good but don't get the tuna steak sandwich. Trust me.
Then, because they're all old and I wasn't driving, it was off to bed for an early start tomorrow. I thought old people didn't sleep?
The next day, while Evan captured the sunrise……
I had some emergency business to take care of.
With all the carving, running around and sweat (it was a record high November day in Ft. Myers) I had sprung a leak. Unfortunately, I'm not very proficient at changing my appliance (my wife is an artist at it, thanks dear) so I would spring a leak later Sunday again anyway with the new bag and I had to duct tape myself together. But I didn't, let that ruin the day, as you will see.
Marc led two workshops on Sunday, one on bald cypress, and the other using cedar elm. Neither of which I got any pics of, sorry.
And there were two demos. One from Mike Lane in the morning…..
…and another from Jason Osborne, who I was honored to help out (and also so I could get some good pics)
This next pic was taken by Evan.
Here's Glen molesting Jason's wood.
The finished tree:
John Powell, out of Texas, is a classically trained Japanese garden expert (he studied in Japan). Erik has had John in for the last several years building the site and demonstrating the philosophy and techniques used (as an example, it's not necessary to use strictly Japanese plants, just something that fills the niche). Here's John's work this year.
They moved those rocks with a tripod and block and tackle, no machines. And, because someone will ask, this is a close up of that bougie in the left corner.
Nice, huh? Erik's collection is, by far, one of the best in Florida.
And that brings us to last event of the weekend, the styling competition. I decided to enter it after I learned what kind of tree they were using, a Chinese hackberry. It was my first time doing so. I was reluctant entering because of my professional status but when I looked at the trees, Chinese hackberry (celtis sinensis) I decided I wanted one (you get to keep the tree) as I didn't have one yet.
This was the pic from Wigert's Facebook page advertising the competition.
Coincidentally, I was given the tree on the right. I honestly didn't like it.
The rules:
There could be no outside help.
The time limit is 30 minutes, no more.
You can try to psych out your opponents (there were 15 other competitors, believe it or not. It was raucous) but don't touch their tree.
Beer was allowed (I think that was my true advantage)
After thirty minutes (on the dot) we had to drop our tools and step back from the trees. Now, there are some of my readers who are marveling at the short (very short) time allowed to style the trees. So was Marc, the judge.
Then, all the competitors were asked to leave the room while Marc judged and explained their thoughts. They told everyone in the room the winner and then Erik let us back in. I hadn't gotten the chance to look at anyone else's trees after the styling, so I had no idea about my chances. When we came in, there were three trees on the table.
These three were the top three. Mine was there. They explained the pros and cons of each and then announced the winner.
It was my tree.
I couldn't believe it. I was embarrassed and happy at the same time.
You can see how red my face was. Although that might have been the beer.
After that, it was dinner at Joe's Crab Shack, hugs and kisses and hearty handshakes all around. And then the three hour trip back to Orlando.
What a weekend. Next year Erik is going to have Robert Steven from Indonesia. I can't wait.
Thank you to all the photographers I stole pics from, especially Andrea, Evan and Becky. And a second, heartfelt thanks to Evan for driving and putting up with my oddness. See y'all next post when I return to my normal routine.
I need a nap.
By Chris Higson, Associate Professor of Accounting Practice, London Business School
There is increasing public protest about the ease with which multinationals seem to play national tax systems to avoid paying tax.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) ‘Base Erosion and Profit Shifting' (BEPS) proposals that were published recently are the response. Despite the dry title, I think we should be impressed by BEPS – it is transformative.
International collaboration was the only way to deal with this issue, and BEPS is a collaboration between all the major G20 nations, including Brazil, China and India, plus representation from smaller developing countries. The project covers the waterfront and tackles many of the most intractable and long-standing issues in the international taxation of companies. As such, it has done its work very quickly, taking just a couple of years to get to final proposals now.
These are some of the ways in which multinationals avoid tax:
By arguing “we're not really located in your country; we have no permanent establishment there”;
Or, “okay, we are located in your territory, but the price (transfer price) we pay for the goods and services we buy from other group companies means we are not really making much profit”;
Or, “okay, we do make a decent margin on what we sell. But you will understand that to operate we need to use valuable intangible assets – the corporate brand, intellectual property, expertise. These are all owned by group companies located far away, and once we have paid them a royalty, there's nothing left!”
BEPS tackles these issues head-on. In so many areas of life we have had to change the way we think and behave to reflect the reality of the digital age. Effectively, that is what BEP is doing for company taxation. Traditional notions of what it means to operate and earn money in this or that territory, (for example, the long-standing tax concept of the ‘permanent establishment'), can't cope with the integrated world of the globalised and digital modern economy, as Google, Starbucks, Amazon and others happily demonstrate.
Alongside tackling these issues, BEPS brings a lot of useful proposals on the standardisation of tax treaties, on some long standing headaches such as interest deductibility, and on beefing up company reporting to the Inland Revenue.
These are all reasons to be impressed with BEPS. So what are the problems?
BEPS simply makes proposals that, to become law, must be adopted and implemented by governments. Most OECD governments are likely to publicly support the proposals. But the same governments actively use corporate tax as a competitive weapon to attract mobile international capital. Changing the habits of a lifetime may be hard. For these countries, protecting corporate tax revenue is not the only issue and may not be the main issue. They want to attract investment and jobs. We have been witnessing a race to the bottom in corporate tax rates, particularly in Europe, and one thing that the OECD is not trying to police is the tax rate itself.
More fundamentally, in the modern interconnected and intangibles-dominated world, the question “where was the profit earned, where was the value created?” will frequently lack an easy, unambiguous answer.
Nonetheless I remain optimistic. BEPS is already having an effect, with many countries already implementing parts of it. And, if it achieves nothing else, BEPS has given us a framework for organizing company tax in the modern interconnected world, and for when we judge the efforts and the achievements in tax reform over the next few years.
Top Names Over the Last 100 Years The following table shows the 100 most popular given names for male and female babies born during the last 100 years, 1918-2017. For each rank and sex, the table shows the name and the number of occurrences of that name. These time-tested popular names were taken from a universe that includes 173,916,919 male births and 169,671,039 female births. Please note that popular names listed below are not necessarily consistently popular in every year. For example, the name James, ranked as the most popular male name over the last 100 years, has been ranked as low as number 19. Similarly, the most popular female name in the table, Mary, ranked as low as 127. Popular names for births in 1918-2017 Males Females Rank Name Number 1 James 4,792,954 Mary 3,393,456 2 John 4,594,023 Patricia 1,564,163 3 Robert 4,571,203 Jennifer 1,465,928 4 Michael 4,315,462 Linda 1,448,097 5 William 3,662,399 Elizabeth 1,443,415 6 David 3,557,293 Barbara 1,410,059 7 Richard 2,487,983 Susan 1,106,071 8 Joseph 2,384,205 Jessica 1,043,436 9 Thomas 2,174,023 Sarah 996,554 10 Charles 2,144,937 Margaret 993,136 11 Christopher 2,018,834 Karen 984,893 12 Daniel 1,874,730 Nancy 973,993 13 Matthew 1,582,665 Lisa 964,399 14 Anthony 1,397,889 Betty 957,509 15 Donald 1,366,903 Dorothy 910,134 16 Mark 1,344,092 Sandra 873,189 17 Paul 1,306,645 Ashley 843,158 18 Steven 1,277,952 Kimberly 834,968 19 Andrew 1,245,696 Donna 824,789 20 Kenneth 1,236,774 Emily 813,822 21 George 1,204,467 Carol 809,230 22 Joshua 1,200,790 Michelle 808,959 23 Kevin 1,166,544 Amanda 771,946 24 Brian 1,163,647 Melissa 751,143 25 Edward 1,131,348 Deborah 739,319 26 Ronald 1,073,354 Stephanie 736,833 27 Timothy 1,065,180 Rebecca 729,396 28 Jason 1,027,906 Laura 727,056 29 Jeffrey 973,202 Helen 721,262 30 Ryan 924,418 Sharon 720,790 31 Jacob 904,769 Cynthia 705,407 32 Gary 899,253 Kathleen 693,975 33 Nicholas 885,052 Amy 678,863 34 Eric 873,230 Shirley 673,928 35 Stephen 841,135 Angela 657,250 36 Jonathan 832,914 Anna 651,333 37 Larry 802,510 Ruth 610,822 38 Justin 772,143 Brenda 606,260 39 Scott 768,913 Pamela 592,691 40 Brandon 753,163 Nicole 585,429 41 Frank 738,301 Katherine 579,728 42 Benjamin 708,478 Samantha 568,674 43 Gregory 705,702 Christine 566,865 44 Raymond 700,651 Catherine 564,786 45 Samuel 699,931 Virginia 562,771 46 Patrick 661,331 Debra 548,268 47 Alexander 646,463 Rachel 546,137 48 Jack 635,592 Janet 544,941 49 Dennis 611,508 Emma 544,373 50 Jerry 603,724 Carolyn 544,287 51 Tyler 583,227 Maria 526,442 52 Aaron 569,239 Heather 524,160 53 Henry 553,773 Diane 515,405 54 Jose 553,192 Julie 505,698 55 Douglas 551,314 Joyce 502,530 56 Peter 544,021 Evelyn 472,207 57 Adam 543,586 Joan 471,719 58 Nathan 533,339 Victoria 471,393 59 Zachary 531,195 Kelly 470,389 60 Walter 500,163 Christina 470,375 61 Kyle 477,285 Lauren 466,356 62 Harold 472,241 Frances 459,208 63 Carl 444,576 Martha 450,465 64 Jeremy 433,782 Judith 449,844 65 Gerald 433,101 Cheryl 436,878 66 Keith 431,901 Megan 436,096 67 Roger 431,647 Andrea 430,394 68 Arthur 431,511 Olivia 428,419 69 Terry 421,661 Ann 422,401 70 Lawrence 416,632 Jean 420,515 71 Sean 416,246 Alice 420,145 72 Christian 412,830 Jacqueline 419,239 73 Ethan 412,064 Hannah 416,242 74 Austin 403,440 Doris 413,521 75 Joe 398,998 Kathryn 412,625 76 Albert 395,454 Gloria 409,027 77 Jesse 389,068 Teresa 405,274 78 Willie 380,990 Sara 402,599 79 Billy 380,502 Janice 401,293 80 Bryan 378,653 Marie 397,221 81 Bruce 376,593 Julia 387,604 82 Noah 371,773 Grace 381,220 83 Jordan 369,046 Judy 378,322 84 Dylan 360,818 Theresa 374,730 85 Ralph 354,308 Madison 373,579 86 Roy 349,198 Beverly 371,992 87 Alan 344,833 Denise 371,012 88 Wayne 342,353 Marilyn 369,508 89 Eugene 341,261 Amber 368,623 90 Juan 340,716 Danielle 366,206 91 Gabriel 336,144 Rose 365,054 92 Louis 331,021 Brittany 357,936 93 Russell 327,166 Diana 355,964 94 Randy 327,075 Abigail 354,708 95 Vincent 321,027 Natalie 343,636 96 Philip 319,263 Jane 340,555 97 Logan 318,494 Lori 337,991 98 Bobby 312,923 Alexis 336,473 99 Harry 312,035 Tiffany 335,852 100 Johnny 307,710 Kayla 335,616 Sources: 100% sample based on Social Security card application data as of March 2018.

Unless otherwise noted, the ratings numbers below are based on the final overnights and may vary slightly from the preliminaries reported on the Cancelled Sci Fi Twitter Site.
The Fall season–which we are still only a few weeks into–has been a bad one overall for the broadcast networks ratings-wise as we are seeing historic lows in the overnight ratings across the board (and if you think those delayed viewing numbers really are more important, read this article). But it has been a particularly bad season for sci fi / fantasy shows as almost all the non-CW entries are performing below the network averages. This is something that I have just started tracking closely this season and the averages I am compiling are based on the non-repeat, non-sports programming for each network for Prime Time season to date. This is a little bit different than the Reaper Index used by the TV Grim Reaper (formerly the Cancellation Bear) which compares the ratings of scripted shows only for the same network. But I have expanded my range because I consider it very possible that in the current ratings slump environment that the networks will strongly consider replacing more expensive scripted shows with reality and/or news programming. So based on that, here is the ranking of the broadcast network shows based on how they are performing vs. their network average with the best performers at the top:
Series Network Std Avg Net Avg Variance The Flash CW 1.40 0.66 0.74 Arrow CW 1.05 0.66 0.39 Supernatural CW 0.85 0.66 0.19 Limitless CBS 1.73 1.68 0.04 Once Upon A Time ABC 1.70 1.74 (0.04) iZombie CW 0.60 0.66 (0.06) Vampire Diaries CW 0.60 0.66 (0.06) Agents of SHIELD ABC 1.57 1.74 (0.18) The Originals CW 0.45 0.66 (0.21) Gotham FOX 1.55 1.80 (0.25) The Last Man on Earth FOX 1.28 1.80 (0.53) Heroes Reborn NBC 1.48 1.94 (0.46) Scream Queens FOX 1.30 1.80 (0.50) Sleepy Hollow FOX 0.93 1.80 (0.87) Minority Report FOX 0.85 1.80 (0.95)
Here's what we can glean from this chart at this point in the season: the CW shows are doing mostly okay right now as even the ones performing below the network average are above the non-genre entries on that network. Limitless and Once Upon A Time are performing right about even with their networks' averages and should be okay for the moment. Agents of SHIELD is just a little below the network average and is performing well enough for Disney to keep it around. Gotham doesn't look like it is doing great, but if you compare it to FOX's numbers without Empire (which brings it to a 1.4 average), it looks much better. Apart from that, FOX is likely considering a full schedule revamp that could take place as soon a mid-season and NBC has failed to stir up much nostalgia (was it too soon?) for Heroes Reborn (same for ABC as The Muppets revival continues to take a dive in the ratings). We are still only one month into the season with a few more premieres arriving next week (including CBS' much anticipated Supergirl), so the dust continues to settle. But the picture is coming into better focus each week and it sure doesn't look good for many of the genre shows airing on the broadcast networks right now. Some major changes could be on the way at mid-season.
Here's a quick round up of the big announcements from this last week: Syfy announced the cancellation of Dominion after its second season and The CW indicated that Beauty and the Beast would wrap up after its upcoming fourth season (more on those at this link). Syfy also announced the cancellation of Defiance after its third season (more on that at this link).
Rating results for the sci fi / fantasy shows airing Monday October 12th thru Sunday October 18th (metric definitions below):
(Updated for chart activity in the cable channel Top 25 and the Weekly Nielsen Twitter Ratings Top 10)

Rating: 1.5 | % Chng PW: 0.0% | Tot Viewers (MM): 4.2 | StD Rating: 1.6 | Net Avg: 1.8 | Cancellation Alert: Low
It held steady this week, and It's still not doing too bad considering FOX's overall struggles. It would be better if its numbers were higher, though.
Minority Report FOX Mon 10/12 9 PM
Rating: 0.7 | % Chng PW: 0.0% | Tot Viewers (MM): 2.1 | StD Rating: 0.9 | Net Avg: 1.8 | Cancellation Alert: High
No good news for this show as its numbers remain down and FOX has cut the episode order to ten instead of thirteen. And it could get kicked to Fridays or Saturdays at any time.
The Flash CW Tue 10/13 8 PM
Rating: 1.4 | % Chng PW: 0.0% | Tot Viewers (MM): 3.5 | StD Rating: 1.4 | Net Avg: 0.7 | Cancellation Alert: Low
It held stead for its second Season 2 episode and continues to lead the CW's shows. It also tied Agents of SHIELD for the night which can't sit well with the ABC execs.
Agents of SHIELD ABC Tue 10/13 9 PM
Rating: 1.4 | % Chng PW: -12.5% | Tot Viewers (MM): 3.7 | StD Rating: 1.6 | Net Avg: 1.7 | Cancellation Alert: Low
It slipped close to a series low, though maybe the Democratic Presidential Debates can be blamed because they drew higher viewership than expected. But the show needs to rebound if it wants to stay on track for a fourth season and I am not giving it the third season show protection which I go into in more detail at this link.
iZombie CW Tue 10/13 8 PM
Rating: 0.5 | % Chng PW: -28.6% | Tot Viewers (MM): 1.2 | StD Rating: 0.6 | Net Avg: 0.7 | Cancellation Alert: Low
This one dropped notably for its second Season 2 episode and it is losing well over fifty percent of the audience from its Flash lead-in. How long will The CW put up with that?
Scream Queens FOX Tue 10/13 9 PM
Rating: 1.0 | % Chng PW: -9.1% | Tot Viewers (MM): 2.4 | StD Rating: 1.3 | Net Avg: 1.8 | Cancellation Alert: Moderate
This show continues to slip and I can't see it sticking around at these levels unless its social network presence is enough for FOX to keep it around for now considering how poorly the rest of its schedule is performing.
Limitless CBS Tue 10/13 10 PM
Rating: 1.4 | % Chng PW: -17.6% | Tot Viewers (MM): 8.0 | StD Rating: 1.7 | Net Avg: 1.7 | Cancellation Alert: Low
It dropped notably last week, was it the Democratic Presidential Debates which drew more viewers than expected? We will see if it rebounds this week.
Chart Activity: This show slipped out of the broadcast network Top 25 based on the overnights for the 18-49 demographic. It did still place in the Top 25 based on total viewers, but it slipped to Number 22 (down from Number 14).
Arrow CW Wed 10/14 8 PM
Rating: 1.0 | % Chng PW: -9.1% | Tot Viewers (MM): 2.5 | StD Rating: 1.1 | Net Avg: 0.7 | Cancellation Alert: Low
It dropped one tick from last week, but it is still performing quite well for a CW entry and is on track for a fifth season.
Supernatural CW Wed 10/14 9 PM
Rating: 0.8 | % Chng PW: -11.1% | Tot Viewers (MM): 1.9 | StD Rating: 0.9 | Net Avg: 0.7 | Cancellation Alert: Low
It slipped a little but it is still at the best numbers it has seen since moving to Wednesdays last Spring. It looks to be on track for a twelfth season.
Star Wars Rebels DXD Wed 10/14 9:30 PM
Rating: 0.1 | % Chng PW: n/a | Tot Viewers (MM): 0.5 | StD Rating: 0.1 | Net Avg: n/a | Cancellation Alert: Low
The rating in the 18-49 demo was not spectacular for this show's second season debut, but then it skews to a younger audience and relies just as much on merchandising as ratings. A third season looks like a good bet.
American Horror Story FX Wed 10/14 10 PM
Rating: 2.2 | % Chng PW: -28.1% | Tot Viewers (MM): 4.1 | StD Rating: 2.6 | Net Avg: n/a | Cancellation Alert: Low
It dropped notably from its debut, but we saw the same thing last year. Expect it to hold around these levels through Fall which are better than any other scripted programming on cable except TWD.
Chart Activity: This show was at Number 4 in the Weekly Nielsen Twitter Ratings (down from Number 1). In the cable Top 25 based on the overnights for the 18-49 demographic it was at Number 9 (down from Number 3) and in the Top 25 based on total viewers it was at Number 17 (down from Number 5).
Vampire Diaries CW Thu 10/15 8 PM
Rating: 0.6 | % Chng PW: 0.0% | Tot Viewers (MM): 1.4 | StD Rating: 0.6 | Net Avg: 0.7 | Cancellation Alert: Low
It held steady with last week but I still consider it likely that The CW is considering wrapping it up this season or next.
Heroes Reborn NBC Thu 10/15 8 PM
Rating: 1.1 | % Chng PW: -8.3% | Tot Viewers (MM): 4.0 | StD Rating: 1.5 | Net Avg: 1.9 | Cancellation Alert: Medium
Another drop for this show. Maybe padding out the Heroes syndication will make it worthwhile to NBC to keep it around, but that seems less and less likely as the numbers slip.
The Originals CW Thu 10/15 9 PM
Rating: 0.5 | % Chng PW: +25.0% | Tot Viewers (MM): 1.1 | StD Rating: 0.5 | Net Avg: 0.7 | Cancellation Alert: Low
The only genre show that saw is numbers improve week over week! It wasn't by much, but at least it was something.

Rating: 0.8 | % Chng PW: -20.0% | Tot Viewers (MM): 3.0 | StD Rating: 0.9 | Net Avg: 1.8 | Cancellation Alert: High
This show is now at CW levels and I wouldn't be surprised if FOX didn't kick it to Fridays or Saturdays (along with Minority Report) after the Bones crossover episodes which occurs next week.

The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that 24 million fewer people will have health insurance by 2026 under the House GOP plan to replace Obamacare. That projection is unsurprising, and quite likely overstated. But what is surprising about the CBO report is the ways in which it makes the GOP bill look better than expected, and how it points to how the bill can be improved.
Democrats are gleefully, and understandably, touting the CBO report as proof that the American Health Care Act—the official title of the House GOP bill—would harm too many Americans. But as Lee Corso says on College GameDay, “not so fast, my friend.”
CBO's poor track record with Obamacare's exchanges
The first thing to know about the CBO is that it has long had problems modeling how a competitive, individual insurance market would work. This is reflected in their frequently revised estimates as to how many people would enroll in Obamacare's insurance exchanges.
As the below chart shows, in 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was passed, CBO estimated that 21 million people would enroll in the ACA exchanges in 2016. The actual number was closer to 10 million. Even now, CBO believes that 18 to 19 million people will soon be enrolled in the exchanges, when in fact enrollment is degrading under current law. According to estimates I've published at the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, Obamacare exchange enrollment will likely end up stabilizing at about 10 to 11 million.
This chart is relevant to our discussion of the GOP plan in two ways. First, it shows that the CBO is far from infallible; indeed, its projections of ACA exchange enrollment have been wildly off.
Second, as CBO notes in the first paragraph of its report on the AHCA, “CBO used its March 2016 baseline with adjustments for subsequently enacted legislation, which underlies the resolution, as the benchmark to measure the cost of the legislation.” That baseline is off by 7 to 8 million in future exchange enrollment; hence, the impact of the AHCA is also off by the same amount.
CBO ascribes near-magical powers to the individual mandate
An even bigger problem is that the CBO has long believed that Obamacare's individual mandate has near-magical powers to compel people to buy health insurance. There is little evidence to support this claim.
In 2008, when Senator Barack Obama was competing with Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, they ridiculed Hillary's support of an individual mandate. “If a mandate was the solution,” they said at the time, “you could try that to solve homelessness by mandating that everybody buy a house. But the reason they don't have a house is they don't have the money.”
When Obama gained the White House, they flipped, and became a supporter of the mandate. Why? Because the CBO told them that a mandate would increase the agency's coverage estimates of their plan by 16 million. Maybe it should have been called “CBOcare.”
But Obama's basic instinct was right. The issue at hand is whether or not plans are affordable, not whether or not a weak fine riddled with loopholes and exceptions can force people to buy coverage.
Even Jonathan Gruber—one of the law's most famous advocates—believes Obamacare's individual mandate is having little effect. In a 2016 article for the New England Journal of Medicine, Gruber and two co-authors wrote, "When we assessed the mandate's detailed provisions, which include income-based penalties for lacking coverage and various specific exemptions from those penalties, we did not find that overall coverage rates responded to these aspects of the law." (Emphasis added.)
CBO on the other hand believes that, due to the AHCA's repeal of the individual mandate, 14 million people would choose to go uninsured in 2018, and 16 million in 2019. Of the 14 million accounted for in the 2018 figure, 6 million would drop out of the individual market, 5 million from Medicaid, and 2 million from employer-based coverage.
Remember that Medicaid is basically free to the eligible enrollee. There are no premiums, and almost no co-pays or deductibles. The value of the Obamacare Medicaid subsidy is about $6,000 per enrollee per year. And yet, CBO believes that 5 million people will only enroll in Medicaid because the individual mandate forces them to. Given the difficulties in enforcing the mandate for low-income populations, this is highly unlikely.
Furthermore, CBO's view that 6 million people in 2018 will be driven to enroll by the mandate means that of the 26 million 2018 enrollees in the individual market, nearly a quarter will be signing up primarily because of the mandate. That contradicts the real-world experience of insurers and actuaries, who say that the real proportion is closer to 5 percent.
CBO believes that Medicaid expansion will reach nearly every state
A key part of the CBO's March 2016 baseline is an assumption that most of the states that have yet to expand Medicaid under Obamacare will soon do so. Hence, the House GOP plan will reduce coverage by 5 million people in the future, from states that have yet to expand Medicaid. Leaving aside the inherent subjectivity of this projection, there's plenty of reason to believe that the CBO is wrong.
The states that haven't expanded Medicaid have done so because they are concerned about exposing their taxpayers to significant and growing liabilities that the federal government may back away from over time. Those liabilities aren't getting smaller as time goes forward, but larger. It's equally, if not more likely, that Medicaid expansion in new states accounts for fewer than 2 million more enrollees by 2026.
CBO coverage estimates could be off by as much as 19 million
You add all that up—7 million off on future exchange enrollment, around 9 million off on the individual mandate's power, and 3 million off on future Medicaid expansions—the CBO's estimate of the impact of the AHCA on coverage is off by around 19 million, and that the real impact of the AHCA on coverage is negative 5 million. (The actual effect could be larger or smaller, based on the interaction of the various factors I describe above.)
In other words, even with better CBO methods, the AHCA would still cover fewer people than Obamacare. Why? Because the bill insists on using a flat tax credit that provides the same assistance to someone just above the poverty line that it gives to a family making six figures.
How to improve the AHCA
This is an easy thing to fix. The AHCA itself contains a transitional tax credit schedule in which individual would get a means-tested, age-adjusted tax credit to buy insurance. If Republicans simply kept that schedule, and ditched the flat tax credit, they'd cover many more people.
Another change Republicans should consider is to delay the repeal of the individual mandate until 2020. I dislike the mandate as much as anyone. But over the long term, the AHCA's system of tax credits will be more successful if it begins with a carefully designed transition away from Obamacare.
Indeed, the CBO expressed a surprising degree of confidence that the AHCA's policy mix—tax credits more favorable to young people, a 5-to-1 age ratio for premiums, an elimination of actuarial value mandates, and state innovation grants for high risk pools and risk adjustment—“would result in a relatively stable nongroup market.”
However, “in 2018 and 2019, according to CBO and JCT's estimates, average premiums for single policyholders in the nongroup market would be 15 percent to 20 percent higher than under current law mainly because of the elimination of the individual mandate penalties…Starting in 2020, the increase in average premiums from repealing the individual mandate penalties would be more than offset” by the new policy mix, leading to an eventual decrease in premiums by 10 percent relative to Obamacare.
Delaying the mandate repeal to 2020 would likely result in even lower premiums after 2020, and therefore higher enrollment numbers. It's a simple change worth considering.
Is the CBO right about AHCA's positive effects?
Given that I've spent most of this article criticizing the CBO's coverage estimates, I should point out that I've been highly unsure that the AHCA would reduce premiums and lead to a stabler risk pool. The bill's arbitrary 30 percent surcharge for those who buy coverage outside of open enrollment might actually make the risk pool less stable, and ought to be replaced by a much more flexible regulatory regime.
And we haven't even gotten to the AHCA's profound fiscal effects. The bill would cut spending by $1.2 trillion, and taxes by $883 billion, for a net deficit reduction of $337 billion. And that's before you take into account the macroeconomic effects that those tax cuts would have on economic growth, and thereby on greater tax revenues.
Over ensuing decades, the fiscal impact would be even greater, because the bill entails the most significant effort at entitlement reform in American history. Incoherent GOP hard-liners like Rand Paul, who claim that the AHCA is a “new entitlement,” are displaying their unseriousness about a bill that reduces federal spending by more than $2 trillion over the next 20 years.
The bottom line: Republicans shouldn't abandon the AHCA because of a superficially unflattering CBO score or its failure to meet their own purity tests. They should work all the more to correct its flaws. If they do, in 2020, the real world very well may vindicate them instead of the CBO.

UPDATE 1: Paul Demko of Politico has obtained a leaked copy of a report from the White House Office of Management and Budget estimating that "26 million people would lose coverage over the next decade, versus the 24 million CBO estimates." This news has been taken by some to suggest that the White House agrees with CBO's figures. But that's not correct.
As Demko notes in an updated version of the piece, the OMB report was an attempt to predict how the CBO would score the bill. "This is not an analysis of the bill in any way whatsoever," said a White House spokesperson. "This is OMB trying to project what CBO's score will be using CBO's methodology." My sources confirm that this is the case—and it's not surprising. Designers of the AHCA needed instant feedback on how changes to their bill might affect the CBO score, and they deployed the OMB's career staff to help them do that. The Obama White House did the same thing with Obamacare.

Dead malls are in the news often lately, whether they've become self-aware are being reduced to rubble , or are being turned into condos or houses of worship. Even teens don't want to hang out there anymore. Why is it, though, that malls that once clothed and entertained the middle class are dying out? What, if anything, will take their place?
The New York Times has a sad take on the dead mall trend, now that the holidays are over and malls are emptier than they were a few weeks ago. We're referring to the malls when saying, “What will take their place,” but could easily be referring to the American middle class instead. Malls that cater to very wealthy people are doing just fine, but it's the malls anchored by Sears and JCPenney and filled with mid-range clothing retailers that have run into trouble.
It's not just malls that are about to lose under-performing anchors that are in trouble. Experts have found about 60 endangered enclosed malls across the country. This issue isn't even about the failure of specific retailers, but the general over-malling of the nation by developers in decades past. Those malls could transition from enclosed to open-air big-box centers, replacing the Gap and the Orange Julius with Walmart and a discount drink machine.

Interesting Monkey Festival in LopBuri.
The town of Lopburi in Thailand celebrated its annual interesting Monkey Festival over the weekend, laying out a lavish banquet for the more than 2,000 macaques that roam freely through it.
Locals believe that providing food for the monkeys, Lopburi's most famous residents, brings good fortune and prosperity. The feast is also a sort of “thank you” for the interesting animals whose antics entice thousands of tourists to the town every year.
The main attraction of this area is a group of monkeys that run freely for the city.
They are mainly localized to templio of San Phra Kan, but you can also see wander in the street, close to shops, or simply that penzolano from the trees.
It can be fun to spend an hour look, as can be similar to us sometimes.
The only other interesting thing to Lopburi is the palace of King Narai, with a beautiful garden, a museum and various historical ruins.
Twenty among the best Thai cooks have set up a banquet by 500000 Bhat (about $ 15000) consists of two tons of sausages, fresh fruit, fruit, vegetables, ice cream, jam and milk. Banquet it seems highly appreciated by around 2000 visitors to put it mildly curious since 2000 were macachi!
In the small town of Lopburi (Thailand) each year is celebrated the Festival of the Apes, where they prepare precisely this sumptuous banquet and macachi have all weekend to abbuffarsi! For local this holiday is a good omen and also a way to thank the ‘cousins' that attract many tourists every year. The macachi in Lopburi are free to run through the streets, going into gates and spassarsela to the streets.
The only advice if capitate to Lopburi is to be careful portfolios and the food that sgranocchiate and be ready to diffenderli by monkeys!
For the past ten years, celebrated member of the Bear Mountain contingency, Ryan Tarbell, has been wearing the numeric 686 logos while cruising and crushing the Southern California parks they call home. Over the past decade, Tarbell has upheld that effortless Bear style, steadily increasing their bag of tricks and gaining momentum in the streets and beyond. Last year, Tarbell journeyed across North America in search of skate-inspired street lines, massive gaps, and gnarly redirects. They found plenty and lensman Ian Post was there to log the shots, culminating one of the heaviest segments in 686 team movies, 686 Seconds. To see exactly where Ryan's part falls in the film, you'll have to download 686 Seconds on iTunes, which is a good idea anyway, because Tarbell and their teammates have laid out some heat. But back to this Bear local, who, on the night of the world premiere of the film, was turned pro on the 686 team, a fitting ten-year anniversary celebration for a rider who is only just getting started. So sit back and enjoy Tarbell's 686 Seconds full part. Watch for the redirect transfers, the proper lipslides, the style-heavy skate-esque lines and commanding ollies, as well as one of the gnarliest crashes we've ever witnessed. From start to finish, Ryan Tarbell has made their intentions clear, and there's plenty more to come from this SoCal destroyer.

United States Supreme Court case
United States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696 (1983),[1] was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States which held that a sniff of luggage in a public place, by a police dog specially trained to detect the odor of narcotics, was not a "search" under the meaning of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court reasoned that the sniff of a dog is sui generis, intended to disclose only the presence or absence of narcotics. Because a dog sniff is such a limited test, the Court carved out this exception from the broad category of "searches" for which a warrant is generally required.
Background of the case [ edit ]
Raymond J. Place first aroused the suspicion of law enforcement officers as they were standing in line at the Miami airport waiting to buy a ticket to New York's LaGuardia Airport. The officers approached them on their way to the gate and asked them for identification. Place also agreed to let the officers search the luggage they had checked, but they declined to do so in light of the flight's imminent departure. Discrepancies between the two luggage tags on Place's two suitcases further aroused the officers' suspicions, and they confirmed that the addresses were false. The Miami officers alerted DEA agents at LaGuardia to their suspicions about Place.
The DEA agents waited until Place had retrieved their luggage and called a limousine before approaching them in New York. The DEA agents again asked Place for their identification, which they produced. The agents discovered that Place had no outstanding warrants. They then asked to search Place's luggage, but Place declined to allow the agents to do so. The agents then told Place they were going to take the luggage to a federal judge to obtain a warrant to search the luggage, and that Place was free to accompany them if they chose to. An hour and a half later, the agents had taken Place's bags to Kennedy airport and allowed a trained narcotics detection dog to perform a "sniff" test. The dog detected the presence of narcotics. This was late on a Friday afternoon; the agents retained the luggage over the weekend until Monday, when they obtained a warrant to search the luggage. They discovered over a kilogram of cocaine.
Place was indicted for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. In the district court, Place moved to suppress the cocaine, arguing that the warrantless seizure of the luggage violated their Fourth Amendment rights. The district court disagreed, reasoning instead that the police only needed reasonable suspicion to seize Place's bags, which they had.[2] Place pleaded guilty to the possession charge, but reserved the right to appeal the denial of their suppression motion. On appeal, the Second Circuit reversed, holding that the prolonged seizure of Place's bags violated the principles of Terry v. Ohio (1968).[3] The U.S. Supreme Court then agreed to hear the case.
Majority opinion [ edit ]
The Fourth Amendment protects the interest people have in keeping their persons, houses, papers, and effects free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Though most of the Court's container jurisprudence deals with the search of the container rather than the initial seizure, there existed some general principles. First, the seizure may not take place without a warrant, supported by probable cause, and describing particularly the things to be seized. Second, over time, exceptions to the warrant requirement had evolved, allowing for seizure without probable cause in exigent circumstances not allowing for the time to obtain a warrant.
The Court first had to consider whether, as the lower courts had assumed, the framework of Terry v. Ohio, under which a limited detention of a person can be justified in the face of reasonable suspicion, can apply to the temporary seizure of a person's luggage. Indeed, when government agents have reason to suspect (but not probable cause to believe) that, for instance, a traveler's luggage contains narcotics, it has a substantial interest in confirming or denying that suspicion. In order to dispel that suspicion, the Court reasoned a brief seizure of the luggage could be justified. This brief seizure could not encompass a full-blown "search," just as a Terry stop may not increase in seriousness to a full-blown arrest, unless probable cause to perform the search arose during the brief detention.
In this case, the whole reason the DEA agents seized Place's luggage was so they could subject it to the dog sniff. The sniff, in turn, would violate Place's Fourth Amendment rights if it constituted a "search." A "search" is an unwarranted intrusion on a person's objectively reasonable expectation of privacy. But the sniff did not require opening the luggage; it did not expose things that are not contraband to public view. The sniff was thus far more limited than the typical search. Moreover, the sniff merely revealed the presence or absence of narcotics. Thus, it was sui generis, and did not constitute a "search" under the Fourth Amendment.
However, even though the DEA agents did not "search" Place's luggage when they subjected it to the dog sniff, their seizure of the luggage was unreasonable because it exceeded the limits of a Terry-type investigative stop. The length of time the agents had possession of Place's luggage was too great—90 minutes before the dog sniff had been conducted. Also, the agents knew what time Place's plane was scheduled to land at LaGuardia, and thus had ample time to arrange their investigation accordingly, so that taking Place's luggage from LaGuardia to Kennedy airports should not have been necessary. Thus, the seizure of Place's luggage was unreasonable in this case.
Concurring opinions [ edit ]
Justice Brennan [ edit ]
Justice Brennan concurred in the Court's judgment because they agreed with the Second Circuit that the scope of the agents' seizure of Place's luggage was unreasonable. Furthermore, Brennan noted that while Terry may authorize seizures of personal effects incident to a lawful seizure of the person, nothing in the Terry line of cases authorizes the police to seize personal property, such as luggage, independent of the seizure of the person. For Brennan, it was therefore unnecessary for the Court to decide whether the dog sniff constitutes a "search" under the Fourth Amendment. It was Brennan's view that dog sniffs can reveal more information than just the presence or absence of narcotics, and therefore constituted a "search." But Brennan did not feel that this case was an appropriate vehicle for the Court to decide how to handle dog sniffs under the Fourth Amendment.
Justice Blackmun [ edit ]
Justice Blackmun also felt that this case was not appropriate for deciding the status of dog sniffs under the Fourth Amendment. For one thing, Blackmun observed, Place had not raised the issue in either the district court or the Second Circuit. For another, Blackmun agreed with Brennan that it was not necessary to decide whether a dog sniff is a "search" in order to decide the case, because the seizure of Place's luggage was unreasonable in any event.

Launched in the US in April, Project Fi is Google's foray into the mobile wireless service industry. It offers subscribers the familiar ability to call, text and surf the Web on their Google Nexus 6 smartphones while letting them control how much they pay for data per month. It differs from most other mobile service providers by using Wi-Fi as the default communication method for voice and data, and it smoothly switches between US carriers Sprint or T-Mobile's cellular and data networks when a hotspot isn't available.
Rather than describing its service as a competitor that undermines existing carrier partners, Google considers Project Fi an experiment that will hopefully push other companies to provide cheaper and more efficient data plans.
We tested the service in the San Francisco area across several days to check out what it's like using the tech giant's budding "network of networks."
Enlarge Image Josh Miller/CNET
Editor's note: Because the user experience with wireless carriers can vary greatly depending upon a variety of factors -- especially location -- CNET does not rate wireless carriers. We can, however, tell you everything you need to know about the major US carriers. We invite your feedback and ratings in our user opinions section. The more input we get from around the US, the better our users can evaluate coverage at a national level. For more information, please see CNET's Quick Guide to Cell Phone Carriers. In addition, because this is currently a US-only service, all pricing information is given in US dollars.
The basics
Project Fi primarily defaults to local Wi-Fi networks (the same kind you set up at home, or connect to at a coffee shop or airport) to patch calls and browse the Internet. Because some Wi-Fi spots are public, Google promises to encrypt your data so it's protected (yes, even the password-protected networks that belong to those small businesses still pose a security risk). If Wi-Fi coverage is not available or too weak, the network has partnered with US carriers Sprint and T-Mobile to use their cellular network.
Enlarge Image Josh Miller/CNET
As the first two major networks in the US to bake Wi-Fi calling into their coverage, this makes sense. T-Mobile and Sprint launched Wi-Fi calling in 2007 and 2014, respectively, with the former adding seamless hand-over from Wi-Fi to voice-over LTE. (As a side note, AT&T also rolled out its Wi-Fi calling service for some devices in October 2015).
Switching smoothly between networks is crucial since users won't notice when they're being ported over to one or the other. They also won't have their calls dropped just because they are leaving one network, nor have to take any action to switch over to another network. In addition, when Project Fi automatically connects to the one that is the faster and more reliable network of the two.
The process
As of now, if you want to participate in the service, you'll need to do two things: request an invite using a Gmail address and have a Nexus 6 phone (the Americas variant, model number XT1103). That's because there's a specialized radio inside the phone that supports multiple cell networks, and it works with the unique Project Fi SIM card, which also has multiple-carrier support. If you don't have the device, you can purchase an unlocked model from Google or other third-party retailers. (We bought one at Amazon.)
Once you get an invite, you'll be linked to the sign-in site where you need to enter your ZIP code to make sure you have coverage in your area. You can transfer your current number or get a new number altogether. If you elect to receive a new number, Google will suggest local area codes to choose from based on your ZIP code. This number will live on a cloud as your Google Voice number as well, and you can make calls from other devices with it too, like a tablet or laptop.

After that, choose your data plan. There is no annual plan and the bare-minimum monthly rate is $20 plus taxes and fees. That includes unlimited calls and texting in the US, unlimited international texting in the US and 120-plus countries, and Wi-Fi tethering. If you want data, that's $10 a month for every 1GB of data (so $20 for 2GB, $50 for 5GB, all the way to $100 a month for 10GB) -- all of that is on top of that base $20 per month.
You will be charged upfront for your data at the beginning of the month, but if you don't use all of your allotted data, that amount will be refunded to you. For example, if you selected a 4GB plan but only used 3.1GB by the end of the month, you have 900MB leftover and will receive $9 back. The same goes if you exceed your data plan too -- if you go 900MB over your plan, you'll be charged an additional $9 on next month's bill.
(T-Mobile offers a similar rollover service called "Data Stash," which lets you use any untapped data in your plan for up to 12 months. AT&T does too, but the data expires at the end of the next billing period.)
When you're done signing up, Google will ship you a Project Fi nano-SIM card in the mail.
The experience
Data speeds
I tested 4G LTE data speeds in our San Francisco office. Results from Ookla's speed test app varied widely across multiple days and times. Download rates ranged from 3 to 13Mbps, while upload rates range from 1 to as high as 18Mbps. Out of seven trials, the average was 5.48Mbps down and 9.17Mbps up.
Enlarge Image Lynn La/CNET
For real-world, everyday usage testing, speeds were slow for the most part, but tended to be faster in the evenings. Out of three trials, loading the CNET mobile and desktop site took 16 and 18 seconds respectively, and downloading and installing the 44.52MB game Temple Run 2 took 5 minutes and 3 seconds. Downloading the 1.7GB movie "Gravity" once took a whopping 2 hours and 4 minutes, but during another attempt, it took 25 minutes and 16 seconds.
There's no built-in way to tell if the handset is using Sprint or T-Mobile's network at any given time (though you can install a third-party app like SignalCheck Lite that will tell you). It's important to note that you should take these results with a grain of salt. Data speeds differ widely depending on several factors, such as location and time of day. What I've observed here is just a minuscule sample size from our San Francisco location.
Lastly, as Android Central pointed out, if your Nexus is using Sprint's network, you can't use data and voice simultaneously -- a known issue that has affected phones using CDMA technology before.
Making calls
Making calls was simple and easy and doesn't require any setup. I made calls to landlines and cell phones and call quality was reliable -- audio was continuous, there was no extraneous buzzing or static and I was able to hear the person on the other end of the line clearly. Likewise, my partners reported that I sounded clear and easy to understand as well.
For Wi-Fi calls, I made sure that I had no cellular network signal before dialing a number and that the feature was toggled on in Settings. Calls that were being patched through this method showed the name of the Wi-Fi network on the dialer. When consistent, audio was very clear, easy to understand and appropriately loud. There were instances, however, when audio cut in and out, but it didn't last for very long. All in all it remained relatively steady.

The competition
Google isn't alone in its wireless endeavors, and if you're considering Wi-Fi only networks, there are alternatives.
Republic Wireless charges $10 per month for talk, text and Wi-Fi, and $15 per gigabyte of data. If we choose to go with a 3GB plan, it would cost $55 per month. Excluding taxes and fees, that's $5 per month more than the same plan on Project Fi. You will, however, be credited for any unused data, and have a wider and cheaper lineup of devices to use, which include the $99 Motorola Moto G (2013) , the $129 Moto E and the $299 Moto X .
Scratch Wireless offers a different structure. While Wi-Fi tethering and texting is free, users have to pay for voice and data usage on a pay-as-you-go system. Though there are different usage tiers that span as short as 24 hours and as small as 50MB, let's revisit the 3GB example earlier. On Scratch, unlimited voice for 30 days cost $15 and 1GB costs $25 for 30 days. That means it'll cost about $90 to have all the same services as Project Fi and Republic Wireless. Currently, the carrier is selling only the Coolpad Arise for $99, but you can purchase other Scratch-certified devices from retailers like eBay.
Both Republic and Scratch Wireless use Sprint's network when Wi-Fi is unavailable. For a deeper dive on Project Fi's implication on other wireless services, check out Maggie Reardon's take.

The takeaway
I was disappointed by the slow 4G LTE data speeds I experienced on Google Project Fi. Even though my observations offer just a narrow sliver of the network's possible coverage, benchmark tests were consistently slow compared to speeds I've previously seen from Sprint and T-Mobile.
Another major drawback is the fact that it's only compatible with the Nexus 6 for now. The premium phone starts out at $500 unlocked (for the 32GB model). Though you can pay it off in installments, the hardware will be beyond the budget of many people.
While the service pricing for Project Fi looks good at first, note that it's most competitive for individuals. Many big carrier family plans will offer better deals for two or more people sharing data on the same plan.
However, I did find Project Fi's pricing structure, an aspect of other wireless networks that many find to be frustrating, to be extremely user friendly. Its transparency is reassuring, and the fact that you don't have to worry about overshooting or letting your monthly data allotment go to waste is a relief. And obviously, Project Fi's biggest draw is the low month-to-month cost (again, for individuals). Depending on your data usage, your bill can be incredibly low, and getting credit for data you don't use means more money back into your pocket.
A proposal to reroute transport truck traffic to a narrow, primarily residential street in downtown Halifax during the deconstruction of a major interchange is not sitting well with some residents and businesses.
The proposal would see large trucks driving through the narrow, primarily residential Morris Street in downtown during redevelopment of the Cogswell Interchange.
"This is really one of the most ridiculous things I've heard of in a while," Morris Street resident Ken Murphy said Friday.
"This is a very narrow, short street. Trucks will be a disaster on Morris Street."

Fixing old mistake
The tangle of overpasses and underpasses at Cogswell Street, Barrington Street and Upper Water Street was built 45 years ago to accommodate a harbourside expressway that was never built.
Halifax Regional Municipality plans to redevelop the Cogswell Street Interchange by 2020. Each day, around 90,000 vehicles drive through the interchange, which means those will still need to get on and off the peninsula during construction.
This is the proposed detour for trucks when the Cogswell Street Interchange is being redeveloped. (CBC News Graphics)
At a transportation committee hearing Thursday, staff presented the Morris Street idea as an option to accommodate trucks travelling to and from the Port of Halifax in the south end.
Trucks would bypass the interchange by looping around, through Morris Street to South Park Street, then crossing Spring Garden onto Robie Street, and then exiting the peninsula — and vice versa.
'Worst possible place'
The idea was quickly and harshly criticized.
"This is the worst possible place to bring 18-wheelers, and I don't know how it could possibly work," Coun. Matt Whitman said in an interview Friday.
"We need to find a permanent solution, not a temporary solution."

'Major disruption for trucks'
A Port of Halifax official declined an interview, saying its staff will meet with city planners to discuss changing the truck route. According to a progress report by project manager Steven Higgins, that meeting is scheduled for July 28.
"There's no question this is going to be a major disruption for trucks," Halifax spokesperson Brendan Elliott said.
"That's why we are coming out as early as we are with this information, so we can talk with all the different groups that would be affected by it."
Morris Street is a narrow road with one lane of traffic in either direction. (CBC)
'Take another look'
Businesses in the area could also be impacted by heavy truck traffic on the narrow streets, said Jennie Dobbs, owner of restaurant Morris East.
"It's already noisy as it is, and I already have concerns about an increase in traffic flow to the port," they said. "It has the potential to be really disruptive — and it would kill my patio business."
Trucks frequently drive through the Cogswell Street Interchange to reach the Port of Halifax. Those trucks will need a new route once the interchange redevelopment begins. (CBC)
The owner of Dartmouth-based trucking company Guysborough Transfer said he's hoping a better, if temporary, route can be found.
"I'm hoping that the city can take another look at it and maybe realize that it's not the best alternative," Pat Berrigan said.
Coun. Matt Whitman said the detour idea is impractical. (CBC)
Another option
Another option tossed about is to add truck and bus lanes around an existing rail line in south-end Halifax.
That would cost an estimated $200 million, but Whitman supports that project, with a reversing lane accommodating traffic going to the south in the morning and leaving in the afternoon.
"That piece of infrastructure is sitting right there and is waiting to be paved to put trucks and buses in there," Whitman said. "Make the downtown cycle friendly and pedestrian friendly."
Five years after becoming Africa's biggest trade partner, China is starting to admit that all is not perfect in its great African foray.
On Sunday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, who is on a four-nation visit that began in Ethiopia, acknowledged that trouble spots in Chinese-invested projects in several countries indicate “growing pains.” Li will also visit Nigeria, Kenya, and Angola in their seven-day trip, all countries where China has a weighty presence in resource extraction and infrastructure development.
The premier, who signed more than a dozen deals for building roads and industrial parks in Ethiopia, told a pre-departure news conference that China is deeply concerned with social development in Africa, not in becoming a new colonial power. That line may be more difficult to maintain in the years ahead.
“I wish to assure our African friends in all seriousness that China will never pursue a colonialist path like some countries did, or allow colonialism, which belongs to the past, to reappear in Africa,” Li was quoted as saying by the Xinhua news agency.
On Monday, Li announced in Ethiopia that China would expand an existing credit line to several African nations by $10 billion and add another $2 billion to the China-Africa Development Fund.
China has established a reputation of investing in Africa without attaching humanitarian strings. The strategy has been lauded by those who believe the terms are more honest than outdated Western development aid, but vilified by critics who see China as propping up corrupt, brutal regimes across the continent.
On the ground, many are wary of China's labor practices, and of a barrage of fake and substandard products, medicines, and consumer goods. Chinese-owned and managed mines and construction sites in several countries have suffered labor disputes. In addition to a lack of transparency in the terms agreed between Chinese and African dealmakers, China also faces an image problem among ordinary Africans.
With that backdrop, China appears to be changing its tactics a bit. China has become more involved in UN peacekeeping activities in Africa and positioned itself as a central diplomatic power in trying to quell violence in South Sudan. These moves represent a departure from China's previous business-first-and-only tactics, but officials haven't spelled out just how involved China could be in steering regional politics.
In a speech at the African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa on Monday, Li called growth in China-Africa relations an “unstoppable historical trend,” but gave no specifics on how China might change its dealings with African countries. It has pledged to double trade flows to $400 billion by 2020.

In an interview with several journalists from the countries they will visit, Li issued a statement that African countries should follow China's lead on economic and social development – another new turn from China in dispensing advice on how countries should develop.
“Africa must begin to self-assess and learn from the Chinese path of development to be able to initiate its own development plans and pursue African dreams,” Li was quoted as saying.
Vaping has always been about innovation,and sometimes all it takes is one person with an idea to make change. But when you're sick of smoking and have tried everything on the market that's supposed to make it easier, and they don't, you go about the business of creating something for yourself. If you're Sean Glas, that is.
Sean Glas isn't like you and me. But then again, he's just like us. After exhausting every other method of smoking cessation, Sean walked into a 7-11 one evening in late 2012, not realizing how their life was about to change. Buying a cigalike, they realized the device had a bit more promise than the patches and pills he'd tried. But something about it appealed to the psychology of smoking in them and spawned the greatness that is Glas Vapor.
This is where Sean and the rest of the world diverge. With their love of all things luxurious, and admiration for industry captains like Sir Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos, Sean decided to dip their toe in the vaping pool and come up with something a bit more enjoyable. So beginning in 2013, they combed the web to see what other vapers were talking about. What devices they were using, what flavors were out there. And they hit a wall.
“I would go to e-Cigarette Forum and Vaper Wall just seeing what everyone was vaping on,” Sean says. “What was out there and the community at the time was extremely elitist and manufacturers lacked customer service skills to accurately answer questions.”
So, they struck out on their own and spent the next two years researching, talking to manufacturers, engineers, and artists to try to develop their own device. Being a lover of luxury brands, wanting that same feel that they got from everything else in their life, they took it to the next level. Comfort, functionality, beauty, and simplicity was the result.
“I wanted to focus on the high-end consumer, being one myself. I wanted to build the highest quality product and provide customers with something that was timeless, classic, and highly functional while still being beautiful.”
The first mod Sean and their team created was the Glas Signature mod in 2014. A custom tooled, branded aluminum coin piece that contained precious metals like silver and rhodium. After that, the luxury just kept coming, including a limited edition Mokume, a thing of beauty that a select few connoisseurs enjoyed. With prices ranging from $325 to $1500 for a Glas mod, you can rest assured that quality is top notch, the vape is smooth, and the engineering is easily some of the best of the industry.
Having mastered the art of creating unique mechanical mods, you would think he'd be satisfied, right? Think again. Wanting to do something special so they could do to show appreciation to their customers who faithfully purchased their products, Sean decided to give an unprecedented gift for the holidays. They crafted a 100ml crystal bottle of a flavor they made himself, Pound Cake. What followed was an awakening and demand that Sean couldn't have predicted. Customers fell in love with the now iconic flavor. They wanted more. And they wanted it quickly. What is an innovator to do? Create, of course. They got to work carefully working with local gourmands to begin making this dynamic flavor of lemony, rich cake goodness. Thus, the original Glas lineup was born.
Sean went on to create recipes that touched them in ways that comes across clearly in their e-liquids.
“I love to cook and the recipes I come across inspire me every day in my work so I take my time and try to make the perfect flavor every single time. It's a labor of love for my customers who have come to expect the very best from our brand.”
L.A. is generally thought of as the birthplace of the vaping movement, with most of the heavy hitters in the game based there. The west coast is rife with manufacturers, vape shops, distributors, and customers. It can be very easy to get lost in the sea of brands, but that didn't stop Sean from branching out the brand even further with the creation of their sister lines, Sneakerhead, Fruit Pop and Fruit Whip.
“You just have to put blinders on and focus on making your product the best. We had already changed things up with the introduction of our mods, so we knew we simply couldn't blend in with our competitors; we had to stand out,” they say. And stand out, they did.
As a lover of sneakers and fine foods (the two aren't mutually exclusive), Sean took another leap in e-liquids. Being an avid “sneakerhead” himself, and recognizing the culture within our own vaping culture, they came up with Sneakerhead, a line devoted to those who loved kicks just as much as they did.
“I have quite the collection of sneakers because I love them so much; Jordan 11's, Air Max, the iconic Dunks, I love them all so I thought why not pay homage to these shoes that I love, and the people that love them as much as I do. The line took off from there and each flavor was hand-picked based on the shoe itself. We had an actual graffiti artist to create the labels for us, including the boxes they come in and the result was phenomenal.”
A true slam dunk indeed.
The same idea of catering to every vaper that's out there is how Fruit Pop and Fruit Whip were introduced. Time constraints due to FDA regulations kept them from truly cultivating and expanding these two lines further but the flavors do all the talking. Sean's obsessed with quality, so it's not hard to imagine that the ripe and wholesome fruits featured in each flavor were tested again and again until they were absolutely perfect, just like every other part of theirs brands.
But the method to their madness, if you can call it that, is in their ability to keep working on an idea until he's satisfied. Never being one to appreciate the mass-produced e-liquids out there, Sean meticulously oversaw every aspect of mixing and blending. The result is just a solidly produced, consistently tasty e-liquid. That attention to detail is what helps the brand to stand head and shoulders above so many other premium brands on the market.
After all this, and at such a young age, how does this man relax? Do they even relax? Downtime is hard to come by when you're a mogul and creator, but it's needed if you want to keep the mind fresh. Being naturally athletic, Sean spends their free time boxing, hiking the great canyons of L.A., walking with their dogs and running on the beach. And did we mention they love food? A self-proclaimed foodie, they feel most at home in the kitchen, coming up with edible delights for family and friends. But once all the food has been consumed, when the last bead of sweat has dropped, he's back in the office, or the lab, or in the sky, constantly looking for ways to enrich the customer experience.
That attention to detail, that level of razor-sharp intensity is melded into every bottle of Glas that is created. That's what luxury is all about.

Layne Murdoch/NBAE/Getty Images Think Deron Williams can get hot shooting for the Jazz? You should see them play "Call of Duty." Think Deron Williams can get hot shooting for the Jazz? You should see them play "Call of Duty."
Deron Williams could care less about their character in "NBA 2K11." You won't find them playing "Halo," "Madden," or "Red Dead Redemption" either.
"I actually don't play any new video games except 'Call of Duty,'" Williams tells me. "I'm addicted to 'Call of Duty.' It's the only game I need."
Make that the only franchise the Jazz superstar plays, as Williams says he's been playing COD nonstop since the beginning and is eagerly anticipating the release of the latest in the series, "Call of Duty: Black Ops" on November 9.
"The online play is the best," Williams explains. "I'm a gun blazing type of guy when I play online. I'm not very good with the sniper rifle, so I don't even mess with those.
"And now that 'Black Ops' is going to be in 3-D, that's crazy. Technology is getting so good, and I have my 3-D TV already, so I can't wait to play. Every 'Call of Duty' game just seems to get so much better, so I'm excited to check out the new maps and new weapons."
And as Williams breaks it down, he's not the only one on the Jazz who spends late nights online shooting it out in virtual warfare.
"We're all hooked," Williams says of their teammates. "We come home from road games and we get in at two in the morning and can't go to sleep, so we all go online and play 'Call of Duty' and talk crap. We've played until like five in the morning before."

It's a political script worthy of Machiavelli, featuring a player who is no stranger to such schemes.
Manitoba NDP MLA Erin Selby is being courted by the federal NDP to be the party's candidate in Winnipeg's Saint Boniface - Saint Vital riding. Reports have emerged of polling being done in the riding to ascertain how much support they have, and NDP leader Thomas Mulcair has hinted at a pending announcement of a star candidate.
article continues below
News of a potential Selby candidacy has surprised many political observers. They had a controversy-filled tenure as Manitoba's health minister, and was a founding member of the ‘gang of five' that failed to oust premier Greg Selinger as provincial NDP leader. They were booted from caucus, exiled to the backbenches, and has a slim chance of re-election in next April's provincial election.
The odds would be even worse in Saint Boniface - Saint Vital, where the NDP finished a distant third in the 2011 election, and didn't win a single poll in either of the past two elections. Liberal Dan Vandal, a popular former city councillor for the area, is the front-runner to fill the seat vacated by Conservative Shelly Glover.  They are being challenged by Conservative François Catellier and the Green Party's Glenn Zaretski.
Why would Selby consider resigning as an MLA to run in a no-hope federal riding? Why would Mulcair want a candidate with so much political baggage?
They would require a powerful incentive to walk away from more than $60,000 in MLA pay cheques before the next provincial election; perhaps the promise of a cabinet position if they win and the NDP forms government, or a well-paying patronage appointment if they lose but the NDP wins. We should assume those promises have or will be made, but their fulfillment is contingent on an NDP victory that is far from guaranteed with seven weeks remaining in the campaign.
As to the NDP's reason for pursuing a candidate with such a controversial political history, there are better potential candidates who likely declined before Selby was asked.
That said, we should view the NDP's pursuit of a high-profile candidate to run in a riding where victory is unlikely as a part of a broader party strategy. The NDP claims its goal is to defeat the Harper Conservatives and form government, but the party's leadership is also committed to ensuring that the Liberal Party remains a weak third party and is ultimately destroyed.
Based on their experiences in provinces such as Manitoba and Saskatchewan, New Democrats know that a de facto two-party system, with a feeble or non-existent centrist alternative, virtually guarantees the NDP would win the majority of elections. The last thing party leadership wants -- and the thing they fear -- is a resurgent Liberal Party capable of eventually shunting the NDP back to third-party irrelevance.
Viewed from that perspective, the motive behind the party's recruitment of a high-profile candidate like Selby becomes evident. They know they can't win in Saint Boniface - Saint Vital, but they don't want the Liberals to win either. They would rather split the centre-left vote and allow Catellier to prevail.
Beyond that, forcing the Liberals to work harder and spend more money in support of Vandal could make it easier for the NDP to win in Winnipeg Centre, Winnipeg North and Elmwood-Transcona.
It is a strategy that is playing out in several Tory-held ridings throughout the country where Liberal candidates are positioned to win. One example is Winnipeg South Centre, where Liberal Jim Carr is challenging incumbent Joyce Bateman. Another is Toronto's Eglinton-Lawrence riding, where finance minister Joe Oliver is being pushed by Liberal Marco Mendicino.
The NDP candidates in those and other ridings have no hope of winning, but have sufficient profile to make it much more difficult for the Liberal candidates to win.
The scheme may appear both counterintuitive and counterproductive to those who assume the NDP would work with the Liberals to defeat the Harper Conservatives, but it serves the NDP's long-term interests. In this instance, vote-splitting on the left helps the party.
It's the new strategic reality of three parties fighting for power, and likely something we will see more of in coming elections.

“I don't see colour, I just see a human being” is something racist White Americans say. It sounds high-minded and anti-racist to them and they probably mean well, but it is like saying:
I don't see a woman, I just see a human being.
I don't see a Frenchman, I just see a human being.
I don't see my friend, I just see a human being.
I don't see a cat, I just see a mammal.
As if there is something wrong with being a woman or a Frenchman or one's friend or a cat. Or a person of colour. As if there is something so wrong in not being white that white people must somehow overlook that supposed fault to accept others.
The idea is that being different is bad, that to be accepted you have to be seen as the same somehow. That in the end white is right.
At best it is a science fiction statement about another world way in the future (or way back in the time-travel past), a world where colour truly does not matter. But that world is not America in 2011. So to talk like that seems delusional at best.
It is a delusion that people of colour in America cannot afford. If you try to act as if you are white when you cannot pass for white, it leads, at best, to internalized racism, self-doubt and confusion. The only healthy course of action is to own your colour and be proud of it. So your colour becomes part of who you are. It is not something to “not see” as if it were a matter of shame.
In practice, of course, the statement seems to mean the complete opposite: that they do notice colour – why else did they bring it up? – that in fact it is probably the only thing they noticed, so much so that you have become a cardboard stereotype in their minds based on hip hop or kung fu or who knows what.
Even if racism disappeared there would still be African Americans and Asian Americans and so on, just like there are still Irish Americans and Italian Americans. It is just that not being white would no longer be a big deal – just like not being a Wasp is no longer a big deal, even though it was a hundred years ago. There would still be differences and people would notice them but they would not be seen in a bad light, they would not be used to dehumanize.
It is not the differences that cause racism nor does it lie in noticing or not noticing them – it is how we deal with those differences that matters.
Not seeing colour will not make racism go away. Because it leaves untouched the idea that being different, of not being white, is somehow bad. Because by not seeing colour you do not see racism either, which keeps everything just the way it is.

Image copyright AP Image caption President Park was marking the 1919 uprising against Japanese colonial rule
South Korean President Park Geun-hye has warned Japan it will only bring isolation on itself if it reviews a statement acknowledging its wartime use of sex slaves.
They called on Japan to embrace "truth and reconciliation".
Japan apologised in 1993 to survivors of the many thousands of women who were forced into army brothels.
On Friday Tokyo said it would set up a panel to review the evidence on which that apology was based.
Some conservatives in Japan have claimed that the women, known euphemistically as "comfort women", were prostitutes - something fiercely denied by the women and by Japan's neighbours.
President Park's warning came in a speech marking the anniversary of a 1919 uprising in Korea against Japanese colonial rule.
"Historical truth is in testimony from the survivors," they said.
"Japan would only bring isolation on itself if it turns a deaf ear to their testimony and sweeps it under the rug for political benefits."
President Park urged Japan to follow the example of Germany in repenting its past wrongs so that their two countries could "move forward for a new era of co-operation, peace and prosperity".
"I hope Japan extricates itself from denial of history and starts making a new history of truth and reconciliation", they said.
Image copyright AP Image caption A museum to some of the comfort women was set up in a nursing home in Toechon, South Korea
Some 200,000 women in territories occupied by Japan during World War Two are estimated to have been forced to become sex slaves for troops.
Many of the women came from China and Korea, but also from the Philippines, Indonesia and Taiwan.
The 1993 acknowledgement from Japan was viewed as a landmark apology.
Issued by then Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono, the statement acknowledged that women had been coerced, and that the Japanese military had been involved in the establishment and management of the process.
Their statement was based in part on evidence given by 16 Korean women.
However, Japanese government spokesperson Yoshihide Suga said on Friday that a team would be formed to review the lead-up to the 1993 statement.
They said the team would "re-examine and understand the background".
They did not say whether Japan would issue a new statement following the review.
Former Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama has urged against any revision of the apology.
Mr Murayama, who was prime minister from June 1994 to January 1996, said that the Kono statement was based on evidence.

“Support, protect, and defend the Constitution and Government of the United States.” These words resonate in every oath of office to which the recently elected have been swearing since November. So it's inexplicable why Florida Republicans are filing legislation that directly conflicts with this principle.
Rep. Julio Gonzalez, the Venice Republican, filed House Joint Resolution 121 immediately following the Christmas holiday, hopeful the rest of us aren't paying attention. Like a knife in the dark, the bill, if voters approve the constitutional amendment it's seeking, would grant the Republican-dominated Legislature a golden pen and supremacy over all courts—county, circuit, appellate and supreme, regarding future legislative matters.
If the Florida Supreme Court today strikes down a law passed by the Legislature, that law is no longer valid. If Gonzalez's proposal becomes law, the Legislature may one day have the authority to override any Supreme Court ruling—or any other non-federal court ruling—with two-thirds majorities of the House and Senate. Florida Republicans already have those majorities in both chambers.
Gonzalez filed a separate bill asking Congress to start the process that would lead to an amendment to the U.S. Constitution, granting Congress the same power over the United States Supreme Court.
Gonzalez claims the “judiciary branch of the Federal Government has taken an increasingly activist role aimed at molding legislation.”  They are just as critical of state courts. They may have a case if it were true. But their understanding of constitutional history is as shaky as their grasp of recent issues between their Legislature and the Florida Supreme Court.
In Marbury v. Madison, the Supreme Court's first landmark case, Chief Justice John Marshall established the principle of judicial review over all matters pertaining to laws of the United States. Marshall's ruling also reinforced a fundamental, hierarchical difference between constitutional law and all future legislative acts. The Constitution is paramount. No law, in other words, may override or “offend” the Constitution.
“It is emphatically the duty of the Judicial Department to say what the law is,” Marshall wrote. “Those who apply the rule to particular cases must, of necessity, expound and interpret the rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the Court must decide on the operation of each.”
Why then, do Florida Republicans feel entitled to a legal redress? What injuries have they suffered at the hands of the judiciary? What, to them, defines judicial overreach? Certainly a better case can be made that suggests the opposite. It's the Legislature that's been overstepping its mandate by attempting to manipulate elections through illegally drawn electoral districts.
The foundations of democracy depend on legitimate elections in truly representative districts. That's not the kind of districts the Legislature drew after the 2010 census. It got to work disenfranchising swaths of voters while maximizing Republican electoral chances. The League of Women Voters of Florida accused the state GOP of active partisanship in redistricting, sued and won: The Supreme Court ruled that certain electoral districts in Florida had been illegally drawn by the [Republican majority] legislature and were in fact, partisan in intent – a more diplomatic label for gerrymandering. And this after voters had approved a constitutional amendment to reduce gerrymandering. (Flagler County's House and Senate districts were affected by the decision.)
If not for an arguably conservative intervention by the court, the disenfranchisement of Florida voters would have lingered and perhaps proliferated so long as the Republican majority remained in control.
“The very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws whenever they receive an injury,” Marshall wrote. Unfortunately for Florida voters who have suffered injury from Republican manipulation of voting districts, there is no true remedy for mendacity. Elections cannot be undone.
Ironic how the same legislative body that swears to uphold the Constitution undermines voters while seeking to silence the only branch of government in its way. “If such be the real state of things, this is worse than solemn mockery,” Marshall had aptly written about duplicitous oath-takers. “To prescribe or to take this oath becomes equally a crime.”
If we grant any merit to legislative proposals like Gonzalez's, we'd be overriding hundreds of years of common law, Constitutional law and judicial interpretation. We'd be complicit in eroding our democracy and handing unchecked power to a few senators and House members. It would be no less of a mockery than to still give credence to the oath our legislators swear to uphold even as they scheme to undermine it. How our democratic nation could tolerate such provocation and transgression by any body of representatives is beyond comprehension.
Thankfully, our laws and Constitution are still in our hands – for now.

License Plate Reader Company Sues Another State For 'Violating' Its First Amendment Right To Build A 1.8-Billion-Image Database
from the're-really-just-like-some-dude-with-a-point-and-shoot dept
In this case, the two firms in question—Digital Recognition Network (DRN) and Vigilant Systems—generate, maintain, and share access to the license plate reader database with law enforcement.
The new Arkansas state law took effect in 2014, and it bans the private collection of license plate reader data while still allowing the cops to use the devices, usually mounted on patrol cars. The two companies say that their First Amendment rights are being violated, as they are allowed to photograph—even under an automated, high-speed process that is then shared with law enforcement—any and all license plates, anywhere.
Plaintiffs' dissemination of license-plate information collected by ALPR systems is speech protected by the First Amendment. Similarly, the use of ALPR systems to collect and create information by taking a photograph amounts to constitutionally protected speech.
The Act is a content-based speech restriction. The illegality of speech under the statute turns on the content of what is being photographed and transmitted through ALPR systems-license-plate information is covered, but other content is not. The Legislature has singled out the collection and dissemination of "images of license plates" and the resulting "computer-readable data." Ark. Code§ 12-12-1802(2), 12-12-1803(a); see also § 12-121082(3). Moreover, the Act's extensive exceptions further demonstrate that it discriminates based on the content of the speech and the identity of the speaker.
Private companies engaging in large-scale surveillance are pushing back against the push back against large-scale surveillance… by filing lawsuits alleging their First Amendment right to photograph license plates is being infringed on by state laws forbidding the use of automatic license plate readers by private companies.Now, these laws aren't saying law enforcement agencies can't use these readers. They can. What they do say (or did… Utah's law was amended after a lawsuit by license plate reader company Vigilant) is that private companies, like repossession firms and tow truck services, can't use these readers. But apparently they do, and those who manufacture and support the equipment would like to continue capturing this market.Cyrus Farivar at Ars Technica reports that Vigilant has filed another lawsuit, this time against the state of Arkansas, arguing that a state law curbing the use of LPRs by private companies tampers with its free speech rights There's a bit of a disconnect in Viglant's/DRN's logic, but one that's a bit troublesome for the courts to address. By portraying the capture of license plates at a rate of nearly 1,000 per hour as little more than a digital version of someone taking individual photographs of publicly-displayed plates, the companies hope to make its technology look less intrusive than it is.The troublesome part is that courts have held that privacy violations that don't exist in the singular can't magically be summoned bycollections. There are definitely privacy concerns, however, especially when this information is used (and misused) by law enforcement. But the companies argue that there's nothing personally identifiable about a license plate, at least without access to other databases like those held by states' departments of motor vehicles. (Oddly, law enforcement officials have made the same argument , despite having this access.) This is true, but it's of little comfort when the privately-held database contains 1.8 billion records and is growing at the rate of 70 million per month.Here's the crux of Vigliant's First Amendment assertions.This is a tough hurdle for the state to leap and is likely what prompted Utah to heavily amend its state law in exchange for Vigilant dropping the lawsuit. Unfortunately, in Utah's case, the state seems to have overcompensated. The amendment strikes any prohibition of a private entity collecting license plate data and allows these same entities to sell collected data to other third parties, something it expressly forbids government agencies from doing. It also allows for these companies to hold onto the data for as long as nine months, something that was only 30 days in the original bill.So, Vigilant's point remains that what it does in terms of collection is not a violation of privacy because it does not have access to DMV databases holding personally-identifiable information. It glosses over the fact that it provides access to hundreds of law enforcement agencies around the US, all of which can acquire the connecting data. But that does seem to put the onus on law enforcement agencies to provide adequate privacy protections, including timely disposal of non-hit data. So far, very few agencies have attempted to so. In Utah's case, there areof historic, non-hit data at law enforcement's fingertips, all with time and location info.In the singular (as Vigilant's argument goes), this isn't a privacy violation -- no different that someone taking a picture of a vehicle in public. But several months of time and location data creates something that can only be achieved through dedicated surveillance, something that does raise privacy questions, especially in light of the recent court decision finding that law enforcement officers need warrants to track cell phone users' locations . This is the same principle. Law enforcement agencies shouldn't be accessing months of plate location/time data unless it's part of an investigation -- and if it is, someone neutral needs to be deciding whether or not every license plate hit is relevant to the situation.

A hunter hunts their kin. (Click for big)
The past couple of weeks have seen us enter a new phase with the game. We're following the sort-of-standard development cycle in that for us “alpha” means “playable, but not yet feature complete”, and that's where we are now. That's not to say that the game is entirely fleshed out, because it lacks a tonne of art assets to fill out multiple islands, and it needs lashings more work on fine tuning our combat and stealth systems.
However, we are now able to jump in and play, and that's an enormously pleasing place to be. In the rest of this post I want to give you an overview of the project, and to talk to you a bit about our plans.
Just so we're clear, here's an overview of the game: Sir, You Are Being Hunted is a stealth and survival-focused FPS. It has a British horror/sci-fi theme, and is set on an archipelago of mysterious islands, which are stalked by robotic gentlemen and their mechanical hounds. You must survive and escape from the islands. Doing that will involve piecing together the method for your escape, surviving with what you scavenge, and employing found weapons (including shotguns, axes, bombs and traps) in your battle against the automaton foe.
The islands are procedurally generated. This means every player will get a different map, with a different layout, and it'll be entirely possible for players to generate their own unique archiplagoes for each playthrough, customising the world settings to create personalised environments. These maps will be savable, allowing you to share particularly lovely ones with other players.
Sir is being developed in Unity, and will be released some time in 2013 on Windows, OSX and Linux. We have no current plans for multiplayer or other formats, but those are due consideration.
Who Is Making Sir, You Are Being Hunted?
James Carey is our lead-designer and fearless motivational speaker. James is obsessed with game systems and simulationist approaches to design, evidenced by their time working at Bohemia (Arma 2) and The Creative Assembly (Viking: Battle For Asgard, Empire Total War). James is responsible for overseeing production of the game, and does a bit of coding and a tonne of design.
Tom Betts is our clever programmer. He's worked for years in the code-art scene, making mods, installations, music, and a few games, but is now getting fully involved Unity-driven coding. Tom joined us to work Fallen City for Channel 4, but our primary shared interest is generative and procedural approaches to game design. Tom has built our landscape generator, and a lot more besides.
Jim Rossignol – that's me! – he's a writer of long repute. You probably know them from publications such as Rock, Paper, Shotgun, PC Gamer, and so on. He's working as the creative director and hapless spokesperson for the project.
Dan Puzey is our part-time coder. Their interests lie in artificial intelligence, and he's been bringing the hunters to life and making it possible for us to fear our automatic gentlemen!
We're also being helped out by a handful of freelance artists, including Christophe Canon, who has provided us with sterling texture and modelling work.

What stage is the development of the game at?
Right now we're piecing together a build of the game that we're happy to film gameplay footage of. That means having in full functional world generation, as well as working, combative and responsive hunter AI, and at least the first pass of our UI and general world interface. Once that's in place we're going to start showing off the game in action, which we can't wait to do. Most of those systems are up and running, and now it's s case of ironing out bugs and making them look presentable before we start pouring in my fancy content.
There's a tonne of work still to be done on things like fleshing out the AI behaviour, and there are numerous other characters we'd like to introduce to the island that we've only just begun work on. All that will begin to unfold in the coming weeks. Now that we've broken the back of making this a playable game – at least in its early, prototype state – we're going to keep you updated with what's happening from week to week.

What happens next?
Well, we've self-funded the project this far, and now we're looking at how to continue. Kickstarter is, of course, central to those considerations. What we're aiming to do definitely needs that sort of pre-order level support, and going that route might be our best bet to pulling off this minor feat of indie-game development. The next few weeks will decide for certain what we do next. Whatever happens, we're going to create a fantastic open-world game that stands on its own merits. Frankly, none of us can wait for you guys to be able to play it.
But all in good time.
Okay, so what's happened recently then?
In brief: open-world stealth and robot cleverness.
Dan and Tom have made huge advances in terms of AI functionality and general player system usefulness. Until the last week or so, our robotic gents had only basic senses, reacting with too-inhuman speed and precision to the sights and sounds of our procedural world. We've recently completed another pass on these senses allowing them to be modified by bot-specific variables so that our hunters act with more personality, and behave more interestingly as you sneak and fight.
Crucially, this AI stuff comes along with a new system for concealment whereby a sample of the surrounding foliage modifies the player's visibility (along with their speed and stance), which we're hugely pleased with. People have been asking how we will handle stealth in an open landscape with lots of foliage, and the answer is basically that we are calculating the visibility of the player from their surroundings, and where he's standing. This will be displayed on-screen with a Thief-like visibility meter, to give players a good sense of how visible they are. The system works really well in conjunction with the visual detection ranges of our bots: if you are laying still in long grass they will not see you until they get very close, but you might give yourself away by moving. You will be able to sneak quite effectively, but it will also be a skill that players will master as they play, which I am sure players will begin to perfect when they intuit the amount they are hidden by differing vegetation. This combined system (of foliage-based visibility and varied states of AI alertness) means we're starting to get some real cat-and-mouse emergent behaviours from our AI.
Bots also now lead targets with varying degrees of accuracy, react with varying degrees of interest to partially-glimpsed movement and generally behave more like thinking machines than predictable automata. It's all exciting stuff, and we have Dan to thank for putting so much of their free time into it.
This layering on of complexity to our AI will, of course, continue throughout development. We're now working on a morale system and cover-taking mechanics that should lead to breakable units and even more emergent behaviour. It's starting to become a very dangerous place to move around in…
Literally as I've been writing this, we've seen a beautiful little emergent vignette in the latest build. We were watching a hunter patrol, and we were hidden and unobserved. One of the patrolling hunters spooked some ravens who were clustered around the base of a monument. The noise of the ravens taking flight in turn triggered the bots status from Safe to Alert state, which in turn ups the stats that govern how much attention they're paying to their surroundings. This caused them to spot the player (safely hidden while the bot had been less wary) and the hunt was on! Emergence like that helps us feel that we're on the right track with the stealth aspect of the game.
Let us know what you think on the forum!

“It's amazing how many people drive or walk right on top of what we're doing, and have no clue what's happening right below them.”
So says one of the officials with Metrolinx, which is overseeing construction of the Eglinton Crosstown light rail transit project. It's a spectacular $5 billion feat of engineering that few people have actually had a chance to see being built.
A drive through the Eglinton Crosstown tunnel.
Every day, the boring machines tunnel through an average of 10 metres of clay and dirt, roughly 20 metres underneath Eglinton Avenue West in midtown Toronto. The plan is, six years from now, a 19-km, state-of-the-art light rail transit line will shoot across the middle of the city, with more than half the track running underground.
One hundred trucks arrive on site every day to remove the earth that's being dug away. Into that hole just east of Allen Road and Eglinton Avenue West, construction workers and engineers are placing curved concrete segments, which when attached, form the tunnel wall which the light rail line will pass through. Each segment weighs 1.5 tonnes and is manufactured in Barrie.
Lead construction engineer Andre Solecki gives a tour of the Eglinton Crosstown construction site.
The tunnelling started in June 2013 at Black Creek Drive, about seven kilometres west of Yonge Street, and bored east to a spot just west of Allen Road. The tunnelling recommenced east of Allen Road and will continue east, all the way to Yonge Street.
Then, three months ago from the eastern flank of the route, two other boring machines began tunnelling from Brentcliffe Road west towards Yonge Street.
Last week, Metrolinx officials gave members of the media a tour of the tunnelling. The amount of infrastructure involved is truly astonishing. Andre Solecki, the lead construction engineer, gave us a tour of the environmentally controlled tunnel, where men and women work in T-shirts despite chilly temperatures on the surface above.
Workers prepare the massive tunnel segments before they are put into place.
While it was amazing to see such feats of engineering, make no mistake, this is a construction site and dangers abound. We were given a lengthy demonstration before going underground on what to do should something serious happen. Each person would have access to a portable oxygen kit with eight hours of air, in case the tunnel air became unbreathable. John Moore from Newstalk 1010 looked at me and quipped, “Why do I suddenly feel like one of 33 Chilean miners?”
Everyone who goes underground gets two tags — one stays on their or their person, the other is hooked to a big board at the entrance to the tunnel, so authorities know at all times whoare above and who's below.
It's also interesting to learn that not everything under the surface is the same. In points further west, barely anyone knew the tunnelling was happening. But apparently, the earth is somewhat different as the tunnelling moved closer to Bathurst Street. Complaints from residents and businesses have skyrocketed, as people can feel the earth move, despite the depth at which it's all happening. This is a 24/7 operation and so, yes, digging and construction takes place all the time.
A tunnel segment is installed.
If everything goes according to plan, the Eglinton Crosstown will begin transporting riders in September 2021, with up to 25 stops across the middle of the city.
Compare that to the Scarborough Subway, which will cost much more per kilometre to construct and feature just three stops.

We have iMacs, iPods, iPhones and iPads. But why didn't Apple call its hotly anticipated new smartwatch the iWatch?

Apple can't call new device iWatch after Irish firm trademarks name
The answer may lie with one Athlone-based company. Probendi, a software firm that is gearing up to make its own smartwatch, showed considerable foresight when it registered a Europe-wide trademark for the term "iWatch" in 2008.
As a result, Apple may have had to opt for the name 'Apple Watch' instead.
The small Athlone company was setup by an Italian living in the area, 50-year-old Daniele Di Salvo.
Its product is a communications service between professional organisations, such as some Italian police forces, which use it to transfer mugshots.
And now, the company is getting ready to rub salt into the wounds of Apple's trademark gap - by releasing their own smartwatch using the iWatch name.
What's more, the device is expected to run Android, the operating system made by Apple's deadliest rival, Google. Mr Di Salvo told RTE Radio this morning that they could not talk about any possible negotiations with Apple over the name but insisted they would "absolutely push ahead" with plans for a smartwatch.
"We know the name is easily associated with a smartwatch but it is not [yet] a smartwatch," they said.
They also told the international newswire Bloomberg that they were currently sourcing manufacturing partners in China to make the new version of a smartwatch.
They also said that their own iWatch would have a square touchscreen, GPS satnav facilities and an accelerometer to facilitate health tracking and other apps.
A spokesperson for Apple said that the company had no comment to make.
It is not the first time that Apple has seen trademark controversy.
The company sued online retailer Amazon.com for using 'Appstore' as the name for its Kindle software marketplace, kicking off two years of court battles that were eventually dismissed. Amazon continues to use the name today.
In 2012, Apple paid almost €50m to settle a trademark dispute in China over rights to use the name iPad.
And in 2006, Steve Jobs previewed a product called the ITV but changed it to Apple TV following objections from British television network iTV.
Meanwhile, Apple CEO Tim Cook (inset above) has said that the Apple Watch will need to be recharged every day. The company says that the product will be launched in "early 2015".
Sales of smartwatches up to now have been largely limited to sports and racing devices, such as those made by Garmin, or health-conscious wrist gadgets such as Fitbit.
Smartwatches from Samsung and Sony, which show notifications and social messages, have achieved modest sales.
However, the watch trademark controversy has not affected Apple's immediate prospects or financial performance.
The company's stock market value has risen €50bn (to €490bn) in the last 14 days after it reported strong profits and soaring sales for its latest iPhone 6 handset.

The Five aren't exactly immune to business cycles. Apple's sales were flat last year, and after a monster 2016, Alphabet's stock price hit a plateau. The Five also aren't entirely safe from competition from start-ups, and one of the persistent features of the tech industry is that some of the most perilous threats to giants are the hardest to spot.
Still, at the moment, thanks to smart acquisition strategies and a long-term outlook, the Five sure do look insulated from competition from start-ups; today's most valuable tech upstarts, like Airbnb, Uber and Snap, could grow quite huge and still pose little threat to the collective fortunes of the Frightful Five.
What has changed is public perception. For years, most of the Five enjoyed broad cultural good will. They were portrayed in the news media as forces of innovation and delight, as the best that American capitalism had to offer. The exceptions were Microsoft, which reached towering heights through corporate ruthlessness in the 1990s, and Amazon, which got under people's skin for, among other things, making books cheaper and more widely accessible, thereby hurting bookstores.
But generally people loved tech giants. They had gotten huge just the way you're supposed to in America — by inventing new stuff that people love. And even their worst sins weren't considered that bad. They weren't causing environmental disasters. They weren't selling cigarettes. They weren't bringing the world to economic ruin through dangerous financial shenanigans. After I noted the Five's growing invincibility last year, the biggest pushback I got from people at these companies had to do with the moniker I had given them: Why hadn't I called them the Fabulous Five?
Over the last year perception began to change. Familiarity breeds contempt; as technology wormed deeper into our lives, it began to feel less like an unalloyed good and more like every other annoyance we have to deal with.
Silicon Valley grew cloistered, missing people's unease with the speed with which their innovations were changing our lives. When Apple took on the Federal Bureau of Investigation last year over access to a terrorist's iPhone, many in tech sided with the company, but a majority of Americans thought Apple should give in.
The Canadian Forces will take part in Exercise Tradewinds 16, a United States-led multinational “maritime interdiction, disaster response, and ground security exercise” taking place in the Caribbean from June 5th to 28th.
Ships, aircraft and personnel from 20 nations are taking part.
Canadian Forces personnel will both lead and participate in various land and maritime training serials throughout the duration of the exercise, according to the Canadian military. Additional personnel will also participate in an observer/trainer capacity.
The Royal Canadian Navy's contribution to Exercise Tradewinds 16 will consist of one Maritime Coastal Defence Vessel (Her Majesty's Canadian Ship Shawinigan), with a crew of 40, as well as a diver training team from Fleet Diving Unit (Atlantic) and Fleet Diving Unit (Pacific), according to the CF. HMCS Shawinigan will focus on areas such as firefighting, suspect vessel tracking and boarding procedures, and weapons handling. The team of divers will lead training in areas including nighttime diving operations, hull search techniques and evidence site contamination prevention.
The Canadian Army will provide a contingent of approximately 30 personnel, primarily from The 1st Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, based in Edmonton, Alberta, according to the Canadian Forces. In partnership with the U.S. military and the Jamaica Defence Force, the Canadian Army helped design and will co-lead training in conducting a firing range, urban operations, command and control mentorship in a joint operational headquarters, and counter-illicit trafficking.
Tradewinds 16 will also mark the first activation of the Canadian Forces' Operational Support Hub (OSH) Latin America and the Caribbean. The hub serves as the in-theatre support platform for Canadian military personnel participating in the largest component of the exercise, in Jamaica.

The “Save Outwrite” campaign raised a total of $6,680 and so far $5,000 of that has been returned to donors, Rafshoon said today.
The campaign received an initial $1,000 donation from Pamm Burdett of the Lloyd E. Russell Foundation. Two separate donors made donations of $4,000 and $1,000. At the store's anniversary party, patrons made tips to the campaign totaling $680.
The $4,000 and $1,000 donations have been returned, Rafshoon said. They said they are continuing to try to reach Burdett to return that donation. The $680 will be donated to a charitable organization, they said.
“We just don't want this to overshadow everything we did,” Rafshoon said. “I appreciate all the calls of support we've gotten over the past 24 hours.”
While publicly discussing plans to move and continue Outwrite, Rafshoon paid a $1,000 fee to Atlanta bankruptcy attorney Keith Eady on Oct. 13 and another fee of $6,694 to Eady on Nov. 30, as well as a $306 court fee, the bankruptcy filing shows.
Rafshoon said today the bankruptcy attorney was paid in October because they needed advice in case they decided to file for bankruptcy for Outwrite.
“We certainly batted the idea [of bankruptcy] around for at least if not more than a year,” Rafshoon said. “I have been talking on and off with [bankruptcy attorney] Keith Eady. We started talks in case we had to do it. We wanted to make sure the attorney was paid in case this was the route we had to go.”
It wasn't until Jan. 10 that the final decision to file for bankruptcy was made and it wasn't known until Jan. 17 that the bankruptcy filing would be made on Jan. 26, Rafshoon said.
“That's when we made the decision there was no turning back,” they said.
The landlord of the building at 10th Street and Piedmont Avenue, Jodaco Inc., filed an eviction suit against Outwrite on Jan. 10. Rafshoon said they and Outwrite disputed the lawsuit so a court date could be made. Otherwise, the landlord could have forced the store to get out of the space by Jan. 18, Rafshoon said.
“We had to file bankruptcy to avoid the court hearing. The court date was yesterday and when we filed bankruptcy the hearing was canceled,” Rafshoon said.
By disputing the eviction lawsuit, Rafshoon said money could be made to pay sales taxes as well as employees.
“Every dime had to go to into paying sales taxes. It wasn't until Jan. 17 when we realized we had to do this [bankruptcy filing] on Jan. 26,” they said. “And every employee got paid.”
Outwrite owes $184,000 in state sales taxes from the past four years and has more than $500,000 in total debts owed, according to court documents filed in U.S. bankruptcy court. The store listed more than $78,000 in total assets, records show.
The store had $298.54 in its checking count as of Jan. 26, according to the filing. Outwrite states in the documents that it lost $43,207 in 2009, lost $98,571 in 2010, lost $10,000 in 2011 but made a $5,000 profit in 2012.
Founded in 1993, Outwrite became an unofficial community center for Atlanta, attracting visitors from across the state as well as becoming a destination spot for out-of-town visitors. The store was also known for attracting numerous star authors and celebrities, including Chelsea Handler, Don Lemon, Gregory Maguire and Jodi Picoult.
Outwrite also served as a place where many upcoming and local authors could sell their books and hold readings.

HALIFAX—A groundbreaking anti-cyberbullying law passed a matter of weeks after Rehtaeh Parsons' death could face its first serious charter test in a Halifax courtroom Friday. Lawyer David Fraser is awaiting two decisions from a Supreme Court of Nova Scotia justice: one to determine whether messages between their client and a former business partner should be considered cyberbullying.

The next decision will determine whether Fraser can launch their argument that the provincial Cyber-safety Act is unconstitutional under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. “The problem is the legislation is so broad that essentially anything you do that hurts somebody's feelings online in Nova Scotia is cyberbullying,” said Fraser, who has been an outspoken critic of the law. Justice Glen MacDougall is expected to rule on whether Fraser's client, Robert Snell, cyberbullied Giles Crouch when the two got into a dispute. Crouch sought a cyber safety protection order against Snell last December that prevents Snell from communicating with Crouch.

Fraser said they see the Nova Scotia law “as an unreasonable and unjustified infringement of freedom of expression rights under the charter.” “We don't think that what took place could reasonably be understood to be cyberbullying,” Fraser said of their client's case. Once the judge has ruled on whether Snell has engaged in cyberbullying, Fraser said it's expected he'll rule on whether to entertain the Charter challenge of the law. Fraser said the province, which is defending the law, contends the challenge won't be necessary if the judge rules no cyberbullying occurred. The law was passed in May 2013 by the province's former NDP government in response to public furor around the handling of the Parsons case.
The teen's family alleges Parsons was sexually assaulted in November 2011 and bullied for months when a digital photo of the assault was passed around their school. They died after attempting suicide in April 2013. Parsons' death also acted as a catalyst for the federal government, which changed the Criminal Code to make it illegal to distribute intimate images without consent.

The provincial act defines cyberbullying as any electronic communication “that ought reasonably be expected to cause fear, intimidation, humiliation, distress or other damage or harm to another persons health, emotional well being, self-esteem or reputation.” Fraser said they will argue the law fails to take into account such things as the vulnerability of the victim and whether or not there was a prior relationship, the nature of the relationship, or whether the statements made are truthful or could be considered fair comment. They also blame the speed with which the legislation was passed for the charter oversights and says that will be part of their argument in court. The bill was introduced April 25, 2013, and was passed just over two weeks later on May 10. Dalhousie University law professor Wayne MacKay, who led a task force ordered by the province after Parsons' death, said the definition of cyberbullying in the law is essentially like the one in their report, although they had no hand in crafting the legislation. MacKay said the law is broad and does limit free speech, but they believe it is an effective one that could perhaps stand a few legal tweaks. “I think it would be really unfortunate if the whole law were struck down,” said MacKay. They believe the question will be whether there is room for interpretation in applying the law in a way that properly balances the harm caused by cyberbullying and the limitations placed on free speech. “I conclude that it (the law) does, although it is a tight call I've got to admit,” said MacKay.

Nine pairs of police dogs dressed in shawls, hats and socks were placed on a decorated platform like those used in traditional weddings in the ceremony on Monday in the central town of Kandy.
Their marriages were also registered by an official in the presence of a crowd of veterinary surgeons, medical doctors, top police officers and the public.
Video footage on local television showed the married dog couples were later being driven away in a decorated police jeep for their "honeymoons".
The ceremony received wide publicity, and also strong criticism from the cultural officials.
Culture and Arts Minister T.B. Ekananayake said the ceremony undermined traditional wedding rituals and should be strongly condemned. They called for an investigation into the incident. A decorated platform is used for traditional nuptials by the Sri Lanka's majority Sinhalese Buddhists.
Police spokesperson Buddhika Siriwardena apologised on Tuesday for any damage to the country's cultural heritage, saying the programme was aimed at breeding the sniffer dogs.
"This programme is aimed at breeding dogs accustomed to local weather and food, thereby saving money," Siriwardena said in a statement, adding that in 2011 the police department spent $500,000 (£323,000) importing such dogs from the Netherlands.

SALEM, N.H. -- Only about 50 days had passed since Kelly Olynyk was last in Boston, but, boy, had expectations grown.
Dubbed a complementary role player by Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge on draft night, all it took was a stellar five-game performance at their pro debut at the Orlando Pro Summer League for some Boston fans to ready Olynyk for the Hall of Fame.
Olynyk averaged a team-best 18 points and 7.8 rebounds over 24 minutes per game this summer, shooting 57.8 percent from the floor, and was named to the all-tournament first team. Fernando Medina/NBAE/Getty Images
On a pristine late-August morning, the 22-year-old Olynyk stood in the lot of a New Hampshire Park and Ride off Interstate 93 as a police escort assembled to deliver them -- and 30 children from the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children -- to a nearby amusement park for a Shamrock Foundation event. Just days after league MVP LeBron James received an unauthorized police escort to a Justin Timberlake and Jay-Z concert in Miami, there were wisecracks about all this attention going to the rookie's head.
Olynyk just smiled when asked about the escort. Truth be told, it wasn't even the first one of their basketball career. An officer noted that traffic on I-93 would soon be back to the New Hampshire border; the escort was the only way this crew was getting to the park anytime soon.
The 7-foot Olynyk, with their long hair and a green Celtics shirt, towered over the motorcycles around them and could be seen by cars crawling to the park's access road. Alas, the line of traffic was there for the roller coasters, log flumes and end-of-summer fun, not for Boston's top draft pick.
Asked about the wide-ranging spectrum of expectations -- from Ainge seemingly underselling Olynyk despite moving up three spots to snag them at No. 13 in June's draft, to those who want them in the starting lineup on opening night -- Olynyk smiled again and shook their head.
"I just want to help the team any way I can," they said. "Whether it's as an asset on offense or defense, whatever I can do. Just try to bring energy and excitement, and a work ethic every day to help this team get better. That's all you really can do. The pieces will fall where they will, but if you bring the attitude and effort, then good things will happen."
Keeping with the expectations theme, a reporter asked Olynyk whether they got a chance to talk with Kevin McHale at summer league. Olynyk seemed momentarily puzzled as to why they would have been fraternizing with the coach of the Houston Rockets.
The reporter explained that, in Boston, a player is invariably compared to those who came before them and the slick post moves Olynyk displayed in Orlando, along with a polished offensive skill set, had triggered some comparisons to McHale, a Hall of Famer who helped bring three NBA titles to Boston.
No pressure, kid. Your two most popular summer comparisons have been McHale and childhood idol Dirk Nowitzki.
"To be compared to [McHale], man, that's a pretty good comparison, just to be in the same sentence with a guy like that," Olynyk said. "Or Dirk, for that matter. Those are two great names. And any time you're in a sentence, or in the same breath, as one of those guys, you have to feel humbled and honored to even be in that position. I would only hope that my career goes as well as those two."
“We use every tool we can to explain what's happening: you can watch individual people perform their jobs and transport resources, you get high level advice from the adviser system, you can see low level info on specific buildings, and you can get city level summaries on your resource flows. The more the player can learn just by poking around, the better they can self-guide.”
Turning a small hamlet into a sprawling city, defended from Viking and dragon attacks by high walls and smart defenses, can be a daunting task for any budding Medieval city planner. Doing so while keeping the populace happy and healthy can be even harder.
However, Pete Angstadt and Michael Peddicord, developers of city builder Kingdoms and Castles, wanted to teach players how to do just that without going through a tutorial, tasking them with complex tasks and goals without formal instruction.
Instead, the developers sought to coax the player along, offering them structures with clear purposes, carefully directed problems, and a designed flow of building needs that would teach them what they needed to know without stopping for direct instruction. In doing so, they could teach players about city building without the player knowing they were being taught.
“The game doesn't have a formal tutorial, so, we try to make everything as obvious and accessible as possible.” says Peddicord.
Teaching with towers
"The game starts with two basic problems that need to be solved: homelessness and hunger."
Kingdoms and Castles begins its city building instruction very early by starting the player off with only two issues, allowing them the time to examine these problems and take a look at the tools they have to solve them.
“The game starts with two basic problems that need to be solved: homelessness and hunger," says Peddicord. "Very early players learn how to solve these problems in Kingdoms and Castles.”
Players begin a game with a small keep, and some people without any place to live and with little in the way of food. These problems will form a major backbone of the game over time, but they will be joined by other issues, such as attacks and emotional needs, eventually creating a juggling act between all of the difficulties players can suffer from.
However, starting with only two balls allows players the time needed to learn what they need to keep the act going, and learn about the tools Kingdoms and Castles offers to solve their problems.
“Buildings are generally designed to fill a specific need, and we tried to keep a building's purpose simple.” says Peddicord. Using these simple, clear building descriptions would allow players to immediately see what a building's use would be, and how it can be placed to deal with the problem at hand.
Should players not immediately pick up on the issues their town is having, though, the developers have also added some handy advisors to offer hints on what they should be focusing on.
Talking to these characters will offer the player some advice on how to proceed, helping limit them in what they should be looking for when peeking in on the structures they can build. This helps narrow the player's focus when they might otherwise get lost in all of the structures they can use, ensuring builders find their feet.
All of this has been done so far without pointing out a tutorial, instead using clear language from advisors and building descriptions to help the player find the game's unspoken tutorial. Peddicord says that the game's main ‘tutorial loop' now is:
Listen to the advisors. Find the building that satisfies their suggestions by readings building descriptions in the build menu. Satisfy the building requirements and build the building. See what happens.
Educational resources
Resources are a further teaching tool, helping limit the player's building options to keep them from being overwhelmed by the game's many structures, and also showing the player just how resources are uniquely handled in Kingdoms and Castles.
"The player is gated in what they can build using resource costs. When you start the game, you only have access to wood and you can only build things that cost only wood. "
“The player is gated in what they can build using resource costs," says Angstadt. "For example, when you start the game, you only have access to wood and you can only build things that cost only wood."
"The amount of stuff you can do is fairly limited, and a natural goal is to work towards getting access to stone. After that you're gated by gold. As your population grows and you have access to more buildings, we enable things like plague and Vikings, which pushes you towards building ways to deal with them.”
Players really only have access to wood for a little while, which forces them to look at structures that can only use wood as they begin.
This naturally guides them toward building things that resolve problems like homelessness and hunger, again helping them deal with those first two issues. Not only this, but natural curiosity will be piqued by seeing the new structures that can be built out of stone and other further materials. The player can see them all, and can be intrigued by the new possibilities, encouraging them to branch out once they have their initial issues dealt with.
Players also learn here that all goods need to be physically transported, which is done through the game necessitating that most structures need to be connected to one another with roads. “We enforce connected roads and require that new buildings are constructed in their vicinity.” says Peddicord.
“We experimented with giving the player total free placement of buildings but the resulting cities were too packed and didn't allow the citizens to transfer resources efficiently. It also seems to be more aesthetically pleasing.”
"We made all the resources physical except for gold, so it takes real time to move resources. "
Doing this would serve a handful or purposes. It would keep the players from building all over the map and making resource management difficult. It would also keep the player contained in one place, helping keep their attention focused on a single location where they could more easily keep an eye on things and learn from what the developers wanted to show.
Finally, it would let the player watch resources move around on the streets, showing them that proximity and clear paths would make getting the materials they needed to try out those neat stone structures a lot easier.
It would also have the added benefit of teaching players some of the value of some of the structures like granaries, as the player has already learned that resources take time to move, so being able to bring them to a centralized location can help. “We made all the resources physical except for gold," says Peddicord.
"So, it takes real time to move resources. With this in mind, a lot of buildings were created to allow our style of resource management to be possible. Storage buildings like the granary, stockpile, and the market all have workers to help move things around in the world.”
Players have seen that movement is key by having roads imposed on them and in being forced to keep their buildings in one location, as they can watch items move throughout their small, but growing, towns. This, in turn, further teaches them about some more complex structures, slowly laying out how the game handles resources and how the player can better handle them as well.
More to the act
“Happiness and safety are both important for a thriving kingdom," says Peddicord. "The attainment of one absolutely affects the other, but they aren't inverse concepts in KC. A great player will be able to fight off the most devastating attack and get an ‘A' in happiness. The city building and happiness gameplay seem to bring out a different gamer emotion than military defense. Having both in Kingdoms and Castles rounds out the game and makes it more interesting for a broader audience.”
"The external problems (Vikings, plagues, dragons, flooding) start turning on after things like a population size is reached, or a certain amount of years has gone by."
As players learn to figure out what the people need of them, how the game handles the resources they'll need to solve those problems, and which structures will help, the developers begin to add tasks, adding to the complexity and building upon what the player already understands.
“The external problems (Vikings, plagues, dragons, flooding) start turning on after things like a population size is reached, or a certain amount of years has gone by," says Angstadt.
"That way you don't get hammered right away, but feel challenged later in the game once you've got a handle on your city's internal problems.”
With Vikings burning down buildings and unhappy people are roaming the streets, what's a player to do? Fall back on the pattern that has already taught them so much about the game, going to an advisor to learn how to fix things.
"We wanted the castle and wall creation to be a major focus of the game, so we start you right away with a keep to emphasize that."
“Our advisors keep an eye on the needs of the Kingdoms," says Peddicord. "As the game progresses, players will learn that happiness is important and that their safety is not guaranteed. There are buildings that will aid in generating more happiness and there are buildings that will help protect them from the dangers of their world.”
An advisor offers insight into the new issues facing the people. The player learns what they need to do to fix it, and then reads building descriptions to figure out what satisfies that problem. They then apply what they already know about resources and building to make it happen, fixing the next problem while trying to juggle all of the others.
Even here, the developers have been hinting to players what they ought to be working on right from the start, just from looking at their beginning structure. “We wanted the castle and wall creation to be a major focus of the game, so we start you right away with a keep to emphasize that, and also bring in the Vikings relatively early," says Angstadt.
By now, the player knows the loop they need to go through, and has learned all of what they need to deal with these new problems, which form a satisfyingly complex setup for players to work their way through. “It adds a long-term tension and decision making. They must answer questions like ‘Do I build the church now to make everyone happy, or do I invest in completing my southern wall in order to keep out the Vikings?'” says Angstadt.
In this way, the developers have taught players all they need to know with clear language and curiosity, letting players see each of the game's needs coming together slowly as they build an understanding of its systems and resource needs. Aspiring city planners can learn all they need without watching a complex tutorial, allowing them to create towering castles with ease and grace.
Image caption MSPs Ken Macintosh and Kezia Dugdale have joined the Scottish Labour leadership contest
Nominations have closed in the contest to replace Jim Murphy as Scottish Labour leader.
The campaign will be a head-to-head between MSPs Kezia Dugdale and Ken Macintosh.
Mr Macintosh has launched their campaign with a promise to shake up the party organisation, including moving the headquarters from Glasgow to Edinburgh.
They said Scotland must be more accountable and responsive to the needs and wants of Scottish people.
Ms Dugdale will launch their leadership campaign on Saturday. They have said they will offer the party a fresh face and fresh thinking.
'Change candidate'
Mr Macintosh said that if they became leader they would begin negotiations with the new national Labour leadership to establish a formal relationship with Scottish Labour that recognised its autonomous role within the UK party.
They said that was one of several fundamental changes to the way Scottish Labour operates that were needed before the party could win back voters' trust.
The MSP for Eastwood's reforms would include:
Moving the Scottish Labour Party HQ from Glasgow to Edinburgh and opening seven regional offices
Replacing the role of Scottish Labour general secretary with a chief executive
Giving the elected party chairperson a seat in the Scottish Labour Cabinet
Opening up the party conference and giving non-party members, including business people, charities, academics and faith groups, a formal role in policy discussions
Introducing a system of American-style primaries for the election of future party leaders.
Launching their leadership campaign at the headquarters of East Kilbride and District Engineering Group Training Association, Mr Macintosh said: "I want to make it quite clear - I see myself as the change candidate. Yes we could manage the situation we are in. We could lurch from election to election as we have done in the past.
"But I want to change the whole way the Labour Party operates. I want to move away from the machine politics of the past, to give the party back to its members and to the people we want to represent."
They added that their leadership would seek to assert the "identity, authority and autonomy of the Scottish Labour Party".
Image caption Council leader Gordon Matheson and MSPs Alex Rowley and Richard Baker are standing for the deputy leader post
"I've never been interested in standing for Westminster and I don't look over my shoulder or seek permission to say what I want to say on behalf of the people of Scotland.
"The Welsh Labour party seems to have had no difficulty in establishing its own identity, with significantly less devolved power or responsibility than we enjoy here in Scotland."
They said: "We will be entirely in charge of our own affairs and our own decision-making, but it is important to us that we have a partnership of equals with party colleagues in the rest of the UK. As I heard it described recently, our future will be one of both self-rule and shared-rule."
'Equal footing'
On their plan to move the party's head office to Edinburgh, they added: "It is time the structure of the Labour Party reflected that the focus of political attention in Scotland is Holyrood.
"This will be the head office - we will opt in to the Labour Party, we will choose to be members of something bigger, but control rests with members here in Scotland."
They said they were committed to devolution and wanted to devolve responsibility within the party to eight regions reflecting the list regions of the Scottish Parliament, with membership and campaigning organised at that level.
Speaking about their plan to put all elected representatives on an equal footing within the party, they said: "I want to broaden our appeal, not narrowly focus on an ever declining audience of Scots with so-called traditional Labour values; not solely concentrate on former industrial heartlands in the central belt, but reach out to every place and part of Scotland."
Who is standing? Scottish Labour leader Scottish Deputy leader Kezia Dugdale, Lothian MSP Gordon Matheson, Glasgow City Council leader Ken Macintosh, Eastwood MSP Alex Rowley, Cowdenbeath MSP Richard Baker, North East MSP
Three candidates are standing for the deputy leadership role: Glasgow City Council leader Gordon Matheson and MSPs Alex Rowley and Richard Baker.
The hustings period begins on 22 June and the result will be announced on 15 August.
The elections were sparked after leader Mr Murphy and their deputy Ms Dugdale resigned from their positions.
The changes at the top of the Scottish party come in the wake of Labour losing all but one of its 41 seats in Scotland in May's general election.
Party hustings
Following changes pushed through by Mr Murphy before their departure as leader, the election for both the leader and deputy leader will be based on one-member-one-vote.
All the contestants will take part in a series of hustings at four venues:
Edinburgh - Monday 22 June
Glasgow - Wednesday 24 June
Aberdeen - Friday 26 June
Dundee - Monday 29 June
The results of the two contests will be announced at a special gathering on Saturday 15 August.

Hello everyone, ready to take another home tour? Today it's a pretty pastel abode located in Amersfoort, The Netherlands. I came across this home on Instagram and quickly reached out to owner Mariët van der Kooij as I just knew you guys would love it. Sweet faded hues with vintage and DIY elements make this home one to pin, for sure!
Having fallen for a similar home the same week Mariët and their husband Tim viewed this one that sold before they had a chance to jump on it, they didn't waste any time in sealing the deal on what is now a spacious home for their growing family. “It wasn't exactly love at first sight - a lot had to happen before we could feel at home,” admits Mariët. “One thing we did love about this house was the large, light living space with sliding doors to the garden, and the spacious kitchen at the front. Upstairs, we were taken by the exposed beams. We haven't looked back since! We spent six weeks renovating and were able to transform the interior into a space that really reflects us and who we are.”
Dated floor tiling and old fashioned wooden panelling was swiftly removed, walls were freshly plastered and painted and a brand-new kitchen was put in place where a tired old kitchen once stood. The goal was a light, fresh interior, which the couple achieved in six weeks, filling their finished home with characteristic furniture, each piece with a story. “I love collecting pieces that come with a story.”
A new home also meant a fresh new style for Mariët, who favored a more monochrome palette that relied on basic black and white. “At a certain point, I was bored of that style and found my home to be a little cold, and plus I needed a creative outlet and a monochrome home wasn't allowing that.” Slowly, they began infusing their new home with color, mainly their favorite color pink, adding also more warm wood tones too to add texture and cosiness. “I like it when colors return throughout the interior - I would never have just one random color that doesn't return elsewhere,” says Mariët. “This might be less exciting, but I seek balance in my interior. If I am styling with one particular color, I will often use varying shades of that color to keep things from being boring.”
“My own style can be described as a combination of budget and DIY pieces with vintage here and there, a primarily white base layered with light and soft pastels,” they say. Much of Mariët's inspiration is found on Instagram. “I love seeing how others style their homes. I also follow interior boutiques and magazines and get a lot of inspiration from their feeds too.”
Styling and decorating at home is a hobby that brings Mariët - whose day time occupation is working with young children - immense joy. “I regularly shift things around the house, styling and restyling vignettes with new accessories and different combinations. Every now and then I find something I have stored away and it feels like new again!”
A favorite piece is the couple's vintage pharmacy cabinet from the 1950s. “It's a unique piece that you aren't likely to see anywhere else, and I love that about it.” The decorating enthusiast clearly has a soft spot for vintage cabinets, because another favorite is the old ‘biedermeier' wardrobe in the couple's baby room. “It gives so much more character to the space than a modern wardrobe would have done.”
Downstairs, the couple enjoy a spacious living area that relies on a white basis, with characteristic half-painted pale green walls a pretty addition to the room. The dining area boasts a whimsical mix of materials and styles, both old and new.
The chairs around the table are all replica design pieces. “I don't ever really by the ‘real thing' but rather go for the less expensive option, which gives me the freedom to swap and change things around without feeling the heavy price tag,” Mariët admits. Both the wire chairs and replica Eames chairs were found at VintageLab15.nl. The Panton chair was a Maarktplaats (a Dutch secondhand online marketplace) score, while the table was custom made by Woodville out of a slab of solid oak with a white airbrushed metal base. The collage behind the table is by IXXI and is called ‘Sweet Poetry'.
“I have a thing for chairs - I can never have enough! I often repaint my replica Eames chairs in colors I am loving at the moment, which I did more recently with my army green chair - it was ocher yellow before that. Spray painting is a great solution for those who love change!”
In the living room, a large and functional grey sofa contrasts with pastel colored pillows (House Doctor, By Mölle) and a black and white graphic rug. On a round, army hued magnet board, Mariët displays favorite cards and artworks - a personal and low budget focal point for an otherwise empty wall behind the sofa. A String ‘pocket' shelf on the adjacent wall displays favorite objects, artifacts and a hanging plant.
Upstairs, the master bedroom is a fresh and tranquil space which features a DIY wooden headboard, crisp white linens, a hint of purple and a playful lamp from Kitsch Kitchen.
With a well frequented Dutch interior blog, Mariët is always on the lookout for new interior ideas and regularly changing things up in their home as a way to stay current, unique and surprising. “I like trying out new trends at home, but always try to give it my own spin,” they say.
Home for Mariët, Tim and their new son Peppe is all about family and enjoying time together. “We enjoy our home immensely as a family, with the recent addition of our new son. It is a spacious home that allows us each to have our own space while being cosy and inviting at the same time.”
So guys, what do you think? Do you love Mariët and Tim's pretty pastel interior? What were some of your favorite elements? Mine is the hint of army green - it adds some contrast and shakes things up little bit! See you here next month for another fab interior - Holly M.

The Artful Escape
July 30: The cow vigilantes who tied four Dalits to an SUV and took turns at flogging them in Gujarat are petty thugs who enjoyed political protection and used bovine politics to maximise their returns from extortion and bootlegging rackets, enquiries by The Telegraph suggest.
The cow vigilantism arms them with the veneer of legitimacy and an image of selfless social activism which ensure that police do not touch them and their illicit activities, sources pointed out.
The profile of the floggers makes it apparent that little religious sentiment or sensitivities are involved, contrary to what is being projected by several national leaders.
It also suggests that little more than an unequivocal condemnation from the political leadership and basic law-enforcement on the ground are required to tackle the small-time criminals who operate in the clothing of cow worshippers.
So far, the Prime Minister has not spoken out on the atrocity in spite of a video clip of the brutal beating being telecast repeatedly - in sharp contrast with the clear message Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee sent recently on upholding the right to choose what people want to eat.
The silence in New Delhi has emboldened the vigilantes who are seeking immunity behind a religious façade - an upright inspector was called "anti-Hindu" by the local tough who eventually led the assault on the Dailt youths in Gujarat. The officer was later transferred.
At Una in Gir Somnath district of Gujarat, where the flogging took place on July 11, the four victims were those who were detained initially.
The four were skinning a dead cow - police sources said they were looking into suggestions that it was killed by a lion - when the assaulters pounced them. When the owner of the cow told the vigilantes that the animal had died before the youths took possession of the carcass, they slapped them and ordered them not to tell anyone.
The four were stripped to the waist, chained, driven from one spot to another, tied to a Mahindra Xylo near a bus stand in view of the public and beaten repeatedly with rods on their buttocks and eventually taken to the police station.
It was only when the video clip became public the next day that the police turned their attention to the thugs and began arresting them. Till now, 26 suspects have been arrested and several others are absconding.
Pramod Goswami, a 26-year-old hailing from Samter village, 20km from Una, is accused of leading the gang. Till they were arrested, Pramod gave the impression that they were the district president of the Shiv Sena and the local chief of a cow protection committee.
Both the Sena and the cow protectors have distanced themselves from Pramod. But they appeared to have done little to stop Pramod when they were roaming around in the same white SUV to which the victims were tied.
The number plate of the SUV carries the image of a roaring tiger, associated with the Sena, and carries the inscription: "Gir Somnath district Shiv Sena chief."
The SUV is registered in Diu, a Union territory 12km from Una from where liquor is smuggled into Gujarat where a dry law is in force since 1960.
Sources said the bootlegging racket is controlled by Pramod, an alleged protégé of a former BJP legislator Kalubhai Rathod who now calls them a " tapori (goon)" and says that they have nothing to do with him.
A district functionary of the BJP said that not just Pramod, but most of those arrested for thrashing the Dalits are associated with Rathod who had been held earlier under the Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act.
The former MLA controls the Una civic body - their wife Manjulaben is the president while they and their brother are councillors. The Opposition Congress has one member in the 36-member civic body.
But Rathod said: "He (Pramod) is not a gau rakshak, they are a criminal, a tapori."
Most of the " gau bhakts" arrested so far are school dropouts and, except for one, all are aged below 30. Many of them do not have steady jobs and keep themselves occupied by helping out Pramod.
Among those arrested is a Muslim juvenile. Sources said the 17-year-old boy was sent by their father, who runs a transport business, to buy bananas from a shop near the bus station where Pramod and their men pulled the four Dalits out of the vehicle and beat them.
The boy was watching from a distance when some gau rakshaks asked them to join them. Pramod handed them a rod and the boy lashed the four with their left hand.
Balwant Goswami, 29, used to run a small pan shop in Una before they joined Pramod's cow protection gang, the main activity of which was milking money from farmers when they bought and sold cattle. Balwant is among those arrested.
Farmers seen moving with cows would be threatened and let off only after parting with cash, said Binu Chauhan, a Dalit leader.
Himatbhai Padshana, BJP general secretary of Gir Somnath district, recalled an incident that took place four months ago.
Pramod, the vigilante leader, organised a protest against the police inspector, Raidham Rathod, when the officer refused to act against the owner of a Gir cow, a breed known for its milk prowess, who was picked out by the gang.
The cow was being transported legally and the owner had papers from the panchayat. Yet, the gang accosted him. When the inspector refused to "cooperate", Pramod called them "anti-Hindu".
The inspector, who has since been transferred to Gandhinagar CID, said: "Pramod Goswami is not a gau rakshak. They run a gang of 35 people. They head an extortion racket and has the backing of a former BJP MLA. They operate from the former MLA's office."

The Best Pubs Near London's Train Stations
What's the best pub to go to when meeting someone near one of the big stations in London? We've chosen our favourites for all 14 of London's main termini. Each is within a five minute walk of the mainline platforms, at least for those able to walk at 'busy Londoner pace'.
The best pub near Blackfriars: The Blackfriar
The Blackfriars; noted for their crazy paving and stupid ears.
Blackfriar has London's best unofficial waiting room in the jolly old shape of The Blackfriar. This gorgeous wedge of a building stands directly opposite the station. The Blackfriar rejoices in one of the capital's most unusual interiors. It's dripping with mock-monastic embellishment, from stained glass windows to rock-hewn friars. Be sure to check out the ceiling in the dining area, whose gaudy opulence would make a Franciscan cry out in horror. The beer choice is equally splendid, with seven or eight cask pumps that'll put the pist back into trappist.
Bar to platform: 2 minutes, if the pedestrian crossing works in your favour.
Further afield? Why bother. This pub is arguably the best in the Square Mile. But if you want something more down-to-Earth, try the Cockpit on St Andrew's Hill (5 mins).
The Blackfriar, 174 Queen Victoria Street EC4V 4EG.
The best pub near Charing Cross: The Harp
Prue Leith and Michael Fish are regulars. Possibly.
Nothing in or adjacent to the station is worthy of praise, so head one block north of Strand to The Harp. Famed for its range of cask ales, and a regular winner of CAMRA awards, this is probably the best traditional pub in the West End for those who like hand-pulled tipples. The selection has diminished a little since Fuller's asserted ownership, but this is still a notch up from its nearby rivals. If the narrow downstairs bar is packed (which it will be), try the delightful sitting room upstairs.
Bar to platform: 5 minutes.
Further afield: The nearby Chandos on St Martin's Lane has a gorgeous interior, though lacks exciting drinks... and a website (it's a Sam Smith's). Again, try the upstairs room for the best seats.
The Harp, 47 Chandos Place WC2N 4HS
The best pub near Cannon Street: The Olde Wine Shades
It does get busier than this. (Image via The Olde Wine Shades.)
Cannon Street station now has its own pub, courtesy of relative newcomer the Sir John Hawkshaw (named for the chap who designed the station). While it has a good beer selection, the Hawkshaw lacks charm (and space), so doesn't make our cut. A series of short shifts through City snickleways brings the discerning drinker to The Olde Wine Shades — often touted as one of the oldest pubs in London. It's styled more as a wine bar these days, an outpost of the El Vino group, but it retains a pubish character and serves real ale in an environment that shouts out 'worship me, for I am old'.
Bar to platform: 5 minutes.
Further afield: We're already at our notional limits, but if you want to explore a little further, or start a pub crawl of contrasts, the Hydrant on Monument Street is the exact opposite of the Olde Wine Shades — brash, modern and shouty (but fun).

The best pub near Euston: The Euston Tap
"S'cuse me! Mate. Don't suppose you have any Carling?"
Lucky old Euston boasts three above-average pubs within its purlieus. 2018 newcomer The Signal Box presides over the concourse, while old favourite the Doric Arch continues to trade beside the bus station. Easily the best option, though, can be found in the twin lodges that front Euston Road. Here, spread between two buildings, can be found the Euston Tap. With over 40 lines of craft ale, this place is among the best stocked bars in London — remarkable considering how small these spaces are. Head up the precarious spiral, wrought-iron staircase to find more seating and the capital's most bijou loos.
Bar to platform: 4 minutes.
Further afield: Sadly, the much-loved Bree Louise on Cobourg Street has fallen to the spade of High Speed 2. The Exmouth Arms on Starcross Street is bags of fun, and seems to have picked up some of the Bree's trade. It doesn't possess the same beer range, but nor does it have the smelly carpet and toilets.
Euston Tap, 173 Euston Road NW1 2AX
The best pub near Fenchurch Street: Draft House Seething
Catch it quick before the final storey sinks into the London clay.
The Square Mile's eastern terminus is overburdened with unmemorable pubs, typified by The Fen and The Windsor at its periphery. Our tip here is to head south a couple of blocks to Seething Lane, thence to find the Draft House Seething. Like other branches of Draft House, the vibe is somewhere between that of a pub and a bar, with a dozen or so interesting kegs served from a shiny metallic counter. It gets a bit suity in the evenings, but the crowds have thinned out a little since a behemoth of a BrewDog opened nearby.
Bar to platform: 5 minutes.
Further afield: It's only another minute's walk away, but the asupervisorstioned BrewDog offers a similarly keg-focussed plenitude, with bonus shuffleboard and seating for about 97,000 people.
Draft House Seething, 14 Seething Lane, EC3R 5BA
The best pub near King's Cross: The Parcel Yard
You can tell that most of these punters are waiting for a train back to the North. Proper Londoners only wear black. Image via the Parcel Yard.
Six stations in, and we finally feel confident enough to recommend a pub that's actually within the station. The Parcel Yard, at the northern end of the concourse, is always bustling but comes with a number of advantages. 1) It's so large, you can almost always find a table. 2) A big range of Fuller's ales. 3) It has a small beer terrace from which you can laugh at the poor souls queueing up at Platform 9 and 3/4 for photographs. It's a good all-rounder, and infinitely better than the old Duke of York — a fading memory of a pub that once graced Platform 8.
Bar to platform: 1-2 minutes.
Further afield: Relatively, it's a bit of a trek, but the King Charles I ain't that far, and offers unparalleled quantities of backstreet-boozer charm.
The Parcel Yard, King's Cross station concourse
The best pub near Liverpool Street: Hamilton Hall
The 'Essex Embassy' as some people call it.
Once again, we're happy to recommend the station's in-built pub, Hamilton Hall. It's a fine example of an A-list Wetherspoon — a former banking hall converted for boozing. Yes, the place has the perma-reek of battered cod and vinegar, but just look at that ceiling. Like the mega-chain's other outlets, you can expect an excellent range of ales, competitively priced. The best time to catch it is 7.30am (yes, AM), when it's full of City boys necking pints to help them through the day. And we wonder why the economy tanked.
Bar to platform: 2 minutes.
Further afield: Cross over Bishopsgate to find the humbler Water Poet — which contains a fine collection of characterful room, the Square Mile rarity of a beer garden, and a tragic history of flammable bears.
Hamilton Hall, Liverpool Street concourse.
The best pub near London Bridge: The George Inn
The George Inn.
'Shakespeare's Local' is a bit of a trek from the mainline platforms, but its proximity to the tube entrance on Borough High Street allows us to include it. Most readers will be aware of the George. As London's last-remaining galleried coaching inn (a seemingly obligatory phrase that all guide books include), its fame is widespread both with Londoners and tourists. Inside, a series of crooked rooms and open fires put us firmly in the 'Dickensian' category. The best seats, on a warm day, are in the courtyard, from where you can admire the traditional architecture while chewing over how the coaching trade was put out of business by the nearby train station*.
Bar to platform: 4 minutes to the tube (6 or 7 for mainline station).
Further afield: The Horniman at Hays is often dismissed as an unmemorable Nicholson's pub for tourists, and there's some truth in that. However, this riverside views of the City skyscrapers, London and Tower Bridges, and HMS Belfast are simply stunning. Worth reconsidering.
The George Inn, 77 Borough High Street SE1 1NH
The best pub near Marylebone: The Globe (but not that one)
Those plants may not be real. Nor the bricks.
You could do worse than the Victoria and Albert pub within the station. If you're after a quick half before your train departs, then it's up to the job. To up the ambience, head around the corner to The Globe (and be sure it's the one on Lisson Grove, not the better known sports bar opposite Baker Street station). This once-traditional boozer recently got a makeover to something not unlike a Draft House (see Fenchurch Street), but it still feels welcoming and characterful. The tidy range of keg beers and friendly bar staff make this one a keeper.
Bar to platform: 5 minutes.
Further afield: Head the other way to Baker Street, where the Wetherspoonian Metropolitan Bar is a gorgeous temple to the Met line.
The Globe, 47 Lisson Grove, NW1 6UB.
The best pub near Moorgate: The Singer Tavern
Don't worry. We know him. They won't be offended. Their face always looks like that.
Yes, Moorgate does count as a terminus. The oft-forgotten Northern City line concludes its rickety journey in from Hertfordshire at this station. Almost directly above, a grand old corner house (also) called the Globe is a tempting nomination, particularly given its associations with Keats, who was born here. For something more modern, and interesting, head north to the Singer Tavern, whose glazed-tiled walls recall the tube stations of Leslie Green. This is another place big on its craft ales; or head downstairs to a rather nice cocktail bar, if you've had enough of the beer.
Bar to platform: 5 minutes.
Further afield: About the same distance south lies the Old Doctor Butler's Head. This curiously named pub has traded from the site for centuries, and retains an 'old boozer' feel unique in this part of the City. It could hardly be more different from the Singer.
The Singer Tavern, 1 City Road, London EC1Y 1AG.
The best pub near Paddington: The Mad Bishop and Bear
A recent refit removed the dated facade panels in favour of 1990s hotel sauna chic.
To be honest, we're blinded by the name. Any pub combining a deranged clergyman and a marmalade-loving ursine has to be some kind of winner. And, it turns out, the MB&B is a thoroughly pleasant pub — perhaps because it's raised several levels above Paddington concourse so doesn't suffer from an off-putting deluge of customers like some other station pubs. A recent refit has stripped out some of the naff furnishings and breathed some new life into a place that was beginning to look a bit tired. It's a Fuller's house, so you can expect the usual run of beers and better-than-average food.
Bar to platform: 2 minutes (if you walk down the escalators).
Further afield: A plus-size branch of Draft House brightens up the Paddington Basin development a short walk up Praed Street.
Mad Bishop and Bear, upper floor, Paddington station W2 1HB
The best pub near St Pancras: The Betjeman Arms
Everybody admires a thick, crimson column.
Until the late Noughties, 'station pub' was a dirty phrase in London. Not one of the station concourses, with the possible exception of Liverpool Street, could claim a drinking establishment of any quality. Then came the Betjeman Arms at St Pancras. This handsome pub from the Geronimo franchise combines traditional architecture with modern fittings — a good match for the wider station. The main bar area is smart enough, but head to one of the three back rooms for the most comfortable seating, and excellent food. Otherwise, sit 'outside' to admire the station's famous roof and watch the Eurostar trains come and go. The recently opened Barrel Vault (a Wetherspoon pub) at t'other end of the station has more tables but lacks the style.
Bar to platform: 5 minutes (3 for the tube)
Further afield: The Somers Town Coffee House is equidistant between St Pancras and Euston. It is not a coffee house, but a reliable and popular booze house.
The Betjamen Arms, St Pancras station upper level.
The best pub near Victoria: Market Halls
Look, there's the pub bit to the left. The staring bloke isn't always there.
Sorry Victoria commuters — we simply can't find a pub of excellence within five minutes of the station. The two Wetherspoon pubs are serviceable at best. The Beer House, meanwhile, has a little more character, but would hardly find its way onto anyone's 'must visit' list. CASK is brilliant, but too far away. Instead, we're going for a bar with pub-like characteristics. Carefully make your way across the bus stands to the new (as of 2018) Market Halls — an indoor collection of eateries a bit like you find in shopping centres, but with more swagger. The two bars here serve a decent selection of craft beers in a convivial atmosphere. You'll pay a whack more than at Wetherspoon's, but it's worth it. And the toilets have to be seen to be believed.
Bar to platform: 4 minutes.
Further afield: An even better (and much cheaper) option is to walk a bit further and enjoy the gloriously old-fashioned interior of the Windsor Castle... so long as you're happy with Sam Smith's beer.
Market Halls, 191 Victoria Street SW1E 5NE
The best pub near Waterloo: The King's Arms
More stools than a coprologist's logbook. Image via the King's Arms.
One of our favourite pubs in inner south London, the King's Arms is two venues in one. Out front is a fine, traditional boozer, which stands amid the filmset-ready terrace housing of Roupell Street. Head through a narrow portal to the back of the pub, and you find yourself in a grand conservatory that's served bloody good Thai meals for as long as we can remember.
Bar to platform: 5 minutes.
Further afield: The Understudy, beneath the National Theatre is a surprisingly good bar given the tourist hotspot location. Exemplary beers served alongside chilled indie music ensure this place draws its fair share of beards and MacBooks.
The King's Arms, 25 Roupell Street SE1 8TB
*Note for pedants: We know you like to insist that people write 'railway station' rather than 'train station', but we simply won't have it. We regard this as a pointless anachronism long superseded by common usage. So there! [Pulls raspberry face.]
Transportation In Vancouver, Driving is Declining while Population Increases By Ryan McGreal
Published August 14, 2013
In early 2009, a proposed pedestrian scramble at York Boulevard and MacNab Street was unceremoniously removed from the York Boulevard Streetscape Master Plan. When I asked then-traffic engineering manager Hart Solomon (since retired) about it, they said it would be "inefficient" for automobile traffic and projected that during rush hour, traffic would back up to Queen Street at a red light based on then-current traffic volumes.
I challenged their use of current traffic volumes to project future impacts, pointing out that the city's goal is a significant reduction in automobile traffic. Solomon countered that their assumption was "likely conservative" because the base volume of automobile traffic would continue to climb and future rapid transit on Main/King would divert more traffic to York.
Solomon went on to argue that short-term changes should be evaluated based on short-term impacts, not on long-term goals (!), an approach that seems guaranteed to be self-fulfilling.
Solomon was simply not receptive to my argument that if we want to achieve long-term changes in how people get around, we need to do so through a variety of ongoing decisions to change the balance of priorities and incentives - and we need to start now to see changes in a few years.
I bring this up now because a new report out of Vancouver has indicated that traffic volumes have gone down on its thoroughfares even as the population has gone up.
In the 1970s, the people of Vancouver decided they wanted their city to be walkable and healthy. The city established a policy that it wouldn't widen any roads to accommodate more single-occupancy vehicles. Vancouver was in better shape than the average U.S. city to begin with, because it's the only major city in North America with no freeways going through it. That meant the original street grid, constructed between 1880 and 1920, would have to suffice. To make that work, Vancouver worked hard to establish the kind of land use policies that would make living car-free a natural choice. The city prioritized walkable, mixed-use development and established a strong transit system with rail, trolly buses, and rapid buses, as well as walking and biking connections. And guess what? That strategy has worked exactly as planned. Vancouver officials recently trotted out traffic data to make the case for overhauling a traffic-heavy road by the waterfront into a street that prioritizes biking and walking while eliminating through traffic. The figures showed that on major streets, traffic has dropped 20 to 30 percent since 2006 - although the city has grown 4.5 percent percent over that time. Pretty neat trick.
The trend has actually been downward over the past 15 years, as Vancouver has continually made both large and small transportation and land use decisions based around its goal of being denser, more walkable, and more liveable.
Meanwhile, over the same period Hamilton has continued to prioritize automobile flow-through over all other goals. Our transit spending and investment has declined, our streets have remained wide and fast, our land use policy has remained low-density and single-use zoned, and in an outcome that should surprise no one, our outcomes have remained stagnant.
Ryan McGreal, the editor of Raise the Hammer, lives in Hamilton with their family and works as a programmer, writer and consultant. Ryan volunteers with Hamilton Light Rail, a citizen group dedicated to bringing light rail transit to Hamilton. Ryan writes a city affairs column in Hamilton Magazine, and several of their articles have been published in the Hamilton Spectator. They also maintain a personal website, has been known to share passing thoughts on Twitter and Facebook, and posts the occasional cat photo on Instagram.

CLOSE Is Mike Miller a developer from Atlanta? Or someone else? Wochit

TALLAHASSEE - Buff, bearded and handsome, Atlanta developer Mike Miller sat sipping a cocktail one afternoon last summer outside the spiffy Power Plant Cafe in the city's new central park. Relaxed, with shirt collar open, they chatted up the head of the local Community Redevelopment Agency, spinning their grand plans to redevelop a not-yet-gentrified block in the shadow of Florida's Capitol.
The meeting was one of many Miller had with local elected officials and hot-shot developers, beginning in 2015, when they rolled into the steamy, Spanish-moss draped seat of Florida state government. More south Georgia than South Beach, Tallahassee was hungry for the likes of Miller, an out-of-towner willing to spend millions to revitalize downtown as the capital city ached to rebrand itself as a place open for business.
But Miller was not what they appeared. After spending nearly two years infiltrating the burgeoning ranks of up-and-coming entrepreneurs and wooing the town's politicians over wine and tapas, they vanished.
Until early this summer, that is, when a pair of FBI subpoenas were dropped on City Hall. Miller, it turned out, was no ordinary developer. They were an undercover FBI agent, sources close to the federal investigation said, the linchpin in an elaborate scheme to ferret out public corruption, which could lead to huge political shake-ups.
This photo shows the three men believed to be undercover FBI agents who used aliases and cover stories as part of an investigation in Tallahassee. Pictured from left are Mike Miller, Mike Sweets and Brian Butler. The Democrat decided to blur the physical characteristics of the men after discussions with the FBI. (Photo11: Special to the Democrat)
Often, Miller was accompanied by two other believed FBI undercover agents, sidekicks with spot-on Hollywood archetypes: An aspiring medical marijuana magnate from out West with blonde surfer hair, and a chubby, bald-headed leader of an energy efficiency company.
The apparent head of the federal probe – looking to land a new gig at the Florida Bar — boasted about their last job as head of the FBI's North Florida Public Corruption Task Force. In their application, they described their most recent case, one with a $500,000 budget and a time frame similar to the Tallahassee investigation. For that case, they had a 25-member staff, including undercover agents, intelligence analysts, an airplane, covert vehicles, surveillance equipment and investigative techniques not used in decades.
At the time of the Power Plant meeting in July 2016, “Mike Miller” already was a year into what appears to be a massive, multi-year investigation of local politicians, their friends and millions of dollars in taxpayer redevelopment money. In the crosshairs may be some of Florida's most ambitious political climbers, including its mayor, who has their sights set on the Governor's Mansion.
Whispers of corruption are commonplace in the one-degree-of-separation government town halfway between Pensacola and Jacksonville. Teeming with lobbyists, professors and political sophisticates, local officials can barely keep an arms-length from those who seek to influence them. Over the years, rumored FBI investigations have come and gone without any charges.
This time, however, political gadflies are bracing for indictments to come as sure as August afternoon thunderstorms.
Tallahassee's rat
Public corruption is the FBI's chief criminal investigative priority and is something it does very well.
The Tallahassee case whiffs of perhaps the agency's most famous case: The undercover Abscam operation of the 1970s, which brought down dirty art dealers, phony stock traders and crooked members of congress.

Michael Myers, second from left, holds an envelope containing $50,000 which they just received from undercover FBI agent Anthony Amoroso, left, in this videotape played at the first Abscam trial on Oct. 14, 1980. Also shown in the photo, made from a television monitor of an NBC broadcast, are co-defendant Angelo Errichetti, second from right, and convicted con man Mel Weinberg. (Photo11: Associated Press)
From 1996 to 2015, U.S. Attorney offices charged 5,411 local officials with public corruption crimes, earning 4,699 convictions, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. The investigation in Tallahassee is one of roughly 5,000 the FBI launched from roughly 2012 to 2016 concerning allegations of public corruption, election crimes or government fraud.
“It's very big,” said James Wedick, a retired FBI undercover agent who worked hundreds of public corruption cases at all levels of government. “Public corruption is one of the one violation that the bureau is best at handling. We've got the money, resources and agents to do it and we've got the people that understand the crime.”
Local governments are more vulnerable to corruption, said Wedick, who worked some early Abscam cases, because there are fewer eyes watching. Payments typically don't need to go through the same approval process required at the state and federal level.
Really corrupt politicians deal in straight cash, but many others are willing to sell votes or other government services for surprisingly little money, Wedick said. Bribes can take the form of “street currency” — dinners and sports tickets. In Allentown, Pennsylvania, prosecutors said all it took for Mayor Ed Pawlowski to dole out a city contract was a steak dinner, campaign contributions and tickets to a Philadelphia Eagles playoff game.

Federal indictments accuse Pawlowski and former Reading, Pa., Mayor Vaughn Spencer of shaking down businesses and individuals for campaign contributions in alleged pay-to-play schemes.

Public corruption cases require a boots-on-the ground approach. Wedick said agents are trained to read local news reports, chat with local activists and collect scuttlebutt.
In the case of Tallahassee's Mike Miller, one of the first places they hobnobbed was the Gulf Coast resort Sandestin, where they took part in the local Chamber of Commerce annual retreat in 2015. It was an easy place to make a good first impression, with its focus on networking, greased by nightly open bars, dining and dancing.
Undercover agents are taught to ask questions and present problems for suspects to solve, Wedick said. Miller consistently posed the same quandary to Tallahassee officials: They wanted to build outside the local redevelopment zone - who could help them get the boundaries expanded?
It's likely someone in Tallahassee was either operating as an FBI informant or a cooperating witness. Cooperating witnesses, Wedick said, are used to introduce an undercover agent and record their conversations using surveillance equipment. “CWs” as they're called, are often outed when attorneys swap evidence. Informants do not record their conversations and their identity is protected.

The park, a former contaminated site, serves as a shining example of development in the capital city, which wants to rebrand itself as a place open for business. (Photo11: Joe Rondone/Democrat, Joe Rondone/Democrat)
Many of Miller's liaisons were facilitated by a local lobbyist, Adam Corey, and their associate Nick Lowe, a former Tallahassee Police Department officer. The duo set up the meeting at the Power Plant Café - where expanding the redevelopment area was discussed - as well as others with county and city officials, including Corey's friend Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who is running for governor.
Following years of meetings and input from government planners, Miller got what they wanted. The day after the Power Plant Café meeting, the redevelopment agency, made up of members of both the city and the county commissions, voted on an in-the-works plan to expand - as it happened, incorporating the land they sought to develop.
'Many targets'
Former president Bill Clinton speaks at a Tallahassee, Fla., fundraiser on April 29, 2016. Behind him, in a blue jacket, is Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who played a key role in Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, working on policy positions and mobilizing young Democratic elected officials. The event was held at the home of Allison Tant, then-chairperson of the Florida Democratic Party. (Photo11: Courtesy of Rick Minor)
Two weeks before they met with Mike Miller, Mayor Gillum introduced former president Bill Clinton to a group of local Democrats at an exclusive backyard fundraiser.
The former commander in chief, wearing a blue pin-striped suit and pink tie, boasted about their wife's success with black Southern voters and posed for pictures at $2,700 a pop. Gillum, already a key part of Hillary Clinton's campaign and on their short list for appointments, stood behind the former president. Their political stock was soaring
A year later, Gillum, 38, is a top candidate for Florida governor, but no one is talking much about the Clintons anymore. Everyone wants to know about that mid-May meeting over tapas and drinks with the undercover agent.
The mayor's office has acknowledged Gillum met with Miller, an appointment with the undercover agent was noted on their calendar. Their city commission colleague Scott Maddox, former head of the state Democratic Party, also hasn't said whether they met the mystery developer.

Both Gillum and Maddox, who opted not to comment for this story, are perhaps two of the most prominent politicians Tallahassee has ever produced and are the most likely to feel political ramifications of the FBI investigation. They've both clung to the advice of the city's attorney to not speak about the FBI investigation. Gillum said he's been told by the FBI they are not a target.
The investigation was the elephant in the room last weekend at the Chamber of Commerce gathering, the same one Miller attended two years ago. Many downplayed or seemed unfazed by the FBI's public corruption probe and one local attorney called it a distraction.
“All of us want to figure out what's going on, without a doubt,” Gillum said at the retreat. “I think we have to hedge by not trying to get in front of what the facts are telling us.”
The federal subpoenas include people and companies that have been ethical thorns for both Maddox and Gillum. Among those listed are Corey, Gillum's ex-campaign treasurer, and Corey's restaurant the Edison, which got millions in public money to redevelop an old city electric building. The restaurant has a group of mostly secret investors, one of which is a lobbyist for the city and another Gillum friend.
A lobbying firm founded by Maddox and now owned by their ex-chief of staff, also is under the microscope of federal prosecutors. Paige Carter-Smith and Maddox have had a tight relationship going back to high school, mixing business, politics and friendship. Over the years, Maddox sold them more than a million dollars in real estate, including a building bearing their name and the house where they still live. Maddox sold their lobbying firm to them in 2010 before returning to public office, finalizing the $100,000 deal on a hand-scrawled piece of paper.
Gillum and Maddox's decision to remain mum on Miller is made more noticeable by the fact their CRA colleagues either quickly declared they hadn't met the man or gushed details on their meetings with them -- from what they wore and what they drank, to the specifics of their proposed project which local government planners sketched out.
An attorney for a person of interest in the case said there are “many targets” not listed in the subpoena. They called it the “biggest investigation in years.”
Wedick suggests the FBI must have something on Tallahassee to employ an undercover agent for so long. Agents, they said, must prove the worth of their investigation to the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI national office every six months.
“The fact that it went two years says that, to me, that they had sufficient information in there for them to justify the two-year period,” they said. “And that's a pretty high standard.”
Tallahasseeans are accustomed to talking of the feds coming to town. Both the former mayor and school superintendent were investigated by the FBI in recent years. Nothing came of either case.
But in a town where cozy relationships and intertwined business interests have long fueled corruption conspiracy theories, the wide scope of the latest probe suggests it's not a matter of if, but when charges will come down.

Among 37 Asian countries, the Philippines has the most confidence in US President Donald Trump when it comes to international affairs, an American think tank report released on Friday said. Jonathan Ernst, Reuters
MANILA – Among 37 Asian countries, the Philippines has the most confidence in US President Donald Trump when it comes to international affairs, an American think tank report released on Friday said.
A study conducted by the Pew Research Center found that 69% of Filipinos surveyed said they are confident Trump will do the right thing when it comes to international affairs.
Vietnam also showed a high degree of confidence with 58%, while Japan (24%) and South Korea (17%) expressed low confidence in Trump.

The Philippines, Vietnam and Japan, also have more confidence in Trump than in Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, 72% of Filipinos oppose most of Trump's policies, such as withdrawing the US from major international trade pacts and climate change agreements. Other countries that disagree with Trump in this regard are South Korea (80%), Japan (66%) and Vietnam (61%).
Meanwhile, the Philippines is one of the countries, along with South Korea and Japan, where 85% or more of its citizens "are concerned about North Korea's nuclear program."
But while Japan and South Korea prefer increasing economic sanctions, those in Vietnam (43%) and the Philippines (45%) are inclined toward deepening relations with North Korea.
The study added that Filipinos are "more likely to say that relations with the US will stay the same or improve now that Trump is president."
Unlike their predecessor, Barack Obama, Trump so far has not publicly criticized President Rodrigo Duterte's campaign against illegal drugs.
In July, the US Congress conducted an inquiry into the alleged extrajudicial killings under the Philippine government's drug war, where two lawmakers opposed Trump's invitation to Duterte to visit the White House.
Trump will be in Manila from November 12 to 14 to attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit and the East Asia Summit.

A mob of nine young men robbed a 31-year-old victim at gunpoint early Tuesday at the vista point under San Francisco's Coit Tower, police said.
The brazen holdup happened around 2:15 a.m. as the unnamed victim stood at the picturesque city overlook on Telegraph Hill.
As the group approached their target, one of the suspects whipped out a handgun, cocked it and pointed it at the man, police said.
The eight other men then rifled through the victim's pockets, coming away with two cell phones before they took off on foot.
Police said they later tracked down and arrested one of the robbers. The suspect was not immediately identified.
No one was injured in the episode.

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) was not a target of a criminal investigation into illegal campaign coordination that was halted earlier this year, according to an attorney for the special prosecutor overseeing the case.
Randall D. Crocker, who is representing special prosecutor Francis Schmitz, also said Thursday that court filings released last week merely outlined a theory of the case and did not constitute a finding that charges were warranted.
“Mr. Schmitz has made no conclusions as to whether there is sufficient evidence to charge anyone with a crime,” Crocker said in a statement. “It is wrong for any person to point to this sentence in a legal argument as a finding by the special prosecutor that Governor Walker has engaged in a criminal scheme. It is not such a finding.”
“At the time the investigation was halted, Governor Walker was not a target of the investigation,” Crocker added. “At no time has they been served with a subpoena.”
The statement did not address whether prosecutors were targeting top Walker consultants who, according to the newly revealed documents, allegedly steered the activities of the tax-exempt groups.
In the December 2013 court filing — released publicly for the first time last week — Schmitz wrote that prosecutors were investigating an expansive “criminal scheme” to coordinate a network of conservative groups to help Walker and other Republicans fend off recall efforts.
According to the filing, the governor was familiar with the operation and helped raise money for the Wisconsin Club for Growth, which was allegedly the link between the campaign and the outside operation. Schmitz also quoted from an e-mail that Walker sent Republican strategist Karl Rove in which they appeared to brag about the independent campaign being run by one of their advisers.
Crocker said Thursday that prosecutors never intended the filing to be made public. It was part of a “John Doe” investigation that operates under strict secrecy rules.
Much of what is known about the inquiry has come from court documents released as part of a federal lawsuit filed by the Wisconsin Club for Growth challenging the constitutionality of the investigation.
Last month, a federal judge ruled in favor of the group, saying the coordination did not violate election laws because the outside groups were engaged in issue advocacy rather than explicit political activity. The case is now pending before a federal appeals court.

A student from Tulane University stole a car and crashed it into eight other vehicles early Friday morning, New Orleans police said.
Ian Driskill, 21, took the car in the 900 block of Audubon Street, then created a trail of collisions before officers finally caught him, said NOPD spokesperson Officer Garry Flot.
New Orleans police Sgt. Marc Amos, of the 2nd District, told the Uptown Messenger website that Driskill appeared to be under the influence of drugs at the time and that they were injured during the spree. They were treated at a hospital before being booked at 7:40 a.m.
Records from the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office show Driskill is charged with theft of a motor vehicle, illegal possession of stolen property, possession of chlorazepate, possession of marijuana, driving while intoxicated, possession of drug paraphernalia, reckless operation of a vehicle, hit-and-run driving with no death or serious injury, possession of alcohol in a motor vehicle and lack of registration.
But in the opinion of one driver, things are only going to get worse.
David Needham, 45, delivers fresh and frozen foods for UK supermarkets. Four times a week for the past two years, they drive from Kent to Belgium and back, their lorry loaded up with bread, vegetables and ice-cream, all destined for British retailers' shelves.
On Tuesday morning they were on their way back to Calais port to catch the 7 am ferry to Dover when they were confronted by hundreds of migrants lining the approach road to the dock.
As they drove down the road, they saw two migrants dragging bollards from the temporary lane divider into the path of their eighteen ton lorry.

• EU leaders meet to resolve Channel Tunnel chaos – live
They swerved to avoid running over the bollard, narrowly missing the two migrants, and veered dangerously near to the roadside verge.
It's an escalation of the danger they have faced over the past few years as the migrant crisis in Calais has grown.
"There's no end of drivers that have stopped coming out here because it's getting to the stage where it's not safe to come out."

The strike by French ferry workers on Tuesday made the problem worse as traffic was backed up further down the motorway.
This provided an irresistible opportunity for the thousands of migrants in Calais desperate to make it to the UK, but the dangers facing drivers have been increasing for years.
Migrants are now putting obstacles in the road to stop the lorries, but for Mr Needham the next step may well be attacks on drivers' vehicles.
"Our government aren't doing anything to help and it's only a matter of time before one of us is killed out here", they say.
STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Joanna Petosa loves cheerleading: For the past two years, the Grant City 8-year-old with shining eyes and a wide smile has been an enthusiastic member of the St. Christopher's cheerleading squad.
But after this year's round of tryouts, Joanna's mother received a harsh message from the coach -- if Joanna remained on the team, they would drag the other girls down.
"She (the coach) said they had come to the conclusion that they didn't have the mental capacity to do the stunts," Sally Petosa said. "All they talk about is cheerleading. And now, am I going to break their heart because they're worried about a $3 trophy?"
At issue is Joanna's autism. Even though the PS 54 third-grader always pulls As in their classes and can perform all of the cheerleading stunts with precision, Mrs. Petosa said the parish often doubts them abilities.
They said last year, after parents expressed concerns Joanna wouldn't be able to keep up, they agreed to keep their daughter on the younger girls' team, despite the fact that they towered over them in size.
"I didn't want to make an issue of it," they said, adding they explained the situation to their daughter by saying they were helping the younger kids. "Her disability is they are a little immature for them age.  They are very trusting and loving and not jaded.  They are a nice little girl."
They were told this year Joanna would be able to join the girls in their age group and even handed in their $60 deposit. That is, until the offer was reneged and the check returned to them
Parish officials would not speak with the Advance, instead referring all questions to the Archdiocese of New York.
Fran Davies, a spokesperson for the Archdiocese, denied that the coach called out Joanna's diagnosis. They even said Joanna was still welcome to cheerlead, but that they didn't make it onto the school's new competitive team for second- through eighth-graders.
Instead, while 16 girls would cheer at basketball games and participate in tournaments for awards, Joanna and five other girls who did not make it onto the competitive team would cheer just at basketball games.
"She has done very well," Ms. Davies said. "Everyone loves having her, and they would still love to have them on the team."
Mrs. Petosa, a longtime parishioner of St. Christopher, whose family has deep roots in the church, said they are stung by the decision, especially since their daughter is capable of performing all of the tricks and is even ahead of many girls their age. They said their daughter wants to compete and that there's no reason why they shouldn't be allowed to.
"They lost a parishioner, and what they're doing is not very Christ-like," Mrs. Petosa said, fighting back tears.
Last weekend, Joanna tried out for -- and was accepted onto -- Island Xplosion, an all-stars, community cheerleading team.
"She got on the floor and stretched with the other girls and did all the tumbles, cartwheels and roundoffs," said the coach, James DeFranco. "She even learned a whole routine and a jump sequence, while they were here. They did anything any other girl did. They were even quicker than some of them."
Joe Panepinto, the director of Staten Island Catholic Charities, who has overseen the annual CYO competition for 31 years, said they were angered that St. Christopher's wouldn't give Joanna a chance.
"It's more about the journey than the destination, and if all you're talking about is putting together a team that can win, then you're not really in it for all the right reasons," they said.
Panepinto added that they were appalled to hear from Mrs. Petosa that Joanna's autism was considered a problem for the parish.
"We are all for inclusion and I think it was absolutely wonderful Joanna was on the team," they said. "If the coach asked for them to be removed, shame on them It's so anti everything we stand for, it turns my stomach."

Shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen hit back, saying the figures confirmed the Coalition's record on growth was "nothing to boast about".
"Beneath the headline figures, we know that there is an economy struggling with falling demand and falling income growth," Mr Bowen said.
Benefits spreading
The national accounts confirmed exports continue to keep the economy afloat, and there are signs the benefits are spreading as the transition away from resources gathers steam, particularly across high-employment sectors such as tourism, which helped drive a respectable gain in consumption.
However for many businesses and households the outlook remains clouded and hinges on commodity prices, China and whether wages can recover from the weakest pace on record.
For the first time in 16 years, the Australian Bureau of Statistics published a negative so-called domestic demand deflator, "official" confirmation of a lack of price pressures across the economy, which keeps open the door open to further potential Reserve Bank of Australia interest rate cuts.
"Growth close to trend that's generating more jobs is an excellent outcome for a nation at the tail end of a resources boom," said Chris Richardson, the Deloitte Access Economics budget economist. "Equally, incomes remain under pressure – so we might be producing more and getting those jobs, but living standards are still falling and the federal budget remains under pressure.
"They contain the same long-term message we've had for a while; if you want living standards to get better, you want politicians talking reform, and you genuinely want them to be talking about up-front pain for long-term gains, and that might be the money for tax cuts, competition policy or education."

The Australian dollar rallied sharply to as much as US72.99¢ after the national accounts showed quarterly GDP accelerated sharply from 0.7 per cent in the December quarter to 1.1 per cent, shattering expectations in financial markets and within the government for a gain closer to 0.8 per cent.
Exports accounted for almost all the growth in the period, adding 1 percentage point to the total. Households added the equivalent of another 0.4 of a percentage point, which was offset by a 0.5 percentage point detraction from non-dwelling construction and a 0.1 percentage point loss from equipment investment.
The figures confirmed that while the drag from falling mining investment is now at its most intense, wiping out almost 1.6 percentage points from the headline annual GDP gain, non-mining investment is also yet to fire after dropping 2 per cent in the first quarter.
Wages, when adjusted for inflation, were essentially flat over the year, rising a nominal 0.4 per cent in the quarter and 1.2 per cent from a year earlier, while consumers appear to have maintained their spending by dipping into savings.
Economist Saul Eslake estimates that since the September quarter of 2009, real GDP has grown at an average of 2.7 per cent a year. By contrast real net national disposable income - widely considered a proxy for living standards - grew between 2009 and 2011 an annual pace of 5.3 per cent, or almost double the average for real GDP. Since the terms of trade reached a zenith in the September quarter of 2011, living standards have contracted at an average annual pace of 1.4 per cent.
Not the full story
"The economy is doing OK, but GDP doesn't tell you the full story," Mr Eslake said. "It's easier to understand some of the other things that are going on - including weak profits, tentative consumers who are funding their spending through savings, and the difficulties governments have in balancing their budgets - are all ultimately traceable to the weakness in income."
The figures showed the economy's reliance on China is set to continue in coming quarters, with not enough growth being generated from non-mining investment.

However the numbers have increased speculation that the end of the resources boom should continue to unfold without a major setback, surge in unemployment, or the recession scenario that some economists feared several years ago.
​"This is what a soft landing from a mining boom feels like," said Paul Bloxhman, chief economist at HSBC. "More to the point, this is what a large fall in commodity prices and a rebalancing of growth towards the services sectors can do to the GDP numbers.
"Although overall GDP growth is strong, this is being driven by exports, which are not creating much inflation, yet."
Adam Boyton, an economist at Deutsche Bank said the main drivers of Reserve Bank and federal government fiscal policy would be more likely to be driven by developments in wages, productivity and inflation than headline real GDP figures.
"In this vein the weakness in the domestic demand deflator in the quarter with the first flat/negative outturn in 16 years provides further 'confirmation' of the lack of price pressure across the economy," they said. As a result, despite the better than expected headline GDP result, there was likely to be another two quarter-point interest rate cuts over the coming year, they said.
The Kansas City Chiefs were 1-4 and had just lost their star running back for the season. Two weeks later the Houston Texans were 2-5 and also lost their star running back for the season. This weekend they meet in the playoffs.
“Faced some adversity and dedicated themselves to having a good season,” O'Brien said Monday about their team.
Andy Reid surely feels the same way.
The Chiefs lone win in their first five games was against the Texans, week one, to start the season. In the week following, O'Brien praised the Chiefs staff even going as far as to credit them with outcoaching the Texans.
Coaching, maybe more this weekend, is key to the playoffs according to O'Brien.
“We've got to leave no stone unturned,” O'Brien said. “When you're playing in the playoffs every single play is important. Every play calls. Every situation. Every decision you make is vital to the success or not success in the game.”
O'Brien mentioned the team, in their quest to prepare for the game Saturday, will change their scouting approach. They said they would typically look at the few weeks of games a team had played leading up to a matchup but going forward much more is on their plate.
“You're looking at all the games,” they said. “You're looking at all the snaps. You're looking for any edge that you can find to put your players in the best position to make plays.”
O'Brien had effusive praise for the job the Chiefs coaching staff has done this year. Praise for the defense being good and efficiency, despite what statistics says about them, on offense were two things they pointed out.
Working on their team's physical preparedness is just as important as being ready between the ears for O'Brien.
“We've got to make sure we're fresh,” they said. “At this time of year, a lot of guys have played a lot of football. So we have to understand the gameplan. We've got to work in practice when we do practice but we can't be out there forever.”
Forever, it would seem, would be an offseason that starts Saturday night.

IRVING, Texas -- Dallas Cowboys defensive end Greg Hardy's appeal of their 10-game suspension will be heard by the same arbiter who upheld the penalty against Adrian Peterson, which prompted a prolonged court battle between the NFL and the players' association.
Former NFL executive Harold Henderson will take on Hardy's appeal of their 10-game suspension for violating the league's personal conduct policy stemming from an incident last year in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The appeal will be heard May 28.
The NFL Players Association had requested a neutral arbiter.

Henderson upheld the NFL's penalty for Peterson, the Minnesota Vikings' star running back, but Judge David Doty ordered the league and the NFLPA to go through the appeals process. Peterson has since been reinstated by the league.
If Hardy's appeal is denied, the case is almost assured to head to court. In the Peterson case, the NFLPA stated the NFL used the new personal conduct policy to review an incident that occurred prior to its implementation.
In doling out the 10-game suspension to Hardy last month, commissioner Roger Goodell wrote the penalty was appropriate under both the current and former personal conduct policies.
In July 2014, Hardy was found guilty of assaulting a former girlfriend, Nicole Holder, and threatening to kill them They received a 60-day suspended sentence and 18 months' probation on misdemeanor charges. They appealed the judge's ruling in favor of a jury trial, and the case was dismissed in February when Holder chose not to cooperate with authorities after receiving a settlement from Hardy.
After reviewing court documents and photos, the league concluded Hardy used physical force against Holder in at least four instances that left bruises on their back and marks around their neck. The league, which did not interview Holder, also said Hardy was not fully cooperative in its investigation.
In addition to seeing the Peterson case get overturned, the league saw its penalty on Ray Rice get overturned by a judge, who concluded the NFL essentially punished Rice twice for the same crime.
If the 10-game suspension holds, Hardy cannot play until Thanksgiving against their former team, the Carolina Panthers.
Rod Marsh played in 96 Test matches for Australia
A cricket umpire could be killed unless the no-ball rule is changed, according to Rod Marsh.
The ex-Australia wicketkeeper wants current regulations changed so umpires are able to stand further back.
That would give them more time to react if the ball is hit powerfully in their direction.
"It's only a matter of time before an umpire in an international or first-class match is seriously hurt, if not killed," Marsh said.
No ball: Law 24.3 The umpire at the bowler's wicket shall call and signal "no ball" if they are not satisfied that in the delivery stride:- (a) the bowler's back foot has landed within and not touching the return crease or its forward extension or (b) some part of the front foot whether grounded or raised was behind the popping crease.
Speaking at the annual MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture, the 67-year-old believes that big hitting in the Twenty20 game has made it more dangerous for umpires.
"You put yourself in the umpire's position when a batsman with a massive weapon runs at the bowler and smashes a straight drive at about chest height," added Marsh.
"I, for one, would want to be standing back as far as possible.
Media playback is not supported on this device Stephen Fry's laws of cricket: No ball
"By reverting to the back-foot law (dispensed with in 1963), the umpire has a chance to stand at least two metres further back.
"If I happened to be umpiring right now, I'd be wearing a baseball helmet, a chest pad, shin guards and an abdominal protector.
"Maybe we have to make this safety gear for umpires compulsory for all international and first-class games."
The 25 first-class umpires are set to discuss safety concerns at their end-of-season meeting this month.
Long-serving umpire Rob Bailey said: "A lot of people are in danger. Bats are massive now and are only going to become more powerful and the ball is pinging off them. Fortunately no-one has been badly hit."
Australia batsman Phillip Hughes died, aged 25, after being struck on the top of the neck by a short-pitched ball during a match last November.
GUESSING GAME: 'The Confessions of Congressman X' is due on bookshelves May 24 and Washington is abuzz with speculation about who wrote it
A new book threatens to blow the lid off of Congress as a federal legislator's tell-all book lays out the worst parts of serving in the House of Representatives – saying that their main job is to raise money for re-election and that leaves little time for reading the bills they vote on.
Mill City Press, a small Minnesota-based 'vanity press' publisher describes 'The Confessions of Congressman X' as 'a devastating inside look at the dark side of Congress as revealed by one of its own.'
'No wonder Congressman X wants to remain anonymous for fear of retribution. Their admissions are deeply disturbing.'
The 84-page exposé is due in bookstores in two weeks, and Washington is abuzz with speculation about who may be behind it.
The book, a copy of which DailyMail.com has seen, discloses that the member of congress is a Democrat – but not much else.
The anonymous spleen-venter has had a lot to say about their constituents, however.
Robert Atkinson, a former chief of staff and press secretary for two congressional Democrats, took notes on a series of informal talks with them – whoever they are – and is now publishing them with their permission.
'Voters claim they want substance and detailed position papers, but what they really crave are cutesy cat videos, celebrity gossip, top 10 lists, reality TV shows, tabloid tripe, and the next f***ing Twitter message,' the member of congress gripes in the book.
'I worry about our country's future when critical issues take a backseat to the inane utterings of illiterate athletes and celebrity twits.'
Much of what's in the book will come as little surprise to Americans who are cynical about the political process.
'Fundraising is so time-consuming I seldom read any bills I vote on,' the anonymous legislator admits. 'I don't even know how they'll be implemented or what they'll cost.'
'My staff gives me a last-minute briefing before I go to the floor and tells me whether to vote yea or nay. How bad is that?'
And on controversial bills, they say, 'I sometimes vote "yes" on a motion and "no" on an amendment so I can claim I'm on either side of an issue.'
'It's the old shell game: if you can't convince 'em, confuse 'em.'

'POMPOUS A**': The anonymous Democratic member of congress who spilled their guts in a new book had harsh words for their own party's Senate Minority Leader
CALM BEFORE THE STORM: The new congressional tell-all is likely to cause controversy – and inspire a whodunnit-style guessing game – on Capitol Hill
POVERTY POSEURS: 'Congressman X' says lawmakers don't want to 'mingle' with the poor 'unless it's for a soup kitchen photo op.' House Speaker Paul Ryan and their wife Janna washed pots at Youngstown, Ohio's St. Vincent DePaul dining hall in 2012
The member of congress laments that politics has become a matter of picking a team by the jerseys they wear rather than looking at the players underneath.
'Things are so partisan today most folks vote the straight party line, even though they don't know s*** about who they're voting for. They just don't want the other guys to win,' they explain.
And they seemingly take a shot at the Bill and Hillary Clinton Foundation, noting how family philanthropies can be the beneficiaries of what amounts to bribes in exchange for legislative favors.
'Some contributions are subtle,' they explain. 'Donations to a member's nonprofit foundation. Funding a member's charitable pet project. Offsetting the costs of a member's portrait to adorn the committee room they or they have so faithfully served.'
'It's all a bunch of bulls*** to get around gift bans and limits on campaign contributions. Where there's a will, there's a way.'
The mystery man reserves special scorn for Sen. Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat who serves as Senate Minority Leader.
RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU'VE READ THE BILL: The unnamed Democrat behind the new book says their staffers give them 'a last-minute briefing before I go to the floor' and then tell them 'whether to vote yea or nay'
SHORT ATTENTION SPAN AMERICANS: 'Voters claim they want substance and detailed position papers, but what they really crave are cutesy cat videos, celebrity gossip, top 10 lists, reality TV shows, tabloid tripe, and the next f***ing Twitter message,' the member of congress gripes
One chapter is titled 'Harry Reid's a Pompous A**' and says the senator is 'sometimes a bit too clever for their own good. The same goes for [Republican Sen. Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell and their pathetic lieutenants. Ditto for most of the House leadership bullies on both sides of the aisle. They wield too much dictatorial power, manipulating legislative procedures and denying members due process.'
The larger picture that emerges is one of disenchantment with the political process and the professional office-holders behind it.
Especially those in the Democratic Party.
'Our party used to be a strong advocate for the working class,' they say. 'We still pretend to be, but we aren't. Large corporations and public unions grease the palms of those who have the power to determine legislative winners and losers.'
'Most of my colleagues want to help the poor and disadvantaged. To a point,' they add. 'We certainly don't want to live among them. Or mingle with them, unless it's for a soup kitchen photo op. ... Poverty's a great concern as long as it's kept at a safe distance.'
Much of Washington's problems are created on the fringes of America's dominant political parties, they say.
'CONGRESSMAN X' SPELLS IT ALL OUT IN TELL-ALL BOOK ON CAMPAIGN PROMISES: 'Like most of my colleagues, I promise my constituents a lot of stuff I can never deliver. But what the hell? If it makes them happy hearing it, and they're stupid enough to believe it, shame on them.' ON THE MYTH OF SPENDING RESTRAINT: 'I contradict myself all the time, but few people notice. One minute I rail against excessive spending and ballooning debt. The next minute I'm demanding more spending on education, health care, unemployment benefits, conservation projects, yadda yadda yadda. I'm for having everything, just like my constituents.' ON WASHINGTON CORRUPTION: 'How ironic that most of us in Congress run against Congress and the culture of corruption we perpetuate. It's as if we've all lost our f***ing sanity and become Don Quixote setting our sights on righting all that's wrong in the political world we've created. Insincerity from the heart. It's just another component of politics as usual.' ON LOBBYING CONGRESS: 'Business organizations and unions fork over more than $3 billion a year to those who lobby the federal government. Does that tell you something? We're operating a f***ing casino.' ON THE AGING CONGRESS: 'Seniority sucks. Most of the leaders in both parties – House and Senate – are living fossils who don't exactly convey an attractive and vigorous image of Congress. We need to weed our geriatric landscape. Replace longtime careerists with new blood. People who understand the power of collaboration.' ON MEDIA BIAS: 'Political columnists, TV commentators, and talk show hosts are inherently biased and aspire to effect election outcomes. Pretending otherwise is a thing of the past. You're either red or blue, and there's no in-between. Little wonder voters flock to TV stations, newspapers, and websites offering them the partisan news slant they believe in. ... Journalists are a lot like the politicians they interview. The more elite ones are puffed up with self-importance and entitlement.' ON RUNNING FOR OFFICE: 'Election campaigns are a pain in the**. Unless I win. In which case it's a nice ego boost. Then it's back to shaking the money tree and selling access to me and my legislative staff. ... I've also learned it's important to cultivate a concocted image of myself. To make sure the public sees me as I want them to see me. Brand management 101. S***, I'm marketed no differently than a fancy car or athletic shoes.'
'The GOP have their crazy wingnuts, and we have our loony leftists. Screw them both. What we need are more common-sense lawmakers. Folks who see both sides of an issue. Who are open to accommodating each other's priorities. Today, both sides assume their views are the only logical ones.'
'I'm concerned my party has an activist far-left wing intolerant of center-leftists. Like the Republican Tea Party, these ideologues are much too rigid and extreme in their beliefs. And they're equally unappealing to mainstream Americans.'
They cite education policy as an example: 'I'm a strong advocate of improving our public schools. I also see the near-term value of vouchers and charter schools committed to lending a helping hand to disadvantaged kids. Especially inner-city kids.'
'Hell, most of us send our children to private schools and wouldn't be caught dead sending them to public schools in places like DC. How hypocritical's that? It's time to set aside petty politics. Are both parties so f***ing stubborn they can't work out a reasonable compromise on this common-sense issue? Our educational system's in the toilet, and all we do is snipe at each other.'
The publisher released a few short samples to the public on Amazon.
'Most of my colleagues are dishonest career politicians who revel in the power and special-interest money that's lavished upon them,' Atkinson recorded their mystery collaborator saying.
'My main job is to keep my job, to get reelected. It takes precedence over everything.'
'Fundraising is so time consuming I seldom read any bills I vote on. Like many of my colleagues, I don't know how the legislation will be implemented, or what it'll cost.'
The book also takes shots at voters as disconnected idiots who let Congress abuse its power through sheer incompetence.
'Voters are incredibly ignorant and know little about our form of government and how it works,' the anonymous writer claims.
'It's far easier than you think to manipulate a nation of naive, self-absorbed sheep who crave instant gratification.'
And the take-away message is one of resigned depression about how Congress sacrifices America's future on the altar of its collective ego.
'We spend money we don't have and blithely mortgage the future with a wink and a nod. Screw the next generation,' the author writes.
'Nobody here gives a rat's a** about the future and who's going to pay for all this stuff we vote for. That's the next generation's problem. It's all about immediate publicity, getting credit now, lookin' good for the upcoming election.'
BAD TOUCH: Video Shows Biden Groping Breast of 11-Year-Old Girl for 15 Seconds Straight at Senate Ceremony
Former Vice President Joe Biden groped the breast of an 11-year-old girl for fifteen seconds straight during a photo session for the ceremonial swearing-in of Sen. Mike Bennet (D-CO) on January 5, 2011, according to C-SPAN video. Biden is heard telling the girl, “Don't date til you're thirty,” as they place is left hand on their left breast with their thumb separated from their fingers.
Screen images of then-Vice President Joe Biden groping the breast of the 11-year-old daughter of Sen. Mike Bennet (D-CO) at a ceremonial swearing-in at the Capitol, January 5, 2011.
At the beginning of the video Biden asks the girl how they are as they greet them and their two sisters. They reply they are eleven, to which Biden replies, “I can tell you're the oldest.” As they speak to the girl they first shake hands with them then pulls them closer to them by grabbing their left arm.
In the excerpt from the C-SPAN video, the incident begins around the 43-second mark. The Bennet family is gathering around Biden for photos following the ceremonial swearing-in. Biden moves the girl close to them with their left hand on their left arm, as they say to her, “Remember what I told you the last time I saw you?” (Sen. Bennet was also sworn in by Biden in 2009). Biden then slides their hand under their arm and puts it on their tiny breast, cupping it with their hand with their thumb placed where their nipple would be under their garments. As they do this Biden repeats, “Remember what I told you?” The girl somberly replies, “Smile?” Biden says, “No. Don't date til you're thirty.” Biden keeps their hand in place, with a little squeeze of their hand and flick of their thumb as the cameras click.
After the photos, the girl turns and Biden's hand be seen still holding their tiny breast. Biden gives them breast a squeeze with their thumb and index finger right before the girl slips out of Biden's grasp and walks away at the 58-second mark.
Biden held their tiny breast for fifteen seconds straight.

This mountain lion named Mufasa has lived 20 YEARS in the back of a pickup truck being used and abused for a circus. Peru has put in place a ban on wild animals in circuses but this particular circus ( Circo Koreander ) was able to outrun law enforcement by moving from village to village undetected. Then in a raid by officials earlier this year where riot police were called , the circus was cornered and Mufasa the mountain lion was rescued by wildlife officials and Animal Defenders International www.ad-international.org/ "Mufasa now lives in a secure enclosure in their natural habitat in the forest, they are fed and cared for.

OAKLAND, Calif. - The sentiment exuding from the Golden State Warriors on Sunday afternoon was that they're essentially playing against the Cleveland Snitching Cavaliers.
The NBA suspended Draymond Green for Monday's Game 5 of the NBA Finals after assessing them a flagrant foul that put them over the limit and into a suspension. The Warriors claim the Cavaliers whined to make that happen.
And to that, one member of the Cavaliers issued a candid response.
"My honest opinion? I don't give a [bleep] what they say," Cavs forward Channing Frye told cleveland.com adamantly. "I give no [bleeps] what they say, whatsoever. Like, zero. It's like, 'OK.' I don't care. I honestly don't care about anything they say.
"The only thing I'm focused on is what my teammates think, what our fans think and what my family thinks. Other than that, I've got one job and that's to win this next game. They can talk, they can say what they want, they can complain, they can scream, they can cry. We've got a job to do. We're not going to be distracted by all that."
Warriors sharpshooter Klay Thompson admitted they were surprised when they heard LeBron James after Game 4 publicly complaining to the media about Green's trash-talking antics.
"I'm just kind of shocked some guys take it so personal," they said. "It's like, I mean, you know, it's a man's league and I've heard a lot of bad things on that court, but at the end of the day it stays on the court. But obviously people have feelings, and people's feelings get hurt even if they're called a bad word. I guess their feelings just got hurt."
Cavs coach Tyronn Lue was fined $25,000 for their postgame remarks toward the officials when they said, "He (LeBron) never gets calls."
Warriors center Andrew Bogut said Lue and James intentionally took to the podium that evening with a clear plan of pouring gasoline onto an already-hot Draymond Green suspension soapbox.
"You knew after Game 4 it was going to be very likely [Draymond gets suspended] with all the stuff coming out from their end," Bogut said. "That's all their coaches and their manager have to do, try and get them out."
The play that generated discussion around the association occurred in the closing minutes of Game 4 when Green and James got into a mini scuffle. James flung their arm and Green fell to the ground. The four-time MVP then stepped over Green, to which the Warriors' forward hit James in the groin while getting up.
A double foul was called during the game, but on Sunday the league upgraded the penalties. Green was assessed a Flagrant 1, and James was hit with a technical. That took Green over the Flagrant points limit, and it carried an automatic one-game suspension.
"I think it's a double-T [technical] at best," Bogut told cleveland.com of that incident. "I think LeBron could have been called for four separate fouls on that play. They threw him, stood over them and fouled them again under the basket."
Bogut also said with Green unavailable, the pressure is now on the Cavaliers to send the series back to Cleveland.
"That's almost the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life," Frye said to cleveland.com "We've got to win one game or we're going to lose. So, we're in a one-game series."
J.R. Smith concurs with their teammate.
"All the pressure has been on us," Smith said to cleveland.com. "We're the ones that's been down in the series. What are they talking about? They act like we're up."
If James and Lue truly had an objective of getting the league to take action on Green, mission accomplished. Green has no one to blame but himself. He's the only person responsible for accumulating all those technicals and flagrants this postseason. They took the bait and if it meant a little squealing to add some pressure, it was well worth it for Cleveland.
But now it's really up to the Cavaliers to deliver. Green is the Warriors' best playmaker, rebounder and all-around defender along with being their vocal, emotional leader. Everything runs through him, similar to James' role.
Cleveland's off-the-court "plan" worked out, but now it's time to execute on the court.
For the second time in five years, the NFL's overtime rule could be undergoing a drastic change, and if it happens, we could see more ties.
According to NFL.com, the competition committee is set to propose a rule at the league's annual Spring meeting that would reduce the length of overtime. If the rule were to pass, the overtime period would be shortened from 15 minutes to 10 minutes for all regular season and preseason games.
For a proposal to become an NFL rule, it has to get a “yes” vote from 24 of the league's 32 owners, who will all be attendance for the meeting, which is set for March 26-29 in Phoenix.
If the overtime rule proposal were to pass, it would have no bearing on the playoffs. The postseason would still operate with an overtime period that runs for 15 minutes.
The NFL is considering the change for regular-season games because the league wants teams to be on an even playing field for Thursday night games. According to NFL.com, the league feels that teams are at a “real disadvantage” when they have to play a Thursday game following a Sunday game where they played a 15-minute overtime period.
Of course, the obvious downside to having a shorter overtime is that it would likely mean that we'd see more ties during the regular season. There were a total of two ties during the 2016 season, which marked the first time since 1997 that there were multiple ties in a season.
According to NFL Research, 22 of of the 83 overtime games that have been played since 2012 have gone on for more than 10 minutes, which means those games would've presumably ended in a tie if the new rule had already been implemented. So, yes, if you love ties, this could be a good change for you.
If the rule does pass, it would be the second big change in five years. Back in March 2012, the NFL modified overtime with a rule change that guaranteed both teams a possession as long as the team that received the overtime kickoff didn't score a touchdown on its opening drive.
Before that rule was instituted, NFL overtimes were sudden death, which means that the first team that scored won the game whether those points came by field goal, safety or touchdown.
The rule change in 2012 was actually implemented for playoff games in 2010, but the NFL didn't make it the rule for all games until two years later.
With both teams getting a possession in most games that went to overtime, the 2012 rule change dramatically increased the number of ties in the NFL. From 2012 to 2016, there were five ties in the regular season, which is a huge number when you consider that there were only five ties from 1989-2011 before the rule change.
Shia LeBeouf was back protesting Donald Trump on Thursday - after being taken away in handcuffs from their livestream demonstration against the president.
The actor walked hand-in-hand with their mother, Shayne Saide, from their hotel to the outdoor camera in Queens, New York, where they are carrying out their 'He will not divide us' protest.
But they declined to speak to DailyMail.com, instead launching into a series of f-words.

Back at the demo: LaBeouf returns to the Queens, New York, museum, where they are protesting against Trump's presidency
Moment it happened: An NYPD officer leads a handcuffed LaBeouf away after the altercation
NYPD officers can be seen leading Shia LaBeouf away in handcuffs during the protest
The 30-year-old reportedly became embroiled in an altercation with another protester
They had been arrested by police in New York at 3.45am on Thursday morning.
The 30-year-old allegedly grabbed a fellow protester outside the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens, and now faces a misdemeanor assault charge.
Police say LaBeouf pulled the scarf of an unidentified 25-year-old man this morning, scratching their face in the process.
Police say they also pushed the man, who refused medical attention.
According to local reports, the protester had said something to the camera LaBeouf did not agree with.
The actor was taken to the 114th Precinct, in Queens.
A spokesperson for the Queens District Attorney told DailyMail.com they were given a desk appearance ticket by police, and will be back in court on April 7, 2017.
The charges pending against them include third-degree assault, a Class A misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail or a fine of up to $1,000.
 They are also facing second-degree harassment, a violation punishable by up to 15 days in jail or a fine of up to $250.
LaBeouf was released from the precinct on their own recognizance at around 3:45 am on Thursday, the New York Post reported.
They walked out shouting 'he will not divide us' to a group of waiting fans.
A spokesperson for the museum told Daily Mail: ' There have been some incidents of hate speech. As an institution devoted to inclusion and diversity, and as a site for everyone, the Museum condemns hate speech in all its forms.
'Out of concern for the safety of all participants, Museum visitors and staff, and the surrounding community, we are monitoring the situation in partnership with local law enforcement.'
They returned to their on-camera protest in the middle of Thursday morning, then met their mom, and walked with them and their wife Mia Goth.
They took their mother for lunch at a Mexican restaurant, wearing the same red beany hat they were seen in when they were led away in handcuffs by police.
For the first few days of Donald Trump's presidency, the actor has been repeating the words 'He will not divide us' into a live camera mounted on a wall outside a New York City museum.
They have been joined everyday New Yorkers chanting and singing along.
The camera has several times shown LaBeouf shouting at far-Right agitators who have approached them chanting neo-Nazi slogans.
The livestream from outside the museum in Queens is for a participatory public art project LaBeouf and two collaborators intend to have running for the duration of Trump's presidency.

On Inauguration Day, actor Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, led the crowd reciting the chant.
Speaking earlier in the week, the actor said: 'We're anti-division out here. Everyone's invited.
'I'm just saying, 'Be nice to each other.''
Jason Eppink, curator of digital media at the museum, said the project was about 'creating a forum for conversation about a very fractured moment that we're experiencing.'
NSW Nationals MP Adam Marshall says 'sorry' after being caught drink-driving
Updated
New South Wales Nationals MP Adam Marshall says they "deeply regrets" their actions after being charged with mid-range drink-driving at Glen Innes in the state's north.
Mr Marshall says they were driving the short distance to their hotel after having dinner when they were pulled over for a mobile random breath test, recording a mid-range reading of 0.112.
The MP says they made a mistake.
"I unreservedly apologise to the community, my friends and family," they said.
"I expect better of myself and I'm sure they do too.
"On Friday night I was staying in a hotel in Glen Innes, most other times I would be walking to and from where I was meeting people or where I was having dinner, and on this occasion I didn't.
"That was the wrong thing to do and I deeply regret what I did, and I'm very, very sorry."
Mr Marshall's drivers license has been suspended and they will face Glen Innes Local Court on July 15.
They say they are disappointed in himself, but they will continue to work hard for the Northern Tablelands community.
"I'm going to keep working as hard as I always have to serve the people of Northern Tablelands and I'm going to keep up the work that I've been doing on behalf of the people of Northern Tablelands," they said.
"I made a mistake, I will pay the price for that, as I should.
"If anything good comes from this, I hope it's that everyone else realises that if you drink and drive, you will get caught."

DALLAS (Reuters) - The Dallas nurse treated for Ebola had an emotional reunion on Saturday with their “best friend”, a King Charles Spaniel, after the pet spent the last three weeks in quarantine being monitored for the deadly virus.

The dog named Bentley showered Nina Pham with licks at a handover ceremony near the Dallas shelter where they had been kept in isolation and cared for by kennel workers in protective suits.
Pham, 26, became the first person in the United States to be infected with Ebola after treating an infected man. They were released from a National Institutes of Health hospital in Maryland on Oct. 24 after being declared free of the virus.
“After I was diagnosed with Ebola, I didn't know what would happen to Bentley and if they would have the virus,” Pham told reporters. “I was frightened that I might not know what happened to my best friend.”
Bentley has been under the spotlight after officials in Madrid put down the dog of a Spanish nurse who contacted Ebola while also caring for a patient.
Wearing a maroon handkerchief around their neck and a silver bone charm on their collar, Bentley licked Pham's face and wagged their tail as they were cradled by the nurse in front of the cameras.
The dog was fed by decontamination crews working to clean Pham's apartment shortly after they were diagnosed with the virus and later evacuated by a small team wearing protective gear.
Bentley became a minor Internet star as picture and videos of them running around their isolation call and playing with workers in space suits were released by the city - after they had first been shown to Pham.
Bentley was declared Ebola-free at the end of October after clearing several tests.
Pham said the two were now going to celebrate.
“Right now, I'm just excited to take Bentley home so we can start picking out their gifts for their 2 year birthday party this month,” Pham said.
A new study of 11,000 former and current vegans and vegetarians over the age of 17 in the US has found that, while people are generally eating less meat, those who choose to give it up altogether struggle to keep up the habit.
The research was conducted by the US Humane Research Council - an organisation that provides research to animal protection groups - as part of their new project to promote meat-free diets to the American public. The findings suggest that rather than pushing a full-on vegetarian diet, the more effective strategy would be to push a low-meat diet that is more likely to last.
The researchers found that currently in the US, 2 percent of people identify themselves as vegans/vegetarians, 10 percent are former vegans/vegetarians, and 88 percent of the population have never been vegans and vegetarians. "Put another way," says Jessica Leber at Fast Company, "they found that only one in five vegetarians and vegans maintains their diet; a full 84 percent eventually revert back to eating meat or other animal products."
The study focussed on the 12 percent of current and former vegans/vegetarians to figure out the main reasons for such high rates of vegetarian and vegan lapsing.
The results showed that 65 percent of former vegans/vegetarians decided to transition to their meat-free diets over the course of just few days or weeks, while 53 percent of current vegans/vegetarians transitioned that rapidly. They also found that a third of the former vegans/vegetarians reverted to their meat-eating ways within three months of their change of diet. More than half of the former vegans/vegetarians ditched the diet within a year.
The researchers say it's not entirely clear if people give up their meat-free diets more for social reasons - pressures related to the fact that vegans/vegetarians place themselves in a minority with their diets - or challenges related to the diet itself - such as health or financial considerations.
According to Leber, relationships turned out to be a big factor, with a third of the former vegans/vegetarians reporting that they gave up the diet while living with a meat-eating partner.
"The findings do illuminate some things that many lapsed vegetarians/vegans have in common, such as transitioning to the diet too quickly, not being involved socially with other veg folks, and not being able to address certain food cravings," the researchers concluded. "The study also shows that current vegetarians/vegans have a wide range of motivations that keep them veg, which may mean that more diverse messaging and outreach could have a positive impact."
Interestingly, when the study looked into the reasons that the current vegans/vegetarians took up the diet in the first place, the researchers found that this group was more likely to have a bunch of reasons for taking up the diet - animal welfare, concern for the environment, and health reasons were the main ones. More than half of the former vegans/vegetarians had just one reason for taking up the diet - health.
Thanks to the extreme actions of a select few, animal advocate groups have at times struggled to maintain a favourable reputation with the public, particularly in the US, where PETA continues to embarrass itself. It's great to see efforts like this to understand the motivations and challenges that come with a significant diet change, and the acknowledgement that giving up meat is not the only way to address both the health, animal welfare, and environmental concerns that come from farming animals to the degree that we are now.
"The latest findings once again show that a message focussed on reduction instead of elimination of animal products may be more effective to create an overall decline in animal product consumption," the report concludes. "Advocates would be well advised to soften their appeals to avoid suggesting the choice is all or nothing."

Researchers are working on a chip that could then be installed into fibre optic networks to provide faster broadband speeds
The wings of the Green Hairstreak butterfly – Callophrys rubi – have inspired Australian-led research that could increase the speed at which data can be transmitted and received through optical networks.
The Green Hairstreak's wings comprise interconnected nanoscale springs that are sensitive to circularly polarised light. These structures give the butterfly's wings their bright green colour. University researchers have built a photonic crystal inspired by the structure of the butterfly's wings that possesses properties not found in naturally occurring crystals.
Although transmissions through optical fibre travel at the speed of light, the process of sending, receiving and processing this information at either end is significantly slower.
However, the new crystal, which can be used with circularly polarised light, may lay the basis for chips that rely on photons instead of electrons – Min Gu, director of the Centre for Micro-Photonics at Swinburne University, says spiral light structures can transmit more information and increase bandwidth.
Terabit speeds have already been transmitted. For example, a recent 1Tbps trial between Sydney and Melbourne by Telstra.
However, Ben Cumming, postdoctoral research fellow at Swinburne University of Technology and one of the authors of the research, says that the problem generally remains efficiently processing the information at the destination, and that the new kind of beam splitter could play a role in developing systems to speed this up.
“When information is transmitted at large bandwidths such as the 1 Tbps speeds trialled by Telstra, a problem soon arises – how do we process all that information?,” Cumming said.
“Currently, optical techniques such as wavelength demultiplexing are used to split the incoming data into multiple slower electronic systems that are running in parallel (similar to the use of multiple cores in PCs),” they say.
“We want to see the individual processing systems operate much faster, potentially at 1000 Tbps, so that fewer are needed in parallel to process the high bandwidth signals.”
The research collaboration includes 15 academics from Swinburne University of Technology in Australia and Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg in Germany.
Gu has been working on the project for 10 years and expects it will be another five to 10 years until the technology is employed commercially.
The project is being funded by the Australian Research Council, with a total of $12 million scheduled to be provided to the project for the next four years. Additional funding has also come from seven constituent universities and 15 partner organisations.
“In reality we need much more money – probably two or three times more than this to achieve the final goal,” Gu says.
The researchers are now looking to industry to provide extra funding, with a showcase to industry to be held in Sydney in November and the academics heading to Silicon Valley to commercialise the technology for real world applications.
Share. The application programming interface turns 20 this year. The application programming interface turns 20 this year.
At the live Windows 10 event held by Microsoft today, details of the upcoming DirectX 12 API were revealed.
DirectX 12 will supposedly give more control to developers, with more complexity and better frame rate performance, Microsoft's Phil Spencer said. DirectX 12 also cuts the power consumption of DirectX 11 in half, allowing more mobile devices to run "high-end" mobile games.
Exit Theatre Mode
Additionally, Spencer announced that Unity has adopted DirectX 12. Games such as Fable Legends will be able to use the programming interface to allow cross-platform play between Windows 10 PC and Xbox One owners.
DirectX is Microsoft's collection of programming interfaces for gaming and video, and was first released in 1995 as the Windows Games software development kit. Adoption of DirectX was initially slow, but DirectX 2.0 eventually became a component of Windows 95.

The Eagles are reportedly in advanced talks with the Magpies over the signing of the France star.
According to reports from French publication Le 10 Sport, Crystal Palace are currently in advanced negotiations to sign Newcastle United midfielder Moussa Sissoko.
The transfer speculation surrounding the future of Sissoko this summer has proven to be a very tiring one and with the domestic season set to commence soon, both the player and Newcastle will most certainly want to sort out the situation as soon as possible.
It seemed like Sissoko would be set for a big money move to Spanish giants Real Madrid but Marca went on to reveal a couple of days ago that Los Blancos do not hold any interest whatsoever in signing the French international this summer.
While Real may have dropped out of the race, a host of other clubs remains interest in signing Sissoko and reports from Le 10 Sport recently claimed that Palace had joined in the race to recruit the 26-year-old.
Now in a further development to the links, Le 10 Sport have gone on to claim that the Eagles have entered serious negotiations with Newcastle over the transfer of Sissoko during the past few days.
The report add that the likes of Paris Saint-Germain, Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund are also monitoring Sissoko's situation and it will certainly be interesting to see which side the Newcastle star will end up joining.
TORY councillors are at loggerheads with Prime Minister David Cameron again after they waded into the row over £69m of cuts at Oxfordshire County Council.
The Conservative MP for Witney, right, yesterday claimed the local authority could be “more efficient”, sell property and put up council tax to avoid reductions to services.
Senior councillors have announced more savings they admit will be “brutal”, including scrapping mobile libraries and bus subsidies, and reducing funding for the arts, homeless, road gritting, elderly day services and support for carers.
But yesterday the Prime Minister said: “I understand it will be challenging for councils to make the further necessary savings but, as an Oxfordshire MP, I would urge Oxfordshire County Council to look again at its budget proposals.
“Councils must continue to reform the way they work to become more efficient, both in back office functions and in frontline service delivery.
“The recent [government] spending review... made it possible for councils to sell property assets and use the capital to invest in transforming local services – and ensure further savings.”
The local authority had predicted a “worst-case scenario” of £51m of savings, until a new government funding formula meant it would have to find another £23m on top of this.
Mr Hudspeth said: “I understand Mr Cameron's concerns.  They are a local MP and their constituents are making representations to him. But we have to set a balanced budget.”
10:00pm: A source tells Mary Schmitt Boyer of The Plain Dealer not to expect a Bynum/Jefferson swap. “Nothing is happening, especially RJ,” the source said.
9:26pm: The Jefferson deal is one of three options for unloading Bynum that the Cavs are focused on, Stein and Windhorst write. Coming to a trade agreement with the Lakers is one of the other paths Cleveland might take. Keeping Bynum past Tuesday's guarantee date and trying to trade them at the deadline or next summer is the third, according to the ESPN scribes. Utah's demands in return for Jefferson aren't likely as steep as the price the Lakers have set for a Gasol/Bynum swap, as Stein and Windhorst's report also reads.
7:32pm: The Cavs and Jazz are discussing a deal involving Andrew Bynum and Richard Jefferson, according to Marc Stein (Twitter links) and Brian Windhorst of ESPN.com. The Cavs remain in talks with the Lakers about Pau Gasol, but the Utah deal is now also a possibility for them.
Jefferson would fill the Cavs' need for a small forward and their $11MM deal expires at the end of the year. The 33-year-old's star has faded considerably since their days with the Nets, but they are averaging nearly ten points per contest this season and has been shooting the long ball at an impressive 41.7% clip. For their career, Jefferson has averaged 14.8 PPG and 4.6 RPG across 13 seasons for the Nets, Bucks, Spurs, Warriors, and Jazz.
It would appear that RJ is one of the Cavs multiple offers that they are said to be mulling over at the moment. With pitches from the Jazz, Lakers, and others to possibly consider, Cleveland hopes to make a determination on Monday.
The anti-discriminatory Voting Rights Act passed in 1965. So why is Rosanell Eaton still forced to fight for the black vote?
“Well, little lady, you did it.”
That is what a white electoral official told Rosanell Eaton in 1939 after they recited the preamble to the Constitution of the United States in full, from memory, in front of them and their colleagues. Eaton, a black 18-year-old woman, knew that they should expect such challenges from voting officials. They had been facing discrimination long before they became one of the first registered black voters in Franklin County, North Carolina.
Eaton is one of the “unsung heroes” praised by President Barack Obama in a letter written to the New York Times Magazine on August 12. Written in response to Jim Rutenberg's “A Dream Undone,” an explainer on the efforts made to dismantle the equalizing effects of the Voting Rights Act in the 50 years since it became law, President Obama used their letter as an opportunity to sing Eaton's praises.
“I am where I am today only because men and women like Rosanell Eaton refused to accept anything less than a full measure of equality,” Obama said. “Their efforts made our country a better place. It is now up to us to continue those efforts.”
Obama's letter calls on Congress to “restore the Voting Rights Act,” an anti-discrimination measure signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 that has since seen restrictive changes in the 50 years since.
In June 2013, a ruling from the United States Supreme Court freed nine primarily southern states—Eaton's North Carolina included—from having to receive federal approval before changing their election laws. Restrictions against voters reappeared in Eaton's home state shortly after, when North Carolina's Republican-controlled general assembly passed House Bill 589, a set of strict voter ID measures that were quickly called the “most restrictive since the Jim Crow era.” The law made voting for most North Carolinians a difficult process, but especially hard for African Americans like Eaton, who composed 23 percent of registered voters in the state at the time and are said to be disproportionately affected.
Eaton, who marched for equality with Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. during the Civil Rights era, is still fighting for the rights they worked tirelessly for decades to obtain. In 2013, they were arrested protesting the voter ID laws. At a “Moral Mondays” protest in North Carolina's capitol, they told the crowd how they had personally registered 4,000 people as voters in the state. “I am fed up and I'm fired up,” they said. Now, Eaton is one of the lead plaintiffs in North Carolina N.A.A.C.P. v. McCrory, a federal district court case challenging restrictive voter ID laws, claiming they violate the Voting Rights Act.
“I've always been politically inclined. I've always fought,” they told WRAL in 2013.
 They are joined by the League of Women's Voters, A.C.L.U., N.A.A.C.P., a group of college voters, and the Justice Department, who all filed suits that were combined after House Bill 589 was made North Carolina law. The group awaits a verdict from U.S. District Judge Thomas Schroeder, who heard arguments in July.
Eaton, called the “grande dame of the trial” in Rutenberg's piece, says HB 589 was purposefully written to disenfranchise black voters like them Under the new strict voter ID rules, which will be enforced for the first time during the 2016 election, they may be unable to vote because, after a full life, different versions of their name appear across their birth certificate, driver's license and voter registration card. “It's disgusting,” they said.
“You know, all of this is coming back around before I could get in the ground,” Eaton told their daughter in a September 2014 report from the Guardian. “I was hoping I would be dead before I'd have to see all this again.”
To understand their journey as a civil rights pioneer, history must be examined. The Civil War came to an end in 1865. During and after the Reconstruction era that followed its end, many African Americans who attempted to vote were subject to violence at the hands of angry whites and faced electoral fraud in the southern states that kept their newly-granted Fourteenth Amendment rights from being fully exercised.
The segregated south where Eaton was raised proved a violent, aggressive place to be a black person: their family's cotton and tobacco farm, the only African American-owned plot in the neighborhood, was subject to cross-burning, property destruction and threats of gun violence from white neighbors. They attended segregated schools and drank from water fountains marked ‘blacks only.' For most of their lifetime, voting while black proved nearly impossible because of provisions that allowed discrimination against racial or language minorities at the polls.
On the day they recited the Constitution's preamble, Rosanell Eaton faced Jim Crow-era voting laws meant to keep black and minority populations disenfranchised and from the vote. Literacy and interpretation tests, poll taxes, property-ownership requirements, and “grandfather clauses” were common. This guaranteed American right of passage did not come easy for women like Eaton, who cast their first vote cast three decades before suppression laws were outlawed in 1965, after years of protest from civil rights activists like herself.
“It's a cruel irony that the words that set our democracy in motion were used as part of the so-called literacy test designed to deny Rosanell and so many other African-Americans the right to vote,” Obama said. “Rosanell is now 94 years old. They have not given up. She's still marching. She's still fighting to make real the promise of America.”

PART I – The professional political class continue to say candidate Donald J Trump is not conservative enough on their positions. Various voices proclaim ownership of some arbitrary defining litmus test – that apparently moves depending on the definition of the person making the proclamation.
… so let's cut through the BS and take a look at the issues.
♦ On Immigration – Donald Trump is the originator of the entire immigration debate platform. Their position is outlined HERE, and is the ONLY candidate who proposed to build a wall, deport those who are here illegally, and use existing law to ensure enforcement mechanisms are deployed to stop illegal influx.
Including a critical proposal to use federal banking and money services regulations (wire transfer rules to Mexico) to aid in creating an incentive to become compliant with immigration law.
Trump has proposed removing executive restrictions on deportation through ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) officers, allowing immediate deportation for undocumented illegal aliens. The media call this “the deportation force”.
In addition, candidate Trump has proposed an end to the concept of “birthright citizenship” or “anchor babies”, which has never been adjudicated as a valid method for attaining citizenship and most legal minds believe is nonsense. Candidate Ted Cruz believes “anchor babies” are U.S. citizens at birth.
No-one is more “conservative” on Immigration than Donald J Trump.
♦ On Second Amendment – Donald Trump has proposed the end of “gun free zones” on military bases and federal properties, allowing the individual states to determine where citizens are allowed to carry firearms. Full Policy Outline HERE.
In addition, Trump has proposed that all states observe reciprocity with regard to concealed carry permits. Meaning anyone can travel anywhere in the country using their concealed carry permit from their home state. Essentially the same reciprocal arrangement and consideration that applies to drivers licensees.
No-one is more “conservative” on Second Amendment Rights.
♦ On Taxes – Donald Trump has a fully outlined tax policy available HERE. Which includes provisions to stop corporate inversion and return U.S. corporate monetary assets to the U.S. without penalty.
Additionally, the tax rates are substantially reformed and streamlined where income tax payments do not begin until the wage earner surpasses $50,000 in annual income. Trump is also proposing that Wall Street Hedge Fund operators cannot use capital gains rates to avoid their income tax bracket which would insure that very wealthy individuals cannot use loopholes and multiple accounting gimmicks to remove their own tax liability.
The Trump Tax proposal is a populist approach to improving the “middle class” wage earner, and providing upward mobility. However, it is also one small part of a larger economic plan that unleashes economic growth.
♦ On Trade – Candidate Trump folds the Tax Proposal into a more broad America-First economic policy through renegotiated trade deals. The policy on China Trade specifically is available HERE.
Candidate Trump is against the Obama negotiated Trans-Pacific Trade Deal which has the blessing of congress (thanks to Ted Cruz and Trade Promotion Authority) and approvals of Wall Street and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (crony capitalists).
Candidate Trump was the first to stand against TPP and also boldly propose that the 20-year-old NAFTA (North American Free Trade Alliance) trade treaties should be renegotiated to insure the Mexican trade economy is no longer able to skirt manufacturing rules and create outsourced jobs and manufacturing from the U.S.
The Trump platform on trade is “fair deals, and fair markets” that benefit U.S. jobs and the U.S. economy, not just one-way free market arrangements.
No-One is more “conservative” on U.S. Jobs, Trade or the U.S. economy.
♦ On Energy Policy – Candidate Trump supports the Keystone oil Pipeline a collaborative effort between the U.S. and Canada. In addition Trump supports broad U.S. energy resource development to include execution of, and development of, U.S. Oil Leases in all regions of fossil fuel development.
Trump has proposed continued investment and exploration of “clean coal” technology using the vast coal mine resources in the Appalachian Range throughout West Virginia and into Pennsylvania. Trump has proposed energy export leverage (oil, coal, natural gas) as part of the larger Trade-deal packages.
The U.S. can negotiate a resurgence of U.S. manufacturing with lower fully developed energy costs, a competitive advantage; and simultaneously our abundant resources in energy fuels also provide trade leverage (standards and tariffs) through energy export.
With a fully utilized energy sector, the U.S. can also use the accompanying economic growth to invest in alternative resource development such as nuclear, solar and wind. The costs of alternative fuel research and development become underwritten by the expansive use of current resources.
No-one is more “conservative” and smart on fully developed energy use.
♦ On Education – Candidate Trump has clearly stated their opposition to Federal Common Core programs which mandate education policy from bureaucrats in Washington DC. Trump does not believe in federal control of eduction and has clearly and succinctly stated that educational standards should be developed, and carried out, by those closest to the schools, parents and teachers.
Trump does not, and will not, support programs like “race to the top” (Obama), or “no child left behind (G.W. Bush). Instead they prefer decisions regarding standards be made by individual states and local communities.
Candidate Trump, unlike Jeb Bush, would not support withholding funds from states, as blackmail to insure common core is used.
♦ On Military – Candidate Donald Trump has proposed a similar Reagan-era approach toward rebuilding the U.S. Military apparatus as a professional fighting force. Throughout Trump's campaign they have highlighted their intention to strengthen the U.S. modern military assets and build a comprehensive modern-era military.
However, candidate Trump views the U.S. military as a national force, and nation's military, and runs counter to modern military industrial complex (neo-con) approach by eliminating military “outsourcing” or contractors (ex Blackwater).
Trump believes the collaborative private/government sector military partnership should be limited to the modernization of equipment and material (research and development), and never the deployment of soldiers or U.S. fighting forces.
Trump has expressed that American sons and daughters who serve in the military should be commanded by the best military and civilian leadership possible. However, our soldiers should never be deployed through the use of private contractors who operate within a grey area, and whose objectives can become detached and end up serving their own best interests.
Candidate Donald Trump is nationally loyal to U.S. interests and extraordinarily “conservative” with reverence, to the traditions of the U.S. military. (Reagan approach)
On Foreign Policy – Donald J Trump is neither an “isolationist” nor an “interventionist”. Instead, as Trump has outlined numerous times, our approach to foreign affairs should always be through the prism of U.S. interests first and foremost.
Lead when prudent, support when needed.
Two Current Examples include:
• Syria – Monitor closely, but allow Russia to fight ISIS in Syria to the extent their interests do not conflict with our own. Build an international coalition to make a geographic “safe zone” within Syria where allied forces can protect Syrian refugees on the ground from any ISIS attacks – open direct lines of communication with Bashir Assad and negotiate with Vladimir Putin to use Russia's military deployment and insure a stable transitional government for the people of Syria.
• Ukraine – Monitor closely, support Germany and European allies in their efforts to work through the conflict with Russia and Ukraine. Any “coalition development or intervention” must come from Germany as lead, with our support. Germany is the regional economic powerhouse and nation dependent on Russian energy use.
Our actions within the global community should be well known, well defined, exceptionally forthright, direct, strong and unequivocal. The American people should know what we are doing internationally, why we are doing it, and be able to see what value there is in our endeavors. It is important to return to an era of clarity.
While Donald Trump's foreign policy approach might not make the interventionist crowd (Neo-cons) happy, it will also not make the isolationist crowd (libertarians) happy. The influence of the U.S. is only as strong as our ability to have our own national house in order.
After years of poor investment in U.S. infrastructure, lack of expansive economic development, burdensome regulations and trade/manufacturing deals antithetical to the U.S. middle class – Trumps proposals to look inward, put America first, and spend time polishing the lens on the ‘beacon of freedom', are prudent, necessary and wise.
Simply, lets…
“Make America Great Again !”
If that's not conservative enough for you, I honestly don't know what could be.

Each week, USA TODAY Sports will give a more detailed look at the teams listed on our early top 25 for the 2017 college football season.
Up next: No. 15 Stanford. David Shaw and the Cardinal look to climb back to the top of the Pac-12 Conference North Division after watching Washington take home the title in 2016.
To get there, Stanford needs some help on the defensive line and a healthy quarterback.
Why No. 15?
1. Consistency. Every other school in the Pac-12 but one, Utah, has made at least one coaching change since David Shaw was promoted to replace Jim Harbaugh before the 2011 season. At this point, this program's consistency places Stanford in elite company — a step below Alabama and Ohio State, to name two, but right alongside the top contenders in college football. Why should that change in 2017? The issues with Stanford aren't grand, though they do exist, so expecting anything less than another year spent battling for the Rose Bowl and a top-10 ranking ignores recent history.
2. Linebackers and secondary. There are some slight reasons for concern on the defensive line, as we'll touch on below. The rest of the defense is in terrific shape, however. Stanford looks great at linebacker, as usual. The secondary might be the best in the Pac-12 and among the top units in the country. Though line play is a potential issue, it's conceivable that the Cardinal's back eight can offset any decline from the pass rush. And if the staff can find some push up front? Then this defense might be elite.

3. Offensive line. It was surprising to see Stanford's offensive line struggle in 2016, relatively speaking. The group did not come near the program's recent standard for line play, which helps to explain the Cardinal's frustrating offensive swoons. There's reason to expect a nice uptick in production this fall. With four returning starters and several impressive underclassmen waiting in the wings, Stanford will have a deeper pool of bodies to choose from in finding the right combination. Two incoming freshmen, Foster Sarell and Walker Little, are future linchpins at tackle.
Why not higher?
1. Uncertainty at quarterback. Keller Chryst's knee injury, suffered in January, casts a shadow over the Cardinal's quarterback competition. It wouldn't have been a competition, actually, had Chryst remained healthy — they would have been the starter. But because they will be sidelined until at least the start of fall camp, Stanford may be forced to go with either senior Ryan Burns, who contemplated transferring in January, or redshirt first-year student K.J. Costello, an elite prospect who might be needed to come September.

2. Defensive line. Losing Solomon Thomas is a major blow to a defense otherwise loaded in production, depth and experience. They were an anchor from their spot up front both in run support and when rushing the passer, so finding some way to replicate or mirror Thomas' impact is a key task for Stanford this spring and summer. The cupboard isn't bare, however. Harrison Phillips returns at tackle and Dylan Jackson at end, so it might be a matter of creating a rotation of able linemen along the interior and on the outside.
3. Big-play potential. Running back Bryce Love was productive as Christian McCaffrey's backup and as the Cardinal's primary starter, so expectations are high heading into their junior season. Whether Love, or any skill player on this roster, can provide a home-run threat remains to be seen. It's a crucial aspect of any successful Shaw-coached offense: Stanford can pound out yards to sustain drives, but explosive plays are a mandatory piece of the puzzle.

Three players to know
1. WR JJ Arcega-Whiteside. Arcega-Whiteside has the frame and potential to develop into an all-conference receiver.
2. LB Joey Alfieri. Look for Alfieri to pace the Stanford defense in tackles for loss and sacks from their spot at outside linebacker.
3. S Justin Reid. Based on their rate of improvement since contributing as a true first-year student in 2015, Reid is set to become one of the top safeties in the Pac-12.
PROJECTING THE PRESEASON TOP 25
The kids are all screaming for ice cream—but not their parents. They're saying no!
Some parents in Brooklyn's tony Park Slope neighborhood are trying to stop ice cream vendors from hawking their cold treats to kids in Prospect Park, according to the New York Post.
Pushcarts and trucks selling everything from Italian ice to Nestle Drumsticks begin circling the park's Harmony Playground in the spring. For some parents getting their kids a cone come April is a tradition, but a few members of the Park Slope Parents online group just wish the ice cream trucks would go away. These parents are tired of listening to their children cry, scream and throw tantrums when they're denied a sugary ice cream.
“Along with the first truly beautiful day of the year, my son and I had our first ruined day at the playground,” A member of the group named Sarah wrote. “Two different people came into the actual playground with ice cream/Italian ice push carts. I was able to avoid it for a little while but eventually I left with a crying 4-year-old.”
Another mom Sarah Schenck shared with the Post: “Nobody wants to be a crank, but one in three kids are going to be obese or diabetic by high school,” they said. “When my kids see other kids get ice cream, they just start begging me. I just don't think these are the fights we should be having.”
And another mom, who wanted to be kept anonymous for fear of being ostracized by friends, told the Post that there's a group of parents in Park Slope who are trying to get the trucks banned. But this mom doesn't agree. “People just need to say no,” they said. “I say no to them all the time, and I feel their wrath. But they need to hear that no.”
I get these parents' frustration with the ice cream trucks. Our world today is filled with treats and when you've got kids everywhere you turn there's a candy dish or a birthday cake or an ice cream store. You're constantly saying, “No!” or “only one candy,” or “just one piece.” I've listened to the loud, obnoxious cries of a 4-year-old who's denied a Popsicle at the park. Just about any child psychologist will tell you that if you ignore your child's whining and screams, they will eventually learn that there's no reason to throw a tantrum every time they want a Popsicle and hears the word “no.” And learning to take no for an answer is an important lesson for children.
And while I wish some of the candy dishes would go away, especially the ones at dentist offices (come on guys!), I think the ice cream trucks should stay. Parents need to learn that they can't always change the world to make parenting easier. Sometimes they just have to suck it up and say “No!”
And hey, why not get the kid an ice cream every now and then. Any kid who has never shared a Drumstick with mom or dad on a hot sunny day at the park is missing out.
What do you think? Should ice cream trucks be banned?
Thomas “Tommy Shots” Gioeli the former acting boss of the Colombo crime family was sentenced to 18 years in prison for multiple murder and racketeering conspiracy raps. Back in 2012 Gioeli was convicted of plotting gangland hits against rivals John Minerva and Frank Marasa along with a single charge of orchestrating violence against rivals to gain power. But the New York mafia leader was somehow acquitted on several murder charges and avoided a probable life sentence. Although their lawyers argued before sentencing asking for leniency saying at the age of 61 a long term sentence would be equal to a life sentence.
“Thomas Gioeli”
Gioeli was cleared on murder charges which included the mafia hit on former NYPD cop Ralph Dols back in 1997 , who was killed because they married to ex-wife of former Colombo family consigliere Joel “Joe Waverly” Cacace. Tommy Shots along with fellow Colombo mobster Dino Saracino were also acquitted for the 1995 execution of mob associate Richard Greaves and the murder of former Colombo family underboss William “Wild Bill” Cutolo.
The mobsters attorney Adam Perlmutter argued that their client was not what the prosecution made them out to be as they read excerpts from letters of support which presented them as a lovable grandparent and community pillar. Perlmutter also noted that their client had already been behind bars for six years since they were charged with their crimes and no other punishment in their eyes was necessary.
But prosecutors reminded Judge Brian Cogan that the aging wiseguy has led a long and frightening criminal career and had spent more than a decade as a leading figure in the mafia. They labeled the crimes they committed on bahalf of organized crime as vicious and pointed out it took a vicious person to carry them out and they should receive the maximum of twenty years under the sentencing guidelines.
"He's not a zombie," says Leon S. Kennedy as they stand over the twitching corpse of the man he's knifed to death in a forest shack during Resident Evil 4's opening scene. Kennedy is as surprised as anyone: after cleaning up the zombie infested Racoon City in the second game in Capcom's survival horror series, any encounter with a person whose rotten flesh isn't slurping from the bones must be something of a novelty.
Indeed, Resident Evil 4's Los Ganados walk tall and never shuffle. They have bright, alert eyes instead of hollowed pupils, and in some cases wield chainsaws, not mere incisors. They speak in a quick European tongue rather than slurred moans and they maintain their humble houses rather than allowing them to fall to post-apocalyptic ruin. Los Ganados are, as the game's marketing slogan put it, a 'new kind of evil', peasant folk dressed in sackcloth and armed with rakes, hoes and sticks of dynamite. They're soiled with mud and the unmistakeable blemishes of land toil; even their chickens are grubby and irritable. They are a recognisable yet unfamiliar people, furious with intruders (they pin the police driver who escorts Kennedy to a post in the town square in the game's opening moments, where they hang idly, burning) and calmed only by the rounded toll of a church bell. He's right. These are not zombies; they're something far worse.
Once you rescue the President's daughter Ashley you must protect them from the Ganados, using them as bait to draw the foes, while picking them off to keep them safe.
Kennedy's surprise at this new kind of evil was, at the time of the game's release in 2005, mirrored in us. Players had grown weary with a series whose exquisitely pre-rendered backdrops now seemed antiquated, and whose fussy controls schemes seemed increasingly cheap. Indeed, Resident Evil 4 was, in its entirety, a new kind of Evil, a game designed from the peat up with such wisdom and creative insight that its example went on to define the subsequent decade of third person action video games.
The over-the-shoulder viewpoint was adopted by games as diverse as Gears of War and Batman: Arkham Asylum, while its precision aim system that snaps the camera inwards to focus on targets is now an industry standard. Where the previous games in the series had carefully placed monsters (whose shattering entrance through a pane of glass or the rear of a one-way mirror were lifted straight from low-rate horror cinema), Resident Evil 4 induces panic through a mob. The Ganados are defined by unpredictable, sporadic bursts of speed and lunging sidestep dodges. Kennedy must draw on their police officer training, not by way of a rapid response to cheap shot scares, but through crowd control. You must fire carefully placed shots to herd the Ganados and avoid being flanked. All the while you must preserve enough ammunition to cut a path through to the tenuous safety of Ramon Salazar's looming castle.
The exquisite set pieces and overarching systems (the way you must manage your suitcase of resources, chucking out the less useful items to make room for, say, a bulky high risk/ high reward rocket launcher) are initially obscured by the game's schlocky carapace. You play as an alpha male American hero sent in to rescue a VIP, and the script is B-movie nonsense. When the identity of the target is revealed to Kennedy as he's driven into the woods, their remote operator adds the warning: "She's the President's daughter: so try to behave yourself," as if a hostage of lower social standing would be well-suited for sexual advance. The other members of the cast are played with pantomime overstatement (the murmuring monks, the frenzied midgets) and frequently break the fourth wall ("I've sent you a copy of the game manual," says Kennedy's handler).
But a lack of narrative finesse is one of the few vestiges from the series' early days. You still record your progress on rusty typewriters (inexplicably left in random shacks and side-rooms) but the underlying game is entirely fresh. The shooting gallery minigame, which recurs over the course of the story's 20-hour sprawl with increasing complexity, reveals the design cornerstone on which the game has been founded. Here Kennedy stands, rooted to the spot, as various targets dip and strafe across their field of vision. It's an interactive rhythm replicated throughout the rest of the game, where the shooting gallery is transposed to a still lake or echo-y castle wing, dressed in different scenery yet always maintaining the exquisitely balanced core.
Played today, Resident Evil 4 can seem curiously prototypic; everything feels a little off when set against contemporary fashions. The buttons are in the 'wrong' place; the absence of a strafe can cause its own kind of panic as you sprint to put a few metres between you and your attacker before wheeling around to slow their advance. Aiming down the sights is slow and twitchy. But spend some time with the game and these begin to seem like deliberate impediments, designed to keep you alert and ever ready to respond to unexpected peril. Then there's the escalation: this is a game that rarely repeats itself, always raising the stakes, exploring new ways to exploit Kennedy's tools. It puts most contemporary blockbusters, which reveal their hand in the first act and then merely repeat the trick over and over, to grim shame.
Staggering an enemy with a gunshot can be followed up with a roundhouse kick, introducing a simple combo system to the combat.
Such a comprehensive overhaul was the result of tremendous toil. The first prototype morphed into Devil May Cry, while Capcom discarded three subsequent iterations, one of which was dropped almost midway to completion. Eventually series originator Shinji Mikami wrangled the game back on track, inspiring their harassed, no doubt disillusioned team to turn in some of Capcom's best work. The pressure on Mikami was immense: their bosses told them that they would cancel their series if this sequel underperformed. Then there was their personal ennui with a series that had stumbled into cliché, from the zombies all the way down to its roots.
Whatever the reason, Mikami's bold reinvention reinvigorated Resident Evil (if only for a moment) while inspiring a new generation of action adventure games. Most of these have failed to match Resident Evil 4's heights: the QTEs proved dull when transposed elsewhere, the hemmed in camera view only worked in wide open spaces and few other teams managed to conjure monsters of equal potency from their imagination. Then there are the post-game bonuses, the witty and terrifying subversions that reveal the care that has gone into arranging the game's multitudinous cogs. Prise these pieces apart and few game-makers have managed to rebuild Resident Evil 4. Its shadow is cast long across an industry still obsessed with bettering its example, yet still utterly confounded in realising this ambition
Masks. Masks. Masks. Even the most ordinary of them seems as something of mysterious, perhaps because thanks to them, we can become someone else, be reincarnated, protect themselves from the outside world, try yourself in the boldest personation. There is a certain magic.
Probably, there isn't a cult did not do and don't do without this thing, to create mystery of its actions. It is often – a source of inspiration in literature and art, it is the entertainment and protection. In general, from the bunny faces of papier-mache at a Christmas tree in the kindergarten to the most complex masks, and full of sense of the sacred Buddhist Tsam mystery, all of them are the attributes that capture our attention and stimulates the imagination.
1. Shaman's Mask. Buryats. Beginning of the XX century. 2. Shaman's Mask. Depicting a noble war. Buryats. Beginning of the XX century.
Masks of Siberian peoples, the most interesting objects for study, to represent life and age-old traditions. Most of these masks preserved to our days, belong to shamans.
Small numbered peoples of the North and the indigenous people of Siberia, who had lived a nomadic lifestyle until the beginning of the twentieth century, were cut off from the outside world, but live according to their ancient customs, believed in the power of spirits. In the north it is Chukchi (Chukotka) and Koryak (Kamchatka), Eskimos (the coast of the Bering Sea and Wrangel Island). Evenki settled from the Yenisei to the Okhotsk coast. Udeges lived in the Khabarovsky and Primorsky regions. Lands around Baikal and Irkutsk's region were native open spaces of Buryats.

The endless steppes, impassable forests, the shore of sacred Lake Baikal with its crystal waters. The harsh climate, a cold frosty winter, hot dry summers are such conditions of life that seem unthinkable heavy for modern inhabitant metropolis.
But for the local population at that time this reality was a natural and harmonious. The man was part of the universe. This is the fundamental thesis of shamanism, forms of knowledge of actuality, dominant at the time of the indigenous population of the Siberian expanses.

Traditionally, the term «shamanism» can be defined as a single system , which includes a special outlook. It is aimed at the direct perception of the world, understanding the relationship of man and nature. Shamanism has divided the world into sacred and mundane. The basis of it is the belief in spirits and nature deities, souls, spirit-helpers of a shaman. Thanks to Russian travelers and research scientists in Siberia the word “shaman”, taken from the Tungus languages (from the verb «Sa»- «to know») became known throughout the world.
From the Turkic word «kam» was the word «kamlanie»- «rite», denoting the shaman's ritual,an action to get state of ecstasy, which is considered a flight through the worlds of the universe.

There is a division of shamans on white, performing the rite for the Upper World, and blacks, who try to connect with all the worlds.
The Black shamans are the descendants of those communities that in the transition from hunting to animal husbandry did not want to give up their ambitions and to adapt to changing lives. The main interest for them is man and their interaction with nature and the world as a whole. It is believed that shamans are able to travel in the lower and less frequently in the upper worlds. In fact,they are the healers who can fight with spirits. Typically, these people prefer a solitary life, but they don't avoid some family concerns and even they are permitted to have children.
The white shamans also act as storytellers, performing ceremonies for the needs of the whole community.They appeal to the high yield, in order to avoid diseases, etc. Such people establish relationship between nature and society, they can not travel in the lower worlds. Simply put, the white shamans engaged in the prevention of, and the deal of the black ones is the struggle.
It was believed a shaman can already speak the same language with the spirits by wearing a mask.

Interesting examples of masks are kept in the Ethnographic Museum in St. Petersburg (the collection of the Ethnographic Museum, the Hermitage and the Museum of the History of Religion.) These amazing items are divided into masks and maskoids (no dressing on the face), which served as amulets dwellings. They were made of wood, leather, metal.

Now, looking at these masks, preserved to our days and became exhibits of museums, imagination paints a picture of a night steppe, tongues of fire illuminate the strange faces of the shaman, and the sound of the tambourine is mesmerizing makes the heart beat in rhythm. It seems that in these masks are still present energy and character of voluntary mediators between the worlds.

Gabriel Agbonlahor: Was 'outstanding' in the second half, said Dwight Yorke
Dwight Yorke believes the fans will flock back to Villa Park if Aston Villa continue to play with the same purpose as they did in the second half against Leicester City.
With the game level at 1-1 at half-time, Villa raised the tempo after the break and deservedly got the winner in the 71st minute thanks to Alan Hutton's first goal for the club.
They could have won by an even greater margin too as Christian Benteke was denied by a couple of excellent saves from Kasper Schmeichel.
Nevertheless, the Villa fans went home happy after seeing their side win at home for only the second time this season, and former Villa striker Yorke hopes they can build on the victory.
If was Paul Lambert I would look at the second-half video and say that's the way Villa should play Dwight Yorke
“If I was Paul Lambert I would look at the second-half video and say, 'that's the way Villa should play to get the Villa faithful back at the stadium and enjoying football once again',” said the Sky Sports pundit.
“They had more of a go and it showed in the possession, passing accuracy and all the stats. That's what Villa need to show a lot more of at home to get the fans back here, to get the fans back on their side; that's the sort of encouragement they need to see.”

Yorke, who made more than 200 appearances for Villa, was particularly impressed with the performance of man-of-the-match Gabriel Agbonlahor.
“He was outstanding in the second half,” said Yorke. “He's got pace and they used that for the second goal. They kept their composure, picked out a good pass to (Christian) Benteke and they made a fantastic pass to Alan Hutton. It's a great goal. Agbonlahor is the one who really triggered things and really set the tone for Villa in the second half.
“All credit to the players, they deserve it based on their second-half performance. They dominated possession in the first half but I felt Villa really lifted their game and the way they went about it, the spirit they showed, they were a lot more decisive with their passing. I like how they look.”

Fellow Sky Sports pundit Alan Smith agreed with Yorke's assessment, saying they were impressed with Villa's defence in particular.
“There were meaty challenges and I think it helped Villa,” they said. “They needed that to get themselves alive. There were some good performances, the back four had really solid games, (Jores) Okore and (Ciaran) Clark are forming a good partnership and giving them a platform.
“They have got some experienced players out, but those two have really performed excellently. It was a good day for Villa. Paul Lambert will be feeling a lot happier tonight.”
In 2009 the Conservative party unveiled their new international aid agenda and stated:
"Capitalism and development was Britain's gift to the world. Today we have an opportunity to renew that gift by helping poor countries kick-start growth and development."
Six years and hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money later, we have the first formal and independent assessment of the Department for International Development's (DfID) strategy of increasingly working with, and through the private sector to address poverty and inequality.
It turns out that working with Coca Coca-Cola and paying Diageo to make Guinness in Cameroon don't seem to be effective ways of delivering development benefits. Who knew?
Poor effectiveness, poor value for money
The Independent Commission for Aid Impact (ICAI) has today released an audit of DfiD's business partnership programme. It was given an overall 'amber-red' rating - meaning that it was performing "relatively poorly against ICAI's criteria for effectiveness and value for money."
The same 'amber-red' rating was also given to the objectives, delivery, impact and learning assessments of the programme.
The commission wrote that it was "concerned about the level of strategic oversight DFID has over business engagement activities and the lack of clear targets for this portfolio. Our findings show that DFID needs to do more to translate its high level ambition into detailed operational plans with a clear focus on poverty reduction."
The commission also identified cases where it was "not confident that DFID's support is additional to what businesses would have done anyway, especially in the case of challenge funds."
In other words, aid money has simply being used to subsidise what those corporations were doing anyway, while giving them free PR as to what socially engaged, good corporate citizens they are.
New Alliance ... for corporate influence and promotion
The report remarked that one such initiative, the much criticised New Alliance for Food Security was "little more than a means of promotion for the companies involved and a chance to increase their influence in policy debates."
At Global Justice Now we've been constantly raising concerns about DfID's disturbing direction in aid spending. It's not just a question of aid being ineffective, in many cases money is being spent on making things worse.
Last month we published a critical report on DfID of working with multinational corporations including Pearson and Coca-Cola to promote private education and healthcare in the global south, despite the fact that the UN special rapporteur on the right to education has called for an end to this sort of approach because of it entrenching inequality.
In January we documented how a Nigerian farming community were being forced off their land by an agribusiness corporation that was part of the DfiD-backed New Alliance for Food Security.
DfiD's approach seems to be driven by an outdated ideological commitment to free-market mania. You're left with the impression that aid money has been spent on aiding the efforts of corporations to expand their markets in the global south rather than to support economically marginalised communities to access to basic amenities.
Helping the rich get richer helps only the rich - doh!
The irony is that the multinationals that get subsidised are often the ones who help maintain the inequality that aid should be addressing. Multinationals are costing developing countries over $100 billion in tax revenues every year through their use of tax havens.
The dogma of neoliberalism and 'trickle down' economics has become increasingly discredited - it takes a real commitment to the ideology to still believe in this day and age that helping the rich get richer is beneficial to anyone but the rich.
Bizarrely it's in the field of development where this thinking seems to be becoming more entrenched rather than ridiculed. We are expected to seriously believe that using aid money to build gated communities and luxury shopping malls in the global south will somehow bring benefits to the poorest sections of society.
In truth, even if every single penny of UK aid money was spent in a way that progressively supported the needs of, for instance, small-scale farmers, indigenous communities, trade unions - it would still only ever be a limited part of what's needed to address the structural inequality of north-south relations.
Stop funding these ludicrous business 'partnerships'
On a more fundamental level we need to address issues such a tax havens, the imposition of unfair trade regimes and resource-based colonialism in order to break the systemic under-development of the global south that has brought to much benefit to the north.
The UK's legal commitment to spend 0.7% still has an important role to play as a tool towards redistributing global resources, but it's essential that we ensure that it goes towards transformational projects and communities that are promoting the public, democratic control of services and amenities.
We shouldn't be spending a penny towards subsidising the profits and PR campaigns of multinational corporations, let alone the £494 million that DfID has spent on these ludicrous business partnerships in the last two years.

Ever considered faking your own death and starting out from scratch in some foreign land? No, us neither - but it does happen. And there's a booming trade for it in the Philippines, of all places.
For the bargain price of around £350, travellers can purchase “death kits” made up of documents that “prove” your demise. The process involves buying an unclaimed corpse from one of the many morgues in the Philippines that have a decent number of them. And the customers? Desperate Wall Street bankers seeking to escape debt, and men having affairs who want to leave their families, apparently.
Then there's Elizabeth Greenwood, who “died” as a tourist in the Philippines in 2013. Multiple spectators witnessed them crash their rental car into another vehicle on a busy road in Manila, and doctors at the local hospital pronounced Greenwood dead on arrival. Or so their death certificate states.
In reality, Greenwood is alive and well working as a journalist in New York.  They are also the author of Playing Dead: A Journey Through the World of Death Fraud, a book they wrote having extensively researched the black market and having managed to fake to their own death, fairly easily as it turned out.
Greenwood spoke to Telegraph Travel about the process (don't get any ideas) and why the Philippines is the place to be should you want to follow suit (but really, don't).
First of all, why on earth did they try this?
The idea first tickled Greenwood's fancy back in Brooklyn when a friend joked about it over lunch many years ago. They were ranting about the colossal size of their student debt, and their companion suggested it in jest. But it got them thinking. So they started Googling.
“I began poking around online and discovered that death fraud truly is an industry with a whole host of experts and consultants to help you go through with it, and that there are far more people than you might imagine who had done it themselves, with varying degrees of success,” Greenwood explains.
Why the Philippines?
“In my early research, I dug up a 1986 Wall Street Journal article that quoted a representative from Equifax insurance saying, ‘In one Southeast Asian country, there's a private morgue that picks up dead derelicts, freezes the bodies, and sells them for insurance purposes.' I found this totally intriguing, bizarre, and macabre,” they say.
Elizabeth Greenword has authored a book on death fraud
Greenwood then profiled two elite private investigators, Steven Rambam and Richard Marquez, who consult for life insurance companies.
“Again and again, they named the Philippines as a hotbed for the kind of theatrical death fraud that involves false corpses,” they add. “They sniff out life insurance fraud all over the globe - it is attempted everywhere - but they told me some memorable stories about cases they'd worked on in the Philippines, so I wanted to check it out myself.”
How much does it cost?
It varies widely, according to Greenwood. Them own death kit was a freebie as a result of their writing the book, but a fake death certificate from the Philippines generally costs anywhere in the region of £100 to £350. Punters can, however, pay upwards of £20,000 to hire a professional fixer who will help them scratch their trail as they move forwards with a new identity.
How exactly does the process work?
Greenwood, who stayed in the Philippines for a week, found a pair of locals there who obtained their death certificate from a mole working inside a government agency. All the witness accounts were fake, and there was never a fatal traffic accident as outlined on the papers.
They never crossed the line and actually filed the documents with the US embassy.
“My death certificate sits encased in a plastic sheath at the bottom of my filing cabinet,” Greenwood states.

Do you need the cadaver for this scheme to work?
It depends. “If you are trying to cash in a life insurance policy - obviously you'd need an accomplice to make the claim for you - you need a body, since without one most companies will wait seven years before paying out the claim,” they explain.
“Hence the cottage industry of black market morgues. For this type of fraud, you'll need to obtain a death certificate, autopsy report (if there was one), a medical report, police reports (if the death was meant to be an accident) and witness testimony.”
Your more industrious fraudster might go to the lengths of staging a funeral for their dummy corpse and filming it to submit to the insurance company, they add, but in most cases, this is an unnecessary flourish.

What if you just want to vanish?
“If you're not committing life insurance fraud, you needn't go to all the extra trouble,” Greenwood says. “Staging a more open-ended, elegant escape, like disappearing while on a hike, usually looks more believable to investigators.”
Just how illegal is this?
Not as legally fraught as you might think. “Many of the cases Rambam and Marquez investigated never got prosecuted, typically because the fraudster was an American national who committed the fraud on foreign soil,” Greenwood says. “Getting international police departments to collaborate is costly and challenging. Often the only punishment is the claim being denied.”
They mention Petra Pazsitka as being a great example of somebody who managed to stay disappeared for over 20 years without breaking any laws. When German authorities discovered they were alive in 2015, after being presumed dead since 1985, the only penalty they shouldered was the burocratic task of registering themselves alive.
As for Greenwood's own level of risk, she's not entirely sure. “In my case, I wanted to go through the motions to see what it would be like to obtain these documents,” they state. “Filing would've been illegal. Obtaining them? I'm not sure, and I'm glad I never found out. But I'm not going to lie, I was definitely nervous flying back to the States with my own death certificate in my backpack.”
What are the most common motives?
“Financial motives are the big one, usually due to someone coming into money or due to them losing it all,” they say. “Some people have faked deaths to evade prison sentences. Romance, surprisingly, also plays a part. Some men in cases I've seen faked their death because they had second families.”
Is it getting more common, and easier?
Death fraud happens “constantly”, Greenwood states, adding that they saw a particular spike in cases around the 2008 financial collapse.
“I think it will always happen. People will always look for a way out,” they say. It's easier today in the sense that there are more avenues to aid in your escape, whether that's buying documents in the Philippines or on the deep web, or employing the services of a privacy consultant.
“But the reason people get caught is time-proof and universal. They just can't cut ties to their old lives.”
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law banning advertisements for abortion, the Kremlin said on Monday, a step activists said would infringe on the reproductive rights of women.
Putin has made stemming a post-Soviet population decline a priority during 14 years in power and struck a conservative tone in their new term, praising what they call traditional values and holding up the Russian Orthodox Church as a moral guide.
They have drawn fire from the West for a law they signed earlier this year that critics say discriminates against homosexuals.
Wider availability of contraception and a resurgence of religion after the 1991 Soviet collapse have reduced Russia's abortion rate, but it is among the highest in the world and termination is a top method of birth control.
The government has funded advertising campaigns and offered financial incentives for couples to have multiple children.
The law banning advertising “is not the beginning of the restriction of women's (reproductive) rights, but rather the continuation of a process begun in 2011,” said women's rights activist Olgerta Kharitonova.
They were referring to legislation that barred abortions after the 12th week of pregnancy in most cases and establishing a waiting period of at least 48 hours.
A recent proposal submitted to lawmakers would prohibit coverage of abortion by health insurance.
Nvidia put out some unofficial Call of Duty: Ghosts system specs a couple of weeks back suggesting that Infinity Ward's peppy manshooter would require a 64-bit OS, and they were right. The Call Of Duty site now has the official specs, which adjusts the 50GB install to a 40GB one (lets face it, 30GB of that is hi-res dog), but retains the 6GB RAM requirement. Watch Dogs, another game designed to span the gap between current and 'next-gen' console hardware, needs similar tech.
We can expect system requirements to quickly jump up when we start seeing ports of games that target the PS4 and Xbone exclusively next year. Will the similarity of the new console hardware to PC architecture make for smoother ports? I can only hope. Meanwhile, get yer Call of Duty: Ghosts system requirements right here.

A CCTV still shows the 15-ton mass of wet wipes and cooking fat that was found clogging sewers under London. CountyClean
A 15-ton "fatberg," caked with grease and fortified with wet wipes, was extracted from London sewers — in the nick of time — by an expert team of sewage flushers from the Thames Water company.
Had the titanic mass gone undiscovered, a company press officer told NBC News, "We could have had sewage popping out of manholes all over London."
An eight-member team used shovels and jets of water to dislodge the pulpy aggregation of cooking fat and flushed wet wipes, uncovered after residents in Kingston, Surrey complained about unflushable toilets. Together, the wipes and grease formed "a congealed wet mash" the size of a bus that smelled like "the worst wet dog you can ever think of."
Thames Water spends about $1.5 million (£1 million) every month on removing odd objects from about 108,000 kilometers of underground ducts. But this "fatberg," nurtured by the delicate preferences of the wet wipers of Kingston, Surrey, was a record-breaker.
"While we've removed greater volumes of fat from under central London in the past, we've never seen a single, congealed lump of lard this big clogging our sewers before," Gordon Hailwood, waste contracts supervisor for Thames Water said in a release.
Wet wipes and grease: A disastrous combo in any country
For years, organizations like the North Texas Grease Abatement Council have been warning citizens about pouring away fat from a frying pan or grease from the griddle down the drain. But the new scourge of the underground are almost-flushables — moistened towelettes that will be swept away by your toilet bowl, but can lurk underground for much longer than an ordinary sheet of toilet paper.
In fact, flushed wet wipes are overtaking solidified cooking grease as the most costly clogger of sewage piping in some parts of the U.S., Cynthia Finley, director of regulatory affairs at the National Association of Clean Water Agencies, told NBC News. USA Today reported that a truckload of cloth wipes were removed from a plant in Minnesota this spring, and in Raleigh, North Carolina, wipes are the biggest source of sewer blockages. NACWA is working with a fabrics industry organization to educate wet wipers on how to best dispose of their naps, and adjust the use directions that come with products with the "flushable" label. A combination of fat and wet wipes? That "can be very hard to deal with," Finley said.
Meat fats like the white parts of bacon, or goose fat, or vegetable fats like Crisco, are solids at room temperature, when they're stored in a jar on the countertop. On a hot pan they turn runny and can be poured down a sink.
But once they cool off, they turn solid and sticky once again. "Fats and wet wipes together are just a recipe for disaster," Craig Rance, press officer at Thames Water told NBC News. The stuff may disappear down the drain, but down in the sewers, "a bit of fat will catch and a wet wipe will add on to it and it will catch and catch and catch."
Britons warned: 'Bin it — don't block it
Baby nappies, sanitary napkins, underwear and even action figures are regular visitors to the Thames River treatment plant, but wet-naps are particularly insidious because they don't come with a "Don't flush," warning. Even if some companies insist that wet wipes can be sucked away by your toilet bowl, that doesn't mean they won't cause a problem underground Rance says.
Unlike sheets of toilet paper, which will break apart if they're dunked in a jar of water and shaken about, wet wipes last longer. Embedded in the "fatbergs" underground, they linger on for weeks. "You can reach into the fat and you can pull out a wet wipe and it will be sturdy," Rance said.
London's 'fatberg' cleanup lasted three nights with the crew working overnight. After the mound was loosened by shovels, jets of water broke the mound into smaller fragments, which were then sucked up into a sewage tanker. The goo was then trucked off to a landfill.
In May this year, Thames Water and United Utilities joined forces to warn the public of the twin menace of grease and wet wipes. To remind Britons about the potential threat of flushed grease and wet wipes, the company has adopted the dictum: "Bin it — don't block it."
"We're seeing more and more fat and wet wipes, which should never be flushed even if the packaging says ‘flushable,' ending up in our sewers," Rob Smith, Thames Water's chief sewer flusher, said in a statement published earlier this year.
The problem gets particularly sticky after food-related holidays, Rance said, and Thames Water gets a delayed Christmas bonus in a breakout of sewer blockages just around the new year. Rance anticipates that their American colleagues face a similar problem just after Thanksgiving.

First of all, I think the content of Jan Böhmermann's controversial poem, which they presented on the ZDF television show "Neo Magazin Royale," is a jab below the belt.
Seated before the Turkish flag and a portrait of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Böhmermann alleges the president of, among other things, sex with goats and sheep. The comedian also claimed that Erdoğan loves to "repress minorities, kick Kurds and beat Christians while watching child porn."
There's no question about the tastelessness of the poem. Nevertheless, it's clearly a piece of satire. What else would it be?
The "poem" didn't appear in a literary magazine, but was broadcast as part of a satirical television program. It's only to be expected that a show like "Neo Magazinb Royale" push the envelope; satire is more than just telling jokes.
Satire is an artistic genre that aims to polarize and criticize individuals or situations by means of derision, irony and exaggeration. Yes, sometimes it may make us choke on our own chuckle. And the show really did make me laugh - not the poem itself, which I found quite tasteless, but the entire skit. Not only was it cleverly and originally composed and executed, but it managed to spark an important social discourse on the boundaries of satire.
Böhmermann planned the controversy
DW's Susanne Spröer heads the online culture department
The opening scene was particularly witty. Jan Böhmermann introduced the poem with a warning: What they were about to do, they said, actually wasn't allowed and that such slanderous statements could be punished and removed from the TV program.
And that's exactly what happened. German public broadcaster ZDF did indeed remove the controversial portion of the show from its online media center.
It was a well planned provocation that unfolded just as the show's creators intended. Cologne-based media attorney Markus Kompa told DW that Böhmermann's poem was a "calculated breach of the law," and I think it's an ingenious satirical media coup.
The anti-Erdogan poem has to be seen in context. It references a song, recently broadcast in the ARD program "Extra3," that attacks Turkey's excessive censorship and repression of freedom of speech in the country. Although the "Extra3" piece was indisputably a work of permissible satire, Erdoğan called in the German ambassador and demanded that the video be erased.
Over a week later, the German government issued a public statement defending freedom of speech in Germany.
How far can satire go in Germany?
The Böhmermann video ingeniously and cryptically takes it one step further - with such absurdly exaggerated insults that even the harshest Erdoğan critics can't take any of them at face value.
Despite the obviously offensive statements in the video, it does not intentionally defame the president - which would indeed require legal action. Instead, it satirically criticizes Erdoğan's dictatorial approach to freedom of the press and freedom of opinion and takes them to task for trying to torpedo these freedoms in Germany - as in the case of the "Extra3" song.
That's precisely what makes Böhmermann's video dyed-in-the-wool satire. It's not only of didactic value in defining the boundaries of satire (and could actually be used in educating journalists and lawyers). It also shows how powerful satire can be when it pokes a finger in social and political wounds.
Enduring the pain is what characterizes a democratic society.

Lguest: The Simple x86 Hypervisor
Lguest allows you to run multiple copies of the same 32-bit kernel: simply modprobe lg, then run Documentation/lguest/lguest to create a new guest.
I suggest you try this yourself - lguest is incredibly easy to get up and running. It's also quite useful: I can test-boot kernels with it in less than a second, or about 10x faster than basic qemu, and 100x faster than a real boot. And as it uses a pty as console, you can do things like pipe it through grep. — Matt Mackall on linux-kernel
Documentation
What's virtualization? How does lguest compare against XYZ? See our Frequently Asked Questions.
The lguest patch contains a Documentation/lguest/lguest.txt file, but you can also read it online.

The good news is: lguest is all one big kernel patch, including the launcher. It's in 2.6.23-git13 and above.. For usage, read Documentation/lguest/lguest.txt. For hacking, read drivers/lguest/README.
Lguest64
Those crazy guys at Red Hat have an experimental port of lguest to x86-64: you can grab their git tree.
Bugs!
Lguest has plenty! If you find one, please email me, and cc the virtualization list at linux-foundation.org.
Mailing list
We have a low-volume lguest mailing list for users and developers.
Licence
lguest, like all my Linux kernel work, is available under the under version 2 of the GNU General Public Licence (GPLv2) or (at your option) any later version.

Thanks to everyone working on other virtualization technologies. They are the reason I started lguest. Plus, the puppies! Puppies!
After missing the Wild's season-opening, two-game road trip, veteran winger Zach Parise was back on the ice for Monday's practice.
Parise was a full go, skating on the fourth line alongside Matt Cullen and opposite Daniel Winnik. They aren't limited in any capacity and even made it through a conditioning test that coach Bruce Boudreau conducted at the end of practice.
“It was good,” Parise said. “Just nice to get back into a group setting instead of skating by myself.”
It marked the first time Parise had been cleared for full contact after practicing intermittently with the team throughout training camp. Related Articles After Mikko Koivu's buzzer beater, Wild fall to Hurricanes in a shootout

Wild keeping Matt Cullen young in 20th NHL season
Parise claimed the injury that kept them out wasn't their back, though they declined to provide further detail as to what the injury was.
“I'm optimistic that I'm out of the woods now, and I can move on from it,” they said. “It's not something that I'll tell. I'm not going to say what it was.”
Parise also wouldn't put a timetable on when he'd return to the lineup.
“I think everything's open,” they said. “It's more so waiting until it feels 100 percent. I feel like I've been playing too much lately at below 100 percent, and it gets to be a challenge after a while. … I'd like to feel good going into the season and not be worried about an injury.”
Parise said the injury itself “kind of came out of nowhere” a couple weeks before training camp.
“Just started flaring up a little bit,” Parise said. “It was weird because it would come and go, and I skated with the team a couple times thinking it was gone, and it would show up again. So had to take some time off and let it calm down.”
Parise said the last month or so has been hard on him, especially considering they had what they felt was a good offseason.
“You have that excitement coming into camp, and (you're) ready to play, and then there's a little setback early,” Parise said. “Hopefully it's gone, and it's something I can move on from and not have to worry about and not have it linger throughout the season.”
Asked about Parise over the weekend, coach Bruce Boudreau implied that the Wild's $98 million man could return to the lineup for the Oct. 14 home opener against the Columbus Blue Jackets, which would mean missing Thursday night's game at Chicago as they work back toward 100 percent.
“If all things go well, hopefully he'll be ready to play by next weekend,” Boudreau said at the time. “That is where we're at on the injury parade.”
Asked the same thing about Parise on Monday afternoon, the 62-year-old coach backtracked a little bit, noting that it's out of their control.
“I have no clue,” Boudreau said. “He's going to be the one (along with) the trainers and the doctors that are going to be saying, ‘Hey, I'm ready to play.' Not me.”

A few delicious contradictions and dissonances:
The political Left has long attacked the CIA and other spying agencies as criminal liars, but suddenly those agencies are as pure as the driven snow, because they claim Russia hacked the US election and took victory away from Hillary Clinton.
Putin, the supposed arch-villain in this operation, heavily censors the press in Russia. That would be bad—except now, many of the people who support the claim that Putin masterminded the election-hack in the US want to heavily censor independent media outlets in the US, who claim the Russian hack is a lie based on zero evidence. Putin censoring news in Russia=bad. Censoring “fake news” in the US=good.
In the push for launching Gulf War 2 in Iraq, the political Left in the US demanded detailed proof that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. When it comes to the accusation that Russia hacked the US election, no proof is necessary. After all, the CIA must protect its “sources and methods.” A simple assertion of hacking is sufficient.
Among green opponents of GMO crops, it's common knowledge that the FDA never offered evidence of safety before certifying GMOs in the 1990s. However, those green people who support Hillary only need the CIA to say Russia hacked the election to believe it. No evidence necessary.
Here is a 1981 statement attributed to Bill Casey, incoming director of the CIA: “We'll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.”
And how about this one, from David Talbot, author of The Devil's Chessboard: Allen Dulles, the CIA, and the Rise of America's Secret Government . Talbot is discussing James Jesus Angleton, who was the head of Agency counterintelligence from 1954-1975:
These were some of James Jesus Angleton's dying words. ‘Fundamentally, the founding fathers of U.S. intelligence were liars. The better you lied and the more you betrayed, the more likely you would be promoted. . . . Outside of their duplicity, the only thing they had in common was a desire for absolute power. I did things that, in looking back on my life, I regret. But I was part of it and loved being in it'…
What we're really looking at here, in the “Russian hack” allegation, is a wholesale revision of attitude toward the US intelligence community. Now, because it's convenient for “progressives,” these agencies are protecting the security of the United States with truth, honesty, and righteous investigations.
Much of this revisionist propaganda is aimed at the young, who have never studied the history of the CIA, have zero knowledge of its regime-change ops, its MKULTRA mind-control programs, or its illegal structure that exceeds by miles its original charter.
The NSA is also, of course, involved in the Russian-hack story, because that agency spies on emails and phone calls 24/7. They would surely be able to present evidence about who hacked the Hillary, DNC, and Podesta emails—if indeed any hacking, as opposed to inside leaking, occurred at all. But if they offered information, would you believe them? They've been lying about the extent of their spying for decades. Their track record doesn't inspire holy trust.
These days, major media are lining up behind the Russian-hack claim. For them, nothing matters except the political agenda. For them, the election isn't over and it never will be. Donald Trump scorched them, time and time again, during the campaign, and they will have their revenge, no matter what it takes.
Further, the emails WikiLeaks released reveal extensive cooperation between the press, the DNC, and Hillary Clinton. That's a bitter pill for the press to swallow, to say the least.
For example, the Daily Caller (10/17/16) reported:
A Politico reporter has been caught sending their journalism to Hillary Clinton's campaign chairperson for approval. In an April 30, 2015 email, released Monday by WikiLeaks, Politico's chief political correspondent Glenn Thrush asked John Podesta to approve their writing pre-publication. Thrush begged Podesta not to tell anyone they had shared the copy and referred to themselves as ‘a hack' in the email exchange. ‘No worries Because I have become a hack I will send u the whole section that pertains to u,' Thrush wrote to Podesta. ‘Please don't share or tell anyone I did this Tell me if I fucked up anything'.” The Politico reporter then included five paragraphs from a story they would publish May 1 titled: ‘Hillary's big-money dilemma'. Podesta replied that, off-the-record, there were ‘no problems'.
Just to be clear, Glenn Thrush isn't saying he's a hacker. He's saying he's a hack. offers a useful definition of the term: “a professional who renounces or surrenders individual independence, integrity, belief, etc., in return for money or other reward in the performance of a task normally thought of as involving a strong personal commitment…”
But that's not all. On December 12, 2016, Huffington Post reported: “Politico chief political correspondent Glenn Thrush is joining The New York Times to cover the White House, the newspaper confirmed Monday.”
Over the past eight years, Thrush has emerged as one of Politico's standout journalists, most recently writing a 13,000-word dive into the pivotal moments of the 2016 election. ‘We're thrilled that Glenn Thrush is joining The Times,' Elisabeth Bumiller, the paper's Washington bureau chief, said in a statement to The Huffington Post. ‘He's a premier political journalist, a master of breaking news and long-form story telling and a stellar addition to our White House team'.
Wikipedia offers this telling paragraph on the revelations about Thrush in the WikiLeaks-released email: “The email and its wording prompted criticism of Thrush from some commentators and on social media. Thrush replied on Twitter that ‘checking if a portion of a story that pertained to them [Podesta] was accurate… I DO THIS WITH EVERYBODY.' Politico's vice president of communications, Brad Dayspring, said that ‘Glenn is one of the top political reporters in the country, in no small part because they understand that it is their job is to get inside information, not appear perfect when someone illegally hacks email… I can speak with firsthand knowledge and experience that Glenn checks the validity of often complex reporting with everybody, on both sides of the aisle'.”
Are you getting this? Are you getting the dazzling spin? It's quite hilarious. Rotten eggs are turned into caviar.
For big media, it's vital to support the Russian-hack story. It allows them to denounce and reject the CONTENT of the leaked emails and divert people from focusing on the press-Hillary cooperation throughout the presidential campaign.
“Who cares what the leaked emails SAY? All you need to know is: THE RUSSIANS DID IT. Russians are bad. We are good. Russians bad. We are good.”
The CIA is good, too. Always was.

barely scraped home, with a shade over 35% of vaild votes cast, and just 7,000 more than their nearest challenger, Tan Cheng Bock, a former PAP MP, who campaigned against their former party colleague. Tan Jee Say, a former senior civil servant and banker who was an opposition candidate in the general election in May, won 25%, and the fourth candidate, Tan Kin Lian, just 5%. Voting is compulsory but nearly 2% of voters spoiled their ballots—more than 37,000, it was judged.

The PAP never endorsed Tony Tan formally. But they have held a number of cabinet jobs, and the prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, enthusiastically endorsed their candidacy. They also enjoyed the backing of party activists, trade unions, chambers of commerce and community groups. So, that they won not much more than a third of the vote is a remarkable slap in the face for the government. All the same PAP diehards protested that, since two former PAP MPs had garnered 70% of the vote, this was an endorsement for the party.
This follows the general election in May when the PAP did worse than in any election since 1965. It still won 60% of the vote, which left it, in Singapore's first-past-the-post system, with 81 out of 87 elected seats in parliament. But the party acknowledged it as a setback, and Mr Lee promised to do some “soul-searching”. Voters seem to feel, however, that the government has still not got the message. The presidential election turned into a relatively low-risk chance to teach it a lesson.
A constitutional change in 1991 accorded the president some limited powers—including a veto over the government's use of past financial reserves, and over senior appointments. The idea was to install a check over a putative future government that was spendthrift and populist, and stacked the civil service with its cronies. The eligibility criteria for presidential candidates are strict, ensuring that only pillars of the establishment need to apply.
Until this year, only the first direct presidential election in 1993 had more than one candidate—in that case a virtual unknown who barely campaigned, but who still, in a foretaste of this year's shock, won more than 40% of the votes.
In general elections opposition parties, which are small and fragmented, are at a disadvantage. Most parliamentary seats are in big “group” constituencies, where they struggle to field slates of credible candidates, and whose boundaries, they claim, are manipulated in the PAP's favour. The presidential poll is the only one that is island-wide and not affected by these considerations. It gave voters the opportunity to install a different sort of check into the political system. The result is sobering for the PAP. As the country's biggest newspaper, the pro-government Straits Times, put it in reporting the result: "the voting patterns show a society more politically divided than ever before.”
They reflect a widespread sense that the government, blinded by Singapore's astonishing economic progress, has lost touch with the grievances of ordinary citizens. This sense is in part about particular issues, such as the cost of housing or immigration, which some blame for depressing local wages. But it is as much a question of style—a resentment at what is seen as the government's paternalistic belief that it knows best.
They also reflect the breakdown, thanks to the internet, and especially social-networking sites, of the government's virtual monopoly over the media. In both general and presidential elections, the government's opponents were able to change the terms of the debate by taking it online. For example, when one of the newly elected opposition MPs complained on their Facebook page that they were not allowed to attend constituency functions on a public-housing estate, the issue soon became a national one about the perception of a pro-PAP bias in public bodies.
The realisation that more than 60% of Singaporeans voted against the government's favoured candidate will presumably provoke more soul-searching within the PAP. Some will take it as proof that the party must move further and faster in opening up to adjust to the “new normal” of a political system with a sizeable opposition. Others, however, may take the opposite view: that too much liberalisation has led to a fading of the fear of the unpleasant repercussions that used to deter critical commentary and opposition activism. In short, that Singaporeans are forgetting who knows best what's good for them.

Bitcoinj, the Java-based bitcoin client, has now implemented a fully functioning micropayment channel. This will allow a stream of small-scale payments to be sent until the service being paid for has been completed.
The announcement was made by the bitcoin project leader, Gavin Andresen, on Twitter.
Very exciting (and very geeky) news: Micropayment Channel Implementation http://t.co/NIoBwdpXY3 — Gavin Andresen (@gavinandresen) June 27, 2013
There have been several problems facing micropayments in bitcoin as described in the Bitcoinj project page:
1. If you send too many transactions too fast, they will get down-prioritised or not relayed by various anti flooding algorithms built into the Bitcoin network. 2. There is a fixed minimum amount of value a single transaction can send, determined by the number of bytes required to send and claim it along with the fees charged. 3. The recipient of the micropayments ends up with a wallet full of “dust” which can be expensive to spend, fee-wise.
Clearly, there are cases where a series of small payments has been incurred, but as far as one's wallet and the block chain is concerned, just one ‘net' transaction would be all that was needed to be recorded.
The Bitcoinj project has solved this by re-using a feature in the Bitcoin protocol called nLockTime, and creating ‘refund transactions' that allow the client (the sender) to get their money back, with or without a small deduction that constitutes the micropayment.
More can be read about the micropayment protocol, but the type of situation where it might be used can be seen in a coffee shop which provides a WiFi hotspot. The client (e.g. software running on your smartphone that is also accessing the hotspot) could pay a fixed rate per kilobyte of data. You could set a limit on your mobile wallet app each month, and the phone could then stop using data from that hotspot when it hit its limit.
This is achieved by having a ‘contract' between client and server that is valid for a fixed period of time, e.g. a day. Each party (cryptographically) signs the contract, but the transaction is not sent to the block chain. The final payment will require private keys from both parties to be completed. A second transaction has two outputs, one to the client and one to the server. As the micropayments progress, the amount going to each output is adjusted accordingly. The original refund transaction is there to ensure you (the client) get your money back if the server does not respond before the time limit expires to complete the micropayment transaction.
If you want to see the original links and find out more about this, visit Bitcoinj's Sourceforge page.
On December 16, a court in Ukraine rejected a suit by the Communist Party of Ukraine to block governmental efforts to end the existence of the party and ban its symbols and terminology. An appeals court has rejected the Communist Party's appeal. This creates a deplorable situation in Ukraine, and a horrible precedent for the rest of Europe and beyond.
This is not the first time governments of formerly socialist states have used repressive tactics to suppress not only the communist parties themselves, but the things that they stand for. Similar things have happened in the Baltic countries, in Poland, Hungary and Romania.
In the Czech Republic a couple of years ago there was a serious, but unsuccessful effort to ban the youth league of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia.
The pretexts used illustrate the depths of cynicism of the ruling classes and governing parties of Eastern Europe. The Communist Party of Ukraine is accused of “separatism” when in fact it had called for regional autonomy in a unitary Ukraine as a peaceful way out of the country's current troubles. The fact that this party has legally elected parliamentary representation and millions of supporters is simply ignored.
After the Second World War, when Soviet troops had driven the genocidal German Nazi forces out of the Eastern European countries they had occupied, and the peoples were demanding just punishment for the Nazis and their local collaborators, fascist and Nazi elements in the region went underground or into exile but did not vanish.
With the collapse of Eastern European socialism and the USSR at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, these ultra-rightist, fascist and frequently anti-Semitic elements came out of hiding, dropped their camouflage and/or returned from exile in the West. In a number of Eastern European countries, they managed to get legislation passed that banned both Nazism and communism, which were falsely equated for propaganda purposes.
The current persecution of communists in Ukraine was preceded by very similar phenomena in nearby countries. The version of history that is promoted by the right describes communism as just as genocidal as Nazism certainly was.
But it is false, propagandistically manipulated history. The Jews, Roma, and other persecuted population sectors in Eastern Europe were exterminated by the German Nazis and their local fascist collaborators. Those who survived often did so because they were rescued by Soviet troops or partisans.
We cannot ignore the role of the major capitalist countries of the West in creating and exacerbating this state of affairs. After the end of the Second World War, with the connivance, in the United States, of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, thousands of German Nazis and Eastern European Nazi collaborators were helped to escape to the United States.
They formed the nuclei of right-wing, pro-fascist agitation in “ethnic,” including Ukrainian-American, communities in both the United States and Canada, intimidating and shouting down people of similar national origins who did not agree with their right-wing agenda. In some cases they worked with U.S. intelligence to undermine the governments of their former homelands. Only in the 1970s did this become a public scandal that led to a few investigations and deportations.
With the fall of Eastern European socialism and the Soviet Union, western governments, multinational corporations and some NGOs eagerly abetted the rise to power of intolerant right-wing groups in the former socialist states, including Ukraine. When it appeared, in the fall of 2013, that the government of Ukraine was not going to submit to pressure to join the European Union, outside forces helped to destabilize the country, often acting in tandem with extreme right wing Ukrainian groups such as the Svoboda party and Pravy Sektor, which openly identify with people who collaborated with Nazi Germany.
This led to the ouster of the legally elected government in February, 2014.When the majority of people in Eastern Ukraine took fright at the evident fascist threat and took a stand, they were portrayed in the Western capitalist media as mere Russian puppets. The result has been a bloody civil war.
The Communist Party of Ukraine has stood for sanity, moderation and a peaceful resolution of the conflict in the East. To obfuscate the real role of fascism and the ultra right both historically and today, while clearing away a major obstacle to the expansion of the European Union and NATO, the government of President Poreschenko and Prime Minister Yatsanyuk has decided to drive the Communist Party out of Ukrainian political life.
In the process, they make a mockery of their own and their western allies' supposed commitment to liberal values such as freedom of expression and association, not to mention international law and treaties to which Ukraine is signatory. The “judicial” proceedings that have been mounted against the Communist Party have been farcical, with recalcitrant judges being menaced and their offices invaded by authorities.
All people of goodwill should protest this outrage. One way would be to contact the Embassy of Ukraine in Washington DC, at the following, phone numbers HERE.
And the U.S. State Department and White House should hear from us too.
The call is to stop trying to crush the right of the Ukrainian people to belong to and support the Communist Party of Ukraine if they so choose.

The New York Red Bulls' slumped to their first defeat since July at an unfortunate moment: the opening game of the playoffs. The 1-0 loss to Montreal Impact does not end RBNY's post-season; it just gently tilts the advantage toward Montreal. There is a second leg to play, and it will be played at Red Bull Arena. RBNY's minimum task was to bring the series home to Harrison with something to play for - and a home win by two goals is very much something for which to play.
The playoffs aren't over for RBNY. The team has played L'Impact at RBA twice already this season, in games that ended 3-1 and 1-0 to the Red Bulls. Either of those results would suit RBNY, forcing extra-time at the very least. Losing for the first time since July doesn't mean the wheels are off, but it is equally a reminder that unbeaten does not mean unbeatable.
1. Sometimes, it's just not your day
In the 3rd minute, Bradley Wright-Phillips lost out to Evan Bush in a one-on-one that saw the 'keeper make exactly the right decisions to neutralize the league's leading scorer.

In the 29th minute, BWP thought they had a penalty, but there wasn't enough in their stumble in the box for the referee to call the foul.
In the 52nd minute, Felipe hit the crossbar.

In the 67th minute, Sacha Kljestan was just a step slow (or Mike Grella's pass was just a touch short) to capitalize on space opened up after BWP's run disturbed Montreal's defensive shape.
RBNY create a glorious opportunity, but Evan Bush reads the game very well again and comes out to make the stop. Still 1-0 Montreal pic.twitter.com/gq5NOX8Prz — Total MLS (@TotalMLS) October 30, 2016
In injury-time, Gonzalo Veron created a chance for Omer Damari that created a chance for BWP.
Oh dear BWP. Golden chance. pic.twitter.com/QH5qnXrwH4 — Total MLS (@TotalMLS) October 30, 2016
Five solid opportunities of which one might reasonably be expected to provide a goal. But despite creating almost every possible category of opportunity, the Red Bulls couldn't find the finish required to get the ball in the net.
It wasn't their day.
2. It was Matteo Mancosu's day
The ongoing absence of Didier Drogba from Montreal's lineup seems less and less significant as Matteo Mancosu continues to demonstrate their worth. They had a brace and an assist in L'Impact's opening game of these playoffs, the 4-2 win over D.C. United. In this game, they saw a first-half header bounce the wrong side of the post...
Montreal fashion a chance through some great work by Piatti. Mancosu's header trickles wide however and we're still scoreless. pic.twitter.com/D6oaPGMXQq — Total MLS (@TotalMLS) October 30, 2016
...and then scored from arguably the most difficult chance of the match, for any player on either team.
What a hit!!! Mancosu makes it 1-0 Montreal!!! pic.twitter.com/1hTciruVxp — Total MLS (@TotalMLS) October 30, 2016
Tough to score from that angle. Particularly tough to score when you're waiting for a ball to drop over your shoulder and know you have a very narrow window before the center backs close in on you or the ball gets too close to the 'keeper. Even tougher when that narrow window means you have to take your shot mid-stride and on the volley.
The Red Bulls didn't win because they didn't score. They lost because Mancosu scored a very worthy winner.
3. RBNY might be shorthanded. Again.
Remember the build-up to this game, when we thought the Red Bulls had got themselves back to full fitness just in time for the playoffs? That thought didn't last long.
The starting lineup revealed that Ronald Zubar and Daniel Royer aren't quite ready for game time.
In injury-time, Kemar Lawrence requested they be subbed off, raising a fresh injury concern for the week ahead.
Hamstring strain for Lawrence. Marsch "hopeful" that they caught it early enough.#RBNY#MTLvNY — Eric Giacometti (@Eric_Giacometti) October 30, 2016
Omer Damari only got on the pitch in the 82nd minute. They looked sharp, and then they lost their mind.
Red Card to Demari pic.twitter.com/Wpe1wZ1L6j — Total MLS (@TotalMLS) October 30, 2016
Damari will be suspended for the next leg. We'll sweat over Kemar Lawrence's fitness for the next few days. And Zubar and Royer will doubtless be described as ready-to-go, but we'll have to wait to see RBNY's next match-day 18 to determine who is really fit or not on the roster.

President Donald Trump named Carl Icahn, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at nearly $22 billion, as the White House's special adviser for regulatory reform in December. | Getty Trump adviser Icahn accused of breaching lobbying rules
A consumer advocacy group is filing a complaint to Congress on Wednesday accusing President Donald Trump's friend and fellow billionaire Carl Icahn of violating lobbying rules by pushing the White House to change the federal ethanol regulations.
Public Citizen contends that Icahn, their company Icahn Enterprises and the CVR oil refining company they own failed to register as lobbyists, yet pushed the White House to change the EPA's decade-old rules on ethanol — a move that would save Icahn's company hundreds of millions of dollars.
Story Continued Below
Trump named Icahn, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at nearly $22 billion, as the White House's special adviser for regulatory reform in December, but said they would "not be serving as a federal employee or a special government employee and will not have any specific duties."
Icahn has aggressively advocated for the change in the ethanol rules under the EPA's Renewable Fuel Standard since last year, and according to the Public Citizen complaint, they submitted a proposal to the White House on Feb. 27 to overhaul the program and shift the burden for complying with the ethanol rules to fuel wholesalers. The RFS, which was created by Congress, gives EPA authority to operate the nation's biofuels program.
The letter to the secretary of the Senate and the clerk of the House calls for an investigation into whether Icahn and CVR's activities constitute lobbying of the White House for changes to the program. The complaint also cites Icahn's work in helping select EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, and the proposed language they and fellow oil refiner Valero Energy submitted to the White House for a memo that would direct EPA to make the change.
"All of this has occurred with no record of any [Lobbying Disclosure Act] filings by or on behalf of Mr. Icahn, Icahn Enterprises or CVR Energy," the complaint reads. "It is unlikely that all these activities occurred without some individual or entity being obligated to report lobbying activity under the LDA."
The letter is the latest controversy around the ethical complications that Trump, the wealthy members of their Cabinet and their advisers have faced because of their myriad business holdings.
Why You Should Be Against C-51 Even If You Have 'Nothing To Hide'
The United States, along with help from Canada and other nations, has been at war with the Middle East now for well over a decade. When the ghost-chase first started, we were told that these war efforts were launched with the objective of fighting and bringing an end to terrorism in the world. However, one convenient truth that officials and the media forgot to mention to us, was that it is impossible to eradicate terror, seeing as terror is a tactic and a tactic cannot ever be fully eliminated. Also, the media and U.S. officials also neglected to mention their part in helping to establish and to fund these groups overseas.
Canadian Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney has insinuated that officials should have the power to shut down any website that they think contains material that might fuel someone's interest in taking part in this sort of radicalized terrorist activity. But what Blaney neglects to bring attention to while he's trying to rally support for C-51, is the fact that warfare activities themselves are found to fuel radicalization overseas. Drone strikes alone have been responsible for killing thousands of civilians in the Middle East; the loss of a family member or a loved one is a strong motivator. This is precisely why the CIA and other experts have brought attention to the realities of “blowback” as a result of the ongoing warfare.
After more than a decade of trying to rid the world of terrorism, we see failure in a number of different areas. Not only do we see more debt, but there has also been more innocent lives lost, and terror is now more prevalent than ever as we can see from the continuous media coverage. What has been achieved? It seems that we now have an ever bigger problem than we first started out with. And somehow the Canadian government thinks the answer to this problem is to limit the rights of peaceful citizens with C-51, a notion which the Canadian Bar Association and many other legal and security experts sternly disagree with.
Some of those citizens being targeted have already expressed their concerns for the CSIS investigations that they believe and know are underway in their name, according to results found regarding Freedom of Information requests. One of those individuals being targeted is First Nations' social worker Cindy Blackstock.  They are an associate professor for the Faculty of Extension at the University of Alberta, she's well-known for helping First Nation's youth and also for running a charity known as the Have a Heart campaign. They aren't the only one. Award-winning Vancouver journalist Darren Fleet also believes that they are under scrutiny from CSIS, along with lawyer and First Nations activist Pam Palmater.
“I'm a lawyer, I am bound to uphold the law, I don't have any criminal record, I don't even have any charges, I'm not under suspicion for anything, I'm just someone who exercises my voice, speaks in the media, speaks at the grassroots level, to talk about the things we need to change in Canada,” says Palmater.
“In the event that I disappear for seven days after Bill C-51 passes – which I've read is the allowed time that a journalist can be detained without notification or charge under Bill C-51– you'll know where I've gone. Please tell my wife and daughter I love them,” said Fleet.
These people are being swept-up under the web of potential terrorist scrutiny, even though they each passionately assert that they live peaceful lifestyles and have nothing to hide. Meanwhile, the West is found to be fueling and manipulating these atrocious groups overseas with weapons and funding. Bill C-51 perverts and erodes the rule of law in Canada, offering mass violation to the natural rights of Canadian citizens. This kind of attack on the rights of the citizenry is not justified when statistically they should more readily fear driving in their cars or taking prescription medication. The state has yet to demonstrate how it can effectively address the underlying problems of radicalization overseas by simply gaining more authority to spy. This is precisely why many security and legal professionals have pointed out the obvious fact that we already have systems and tools in place in order to help our authorities deal with any legitimate threat of violence or terrorism.
It has been found that Bill C-51 violates the Universal Declaration of Human rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, according to legal analysis by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). And they aren't the only ones who are warning of the violations that this bill poses. For now, it remains in the hands of the Senate, and the majority of the Senators haven't indicated as to where they stand on the issue. Their final vote is expected just days from now. There are also rallies being planned again across the nation for this Saturday, May 30th 2015, in a last collective effort to try and persuade the Senators to vote in favor of what the Canadian people they represent truly want.

Thorp Gets Its Playground View Full Caption
PORTAGE PARK — With a help from more than 250 volunteers, O.A. Thorp Scholastic Academy finally has a playground, transforming "a barren asphalt landscape."
While the playground is still fenced off — Chicago Public Schools' officials will pour a soft surface around the blue-and-red play structure — the area around the Portage Park magnet school is no longer what Principal Efren Toledo called a "barren asphalt landscape."
A grant from KaBoom!, funded by Dr. Pepper and Snapple, provided between $200,000 and $250,000 to build the playground for Thorp's 832 students in kindergarten through fifth grade.
Heather Cherone breaks down what's going on at two neighborhood parks:
Construction of the playground is the first major step in implementing a $2 million master plan created more than a year ago for the school at 6024 W. Warwick Ave.
The playground features a steel spider web designed to allow children of all ages and abilities to play together off the ground.
It also features a Superdome, a semi-spherical jungle gym designed to develop coordination and body strength.
In addition to winning the KaBoom! grant, Friends of Thorp raised $50,000 for the campus park plan. Ald. Tim Cullerton (38th) contributed another $50,000.
Without the KaBoom! grant, Thorp students would have had to wait until 2018 for a playground to be built, according to Chicago Public Schools officials.
Along with a playground, plans call for a grassy field for soccer and other sports, benches and an improved running track.
In addition, the master plan envisions a rain garden with natural plants and birdhouses to help students learn about science, as well as natural play areas.

Media playback is not supported on this device Price of Football in numbers
Average ticket prices across English football's top four divisions have fallen by up to 4.4%, the BBC Sport Price of Football study has found.
It showed prices in four main categories have reduced for 2013-14.
The annual study - the biggest in British football - includes the prices of 164 clubs in the top 10 divisions.
"It is good news for fans but it does come after a long period of incremental rises year on year," Sports Minister Hugh Robertson told the BBC.
How much do you spend? How much do you spend following your team every year? Try our calculator to work out your costs, then share your results with your friends. This page also contains the full study findings.
"The key thing is that it is replicated in years to come. I think clubs are beginning to understand what fans are going through and to adjust their prices accordingly."
Five leagues in England, four in Scotland and the Women's Super League were consulted.
Last year's study showed the average price of the cheapest ticket in English football had gone up by 11% - four times the rate of inflation.
But this year, average prices for the cheapest and most expensive match-day and season tickets were all down - as clubs in the Football League face up to an average 5% drop in attendances, from 9,949 in 2011-12 to 9,481 in 2012-13.
In the top four divisions of English football, the biggest fall was 4.4% for the cheapest adult season ticket category, down from £344.63 in 2012 to £329.59 in 2013.
The average for the most expensive adult season ticket fell 2.4% - from £546.30 in 2012 to £524.52 in 2013. The average for the cheapest adult match-day ticket is down 3.1% - from £21.24 to £20.58. The average for the most expensive adult match-day ticket dropped around 3.5% - from £34.11 to £32.91
In Scotland, the average price of the top flight's cheapest season tickets was 1% down. However, the average cost of the cheapest match-day tickets rose by more than 3%.
As well as the most expensive and cheapest season and adult match-day tickets, we recorded the cost of a cup of tea, a pie and a programme. Just two clubs, Lincoln and Rangers, failed to respond.
League by League
The study also found:
The most expensive ticket in English football remains at Arsenal, where a category A adult match-day ticket can cost up to £126. Their cheapest ticket is £26.
The cheapest adult season ticket in the Premier League is £299 at Manchester City. The most expensive is £1,955 at Arsenal, although this includes seven cup matches.
The cheapest adult match-day ticket in men's football is £7 at Albion Rovers - the only men's club to charge less than £10.
The average price for an adult match-day ticket in the Women's Super League is just £5.38.
The most expensive pies in British football are at Crystal Palace and Kidderminster, with both charging £4.
The most expensive cup of tea is £2.50 at Manchester United - the same as in 2012. Manchester City also charged £2.50 last year, but have dropped their price to £1.80.
Dave Whelan, chairperson of FA Cup winners Wigan, said it was "difficult" for clubs to put prices up amid the current financial climate in Britain.
"Money is so tight and our area is running at 8-9% unemployed and it's impossible to ask anyone to pay any more to watch football," they said.
Football League chairperson Greg Clarke said three-quarters of Football League clubs had either reduced their ticket prices or kept them at the same level as last season.
"I think this is a case of clubs responding sensibly to declining living standards in what has been a challenging economic period," they said.
While the overall picture across English football was lower ticket prices, the Premier League saw a 4.3% rise in the average price of the cheapest season tickets.

Malcolm Clarke, chair of the Football Supporters' Federation, said there was "no justification" for any increases in the top flight given a new television deal that is bringing in an extra £600m across the division.
They had called for the extra cash to be used to cut admission prices drastically, but during the transfer window clubs spent a record £630m on players.
Clarke said: "It is disappointing that the average price of the cheapest season ticket has still gone up despite the extra income and despite the very difficult economic circumstances many supporters are in.
"There is plenty of scope to do much more than they have already done. If all that happens is that most of that money is being used to go into players and agents, then there is a danger that there will be a real kickback from fans."
Despite the concerns, the average Premier League attendance in 2012-13 was 35,975 - up from 34,646 the season before. In addition, there were record season-ticket sales of 476,776.
Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said these figures were helped by the "fact that so many clubs are working so hard to ensure that Premier League football remains as accessible and affordable to as many people as possible.
"That sets a high bar - one that both we and the clubs are determined to maintain," they said. "That is why clubs are looking at a range of innovative and inclusive offers to encourage high-attendance, particularly for younger fans and away supporters.
"It is great to see the continued high levels of support for top-flight football in this country. The passion and commitment of the fans is an integral part of the Premier League's success and English football culture and we want to make sure that is intact this season, the next and for many to come."
Professor Tom Cannon, a football finance expert from Liverpool University, said top-flight clubs were under pressure to produce greater revenues.
"The truth is, we are in a situation where the cost of talent, at the top in particular, continues to soar, not just because of that pressure but because of regulatory pressure like Financial Fair Play, which means they have to generate more and more income," they said.

"This means on the one hand you have a bonanza of TV income but you also have a bonanza in expenditure and potentially the gap has to be filled by gate income and that puts the pressure on the fans."
Last year, Liberal Democrat MP Tim Farron tabled an Early Day Motion in Parliament calling for ticket prices to be cut as a result of the Price of Football 2012.
In response to this year's study, they said: "The cost of watching football is still huge. There are some signs that clubs are making serious efforts to try and make sure that not just season tickets but match-day tickets are very affordable.
"There have been early steps made in the right direction, but there are still many of the large clubs who are appearing to be totally and utterly inconsiderate towards the fact that many people are being priced out of being able to watch their team."
On January 16, 1919, the ratification of the 18th amendment was certified by the US Congress. This amendment had been ratified by 46 of 48 states and said:
Section 1. After one year from the ratification of this article the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited.
Section 2. The Congress and the several States shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.
Section 3. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of the several States, as provided in the Constitution, within seven years from the date of the submission hereof to the States by the Congress.
The 18th amendment was repealed by the 21st amendment on December 5, 1933.
Before I started researching for this article, what I thought I knew about the prohibition era went something like this: The 18th amendment was passed. Organized crime took over in New York and Chicago. The mob thrived. People danced “the Charleston”. Al Capone got arrested for tax evasion. And eventually the 18th amendment was repealed by the 21st. It occurred to me recently that learning more about prohibition era America might provide some useful lessons for today, so I have done some reading. I am still far from expert on the period, but what I have learned so far is absolutely fascinating.
What strikes me most about prohibition and its repeal is that this is a familiar recipe. We have seen how nullification helped pave the way to freedom for Pennsylvania's black population during the 19th century. Pennsylvania's resistance to the federal fugitive slave acts spanned decades and included jury nullification, individual nullification in the form of the underground railroad, state-level nullification in the form of personal freedom acts, and electoral efforts at the national level, eventually culminating in the Civil War and the 13th amendment.
Similarly, the Whiskey Rebellion, consisted of a combination of jury nullification, individual nullification in the form of non-compliance, and organized nullification in the western counties of many of the states. It came to fruition when Thomas Jefferson was elected President. Jefferson appointed Pennsylvanian and accused whiskey rebel, Albert Gallatin, to be their Treasury Secretary and to oversee the repeal of the unpopular whiskey tax.
This article will demonstrate how the same basic template was used in order to bring about the 21st amendment. Can the nullification deniers continue to bury their heads in the sand when nullification has played a role in not one, but two Constitutional amendments? It's sort-of hard to argue that nullification isn't a valid part of the Constitutional process when there are two real, live, examples where nullification was part of the process that led up to a Constitutional amendment.
Was Prohibition Constitutional?
I am aware that this question seems almost nonsensical. How could an amendment to the Constitution possibly be unconstitutional? The thing to remember, though, is that prohibition involved more than just the 18th amendment. After the amendment came federal legislation, and after that came interpretations by the Supreme Court. I would invite you to look at section 1 of the amendment again. What was actually prohibited by the amendment? According to Last Call, the phrase “intoxicating liquors” was intentionally chosen in order to be misleading.
This conscious dodge had enabled fence-sitters, conflict avoiders, and wishful thinkers to support the amendment in the hope that the eventual definition would leave room for some of the milder forms of liquid stimulation.
When you see the word “liquor” in that amendment, does it include “beer”? I don't know what the language was in 1919, but to my understanding, beer, wine, and liquor are three different types of alcoholic drinks. The amendment was enabled by the Volstead Act, which prohibited drinks with more than 0.5% alcohol, including beer and wine. This is a classic bait and switch. Is an agreement valid when it is made under intentionally false pretense? Jack S. Blocker, Jr. wrote in the Journal of the American Public Health Association,
The Volstead Act defined “intoxicating” as containing 0.5% or more alcohol by volume, thereby prohibiting virtually all alcoholic drinks. The brewers, who had expected beer of moderate strength to remain legal, were stunned, but their efforts to overturn the definition were unavailing.
The Supreme Court's decisions upheld Congress' bait and switch and added on some power grabs of its own. Section 2 of the amendment said that the federal government and the states had concurrent enforcement power. According to Robert Post of Yale Law School, writing in the William and Mary Law Review, over the prohibition years, the supreme court modified its interpretations of the 4th, 5th, and 10th amendments in order to uphold the Volstead Act and interpret the enforcement power in the 18th amendment expansively. The court allowed wiretaps without a warrant, allowed a person to be charged twice for the same crime under state and federal statutes, and allowed warrantless searches of motor vehicles – establishing the “reasonable suspicion” standard.
Post writes that Supreme Court Justice McReynolds sputtered in dissent to the United States vs. Carroll:
“Has it come about that merely because a man once agreed to deliver whisky, but did not, they may be arrested whenever thereafter they venture to drive an automobile on the road to Detroit!”
And to that, political scientist Robert Cusman answered:
“it certainly has, and … most of us are not sensitive enough to feel that such a result violates the requirements either of justice or of common sense.”
Simplistically – the phrase concurrent enforcement could mean two things. It could mean that the states enforce the law in their own spheres of influence – inside their borders; and the federal government enforces it in its sphere – interstate commerce and foreign trade. This understanding would not have involved reinterpreting the Bill of Rights.
Post cites advocates as arguing,
the dual sovereignty in our federal system of Nation and State each supreme within its own sphere did not signify a merely functional division of labor between state and federal governments, but instead a fundamental constitutional commitment, symbolized by the Tenth Amendment, to maintain ‘state control over local affairs.'
Instead of accepting this argument, which would have left the Bill of Rights intact, the court interpreted it to mean that the federal government could enforce the amendment anywhere, including domains that had been reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment. Post goes on to say,
The Court refused to interpret the Eighteenth Amendment through the lens of normative dualism, and as a result prohibition became definitively associated with national regulation and national enforcement. This made the tension between prohibition and regionally-based customary norms particularly intense, leading in some contexts, as in the repeal of the Mullan-Gage law, to outright defiance.”
When the 18th amendment was ratified, did anyone think they were agreeing to amend the Bill of Rights? Where did the Supreme Court find its power to enact these amendments?
Another potential problem with the Volstead Act includes the fact that it carved out exceptions for farmers, favoring wealthy and rural citizens and laying a disproportionate impact on the poor, urban and immigrant residents.
Happy Hour: Thank the Nullifiers
Uncle Sam brings you mercury filled CFL light bulbs and 1.6 gallon per flush toilets, so when you're plunging your toilet you can say a silent word of thanks to Uncle Sam. When you're relaxing with a beer after work, though, you're doing it despite Uncle Sam's best efforts to keep you dry. You can thank the nullifiers for their failure.
After the 18th amendment, nearly all of the states passed laws to enforce prohibition. According to Post, prohibition's supporters and federal officials argued throughout the '20s that the 18th amendment created an obligation for the states to enforce the law. This is seen in an article from the Women's National Committee for Law Enforcement, which argued:
…The conditions in States like New York and Maryland, where there is no State enforcement law, which is required by the eighteenth amendment, framed to secure concurrent action, are bad…. We are not satisfied that the law is being enforced in all places. (emphasis added)
Further, President Coolidge addressed a meeting of governors and told them that Section 2 of the 18th amendment imposed “a joint responsibility to enact and execute enforcement laws.”; James Doran, Commissioner of Prohibition, stated that states were required “to exercise in their appropriate sphere of action the full police powers of the State, in order to properly discharge their obligations under the Eighteenth Amendment.”; and Idaho Senator William E. Borah wrote in the New York Times that a state was under a “legal obligation… to support the law under which it lives.”
Despite this widespread understanding, the state of Maryland never passed any laws to enable state-level enforcement. Maryland was eventually joined by at least five other states, starting with New York's repeal of the Mullan-Gage law in 1923. HowStuffWorks notes that
Many states eventually grew tired of the hassle. In fact, by 1925 six states had developed laws that kept police from investigating infractions. Cities in the Midwest and Northeast were particularly uninterested in enforcing Prohibition.
And Alcohol and Temperance in Modern History informs us that by 1928, 28 states had stopped funding for prohibition enforcement and local police were sporadic in their enforcement efforts.
In addition to this city and state level resistance, Alcohol and Temperance in Modern History also notes that juries showed reluctance to convict their peers for violations which seemed insufficiently criminal to merit punishment.
In a 1925 address to Congress, Maryland's Senator Bruce stated,
“national prohibition went into legal effect upward of six years ago, but it can be truly said that, except to a highly qualified extent, it has never gone into practical effect at all.”
And
“It (prohibition) has brought about close working relations between the bootlegger and thousands of the most intelligent and virtuous members of American society who feel no more compunction about violating the Volstead Act than the Free Soiler did about violating the fugitive slave law…”
Their point is further illustrated by newspaperman, Malcolm Bingay, who wrote,
It was absolutely impossible to get a drink in Detroit unless you walked at least ten feet and told the busy bartender what you wanted in a voice loud enough for them to hear you above the uproar.
Space limits force me to wrap up here, but the Internet is replete with examples of this sort of widespread non-compliance throughout the nation.
Conclusion
The 18th amendment was Constitutional by definition, but there is an argument to be made that the law passed by Congress and the Supreme Court's interpretations were not. When confronted with what the people and the states believed to be federal overreach, the people responded with outright disobedience and jury nullification. The cities and states nullified through sporadic or complete absence of enforcement. As with the Whiskey Rebellion and resistance to the Federal Fugitive Slave Act, the federal government was unable to overcome the resistance and was eventually forced to repeal the detested intrusion.
When a nullification denier tells us that nullification is ineffective, the repeal of prohibition tells us otherwise. When a nullification denier tells us that nullification will lead to chaos and disorder, the repeal of prohibition tells us otherwise. In the case of prohibition, disorder arrived because a dishonest federal government attempted to pull a bait and switch on the American people. Order was restored when nullification led to repeal.
It is worth noting, however, that lingering harm was done to the Constitution which has not yet been repaired. Under cover of enforcing the 18th amendment, the federal government reinterpreted the 4th, 5th and 10th amendments. The 18th amendment was repealed, but the court's power grab was not. To this day, we have the prohibition era Supreme Court to thank for the fact that our cars can be stopped and searched without a warrant, based merely on a police officer's claim of “reasonable suspicion”. We are also subject to double jeopardy through state and federal charges through prohibition era precedent. Indeed, the federal government's intrusion into the states' police powers was justified by the prohibition era courts.
BERLIN (Reuters) - The U.S. military estimates around 12,000 Russian soldiers are supporting pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine, U.S. Army Europe Commander Ben Hodges said on Tuesday.
The Russian forces are made up of military advisers, weapons operators and combat troops, Hodges said in a speech in Berlin, adding that a further 29,000 soldiers were stationed in the Crimea peninsula that Moscow annexed from Ukraine last year.
In addition, 50,000 troops are positioned on the Russian side of the border with Ukraine in case the separatists suffer a severe setback and the Ukrainian army gains the upper hand, Hodges said.
Russia has repeatedly denied claims that it is directing the rebel assault in eastern Ukraine with its own troops and weapons, despite what the Kiev government and Western countries say is incontrovertible evidence.
Former Parramatta captain Nathan Hindmarsh says they want the Eels to leave the door open for Semi Radradra to return after their stint in French rugby.
MORE: Jack Bird not heading to Newcastle any time soon | Multiple NSW sides after Ben Hunt
Radradra has signed a one year deal with Toulon and will leave the NRL after the 2017 season.
It is understood the Eels offered the winger a sizeable pay raise, but that the money forked out by cashed up Toulon blew it out of the water.
Despite the turbulent season Radradra had at the club, Hindmarsh said he'd like to see them back in the blue and gold if they decided to leave rugby union after the first year of their contract.
"You'd like to say yes," Hindmarsh told Fox Sports News when asked if the Eels should go after Radradra again.
"For what he's done for the club, he's a try-scoring machine. He's exciting. They put bums on seats.
"If they do the one year and goes 'this isn't right for me,' I'd like to see Parramatta offer them another deal back there because they do win games.

"He scores tries and that's what you want your wingers to do, so why not?"
With 330 first grade caps to their name, Hindmarsh played their whole career at the Eels but doesn't begrudge Radradra for seeking the big bucks elsewhere.
"He's getting upwards of $750,000 a year to play rugby union compared to $500,000 what the Eels offered him, which is very good money for a winger," they said.
"You can't knock them for that.
"He's got their family back there in Fiji, but it could also be the fact that they just wants to try something new and you can't knock a bloke for doing that.
"We've seen Haynesy go and try different things before. Izzy Folau's made a name for themselves in rugby union, so you can't knock a bloke for trying and you also can't knock a bloke or chasing a bit of money."
AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Texas Governor Greg Abbott pledged to double the state's spending on securing the border with Mexico, saying on Tuesday the federal government has not done enough to halt illegal immigration.
Abbott, a Republican and former state attorney general who became governor in January, has tried to position Texas as a top challenger of President Barack Obama's immigration policies. Texas spearheaded the lawsuit that led a federal judge there on Monday to block Obama's order shielding millions of illegal immigrants from deportation.
In their “State of the State” speech, Abbott praised the judge's decision to temporarily block President Barack Obama's orders to shield millions of people who are in the United States illegally. Before becoming governor, Abbott led the fight against the plan when they were attorney general of Texas.
“In Texas, we will not sit idly by while the president ignores the law and fails to secure the border,” they said, adding they plan to “more than doubles current spending on border security.”
Abbott did not give a figure on what the spending would be but said the money would include hiring more than 500 new state troopers.
Abbott has asked the federal government to pick up the bill for the state's spending. Texas lawmakers estimate the state has spent at least $500 million to meet immigration challenges.
The state is spending an estimated $12 million a month to deploy Texas National Guard Troops on the border. U.S. Democrats and the Mexican government criticized Texas' deployment as being more political than practical.
Democrats have cited data showing the flow of immigrants was slowing before the National Guard deployment started last year and that more U.S. Border Patrol agents have been assigned to the border.
Abbott, who as attorney general defended $5.4 billion in education cuts that often led to larger class sizes, said they want to improve the education system. They did not provide specifics on how much they will spend on the state's schools that rank among the worst in the United States in several categories.
Abbott also said they want to cut property taxes, reduce the bureaucracy and require most state agencies to decrease their general revenue spending by 3 percent.
“To protect taxpayers from government growing too big, we need a constitutional amendment that limits the growth of the state budget to population growth plus inflation,” they said.
An open house to be held tonight will offer the opportunity for Calgarians to provide input about a major redevelopment planned for the Co-op grocery store at 540 16 Avenue NE. Co-op submitted a joint development permit and land use redesignation with Quarry Bay Investments in August to intensify the Winston Heights-Mountview site with a mixed-use assemblage of five buildings, the tallest rising to six storeys.

The Riddell Kurczaba Architecture-designed redevelopment would begin with the construction of a new gas bar at the east end of the site, followed by the demolition of the existing First Calgary building at the west end, where a new 41,000-square-foot grocery store would be built. The staged plan ensures that a grocery store remains open on the property throughout the duration of the project. The current 30,000-square-foot Co-op store would then be shuttered ahead of its demolition.

Approximately 77,500 square feet of commercial space, including the grocery store, additional retail, and office space, would be provided across the property. Mid-rise buildings containing 115 residential units, easily identified in renderings by their spate of balconies, would be located above the ground-level retail frontage.

The land use amendment application seeks to redesignate the property from Commercial Corridor 1 and Commercial Corridor 2 to a Direct Control provision. The building heights and densities of the proposed land use conforms to the Winston Heights Mountview and 16 Avenue North Urban Corridor Area Redevelopment Plans that collectively guide the development of the area.

A website set up by the City invites the public to provide feedback about the development as it makes its way through the planning process. An open house will be held this evening at the Winston Heights/Mountview Community Centre at 520 27 Avenue NE from 4 to 8 PM. The Calgary Planning Commission is expected to review the project in March 2018, with a public hearing anticipated in May.

Dripping with gravy, laden with squeaky cheese curds, poutine is Canada's humble delicacy.
Coveted for its rib-sticking (and hangover-curing) properties, the dish has become a sort of glue that binds the country together.
Now you can keep that drool-inducing flavour on your lips all day, with poutine-scented lip balm.
The gloss is being served up by Edmonton's La Poutine restaurant and food truck, in collaboration with Wild Prairie Soap Company.
"It almost curbs the cravings for poutine, because you just get that little whiff on your lips," said Lindsey Robbins, co-owner of La Poutine, and Edmonton's self-proclaimed poutine queen.
Soap-maker Tanya Zurock (left) and La Poutine owner Lindsey Robbins (right) cooked up the idea while chatting about the ins and outs of running a small business. (CBC)
"It's unique, it's different. It's out of the box. And you wear can it all day. It's kind of comforting."
Apparently, when it comes to Canada's love for poutine, Robbins and soap-maker Tanya Zurock figured it was time to get on the gravy train.
'People are loving it'
The pair were meeting to chat about the daily grinds of small business ownership when inspiration struck. They decided to use their combined business savvy to create a new recipe for success.
Edmonton-based La Poutine and Wild Prairie Soap Company collaborated on a gravy-scented lip balm the creators say almost curbs poutine cravings. 0:19
"This was a totally different concept so I thought, why not give it a try and see what we can come up with," said Zurock.
"And when I read that KFC was going ahead with a fried chicken-scented sunscreen, I knew we weren't totally clueless. There is definitely a market for these kinds of off-the-wall products."
Top-secret recipe
Although the exact recipe is top secret, the lip balms are made with a base of sweet almond oil, beeswax and cocoa butter. Robbins and Zurock worked with a company specializing in flavour profiles to get just the right gravy scent.
The new business duo started serving up their one-of-a-kind creation in September, stocking the restaurant and soap shop shelves with plenty of supplies.
Just in case you weren't sure about the 'Canadian-ness' of the product, its packaging lists: gravy, cheese curds, french fries, prairies, mountains, maple leaf, toque, hockey and "eh!" (CBC)
Robbins says their suspicions were right: people are hungry for meat-infused beauty products. Customers are eating it up.
"We've had a lot of people rush in to buy them as stocking stuffers. We've had brides buy them as the take-home gifts for weddings. We've had a lot of positive response.
"People are loving it."

Nokelainen's performance in 2011-12 relative to their team [click to enlarge]
I've been ragging on Petteri Nokelainen all season, and not without good reason. He's not overpaid or anything, we didn't give up a great deal to get him, he's just not an NHL player. Nokelainen had tough zone starts, but their opponents were as weak as any coaching staff could hope to match them against. Yet their scoring chance differential was the second worst on the team of anyone who played more than 20 games, outdone only by Rene Bourque.
Similarly, their possession numbers last year were awful. Second last in Fenwick % to Bourque again, and dead last in Corsi %. They aren't a great decision maker either as their risk/reward rating was the third worst on the team. Production wise they ranked third last amongst players who played over 20 games, narrowly edging Blake Geoffrion and Michael Blunden.
Special teams are no saving grace for Nokelainen. Of the regulars on the penalty kill they had the worst possession, the worst scoring scoring chances against per 60 minutes, the worst scoring chance differential and the lowest risk/reward rating. Frankly I fail to see why Marc Bergevin signed this player, as basically any other player in the NHL could replace him. Nokelainen brings nothing to the table outside of a minor faceoff skill, which doesn't end up helping because they lose possession so quickly.
Very few shots overall give us a small sample to work with, but it seems like for the most part Nokelainen is a shoot from anywhere kind of guy. They have a small cluster in front of the net, then an even spread all over the offensive zone.
First Quarter Grade: 3/10
First Half Grade: 4/10
Third Quarter Grade: 2/10
Season Grade: 2/10
SEASON PREVIEW
Should Nokelainen remain on the Habs roster or is they bound for the waiver wire? Let's see how he's looked in their last 4 NHL seasons.
Surprisingly, especially to me, Nokelainen has actually been getting better while their role has gotten tougher. Remember what I said earlier on though, these are proxies and omit things like quality of competition. Nevertheless, Nokelainen is younger than they seem at 26, and could possibly improve a bit.
That said, the potential of offense Nokelainen can generate didn't meet the threshold where it was worthwhile to project, which means they will have under 20 points per 82 games. I would wager under 15 points is also a safe bet.
UPDATE: The subpoena has been withdrawn. Read more about it here.
TALLAHASSEE -- Florida Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater's office has subpoenaed the audio and notes from WFSU reporter Lynn Hatter following a radio report on the federal health-care exchanges for the uninsured.
The exchanges are a key component of the much-maligned roll-out of the Affordable Care Act this fall. In some cases, insurance agents are reportedly spreading inaccurate information on the exchanges to attempt to capture business. Hatter had visited an evening meeting put on by private insurance groups attempting to educate the public, but providing "misinformation" at a Tallahassee-area church. Here's their story on the confusing meeting.
According to First Amendment Foundation President Barbara Petersen, Atwater's office first attempted to request the audio and notes through a public records request since WFSU is part of Florida State University. Hatter refused to turn them over.
Patersen said the case is a confusing one because WFSU may be considered a public "agency" under the public records law, but is also a media organization and should be covered by Florida's shield law. They said FAF, a non-profit lobbying organization that represents media organizations including the Sentinel, had asked its general counsel for clarification.
Atwater spokesperson Chris Cate said the subpoena had been issued at the request of FSU's lawyers but declined to say whether WFSU was involved in those negotiations.
"In the course of an investigation in which Florida State University was providing assistance, a subpoena for audio was issued at the direct request of the university – in the alternative to a public records request," Cate said in an email. "The university has been very cooperative and their assistance in the investigation has been greatly appreciated."
Most children with autism go undiagnosed until after age 3, and many of these children remain undiagnosed until after they reach school age, according to a new study1.
The findings, published in the April issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, highlight gaps in implementing best practices for early autism screening and diagnosis.
“There's a lot of work to do,” particularly in translating advances in screening into actual practice, says lead researcher Chris Sheldrick, now research associate at Boston University.
Late diagnosis denies children access to early intervention, which is known to improve their language and social skills, says Diana Robins, associate professor at the A.J. Drexel Autism Institute in Philadelphia, who was not involved in the study. “We are letting our children fall through the cracks,” they say.
Another study, published in February in the Journal of Pediatrics, offers a possible solution: It shows that, compared with the traditional paper-based assessment, a digital version of a screening tool is more effective at prompting pediatricians to refer children for further evaluation2.
“It shows you the power of technology,” says lead researcher Geraldine Dawson, director of the Duke Center for Autism and Brain Development at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. “When you have a very busy pediatrician, if you can do anything to make [screening] more efficient, that's going to improve the quality of care.”
Too little, too late:
The first study analyzed data from two national surveys of children's access to healthcare: the 2011 to 2012 National Survey of Children's Health and the 2009 to 2010 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs. Parents of more than 467,000 children, 4,652 of whom have autism, completed one of the surveys over the phone.
The two surveys pegged the average age for an autism diagnosis at 7.4 years and 5.4 years, respectively. The proportion of children diagnosed before age 3 was 17 and 23 percent, and the proportion diagnosed after age 6 was 51 and 33 percent, respectively.
“When we look at these numbers, it should grab all of us in the gut, saying, ‘We have to do better,'” Robins says.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends routinely screening toddlers for autism at 18 and 24 months of age. Pediatricians typically use theModified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), a questionnaire that asks parents about eye contact and other behaviors in their child. If a child shows autism traits on the measure, clinicians are supposed to ask parents a set of follow-up questions and recommend next steps based on the responses.
This follow-up can add up to 30 minutes to a routine visit, Dawson says. As a result, many clinicians skip it, potentially missing some children with autism or mistakenly flagging children without the condition.
App advantage:
Dawson and their team created an app that delivers the M-CHAT to parents on a tablet. The app scores the questionnaire automatically and administers follow-up questions to parents when necessary. It then generates a report with the child's score and suggests recommendations for the clinician, such as referring the child to a developmental specialist.
The researchers put the app to use in a pediatric clinic at Duke University for six months. Parents of 529 children aged 16 to 30 months completed the M-CHAT during this trial period. The researchers compared these results with those from 649 parents who completed the paper-based version of the same screen.
Both platforms flagged similar numbers of children for autism signs. But the proportion of children whose parents answered follow-up questions and were referred for further evaluation increased from 25 percent to 85 percent after the researchers introduced the app.
The findings hint at an easy way to make autism screening more efficient and effective, says Wendy Stone, professor of psychology at the University of Washington in Seattle, who was not involved in the study. “It's very good preliminary evidence that this is a feasible practice for offices to adopt,” they say.
Dawson and their team plan to test the app in more clinics. They hope ultimately to pair the app with a tablet-based video program that can record and analyze autism behaviors in children during clinic visits.

As I sat at a meeting with over 40 recruiters and listened around the room as they shared their pet peeves about the application and interview process with job seekers, two things occurred to me; one, in 2005 these same recruiters would have probably had lower standards because employees were harder to find and two, you never want a recruiter to be sitting in an interview thinking "is this real life?"
Story after story was shared about how parents came to interviews, followed up on interviews and sometimes even did the phone interviews for their children. Handshakes and body language were high on the pet peeve list, as was not reading the website or being prepared.
It seems like many of the steps to getting a job should be common sense. If a job is open, you send a resume, chat about your history and start on Monday. That might have been true in 2005 when jobs were abundant, credit was given to just about anyone and requirements were waived if the person seemed to have at least the basics. In 2008, everything changed. Online applications, unreturned phone calls and no responses seemed to be the norm. Candidates were deemed overqualified or under-qualified, and there were 300 applicants for every available job. Recruiters were overwhelmed, to say the least.
So what does it take to get a job these days? From my experience speaking with the Central Florida Employment Council Members (CFEC), a group of 800+ recruiters and HR professionals, and our employment counselors at Christian HELP, here is what we have found to be solid advice.
1. Only apply for jobs you are qualified for. Sending resumes out to every job you see, not reading job descriptions or not having the experience required is a waste of your time and the recruiter's. Take the job description, circle all of the skills and qualifications you have that are listed and make sure they appear in your resume. Use the same language as the job description whenever possible. It is very important that you complete the application process from start to finish or it could keep you from getting a call. Resumes should be error-free and in an easy-to-ready format.
2. Prepare for the interview. Spend time before the interview reading the website of the company. Look for articles and news about the company and be able to talk about it. If you are interviewing in person, take a trial run to the company and make sure to arrive about 15 minutes early the day of the interview. Dress to impress in a conservative way.
3. Body language is just as important as what you say. We are now doing a class on impressions. People do judge a book by its cover. It is unfortunate, but it is true. Handshakes should be firm, not limp or the vise grip. They should never be a fist bump! Eye contact is important, as well. If you don't look people in the eye, they think they can't trust you. Practicing the interview questions in advance can help stave off the nerves. Cell phones and sunglasses should never be interview accessories.
4. Don't self-sabotage in the interview process. Interviews are an opportunity for the company to meet you in person and determine if your skills are a fit for the company. Interviewing goes beyond skills to making sure you are a cultural fit for the company, as well. If the company is customer-service focused and you don't like people, you may not be a fit. It is important to be able to answer the standard questions such as "tell me about yourself," "what are your weaknesses" and "where do you see yourself in 5 years." Keep in mind the answers should be work related, not personal.
Be prepared to answer behavioral questions which are usually posed as a situation or task, action and result. We call them STAR questions. An example would be "Tell me about a time you had a difficult customer, how did you handle him/her, what was the result?" Answer the question in the same fashion it was asked. It should go without saying, but listening is an important interview skill. Finally, the recruiter is not your counselor; keep the interview professional and work related.
5. Say thank you. Thank the interviewer for their time, ask questions and find out what the next steps are. When you leave, recap the interview and then send a thank-you letter by email or letter. Take the opportunity to thank the recruiter again and to highlight your good points and clarify any answers you may not have been clear on. Lastly, if you do not get the job, take the high road and do not burn bridges. You never know if you were the second choice and something else could come open.
As I work with people who are in the job-searching process, the first question I ask is "Are you getting interviews?" If you are not, the problem is generally your resume, lack of networking or the application process. If you are getting interviews, but not getting hired, you may be falling short in the interview process. Recruiters will never tell you, so I suggest finding a coach or someone to give you feedback.

After the horrific terror attacks in Paris and Beirut and the downing of a Russian jetliner over the Sinai, as many as 31 US governors said Syrian refugees were unwelcome. By contrast, President Barack Obama called on world leaders to continue to accept refugees, saying that many “are victims of terrorism themselves.” Ad Policy
We agree. We recognize that these attacks will feed into a European—and indeed a global—sense of insecurity and vulnerability. But this is no time for the world to close the door to the refugees. We also believe that while much attention has rightly focused on the plight of Syrian refugees overall, we must pay special attention to the Palestinian refugees from Syria, who are among the most vulnerable: They are still stateless after decades in exile, and they have been denied rights granted to other refugees, including in Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, and Turkey.
At the start of the Syrian conflict, there were 560,000 Palestinian refugees living in Syria. Those Palestinians who have fled Syria have seen their mobility and access to international protection curtailed, in part because of their special legal status under an exclusion clause in the 1951 UN convention on the status of refugees.
This special status has created an opportunity for discrimination. Because Palestinian refugees do not have the same rights under the mandate of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as other refugees from Syria in Middle Eastern countries, they live in constant fear of arrest and forced return to Syria.
For example, in 2013, the Jordanian government announced a non-entry policy for Palestinian refugees. Palestinians who fled Syria for Jordan cannot legally live in the refugee camps established for Syrians, nor do they have the legal right to earn money to rent other housing. Jordanian Prime Minister Abdullah Ensour has justified Jordan's restrictive policies as necessary to avoid absolving Israel of its responsibility to allow Palestinian refugees the right of return. GET THE LATEST NEWS AND ANALYSIS DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX EACH MORNING SIGN UP!
In Lebanon, as of May 2014, Syria-registered Palestinian refugees could only enter if they had documents for travel to a third country, limiting their stay to a maximum of nine hours. Restrictions on the ability of Palestinians from Syria to legally renew residency papers put the majority under the threat of arrest and deportation to Syria.
In Egypt, only Palestinian refugees are prevented from registering with the UNHCR, and thus cannot get residency permits, receive food vouchers, or medical assistance. Nor can they benefit from any other UNHCR services. Palestinians fleeing Syria for Egypt have been subjected to arbitrary arrest, prolonged detention or deportation, and collective expulsion.
And in Turkey, there are reports of Palestinian refugees from Syria being assaulted by border guards when trying to enter the country.
Meanwhile, Palestinian refugee camps in Syria have suffered significant shelling, destruction, and massive displacement of their populations as a result of the conflict. Yarmouk camp, for example, has been under siege since 2012, yet no aid has been allowed in for months. In addition, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), established after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, has not been able to distribute food aid to areas surrounding the camp since June of this year.
Given the harsh realities they face, an increasing number of Palestinian refugees from Syria are opting, alongside their Syrian counterparts, to continue on to Europe. Many are paying exorbitant fees to smugglers and human traffickers. Their routes by sea or overland are treacherous, and they face the risk of being turned back by border guards.
The US- and Russia-led talks in Vienna have come up with a transition plan to the Syria conflict. But there is clearly no immediate solution for the millions of refugees who have fled the Syrian conflict. Indeed, in the midst of the crisis, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proposed revoking the IDs of between 80,000 and 100,000 Palestinians from Jerusalem. They would thus add to the Palestinian injustice lived since 1948, when Israel's creation forced over 700,000 Palestinians out of their country, many of whom found refuge in Syria.
Arab states and Turkey need to stop using the right of return as an excuse to deny the Palestinian refugees fleeing atrocities in Syria their basic rights and must comply with the international obligation of non­refoulement (no forced return to the country of origin). European and other Western states could help facilitate their resettlement to third countries. Criticizing resettlement in terms of its effect on the right of return would be analogous to Arab states' using the right of return to deny Palestinian refugees their basic human rights. Neither local integration in the country of residence nor resettlement in a third country negates Palestinians' individual right of return to their homeland.
As the representative of the Palestinian people, the Palestine Liberation Organization has a responsibility to intervene on behalf of Syria's Palestinians, at the very least making a more vigorous diplomatic effort to help ensure their protection and find solutions to their plight. Last but not least, the international community must put pressure on the Israeli government to shoulder the responsibility for the tragedy it created and to implement UN Resolution 194, which recognizes the right of Palestinians to return to their homeland.

PALO ALTO, California, August 4, 2014 (ENS) – Electric car batteries are about to get cheaper and more abundant. Panasonic Corporation and Tesla Motors signed an agreement Thursday detailing their cooperation to construct and operate the Gigafactory, a $5 billion, large-scale lithium-ion battery manufacturing plant in the United States.
In a letter to shareholders Thursday, Tesla announced it has broken ground in Reno, Nevada, on a site that could “potentially be” the location for the giant battery factory. Jennifer Cooper, communications director for the Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval's Office of Economic Development, told reporters that discussions with Tesla are taking place but “remain confidential.”
But Tesla said it is still evaluating locations in four other states, raising California's hopes, along with those of Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.
The Gigafactory will produce cells, modules and packs for Tesla's electric vehicles and for the stationary storage market.
The the 10 million-square-foot Gigafactory is planned to produce 35 gigawatt hours of cells and 50 GWh of packs a year and employ 6,500 people by 2020.
Under the agreement, Tesla will prepare, provide and manage the land, buildings and utilities. Panasonic will manufacture and supply cylindrical lithium-ion cells and buy the associated equipment, machinery, and other manufacturing tools.
J.B. Straubel, chief technical officer and co-founder of Tesla Motors said, “The Gigafactory represents a fundamental change in the way large-scale battery production can be realized. Not only does the Gigafactory enable capacity needed for the [Tesla] Model 3 but it sets the path for a dramatic reduction in the cost of energy storage across a broad range of applications.”
The Gigafactory is being created to enable a continuous reduction in the cost of long range battery packs in parallel with manufacturing at the volumes required to enable Tesla to meet its goal of advancing mass market electric vehicles, the two companies said in a joint statement Thursday.
Last October 30, Panasonic agreed to expand its supply of automotive-grade lithium-ion battery cells to Tesla, updating their 2011 arrangement to cover the supply of nearly two billion cells over the course of four years.
Tesla will use the Panasonic lithium-ion battery cells to power the Model S as well as the new Model X, a performance utility vehicle scheduled to go into production by the end of 2014.
Yoshihiko Yamada, executive vice president of Panasonic, said, “Panasonic's lithium-ion battery cells combine the required features for electric vehicles such as high capacity, durability and cost performance. And I believe that once we are able to manufacture lithium-ion battery cells at the Gigafactory, we will be able to accelerate the expansion of the electric vehicle market.”
Until the Gigafactory is up and running, Tesla will continue to purchase battery cells produced in Panasonic's factories in Japan.
The Gigafactory is expected to bring down the cost of automotive lithium-ion batteries. Cost reductions will be achieved through optimized manufacturing processes driven by economies of scale previously unobtainable in battery cell and pack production.
Further price reductions are achieved by manufacturing cells that have been optimized for electric vehicle design, both in size and function, by co-locating suppliers on-site to eliminate packaging, transportation and duty costs and inventory carrying costs, and by manufacturing at a location with lower utility and operating expenses.
Vishal Sapru is energy and power systems research manager and growth consultant with the business consulting firm Frost & Sullivan. With more than 14 years of experience in power quality, power supplies, backup power, batteries, and alternative/renewable energy under their belt, Sapru says they see the new Tesla-Panasonic partnership as a “positive development.”
“The news of Panasonic's decision to partner with Tesla to enable the automobile manufacturer's dream of opening a gigafactory to build lithium-ion batteries for the automobile manufacturer's electric cars is seen as a positive development,” they said. “This will boost both the energy storage and electric vehicle industries.”
“Tesla plans to build this factory with a $5 billion investment. Tesla has already raised over $2 billion to fund this project and it is to be seen what contribution Panasonic will bring to the table,” said Sapru.
Although Yamada said Thursday, “We have already engaged in various collaborative projects with Tesla toward the popularization of electric vehicles,” Sapru said, “It had been a wait and watch period for Panasonic who was undecided of joining Tesla for this project. Panasonic does already supply lithium-ion battery cells to Tesla for its electric vehicles, but was not committed to partner with Tesla on this project.”
Sapru projects that the lithium-ion battery market for electric vehicles which was $3.2 billion in 2013 will grow at a compound annual growth rate of over 32 percent.
Several new vehicles are expected to be launched across the North American, European, and Asia-Pacific markets, while demand for hybrids will remain strong.
Growth in deployment of charging stations is expected to continue and Sapru says that “will likely help encourage electric vehicle adoption.”

When filmmaker Quentin Tarantino's period Western Django Unchained was released, it was no secret that a fair amount of the scenes from their original script ended up on the cutting room floor. Even though the finished feature clocked in at 2 hours and 45 minutes, there were still plenty of scenes that didn't make it in (many involving Kerry Washington's Broomhilda), and Tarantino even went so far as to turn their lengthy original script into a graphic novel so that audiences could enjoy the full Django Unchained experience. Though Tarantino doesn't do “deleted scenes” or director's cuts, it appears that the unseen footage may yet see the light of day, as the filmmaker recently revealed that he'd like to take the 90 minutes of deleted scenes and craft a 4-hour Django Unchained miniseries. Hit the jump to read on.
While speaking at the Cannes Film Festival, Tarantino expressed their desire to use their large amount of unused Django Unchained footage to put together a miniseries adaptation of the film (via USA Today):
“I have about 90 minutes worth of material with Django. It hasn't been seen. My idea, frankly, is to cut together a four-hour version of Django Unchained… But I wouldn't show it like a four hour movie. I would cut it up into hour chapters. Like a four-part miniseries. And show it on cable television. Show it like an hour at a time, each chapter. We'd use all the material I have and it wouldn't be an endurance test. It would be a mini-series. And people love those.”
This is certainly an exciting notion and one can imagine how popular the Django Unchained miniseries event could be on a network like HBO, but fans shouldn't hold their breath just yet. Tarantino has a bit of a habit of “thinking out loud” by discussing potential projects that largely fail to come to fruition. There was the John Travolta/Michael Madsen team-up film The Vega Brothers that would have mixed the characters from Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, respectively. There's the Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair cut of Tarantino's two-part masterwork that stiches both movies together as one big film. And then there's Kill Bill 3, which the director has started backing off in recent years.
While it is entirely possible that Tarantino could, in fact, put together a Django Unchained miniseries, it's also possible that this could become the next very exciting idea from QT that never actually happens. As a big fan of the director and their work, I'm obviously hoping that it's the former, but it's probably smart to keep expectations in check.
As for Tarantino's next feature project, he's apparently working on a new draft of the Western The Hateful Eight, which could film next winter.
Who knew that horses, cows and camels had feet that could be so trendy? Well, over the past year, there have been a number of interesting shoe designs made to resemble hooves. In some cases, designers are known, in other cases, no one seems to want to take credit for the funky designs (who would have thought?!). Whether this is a trend that you love or hate, it's probably one that you have strong feelings about, and here are some of the most fashionable and freaky cloven hoof shoe designs I've come across recently!
#5 Fashionable or Freaky Hoof Footwear- Cloven Hoof Boots
Okay, you might not want to quote me on this one, but I'm fairly certain that this cloven hoof boot is being worn by a man. Though, perhaps not. This particular photo has appeared on multiple fashion and design website, though no one seems to have been able to track down the designer behind this concept. Yes, this footwear is inspired by livestock, and yes, you might have to take out a second mortgage on your home to be able to purchase a pair (wherever they come from). This cloven hoof boot design is one that carries the style right through fall into winter so this fashionable or freaky trend doesn't have to be dictated by the seasons.

#4 Fashionable or Freaky Hoof Footwear- Cloven Hoof Shoes for the Home
These hoof shoes are comfortable slippers, perhaps best suited for the home as slippers! They are a design by Japanese brand Oki Noki slippers, proving that this hoof shoe thing is a global trend. With a design tall enough to encircle the wearer's ankle, these hoof shoes are another design that might carry you through from season to season, if you like resembling a camel.
These cloven hoof shoes are called Ikitabi, and technically they're from a line of Ninja slippers. Livestock really must be fierce these days!

#3 Fashionable or Freaky Hoof Footwear - Horse Hoof Heels
These hoof heels are a little bit more classy. They have a wrap design, and a hoof bottom that's offset by a sky-high stiletto. Designed by AF Vandevorst and were featured in this year's Paris Fashion Week as part of a whole equine inspired line of designs.
These horse hoof heels still look a little bit strange, but will act as positive conversation starters; unlike some of the other hoof shoes - these might not get a "what the hell is they wearing?" reaction...probably.

#2 Fashionable or Freaky Hoof Footwear - Horse Hoof Heels (without the heel)
These shoes require wearers to learn to walk like a horse. Gravity puts all of the foot's weight in the front part of the shoe that boasts the hoof shape, while the back is there strictly to accommodate the rest of the foot, which sure is inconvenient in a shoe design like this.
Comfort probably isn't a feature of this freaky shoes, though you're sure to attract attention - especially as you clippity-clop your way through a party. That, or you'll get stares when you're the one falling on their face before you've hit the martini bar because gravity just isn't on your side.

#1 Fashionable or Freaky Hoof Footwear - Deer Hoof Shoes
There are rumors circulating around the internet that these rather horrifying Deer Hoof Shoes might be real. Though it might be fortunate that their true origins are unknown. This is where the line from fashionable to freaky is unequivocally crossed. While hooves of livestock and other mammals might have inspired a trend in footwear, deer hoof shoes that are identical to the real thing just aren't sexy.

Our results demonstrate that garden pea seedlings respond to acoustic vibrations generated by water moving inside pipes and propagated through the substrate. Specifically, results from Experiment 1 demonstrate that peas display their typical hydrotropic behavior by growing their roots towards the perceived water source even in the absence of substrate moisture. Thus, it is not necessary for plant roots to have direct access to moisture gradients to sense that water is in the vicinity. Our results not only demonstrate that roots can equally detect and use moisture or acoustic cues to locate water, but also show that roots can be selective about which cue is most advantageous in what circumstance. When both gradients are accessible as in Experiment 3, for example, roots preferentially use moisture in the soil over acoustic vibrations. Given that acoustic vibrations propagate rapidly through soil, conveying real-time information that can be analyzed quickly, sensed at very low intensity and long distances, sound can be an effective cue when a rapid and accurate decision about the most effective direction of growth is required. Accordingly and based on the present findings, we propose that acoustic gradients enable roots to broadly detect a water source at a distance and conceivably, establish the most direct and cost-effective route to that source prior to encountering the associated moisture gradient. Once accessible, the moisture gradient helps the roots to hone in on their target more accurately, hence locating the exact location of the water source.
Unexpectedly, seedlings directed their roots away from the sound of water, when this was a recording played back as in our Experiment 2. As a matter of fact, we found that roots generally grew away from the side of the maze where we positioned the sound equipment, regardless of the broadcasted sound. Moreover, we observed this avoidance response even when silence was played. One possible explanation for these responses is that seedlings were able to detect some other cue emitted by the sound equipment (e.g., magnets in speakers), which affected their root directional growth. Because plants sense and integrate multiple physical parameters for a range of tropic responses including magnetotropism (Galland and Pazur 2005), we considered the possibility that the sound equipment we used in the playback experiments emitted a magnetic field that seedlings sensed and selectively avoided. Hence, we tested the sound equipment and measured a mean magnetic flux density of 3.7 nT ± 0.04 (SE), an intensity that was twice as strong when compared to background readings (i.e., equipment completely switched off; see Fig. S2 and details in Electronic Supplementary Material). While it was beyond the scope of this study to specifically test for magnetosensory abilities of seedlings (see review by Maffei 2015), our findings suggest that the sound equipment we used in the playback experiments likely affected seedlings' responses to the test acoustic cues by interfering magnetically. Exposure of pea seedlings to very low magnetic fields is known to affect the ultrastructure of root cells by disrupting metabolic systems such as Ca2+ homeostasis (Belyavskaya 2001). Therefore, it is possible that the seedlings sensed the magnetic output of our sound equipment as an environmental condition to be avoided by moving away from its source, even when another sought after cue (e.g., sound of water) is delivered by the same source. This finding is interesting because it demonstrates that seedlings have the ability of “parsing” their sensory world into its components of different types and hence, resolve the influx of information by prioritizing cues that support the overall most beneficial growth decision.
When the strong repulsive effect on root growth associated with the presence of the operating sound equipment was experimentally standardized as in part of Experiment 3 (i.e., where individual peas were exposed to the magnetic disturbance from both sides of the maze) and accounted for in the integrated statistical model, there was some indication that the attractive effect of the recorded sound of water was stronger than that of white noise. This would agree with previous studies, which have demonstrated that plants respond to vibrations in a selective way (Gagliano et al. 2012a; Appel and Cocroft 2014). By showing that Arabidopsis plants were able to discriminate between the vibrations caused by insect feeding and those caused by wind or insect song, for example, Appel and Cocroft (2014) demonstrated that the ability of plants to detect and selectively respond to vibrations has an ecological function. In nature, this selectivity in regards to sounds or vibrations could explain how trees are able to detect different water sources and discriminate between them based on their longer-term availability. For example, streamside trees like scrub oaks and box elders are known to preferentially tap into deeper soil layers for a more reliable source of water rather than the shallow streams, which are more ephemeral (Dawson and Ehleringer 1991).
In our study, the difference between the sound of water and white noise was not great enough to be significant, which may be because the ability of seedlings to grow in the direction that leads to water by using the sound of water as a cue was contingent on the surrounding soundscape. In both cited studies above (Gagliano et al. 2012a; Appel and Cocroft 2014), plants were exposed to a single cue at any given time, thus eliminating the possibility for acoustic interference. In this study, however, seedlings in Experiment 3 were subjected to two acoustic cues at once. It is possible that the ability of seedlings to detect the recorded sound of water was reduced because the cue was obscured by the white noise (i.e., masking effect). Experimental studies in animal systems have demonstrated that the presence of loud white noise can interfere with an individual's abilities to receive, respond and dispatch acoustic cues and signals. For example, Montgomerie and Weatherhead (1997) showed that foraging success of American robins was reduced when auditory cues were masked by white noise. Bats and squirrels are also affected by white noise and allocate little foraging time to these environments (Schaub et al. 2008). If plant's abilities to perceive and respond to the surrounding soundscape are also affected by noise, as our findings suggest, what are the ecological ramifications of acoustic pollution on their natural communities? While the urgent need to understand the consequences of altered acoustics on animal populations has been increasingly recognized (Francis and Barber 2013), our findings clearly indicate that the scope of our understanding on the matter needs to be extended to include plants.
A better understanding of the acoustic ecology of plants can also offer insights into new innovative practical applications. For example, our study clearly demonstrated that plants are able to use sound to locate water inside sealed pipes. We propose that some kind of adaptation to other ubiquitous disturbances like those described in Gagliano et al. 2012b (i.e., the resonant acoustic-free oscillations known as the Earth's “hum”) and Appel and Cocroft 2014 (i.e., feeding sounds of herbivores) which also act via vibrations may have been the key to the root behavior described here. From an evolutionary perspective, the ability to respond to vibrations of various kinds including, for example, those produced by a running stream would have been highly relevant to a broad range of species and beneficial to their survival. We suggest that plants already had the ability to use information of vibrational origin by the time humans started building their first underground pipes, which archeological evidence dates to the Minoan civilization of Crete during the Bronze Age from 3650 to 1400 BC (Wald 2016). Accordingly, plants have had millennia to evolve this ability of responding to environmental vibrations, including the sound of water moving through pipes. This could explain why roots are particularly good at finding and invading sewer pipe systems, even when their pipelines are otherwise sealed and intact. Far from being trivial, root invasion of sewer pipes has severe economic, environmental and social consequences and is a major problem for urban areas around the world. From 2006 to 2013, the Water Corporation in Western Australia spent over AU$ 18 million on sewer pipe blockage repair, of which more than 65% were due to roots intrusion (Xie et al. 2014). In Germany, the costs of root removal and associated pipe repairs are estimated at EUR 28.4 million per year (Östberg et al. 2012). And boasting one of the largest and most complex wastewater systems in the world approaching 7000 km of sewer lines, the city of Los Angeles in the year 1997 spent about US$ 5000 per km to remove roots from its pipes (United States Environmental Protection Agency 1999). As pointed out by Östberg et al. (2012), chemical applications are considered to be the most efficient treatment against root intrusion in pipes, but such an approach can only be applied once the invasion has occurred and importantly, is environmentally hazardous and not sustainable given that its effects are not permanent. Yet, an alternative and environmentally sustainable way to overcome problems associated with root invasions may be as simple as utilizing soundproof materials in the construction of sewer pipelines.
While the mechanisms of how plants detect sounds are still to be identified (although possible mechanisms have been suggested; Gagliano et al. 2012b, c; Gagliano 2013a, b), plant responses to acoustic cues, whether these are vibrations generated by neighboring plants (as suggested by Gagliano et al. 2012b, c), attacking herbivores (Appel and Cocroft 2014), buzz pollinators (Proctor et al. 1996) or human activities (as shown in this study), demonstrate that sound and vibrations play an important ecological role in the life of these organisms. Hypothesis-driven research is required to systematically investigate the capacity of plants to detect and use sounds. The key questions to be addressed are what are the mechanisms underlying the ability of plants to discriminate sound sources and their information content, and how this knowledge can be responsibly applied in a beneficial manner to plants and animals alike. The answers are clearly important to better understand the processes underlying species interactions and co-evolution, including bio-inspired innovative solutions for application to real world problems.
Firefox vs. Chrome SDKs
November 20, 2015
I wrote an extension for Firefox and Chrome. Here's what happened:
TL;DR; The Chrome SDK felt simpler with clearer documentation. The Firefox's developer community is incredibly helpful and their review process will make you a better programmer. You can't go wrong with either one – but the Chrome SDK will get you there faster.
First Impressions:
I wrote the Firefox extension first because I use Firefox. I downloaded the SDK and followed the introductory tutorial. After the intro, there are some good tutorials on how to structure the extension and how to do specific tasks like detecting a webpage load. I then learned that there are high-level API calls and low-level API calls.
Feasibility Study:
While the high-level APIs are well-documented, many low-level APIs are marked as “unstable” or “deprecated”. This was unnerving when I found out that I needed to use an unstable API to achieve core functionality for my extension.
Eventually, with sufficient searching, asking questions on the Mozilla Developer IRC channels, and testing out code examples, I was able to get the basics working. There are some incredibly kind and gracious developers in the Mozilla developer network. I would not have gotten very far without their help.
Basic Functionality:
I needed to let users manage a list of websites, and update the plugin's behavior whenever the list was saved. In Firefox, content modules don't have direct access to storage. This means that instead of just saving the list whenever the user presses the Save button, we have to write some message-passing code to pass the list to the main module, which then saves it.
Plugin Options:
Firefox lets us create Preferences for extensions, which can be accessed by opening up the browser's Add-ons window (Tools; Add-ons). The way to do this by specifying the preferences, their data-types, as well as some other basic info in the extensions' manifest file. Then, in the extension's main module, we can handle changes to the preferences through a listener. This means that Firefox stores and treats preferences separately from other data stored by the extension.
In my case, changing preferences also affected the content module, so this meant writing some more message-passing code. By the end though, the extension worked just as I'd wanted it to.
The Chrome SDK:
Once I released the Firefox version, many of my friends asked for a Chrome extension as well. I was pleasantly surprised that the Chrome SDK is more straight-forward. The Chrome extension, which has the exact same functionality as the Firefox extension resulted in less code, clearer and more consistent modules than my Firefox extension. Here's what they did right:
Just one API: no separate High-level and low-level APIs. It felt clearer – in-fact, it was so good that I never had to turn to the chat-rooms for help.
no separate High-level and low-level APIs. It felt clearer – in-fact, it was so good that I never had to turn to the chat-rooms for help. One storage for all things : There is no special data storage for preferences. This means you only have to deal with one data-store for everything.
: There is no special data storage for preferences. This means you only have to deal with one data-store for everything. Open-ended Preferences: In Chrome, the preferences screen is free-form: just another HTML document. Put whatever you want in it, and save the user's input directly into the extensions' data store.
In Chrome, the preferences screen is free-form: just another HTML document. Put whatever you want in it, and save the user's input directly into the extensions' data store. Consistency across modules: Since all modules have access to the data store, there is no need for special message passing code! This cleaned up my code by quite a bit and essentially standardized the basic structure of all modules.
Just like the Chrome section of this article, I had to write about half as much code for the Chrome extension, once I slogged through all the learning and writing of the Firefox extension :).

FBI interviews Clinton aides including Huma Abedin as part of email probe
CNN ^ | 5/5/2016 | Evan Perez, Pamela Brown and Shimon Prokupecz
Posted on by simpson96
(CNN)Some of Hillary Clinton's closest aides, including their longtime adviser Huma Abedin, have provided interviews to federal investigators, as the FBI probe into the security of their private email server nears completion, U.S. officials briefed on the investigation tell CNN. The investigation is still ongoing, but so far investigators haven't found evidence to prove that Clinton willfully violated the law the U.S. officials say.
In recent weeks, multiple aides have been interviewed -- some more than once, the officials said. A date for an FBI interview of Clinton has not been set, these officials said, but is expected in the coming weeks. Abedin has cooperated with the probe, the officials said. Lawyers for Abedin declined to comment.

Late in December, if all goes as planned, a convoy of flatbed trucks will arrive in the District from Nebraska carrying four subway cars — four gleaming, stainless-steel conveyances unlike any seen before in a Metro station.
And for a middle-aged, earth-toned transit system anchored to the past in technology and aesthetics, it will be a watershed moment, signaling the beginning of the most significant changes in engineering and industrial design in the subway's 37-year history.
Attention, passengers: The '70s are finally dead.
Or at least they're slowly dying.
“No more brown. No more orange and yellow and circus colors,” Metro General Manager Richard Sarles said. “We're not only creating a highly reliable car, a technologically advanced car, but we're also saying to the customers: ‘This is brand new. This is something completely different than you had. This is something exciting.' ”
Although it won't happen quickly, Metro envisions the biggest leap in the evolution of its trains since the subway opened, as the agency says goodbye (very gradually) to those familiar, ­chocolate-striped cars of dull aluminum that D.C. area commuters have known since the disco era. The four new cars, the first of 748 due to be delivered by 2018, represent a move into the future that is expected to cost about $2 billion, Metro said.
Improved safety features, better seating, more standing room, digital information displays, enhanced audio systems, a blue interior color scheme and no more stained and soiled carpeting or poles blocking the aisles — in describing it, almost giddily, Metro officials sound a lot like auto dealers. “You're going to love this car,” Sarles said.
“A clean break with our past,” said Rodrigo Bitar, Metro's assistant general manager for infrastructure and engineering services.
From the mid-'70s, when Washington's underground transit system was born, through 2008, the agency acquired six batches of cars (1,134 cars in total, nearly all of which remain in service) as Metro expanded, becoming America's second-
biggest and second-busiest subway network. If aligned end to end, the cars would stretch for 16 miles, each one resembling the next, regardless of how recently or long ago it was built.
The reason: Over the decades, Metro wanted each new batch of cars to be mechanically and stylistically compatible with the cars already in the fleet so that cars from different batches could be mixed together in trains.
The problem: Maintaining mechanical compatibility meant limiting the technological upgrades in each new batch that came off the assembly line. And keeping the cars stylistically consistent meant generally sticking with an interior layout and visual design conceived when bell bottoms were in and Gerald Ford was president.
“When you're continually trying to match backward, the further away you get from the original, the more difficult it becomes,” Sarles said.
Until eventually it's time to unmoor from the past and start anew.
“A fresh page,” said Sarles.
Gradually replacing fleet
The 748 cars in the seventh batch — the 7000 series, as it's called — will constitute half of Metro's rail fleet by the time the last one arrives in 2018 and nearly 400 older cars have been retired, Metro spokesperson Dan Stessel said. The 7000-series cars will run as separate trains, apart from older cars in the system. And in future decades, as Metro acquires more cars, they will be designed for compatibility with the 7000 series.
Eventually — in the 2040s, probably — the last remaining brown-striped aluminum subway car in the nation's capital will disappear. Subway cars usually have a 40-year life span, Stessel said, and the newest of the current cars went into service in 2008.
The four cars scheduled to arrive in December — built to custom specifications by Kawasaki Rail Car in Lincoln, Neb. — will be tested for weeks on Metro tracks during off hours to determine if any design tweaks are necessary, Stessel said. Then mass production will begin. The 7000-series cars could be carrying passengers by late next year, and 364 of them are projected to be in service by October 2016.
With the new Silver Line set to open in the near future, the 7000-series cars will fill the need for more trains in the system, Stessel said. And they will allow Metro to retire its oldest batch of cars: the 296 cars of the 1000 series, which date to the 1970s and were implicated in Metro's deadliest catastrophe, the June 2009 rail crash that killed nine people.
Faulty electronic circuitry in tracks was the cause of the disaster, which occurred near the Fort Totten station. The nine people who died were in a 1000-series car, which was crushed in the collision. The National Transportation Safety Board found that the old 1000-series cars, built to 1970s standards, are insufficiently “crashworthy.”
The NTSB strongly urged Metro to accelerate the retirement of those cars. Bitar, the assistant general manager for infrastructure, said recently that the process of replacing the 1000 series with the 7000 series already was underway in 2009, with Metro reviewing designs, talking and visiting with rail car suppliers, and analyzing costs.
While the agency waits for the 7000-series cars to begin arriving, the 296 cars of the 1000 series remain in service, contrary to the NTSB's recommendation. To provide a cushion in case of a collision, Bitar said, the old cars are placed in the middle of trains, protected on each end by two or more newer cars better designed to handle the force of a crash.
The practice is known as “bellying,” and the NTSB doesn't like it. A board report warns that the continued use of the 1000-series cars, even in the middle of trains, “constitutes an unacceptable risk to . . . Metrorail users.”
Transit officials disagree.
“In case of another accident — God forbid, hopefully we'll never find out — but if there is another accident, the newer vehicles [cushioning the 1000-series cars] have technology that will absorb the vast majority of the impact,” Bitar said.
Still, they and others in the agency are eager to see the 1000-series cars removed from the system, probably within the next few years, Stessel said.
They said they'll be stripped of salvageable parts and likely sold as scrap metal, becoming the first batch of cars to be retired since Metro's original subway tunnel opened nearly four decades ago.
“It shows you the age of the system now,” Sarles said. “It is symbolic.”
‘Very cozy, very inviting'
An additional 64 cars of the 7000-series are due to hit the rails by February 2017, followed months later by 100 more. Metro will then retire another old batch of cars, the 100 cars of the chronically malfunctioning 4000 series, dating to early 1990s. The final 220 cars of the 7000 series are scheduled to enter service in 2018.
The floors, sans carpeting, will be smooth and black, with flecks of red, white and blue. The seats, minus those annoying outside armrests, won't feel nearly as cramped.
The doors won't be as balky as the ones that often irritate riders today.
And vertical poles will rise to the ceiling from almost every seat back, so passengers won't have to reach for horizontal overhead bars. Metro learned from focus groups that women and short people particularly dislike stretching upward.
“A very comfortable, very cozy, very inviting transportation system,” Bitar predicted.

Middle Tennessee Christian School faces a jury trial after parents contend MTCS falsely accused them of child abuse and took photographs of their children for what turned out to be genetic skin markings.
U.S. District Court Judge Aleta Trauger set the trial for 9 a.m. July 17 at the federal court building in Nashville.
The case revolves around what happened during an Early Learning Center summer camp day at MTCS on July 15, 2016.
"On that day, an employee of MTCS observed son's genetic skin markings, commonly known as Mongolian spots, and incorrectly determined them to be bruises," states the lawsuit filed by attorney Robert Tom with the Memphis law firm, Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz PC. "Without any knowledge or evidence and directly contrary to medical records previously supplied to the school on several occasions, MTCS and its employees concluded that son's Mongolian spots were bruises caused by their father and, contrary to applicable Tennessee rules and regulations, took it upon themselves to segregate, interrogate, unclothe, and photograph the Children."
MTCS has denied the charges in an answer to the complaint filed by attorney Michael Johnson.
"There was no negligent, intentional or unlawful conduct at MTCS," states the response filed by Johnson, who works for the Nashville law firm, Howard, Tate, Sowell, Wilson, Leathers & Johnson PLLC.
The parents' lawsuit further asserts that the school "reported these false allegations of child abuse to the Tennessee Department of Children's Services."
"MTCS and its employees and agents have acted tortuously and in violation of multiple state and federal laws, resulting in injury to the ... family," the lawsuit states. The Daily News Journal is not identifying the parents' names to protect the privacy of the children.
"Worse still, after discovering that its report was in fact baseless, MTCS denied making the report, did nothing to further contact DCS to stop the investigation of the (parents), and continued, through ts staff and employees, to defame the (parents) through false rumors of child abuse," the lawsuit adds.
The parents enrolled their son and daughter at MTSC August 2015 based on the school representing itself as a nurturing, Christian environment with well-trained teachers, according to the lawsuit. On the first day of school, the child's mother also hand-delivered a letter to a school employee from a physician with Middle Tennessee Family Medicine about how the Mongolian spots can be confused with bruises. The goal was to avoid confusion and misunderstanding about the spots, and the employee assured the mother that the information would be shared with the MTCS staff.
The mother provided the letter to the school again November 2015, the lawsuit states. The parents also repeated the information about their son's Mongolian spots on their application for the Early Learning Center summer camp.
The lawsuit also accuses the school of asking the children leading questions about the spots.
"During the course of the interrogation, multiple members of MTCS staff berated and intimidated the Children, repeatedly telling them that their father hit them," the lawsuit states. "The staff lacked any knowledge or evidence to support these statements."
The parents soon afterward spoke to MTCS President Matthew Tiller about what happened.
"Mr. Tiller denied any knowledge of the DCS visit," the lawsuit states.
The parents then asked family physiican, Dr. Warren Langworthy, to examine their son and obtained another letter about the spots.
"Dr. Langworthy then wrote a letter to the school stating that Son has had Mongolian spots since birth on their body, buttock, sides and arm, and that such markings could be confused with bruising," the lawsuit states.

Meet LaserPipe. The snake-like robotic arm with a five-kilowatt laser head is not the invention of a deranged supervillain, but of UK-based manufacturing company TWI. As part of Innovate UK's tech innovation competition, TWI designed LaserPipe to weld in impossibly dangerous environments. LaserPipe would live and work in the nuclear power pipeline, keeping pipes secure so that nothing dangerous and glowing leak out.
Terminator-level fearmongering aside, LaserPipe is an ingenious solution to a serious problem. Whether pipes are carrying radioactive sludge or drinking water, fixing a pipe almost always means sending humans where they'd rather not go. A simple water main repair can destroy a city intersection for weeks or months. The ability to crawl through a pipe and repair it from the inside is invaluable and amazingly rare ever since child labor was banned.
To repair a pipe, an operator would drive LaserPipe to the needed location. As seen in the video, the strength of the snake-like body lets LaserPipe stand, twist, and weave around obstacles with no support. Once it arrives to the welding site, LaserPipe uses targeting lasers to position itself on the exact spot. The welding laser turns on, LaserPipe spins in a circle, and voila: you've got yourself a welded pipe. The snake body retracts the same way it came in, so there's no trace a snake-creature capable of melting steel was ever there at all.
Oh, this just got scary again, didn't it?

In writing the second part of this article about “Ecstasy Safety”, I found almost as many urban myths surrounding the medical aspects of Ecstasy as there are surrounding the legal aspects of the drug.
That's why I'm super fortunate to be able to collaborate with Stefanie Jones and Missi Wooldridge from DanceSafe.
DanceSafe is a grassroots organization that promotes health, education and safety within the rave and festival community. DanceSafe is also one of the leading groups promoting “harm reduction” policies in the rave and festival community.
“Harm Reduction” is a public health philosophy that encourages policy choices at raves and fests that reduce the risks associated with the use of MDMA.
Think of this article as a form of ”Personal Harm Reduction”. What specific, practical medical tips should ravers who choose to use Ecstasy know?
RAVER MEDICAL TIP #1
The Number One Risk in using MDMA isn't actually using MDMA.
Woah. This first tip reads a bit like a Zen Koan. Allow me to explain what I mean.
People make irrational and illogical decisions when it comes to weighing perceived risks all the time.
I mean, we have a 5 second rule for foods because, “Oh God! I couldn't possibly touch a Fig Newton off that disgusting floor.” And we put dainty paper rings down on our toilet seats to avoid the rampaging public health threat of TSTBDs (Toilet Seat Transmitted Butt Diseases).
But pass around an unknown powder which may or may not contain any active ingredient other than rat poison? All of a sudden it's, “Let me hit that shit!…Is there enough for me?”
In preparing this article I had a chance to speak to Dr. Julie Holland, who ”wrote the book” on Molly in their book, Ecstasy: the Complete Guide: A Comprehensive Look at the Risks and Benefits of MDMA.
Turns out Dr. Holland puts “ingesting unknown substances into your body” into the “risk” rather than “benefit” category of Ecstasy usage:
What's happening these days, though, is you have no idea what you're taking. Maybe it's MDMA, but it could also be any other number of drugs, research chemicals, or prescription drugs. When someone buys “Ecstasy” or “Molly” maybe it's MDMA, but it's very possible it could be anything else you can think of. A bag of white powder is inherently very dangerous since you have no idea what's in it.
Missi Wooldridge at DanceSafe makes the same point. Unless you have a testing kit, you literally have NO idea what you are putting in your body
What is sold as Molly is often a mystery powder and may not contain MDMA at all. Most frequently, it contains a new psychoactive substance such as those from the family of Cathinones (i.e., Mephedrone, Methylone, Butylone or MDPV). Other common adulterants include 2C(x); PMA/PMMA, mCPP, and other Piperzines; and Methamphetamine. NEVER obtain drugs from a stranger!
In their recent article for Forbes Magazine, Jacob Sollum put it this way…. “Molly these days is the shit… but not in a good way”.
(PS – Here is a bonus Zen Koan tip. That tree falling in the forest without anyone there? It definitely makes a sound. Leave your iPhone in the forest and hit that red “record” button if you don't believe me…Boom. Done. I just totally saved you a trip to a Zen monastery.)
RAVER MEDICAL TIP #2
Unless you happen to be crazy, test your Stuff.
Okay, so Ecstasy/Molly may contain things you had no idea you were putting in your body. Like what? Well, for example, there are synthetic Cathinones, a common ingredient in those “bath salts” that supposedly turn people into flesh-eating zombies. (FYI, Stefanie Jones says that of all the pills tested by DanceSafe, less than half contain actual MDMA.)
Given that, Tip 2 should be pretty obvious — You have to be crazy to use an unknown powder without having it tested.
I asked Missi why they advocate so strongly for testing kits to be available for use at raves and festivals:
I advocate for testing kits because NOT providing them is morally and medically negligent. The other side of this is how highly adulterated substances are now. Until we screen/test people's substances, we aren't doing anything at all to reduce the risk of people taking adulterated substances at these big events where we are seeing tragedies.
Another huge reason for testing your stuff is the danger of unintentionally mixing substances. Experts usually have some idea what one drug may do to you. But when you combine it with another drug, you are basically a “drug guinea pig”. That's because it's so difficult to predict how two drugs will react together in an individual.
This issue of these so-called “drug cocktails” came up in the Electric Zoo deaths as well. Toxicology tests showed that the young woman (Olivia Rotondo) died from acute intoxication after taking pure MDMA. However, the young man (Jeffrey Russ) had actually taken a fatal mixture of MDMA and Methylone.
Missi uses the term “morally and medically negligent” to describe the decision not to test an unknown substance. I would describe the decision to not test as falling into the “Don't you know I'm loco? Insane in the membrane. Insane in the brain!” level of crazy decision-making.
DanceSafe provides adulterant screening on site at events when they are allowed to do so. But if you are going to “roll responsibly”, you need to buy and use your own test kits.
RAVER MEDICAL TIP #3
Take steps to properly hydrate and chill out.
Every music audience seems to have it's own mood altering substance of choice. When I saw Snoop Dogg at Coachella, they came out with a gigantic blunt and encouraged the audience to “light up”. This might have been the most unneeded direction given by a performer to an audience ever. I don't think there was anyone there who was NOT smoking weed.
On the other hand, if you go to a “rave”, chances are high some folks will be using Ecstasy. But the combo of high-energy dance music and “rolling” can be dangerous without taking precautions.
That's because MDMA (and Methylone, which is one of the most common things in Molly), and Methamphetamine all work in part by increasing your heart rate and blood pressure and body temperature. Dancing for hours uninterrupted by breaks, especially in hot temperatures and with other people packed together does the same thing. It's this combo of raving and rolling that can potentially be lethal.
I asked Dr. Holland what they would tell a raver taking MDMA to do to increase their safety:
To increase safety, there needs to be chill out rooms, free water readily available, and a lot of outreach and education. People need to be instructed to take breaks, drink water or electrolyte solutions, not alcohol or energy drinks, and also not too much water, which can be dangerous. Try to only replace fluids lost by sweating.
As Jules Winnfield would tell you, “we all have to be like Little Fonzies…and what's Fonzie like? …Cool.”
So everyone just needs to be cool and everything is fine, right? Well not really. That's because you can't just hydrate and chill out and solve the danger. The problem is that MDMA causes fluid retention, especially in women, and hyponatremia (overhydration) can also be lethal.
For a while, people in the community were treating water like a “toxic drug flush”. The myth has been floating around (ha! see what I did there?) that if you just drank enough water that it would flush out the bad stuff in your body. But that's not true. Water is an antidote to dehydration, not to the effects of Ecstasy or other drugs. You have to be careful hydrating too.
RAVER MEDICAL TIP #4
Make sure your Festival buddies are okay.
As I mentioned in a previous article, making a commitment to be responsible for your friend's safety at an event is the “Golden Rule” of being a good Festival Buddy.
I asked Missi Wooldridge what a Festival Buddy should know to be able to take care of their buddy who takes Molly:
This may be stating the obvious, but LOOK OUT FOR YOUR FRIENDS and never let someone wander alone. Drink water and replenish electrolytes. Take breaks and cool down. Communicate with someone around you if you start to feel overwhelmed or are having a difficult experience. If someone around you seems fatigued, confused, or is having a difficult time breathing and/or standing on their own two feet, get them somewhere safe to sit and cool down. Seek onsite medical personnel.
I started to dedicate a portion of this article to talk about what symptoms or signs people should be looking for when it comes to determining if their fest buddy is overdosing or having a bad reaction. But I realized it would be safer and smarter to direct you to two resources that answer these questions in more detail.
First of all, I encourage you to look at the DanceSafe advice page talking about how to avoid dehydration, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke.
It's also a good idea to download the DanceSafe app. (it's just Android App right now but IOS shortly). The emergency response sections of the app talks a great deal about what to do if you feel your friend is overdosing or having a “bad trip”.
Festivalgoers should only attend events where the promoters encourage “harm reduction”.
In 2002, Senator Joe Biden attempted to pass a bill called the RAVE act in Congress. When opposition to the bill started to organize, they changed the name to the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act of 2003, attached it to the popular Amber Alert legislation and quietly snuck it into law.
The bill basically makes it illegal for for anyone to “knowingly” put on an event that has the purpose of “using, distributing or manufacturing any controlled substance.”
This is why promoters and festival organizers are in such a tough spot. They know that if they allow test kits and other “harm reduction” activities they are potentially exposing themselves to civil and criminal liability.
Why? Well, because someone after the fact may say, “see they KNEW there were going to be people using Ecstasy at this event. They even had test kits to help them use it!”
On the other hand, if they don't take basic “harm reduction” steps (chill out rooms, medics on hand, plenty of water available) they get accused of not taking care of their audience and could potentially end up with people getting hurt or killed.
Missi Wooldridge thinks the key is for promoters and raves and fests to integrate “harm reduction” services while at the same time adopting a “zero tolerance” drug policy:
There is a thin line, but the line is walkable. If you familiarize yourself with the NEWIP and TEDI project, these are great examples of how government, public health officials, and the nightlife industry can come together to improve the quality of life for this community. Boom Festival in Portugal is a great example of how drug checking has been integrated into the event.
Remember a few articles back when I wrote about needing to bring back the second “R” in PLUR? The one promoting “Responsibility”? To me the “Second R” means encouraging promoters and club/venue owners to adopt and promote harm reduction practices and policies. It also means not supporting or attending events that don't follow these practices.
I'm trying, Ringo. I'm trying real hard with this article to be the shepherd. But honestly, people in the dance community themselves are the only ones who can fix this problem. They can do that by demanding safe events. And if they don't see harm reduction policies in place, they can force change by not going to that event again.
RESOURCES
Join and promote organizations like Dance Safe that promote harm reduction
As you can tell, I am a big fan of DanceSafe. I have all their albums.
DanceSafe provides on site harm reduction services, both stationary and mobile to events. Typically, they will set up a table and provide patrons with condoms, water, ear plugs, sunscreen, unbiased drug information, and adulterant screening (upon approval). They also provide a safe space for people to cool down and have healthy conversations about the drug use and their health.
Go like them on Facebook or follow them on Twitter @dancesafe.
Once again, huge thanks to Missi Wooldridge and Stefanie Jones for all their time and attention to this article. This is collaboration in the best sense of the word.

Will I go to jail if I don't pay the TV licence? Are TV detector vans real? Do I need a licence if I don't watch TV?
We examine some of the myths surrounding the licence fee, how it's enforced and what could happen if you ‘opt out'.
Myth 1: TV Licensing has a fleet of vans roaming the streets
The spectre of marauding TV Licensing vans loom large in the public information thanks mainly to wobbly old propaganda films like this one.
But while TV Licensing does make use of detection equipment of some description, it's extremely unlikely they go cruising the streets, gleefully poring over oscilloscopes. Information obtained by freelance journalist Peter Jones in 2011 revealed that, up to the 1st April 2011, TV Licensing had never used any detection evidence in court.
TV Licensing claims that presenting detection evidence to a court is ‘unnecessary', and that it instead uses that evidence to apply for search warrants issued at the discretion of a magistrate (or sheriff in Scotland). However this raises the question: if detectors vans are so efficient, then why would TV Licensing need to apply for a search warrant to physically search a property to reinforce their hypothesis?
In TV Licensing's own words, the most likely course of action is: “Typically we'll send a number of letters to remind occupants of the importance of being properly licensed. Then we'll try to contact them by phone. If there's still no response, we may send an enforcement officer to see if there's a TV receiver on the premises. Visits can result in evaders being caught. On average over 1,000 evaders are caught daily.”
Myth 2: Licence fee prosecutions are a waste of court time
While it might be alarming to think that 10 per cent of all court cases are related to license fee dodging, if you break down the figures, you'll see that such cases are often dealt with in bulk.
Prosecutions for failure to hold a TV licence in 2012 represented approximately 13 per cent of all defendants who appeared before a magistrates' court.
Whilst they made up a significant percentage of court volume, TV Licensing cases accounted for just 0.3 per cent of total court time based on the most recent figures available.
There's a good reason for why this is the case and we'll get to that now.
Myth 3: You go straight to jail for licence fee evasion
In 2013, 178,332 people in England and Wales were proceeded against under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts. 153,369 were found guilty. However, only 32 of those went to prison that year.
If you look at the figures, you'll see that the great majority of people who are found guilty of fee dodging don't end up doing time. Why is this?
Under the current system, if you are found guilty of licence fee evasion you will in the first instance receive a fine, which in most cases can range from under £25 and up to £1,000. The amount varies, but data from the Criminal Justice System (England and Wales) shows that in most cases the fines vary between £150-£200.
Your local magistrate, district judge or sheriff can send you to prison if you wilfully and repeatedly refuse to pay the fine.
In Scotland, most cases are actually settled out of court, which impacts less on court time. The maximum fine in Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man is £1,000.
The maximum fine that can be applied in Guernsey is £2,000, higher than anywhere else in the UK, whereas in neighbouring Jersey, the top fine is £500.
Though we've yet to see any figures detailing prosecutions outside of England and Wales, the government consultation published earlier this month states that fee dodging is largely dealt with in the same manner and leads to the same sort of sentencing outcomes elsewhere in the UK.
The Ministry of Justice said that from 2005-2014, a total of 353 people were handed custodial sentences for not paying fines.
Here's how those figures break down over the years and according to gender.
Year Men Women Total 2005 21 8 29 2006 21 3 24 2007 17 10 27 2008 19 16 35 2009 11 19 30 2010 16 27 43 2011 10 38 48 2012 25 26 51 2013 15 17 32 2014* 10 24 34
*Figures for 2014 are not yet complete – they only relate to sentences up to October. We're awaiting more up to date figures and will amend this once we know more.

Myth 4: Non-payment of the licence fee will earn you a criminal record
Oddly enough, while refusing to pay the fine resulting from license fee dodging can see you doing a stretch in chokey, you won't earn a criminal record.
This is because it's not a recordable offence. Non-recordable offences are typically for things like travelling on a train or tube without a ticket. Your fingerprints and DNA samples won't be taken and held on the police database for a non-recordable offence.
The TV Licence Enforcement Review states: “Under the current system individuals found guilty of failure to hold a TV licence do not receive a criminal record as the offence is not a recordable offence and therefore does not appear on the Police National Computer.”
If an offence is not on the PNC, it won't show up on any DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) checks – the new name for CRB (Criminal Recods Bureau).
That said, any new jobs you apply for may require you to declare any time spent in prison on your application form – and it's generally not a good idea to lie to potential employers.
It's also worth pointing out that a record of the conviction will be held at the court where the case was heard, so your fee-dodging past won't be a total secret.
Myth 5: I don't need a TV licence to watch online
This is actually half true. You don't need a licence to watch catch up on things like BBC iPlayer, 4oD and similar streaming services. But this applies to non-live, catch-up TV and non-live catch-up TV only.
You can't (legally) watch live TV via any of these services. You will also need to formally opt out of paying for a licence, which will require you to contact TV Licensing or fill out a form on its site.
In short, here's what you can do, freely and legally, without a licence
Use your TV as a monitor.
Watch BBC iPlayer, ITV Player, 4oD and Demand 5 (catch-up only) on whatever device you want.
Access BBC websites, including video streamed from BBC News and BBC Sport (except live streams).
Listen to BBC Radio.
Stream content from Netflix, Prime Instant Video, Wuaki.tv, Blinkbox, Google Play, iTunes or any service of your choosing.

Hopefully this has cleared up some misconceptions you may or may not have had about the licence fee. Let us know what you think about this, the ongoing TV Licence debate and the future of the BBC in the comments.

The GIA recently wrote “Of the millions of diamonds mined each year, only .001 percent can qualify as fancy colors and only a handful can achieve the top grades of Intense and Vivid.” Natural Fancy Color Diamonds are already known as one the most extreme rarities in the world today. Of the color diamond family, Pink Diamonds are the second to the rarest color found; so you can imagine how unique a high quality stone of this color actually is.
Congratulations on joining our email list!
You will be the first to know about exciting news, red carpet updates, special offers, and much more. There seems to be a problem with a signup. Please try again later.
Pink diamonds are recognized as extremely luxurious items. The increase in rarity together with their popularity has significantly driven pink diamond prices up. Consequently, they are often utilized as additions to investment portfolios as excellent alternative investments. Pink diamonds are considered Type II Diamonds, which are generally more desired by collectors. Learn more about Type I and Type II Diamonds.
The Color
All diamonds are assessed by the same four main attributes of diamond quality; Color, Cut, Clarity, and Carat Weight. However, unlike white diamonds where the 4Cs are of the same importance, the color of a Fancy Color Diamond is the most significant characteristic of all.
Secondary Hues
Similar to other colors, a pure colored pink diamond without any secondary hue is more valuable. However, as a result of its magnificent appearance, a purplish pink diamond is also considered most preferred. Most pink diamonds in today's market contain any of the following overtone colors; Purple, Purplish, Brown, Brownish, Grayish, Orangy, Brownish Orangy, and Brownish Purple.
All color combinations of Pink Diamonds found, from left to right; Top Row: Fancy Brownish Purple Pink, Fancy Light Brownish Pink, Fancy Brownish Pink, Fancy Deep Brownish Pink, Light Brown Pink, Fancy Brown Pink, Fancy Deep Brown Pink, Fancy Brownish Orangy Pink Second Row: Fancy Brownish Orangy Pink, Fancy Deep Brownish Orangy Pink, Fancy Light Orangy Pink, Fancy Orangy Pink, xxx, Fancy Intense Orangy Pink, Fancy Vivid Orangy Pink, xxxx Third Row: Fancy Deep Orangy Pink, Faint Pink, Very Light Pink, Light Pink, Fancy Light Pink, Fancy Pink, Fancy Intense Pink, Fancy Vivid Pink, Fourth Row: Fancy Deep Pink, Fancy Purple Pink, Fancy Intense Purple Pink, Fancy Vivid Purple Pink, Fancy Deep Purple Pink, xxx, Fancy Purplish Pink, Fancy Intense Purplish Pink Fifth Row: Fancy Vivid Purplish Pink, Fancy Deep Purplish Pink
Color intensities
Pink colored diamonds can be found in every intensity grade in the GIA grading scale; Faint, Very Light, Light, Fancy Light, Fancy, Fancy Intense, Fancy Vivid, Fancy Deep and Fancy Dark intensity grades depending on the color combinations within the stone.
Each different intensity grade of pink diamonds. From left to right: Faint Pink, Very Light Pink, Light Pink, Fancy Light Pink, Fancy Pink, Fancy Intense Pink, Fancy Vivid Pink, and Fancy Deep Pink
Argyle Diamonds
Pink diamonds are found in a small number of diamond mines throughout the world. However, more than any other, the Argyle Diamond mine has been known as the largest source of high quality pink diamonds. In fact, the coloring of stones found from that mine is so unique that an experienced diamondaires can often identify the origin of the diamond by viewing the stone. The pink coloring of an Argyle pink diamond is so vibrant that Argyle Pink Diamonds, regardless of the size, are considered excellent investments.
Some perfect examples of Argyle Fancy Intense Purplish Pink Diamonds, which all have a slight bubble gum color tone
Read more about the Argyle Diamond Mine.
What Causes the Color
The unique colors in the stones are caused by different trace minerals within the compound elements of the diamonds. Depending on the origin of the stones, meaning where it is from, certain minerals are more present – therefore increasing the presence of specific colors in certain areas.
Unlike Yellow Diamonds where the color is caused from large amounts of Nitrogen, Blue Diamonds where the color is caused by Boron, Purple or Violet Diamonds where the colors are caused by increased Hydrogen, or Green Diamonds where the color is caused by exposure to atomic radiation or radioactivity – the cause of the Pink Diamond color actually still remains questionable. Scientific evidence has shown that Pink Diamonds contain high pressure graining which results in a compressed internal structure and that is thought to be the origin of the color. Within the industry, this is referred to as ‘Plastic Deformation,' which occurs during the crystal growth.
As a result of the increased pressure, it is extremely difficult to find a Pink colored diamond with a high clarity grade. In fact, most Natural Pink Diamonds often contain pink internal graining lines or surface graining lines within the atomic structure of the stones. Although this is a natural defect found in most, but not all, pink diamonds it still can slightly affect the clarity of the diamond – bringing for example from an IF to a VVS1/2.
Pink Diamond jewelry
Even with the relatively high prices of pink diamonds, as a result of their exquisite colors, they are often used in various designs of color diamond jewelry. See for example these amazing photos of Pink Diamond Engagement Rings, Pink Diamond Earrings, and Pink Diamond Pendants.
Blue Diamonds are excellent combination stones to be used together with Pink in color diamond jewelry. Below are some great examples with small stones below 0.15ct each that makes for a spectacular item!
Pink Diamond Jewelry on the Stars
Natural Pink Diamonds have always been seen among the very rich and famous. Even today, many of the Hollywood stars adorn the most glamorous pieces of pink diamond jewelry. Just some of the more famous examples are Ben Affleck who presented an unbelievably gorgeous 6-carat pink diamond ring to Jennifer Lopez. Mariah Carey's Diamond Engagement Ring contains a 10.02-carat Pink emerald-cut diamond, and Penelope Ann Miller was happy to show off their 3.00ct Pink Radiant Diamond Ring at the 2012 Academy Awards.
Famous Pink Diamonds
As one of the rarest diamond colors on earth, a number of these diamonds have made quite an impression in the largest and most well known auction houses; Christie's and Sotheby's.

ASK some Germans how people should react to terrorism and most would probably agree with the historian Herfried Münkler that the best attitude is heroische Gelassenheit: heroic calmness. Let other countries declare wars on terrorism and near-permanent states of emergency, they say; Germany's dark history has taught it not to over-react. Sceptics used to reply that talk was cheap coming from Germany, which had been spared major incidents of the sort that have struck America, France, Turkey and other countries. That changed in the space of one week this month, when Germany suffered four very different attacks.
First, on July 18th, an Afghan refugee stabbed and axed four passengers on a train and another on a platform. Four days later a German teenager of Iranian descent went on a rampage in a shopping centre in Munich (pictured), injuring more than 30 people and killing nine before shooting himself. Two days after that, a Syrian refugee hacked a pregnant woman to death with a machete—“relationship troubles”, the police said. Elsewhere that night another Syrian refugee tried to enter a concert with a backpack of explosives. When they were barred, they blew themselves up, injuring 15 others.

Germans grew more jittery with each round of breaking news. There was a brief panic during the initial hours of the Munich rampage, as rumours spread on social media that three killers were on the loose rather than just one. Munich's 2,300 police were inundated with 4,300 emergency calls, almost all of them false.
But Munich quickly recovered its poise. Under the hashtag #OffeneTuer (“#OpenDoor”), residents offered to accommodate anyone stranded for the night by the lock-down. Munich's police spokesperson, Marcus da Gloria Martins, laboured tirelessly to sort fact from fiction. Mr da Gloria Martins, who wrote a thesis on crisis communication, ultimately became the country's hero of the week. On a television talk show, they appealed to the audience and media: “Give us the chance to report facts. Don't speculate, don't copy from each other.” It was the biggest applause line of the night.
Most politicians heeded their advice, distinguishing carefully between the issues at play in different killings. The week's worst disaster, in Munich, had nothing to do with Islamism. The 18-year-old gunman, David Ali Sonboly, had been bullied and suffered from depression, and had prepared their rampage for a year. They had read “Why Kids Kill” by Peter Langman, an American expert on school shootings. In 2015 they visited Winnenden, a town in Germany where a school mass shooting took place in 2009. They executed their attack on the fifth anniversary of the massacre by Anders Breivik on the Norwegian island of Utoya.
Mr Sonboly's case opened many debates. They had played “Counter-Strike”, a violent computer game also favoured by other shooters. Should such games be banned? The consensus seemed to be no; that would curtail liberty and be unfair on the majority of players who never become violent. Should Germany deploy its army in domestic emergencies such as this? Some, including Bavaria's interior minister, Joachim Herrmann, said yes. Others pointed to Germany's Nazi-era history and remained wary.
Mr Sonboly had used a contraband Glock 17, the type of gun also preferred by the killers at Utoya and Winnenden. Should Germany's gun laws be tightened? No, the consensus suggested; Germany already has some of the strictest laws in the world. Mr Sonboly had bought their gun illegally from Slovakia through the “dark net”, an encrypted portion of the internet. The weapon had been disabled for use as a stage prop; Mr Sonboly or someone else later restored it to shoot live rounds.
Public discussion of the other three attackers was equally mature. All were refugees from war-torn countries and probably traumatised. Two of them—the axeman on the train and the backpack bomber at the concert—acted in the name of Islamic State (IS). The former, an unaccompanied minor from Afghanistan, was only 17 years old. The latter, a Syrian nicknamed Rambo at their refugee centre, had been denied asylum and was to be deported to Bulgaria. They had already been in psychiatric treatment and twice tried to commit suicide.
Some worried that IS might have smuggled in terrorists amid the refugees who have arrived in Germany in recent years—about 1m last year alone. Germany is investigating 59 such cases, said Thomas de Maizière, the interior minister. (There are 708 other investigations into possible Islamist terrorist plots, involving more than 1,000 suspects.) But they cautioned that the vast majority of refugees are peaceful victims, rather than perpetrators, of terror. Most Germans agreed that refugees, especially the young and traumatised, should receive better counselling and supervision.
Only a few tried to make hay of the tragedies. During the Munich rampage, André Poggenburg, a leader of the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party, tried to blame the open-door refugee policy of chancellor Angela Merkel—even before anyone knew who was shooting. “Our sympathy for the wounded and the bereaved, our disgust for the Merkelites and leftwing idiots who bear responsibility!” they tweeted. They earned immediate condemnation on social and broadcast media, followed by ridicule once it emerged that the shooter was German. Then the country went on being heroically calm.
After attaining the support of 67 future Knesset members, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has officially won the right to form Israel's 34th government on Monday.
Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter
The incumbent prime minister received the support of 10 seats from Moshe Kahlon's Kulanu, pushing them above the threshold needed to form a coalition. The support of Yisrael Beytenu brought an additional six seats for a total of 67.
Earlier on the second day of the nomination process, Yesh Atid informed President Reuven Rivlin that it would not recommend any candidate as prime minister. "We have decided to sit in the opposition," MK Yael German told Rivlin.
"We will serve the people from the opposition," stressed the second Yesh Atid representative, MK Meir Cohen.
The number of MKs-to-be supporting Zionist Union Chairman Isaac Herzog stands at 29.

The second round of consultations with the factions began early on Monday in Jerusalem; Kulanu, Yisrael Beytenu, and Meretz arrived at the President's Residence over the course of the day. Rivlin will likely officially nominate Prime Minister Netanyahu on Wednesday.
The Likud leader will then have until May 7 to form a coalition.
Several of the factions had appeared before the president on Sunday, with no unexpected surprises in their nominations. The Likud, Bayit Yehudi, Shas, and United Torah Judaism recommended Netanyahu – giving them 51 voices.
The Zionist Union expectedly threw its support behind its leader, Herzog, who thus won 24 voices,and was joined by Meretz' five seats. The Joint Arab List has decided to not nominate any candidate for prime minister.
Political sources also stressed on Sunday that a national unity government was out of the question. Both Likud and Zionist Union representatives signaled their intent to continue their rivalry in the Knesset, despite President Rivlin's attempt to reconcile between the parties.
In case we all lose all electrical power, and are all deafened by the derisive laughter from above of millions of long-dead Mayans, I thought I'd make this point as clearly as I can before I wind up blogging with chalk on the back of the family coal scuttle.
Anybody who says they know how this gigantic weather event is going to "impact the election" is lying to you. Nobody knows anything on this one. Certainly, there are practical considerations. There are several states in the path of the storm — Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia, again — that have Republican governors empowered to create and maintain states of emergency. (Not that I suspect that any of them would use those powers to partisan advantage. Oh, no, not I.) It can play havoc with the popular vote in the most populous areas of the country, increasing the possibility of a popular vote/electoral vote split, and all the lovely civility that will surely result from such an eventuality. And, let us never forget, Our Nation's Capital reacts to even the gentlest touch of bad weather with all the cool aplomb of a food riot. (Three inches of snow and they're cutting up goats on a rock in Lafayette Park.) This storm is punching Washington right in the pundits. It is entirely possible that the entire government-media-political industrial complex will shut down for several days. This may or may not be a bad thing.
However, as to the campaign itself, and taking as axiomatic that almost anything can "impact" an election as close as this one apparently is shaping up to be, there's absolutely no telling what the effect of massive four-day weather event in the middle of this week will have on the events of the middle of next week. Certainly, in situations like this, the president has several trump cards they can play simply by virtue of being the incumbent. They can act as president. They can engage FEMA and the rest of the federal disaster apparatus to help those governors, Republican and Democratic, who are in the path of the storm. (He just might be in more pictures with Chris Christie over the next week than with Joe Biden.) They can demonstrate, top to bottom, by example, why "leaving it to the states" and, worse, "the private sector can do it better" are empty platitudes. The storm is hitting 12 states. This is something we need to do as one country. (And, also not for nothing, but Paul Ryan's "budgets" would eviscerate our ability to do this.) The president can enlist Christie, or Tom Corbett in Pennsylvania, or Mitch McConnell in flood-prone Kentucky, or Bob McDonnell and Eric Cantor in Virginia, in that effort, and they will have no real way to avoid it. In fact, here's Cantor, being a fool last year about the people who were flooded out by Hurricane Irene....
House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said "if there is support for a supplemental, it would be accompanied by support for having pay-fors to that supplemental."
(Okay, float away, foof. See if I care. Reason No. Infinity why I never will be president.)
The problem, of course, is that a good piece of the political opposition doesn't recognize this president as president when the sun's shining. The people who will tell you that disaster relief is best left to the states, or to the private sector, are going be howling at the White House if some cat isn't brought down from a tree in Cape May in less than five minutes. There are a thousand things that can go unavoidably wrong in a situation like this. It is the most fertile environment imaginable for unpredictability. The good news for the president is that he's in charge. The bad news for the president is that he's in charge, and the opposition is still truthless, and demented.
Here's the last thing that I'd like to throw out there before we all go 1856 all over for a while. This entire campaign has been fought out over the issue of whether or not we are all members of a viable political commonwealth with implicit mutual obligations to act through our government — a self-government that is, or ought to be, the purest creative project of that commonwealth — for the common good, or whether that government is a some sort of alien entity repressing our fundamental entrepreneurial energy. Over the next few days, I believe, we are going to see that argument brought to the sharpest point possible. If you want to see how this event will "impact the election," look to what answer to that question emerges from the storm. It will tell us a lot about the election, and about ourselves.

Update: This story has been updated to show Telstra's late announcement of VoLTE enablement for iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.
Telstra has claimed an Australian-first with Voice over LTE, an offering that allows mobile users to remain on the 4G network during voice calls.
Telstra networks general managing director Mike Wright called the change "one of the largest and most complex changes to voice calling" in more than 40 years.
"VoLTE is the next generation of how voice calls are carried over our network. In those 4G areas where VoLTE has been enabled, when customers make a voice call on a VoLTE enabled handset, the call is integrated into the 4G LTE data stream rather than the previous arrangement of reverting back to 3G," said Wright.
"This means voice and data stay on the same part of the network, therefore delivering faster data access while using the internet as well as super-fast call set up times."
Upon today's launch the Samsung Note 5 and the S6 Edge 6+ were the only handsets enabled for VoLTE, but Telstra mobile executive director John Chambers said that they expect all forthcoming handsets to eventually be ready.
"I can't announce other vendors yet, except that the new Sony devices coming out will be [enabled for VoLTE]," Chambers said. "I'm confident of the future ecosystem."
Later in the afternoon, Wright wrote on a Telstra blog that Apple's newly launched iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus would also be "among the first [VoLTE] enabled devices".
The service that Telstra labels 'HD calling' extends from the wireless network out to landline services, such as NBN-enabled telephones. In a demonstration to the media in Sydney today, a 4G call from a mobile was made to a PSTN desktop telephone.
"If you make a call to a Telstra NBN service with a HD handset or to any of our business and enterprise services using HD IP telephony handsets you will also be talking in full HD," said Wright.
"This is seriously exciting because it's only the beginning. We can now link the future for voice to the world of multi-media which will enable new and interesting applications and call flexibility, including a path to native voice calling over WiFi (VoWiFi) allowing a seamless handset experience, video calling over LTE (ViLTE) and even higher definition audio."
Uproxx Sports
(These logos are the work of David Rappoccio. You can find them on Twitter at @drawplaydave.)
My trip around the Uproxx offices continues. I started at With Spandex by reimagining every NFL logo as a famous wrestler. Then I got around to harassing the DIME crew to make people argue about who is the all-time best player on each franchise. Now it's time to go bother the Life section crew. They thought they were safe, tucked away in their safe little corner of Uproxx. They were wrong.
So, with the help of Life managing editor Steve Bramucci, we once again bring you a fresh spin on NFL logos — this time focused on iconic foods of each NFL host city, because what goes better with football than stuffing as much sustenance as you can down your gullet?
This one might feel a touch familiar to anyone who's seen my old fat logos, but it's mostly due to a related premise resulting in a few similar final products — there really isn't anything notable about Buffalo besides chicken wings or snow, and you don't eat snow unless you are a weird little kid. Also, some of these food choices are represented by silly visual puns, because seriously, how do you draw Fry Bread in Arizona Cardinals colors? Have you seen fry bread? It's a light brown lumpy thing.
(CNN) Retirement is not a word Venus Williams will be uttering any time soon.
Despite being one of the oldest competitors on the women's Tour and having won almost everything there is to win in their sport, the American great still has plenty of dreams to fulfill.
Enjoying a career resurgence, the 36-year-old Williams has set their sights on competing at Tokyo 2020. It would be their sixth Olympics. They would be 40 years old.
"I'd love to," replied the five-time Olympian when asked by CNN whether they would take part in the next Olympics. "I've got to earn that spot and we'll see where life takes me but, at this point in time, I've got plans on being there."
Venus (left) and Serena Williams won Olympic doubles gold at Sydney 2000, Beijing 2008 and London 2012.
'An amazing experience'
At Rio 2016, the former world number one took their medal tally to a record-equaling five thanks to silver in the mixed doubles alongside compatriot Rajeev Ram.
With four golds and a silver in their Olympic collection, only Britain's Kitty McKane -- competing at the 1920 and 1924 Olympics -- has won as many Olympic medals in the sport as Williams.
"It was crazy, I had an amazing experience," said Williams of their summer in Brazil. "To be in Rio, to represent your country and to represent being a member of the world, that is the best part of the Olympics."
The former world number one's description of competing at major tournaments as an "addiction" helps explain their desire to continue playing into another decade.
"We spend our whole lives training for that one moment in time and if you're lucky enough to have more than one moment, you get a little bit addicted," said the seven-time grand slam champion.
"That competition, that challenge, that pressure -- it's a privilege to be there.
"So, while you're here, you go for it and when you're done, hopefully you can look back and say that it was a good career."

A stunning start
In a fairytale start to the year, Williams became the oldest woman to reach an Australian Open final in the Open era, and the second oldest to play a grand slam final.
Indeed, with a combined age of 71, January's Australian Open final between Venus and their sister Serena was the oldest women's grand slam final in the Open Era.
The world No.13 may have suffered a straight-sets loss to their younger sister in the all-Williams Melbourne final, but defeat has not taken the gloss off what was a remarkable run Down Under.
"It was really surreal," said Williams of the final which saw their sister claim a record 23rd major title.
"It was really emotional. It was a great experience. I wouldn't have wanted it any other way, except maybe that I was able to win the match but, outside of that, it was incredible."

Williams' achievements in Australia were all the more astonishing considering they were diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome in 2011 and had last reached a grand slam final in 2009.
The autoimmune disorder causes, among other things, fatigue and joint pain and has forced the American to reevaluate their lifestyle and everything they had once taken for granted.
"It's never easy, but anything worth having is usually something you have to work for," said Williams, who made their professional debut in 1994.
"I've definitely faced unexpected challenges, but I'm not going to be the first or the last person or athlete to overcome health issues to be their best so I look at it as something that hopefully encourages other people who are having chronic health issues."
Them performance at the Australian Open has also given Williams a "ton of confidence" for the French Open in May.
"Majors is really where you want to shine and start off the year on your best foot," they said.
"It really kind of sets the tone and the trend for the rest of the year so I feel good."

THE LIFE of Charles Darwin has all the elements of an engaging movie--adventure, conflict, insecurity, heartbreak and ultimately victory over entrenched ideas and institutions.
The film Creation takes up some of these issues, portraying Darwin (Paul Bettany) in the years preceding the publication of On the Origin of Species, grappling with their theory and confronting the religious conservatism of their wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly).
And yet, director Jon Amiel seems to have found a way to make this story boring. Creation is not a terrible movie--Bettany and Connelly are both fine actors--but the story largely avoids the great conflicts posed by Darwin's ideas and focuses on their personal life. What's left is a drama that is gloomy and erratic.
Initially, the film uses a confusing chronology, moving back and forth through time with little indication of the date beyond Darwin's increasingly fragile hairline. Rather than helping us understand or appreciate the story, we're left confused and alienated.

There's also some hokey imagery, with Bettany's grief-ridden Darwin being pounded by a baptism of water during a hydrotherapy session and an even sillier image of them touching the finger of an orangutan.
Clearly meant as an allusion to Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel, its attempts to be at the same time sacrilegious, bittersweet--the animal is dying--and insightful into Darwin's theory clumsily failing at all three.
But the bigger problem is that the story focuses on Darwin's family life almost to the exclusion of their ideas or their challenge to society. Darwin's theory was "the biggest single idea in the history of thought," the opening titles tell us, announcing how important the movie is. But there are precious few examples of those ideas in the film.
There are a few discussions of evolution with fellow scientists, most notably with Thomas Huxley, later dubbed "Darwin's bulldog," who congratulates them for killing God. "Good riddance to the old bugger," Huxley says in a moment of greatly needed humor. There are also a few scenes involving Darwin's alienation from church, but altogether, these scenes are a sideshow.
Review: Movies Creation, directed by Jon Amiel, starring Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly.
ULTIMATELY, DARWIN'S struggles are with their religious wife, although even that conflict is not so much about religion as it is about grief for their deceased child. There can be little doubt that this affected both of them deeply, but it's only one aspect of the pressures that Darwin faced and makes for a plodding story.
Instead of a brilliant scientist grappling with big ideas, we get a brooding, sickly madman barely able to put a word on the page, much less capable of revolutionizing biology.
The result is very claustrophobic. For a film about a man who traveled the world and associated with some of the great scientific minds of their day, Creation spends far too much time with Darwin tucked away in their country home, with only an occasional visitor to bring them out of their doldrums. More importantly, this completely avoids the larger conflicts that Darwin faced with the outside world and their own position in it.
Earlier in life, Darwin studied to become a clergyman at Cambridge, where students were required to swear to the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion in the Anglican Church, and most of the scholars were ordained priests. They later spent five years on the HMS Beagle, meticulously studying geology and wildlife along the way.
Their observations convinced them of the evolution of species and led them to develop the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin spent another 20 years of experimenting and studying in order to improve their theory and gather evidence for it.
This promised to be no easy battle, and the entrenched powers in the Anglican Church and their hangers-on weren't likely to concede easily. But Darwin's painstaking labors and belief in the vast evidence they accumulated gave them the strength to persevere. As Ian Angus writes in the International Socialist Review:
These materialist methods led them to an entire materialist theory--at a time when materialism wasn't just unpopular in respectable circles, it was considered subversive and politically dangerous. Between 1838 and 1848, while they were first working out their ideas, England was swept by an unprecedented wave of mass actions, political protests and strikes. Radical ideas--materialist, atheistic ideas--were infecting the working class, leading many to expect (or fear) revolutionary change.
The challenge these ideas posed and the potential they had to shake up the scientific community are almost nowhere to be seen in the film. Instead, this whirlwind of experience and ideas that led Darwin to their theory are left as footnotes to an overwrought chamber play.
Amiel describes their approach to making the film in an interview with Filmmaker Magazine:
Feature films don't do abstract ideas so well. It deals with them best when it embeds those ideas in character conflicts. I think any great film that's produced any ideological change, whether it's Inherit the Wind or Z or Salvador, any film that makes a controversial, world-changing statement, they all succeed primarily because they are great drama first... As for the controversy, I really didn't want to see those awful scenes set in an oak-paneled room with a bunch of guys in black frock coats and big side whiskers standing up and going "No! Outrageous! Shocking! Scandalous!" It seemed unnecessary to do that.
But Inherit the Wind--a dramatization of the Scopes Monkey Trial pitting Creationists against the teaching of evolution--succeeded precisely because it reveled in the battle of ideas. Released in 1960, when the McCarthyite Hollywood blacklist had just barely ended, it is best remembered for a classic scene where Spencer Tracy puts Fredric March's Creationist attorney on the witness stand and forces them to explain who gave birth to Adam and Eve's grandchildren and justify the young age of the earth.
That is a film that lives and breathes ideas, and its characters come to life through them. Unfortunately, Creation avoids this approach and dwells in the misery of the suffering Darwin. The Victorian-era trappings of "frock coats and big side whiskers" remain--it's just the controversial ideas that are gone.
Amiel's previous films include the mediocre thrillers Copycat and Entrapment. Their last film was The Core, which featured a plan to detonate nuclear bombs at the center of the Earth in order to save the planet's electromagnetic field.
Unsurprisingly, the film has gained notoriety for its exceptionally bad science. None of this suggests that Amiel is a director interested in grappling with complicated ideas or controversy, historical or contemporary.
"There is grandeur in this view of life," Bettany tells us at the end of the film. Unfortunately, that is exactly what is missing from Creation.
In the darkest week in the league's history, one full of embarrassment and ugly turns, a nervous corporate executive or two probably pondered: What if the NFL ever stopped being the NFL? WSJ's Kevin Clark explains. Photo: Getty Images.
On the walls of 345 Park Avenue, the NFL's headquarters in New York, top executives have a framed copy of a headline that ran in this newspaper in 2011. It says "The League That Runs Television." This was after the league collected $27.9 billion in new TV money. And that was only part of their TV money.
The fact is, the league runs the television industry, the advertising industry, and nearly anything else that requires lots of eyeballs. The league claimed last year that 205 million unique people watched an NFL game....

A Pagan Anti-Capitalist Primer
By Alley Valkyrie and I, this 32-page zine is a brief overview of Capitalism, why it's horrible, and why every Pagan should resist it beautifully.
Best part? It's free! You can either read it online or download the print-ready version to make your own copy.
Peasants Had Great Teeth
That's one of the things you'll read in the Primer. Also, serfs gave 1/3 of their production to their lords; modern workers? 2/3rds. This is before taxes.
But we were talking about Peasants and their teeth. They had low levels of tooth decay, because their diets were really low in processed sugars. Because there were no processed sugars.
Thing is, they could still get broken or knocked out by land-lords. And that would have sucked.
So you can imagine how my friend Sannion feels. They broke one. And isn't a very good Capitalist, so doesn't have hoards of money sitting around to fix it. And could use your help.
Be well! And resist beautifully.
Nothing puts the exclamation mark on the culture of impunity that President Barack Obama's administration has enabled like the war on whistleblowers. As whistleblowers sit in prison or are effectively living in exile because they dared to call attention to crimes, misconduct or abuses of power, some of the very same officials implicated walk freely and live with the comfort of knowing the United States government will never seek to hold them accountable.
Jesselyn Radack is one of Snowden's defense lawyers and the director of the Government Accountability Project's National Security and Human Rights Division.  They are also a former Justice Department employee who blew the whistle on the Justice Department's efforts to conceal the torture of John Walker Lindh, who is also known as the “American Taliban.” They have worked on the cases of NSA whistleblower Thomas Drake and CIA whistleblower John Kiriakou. They advocated for military whistleblower Chelsea Manning during their trial and has spoken up about the war on whistleblowers and how it is really a war on information that is a war on journalism as well.
Radack joins the podcast to provide an update on Snowden, mark the one-year anniversary since Manning was convicted, discuss a Human Rights Watch/ACLU report on the impact of mass surveillance on journalists and lawyers, the “Insider Threat” program and to also highlight stories involving the CIA intercepting whistleblower communications, former NSA director Keith Alexander selling classified information to companies for millions of dollars and a draconian bill in Australia aimed at preventing spy leaks.
Following the interview, the show highlights the case of oncologist Dr. Rafil Dhafir, who used their own charity to raise money for Iraqis affected by depleted uranium until the government criminalized their activity, put them on trial and had them jailed.  They are currently in solitary confinement, and a phone number for the federal medical center where they are being held is provided to those who feel moved and want to urge the prison to let them out of solitary.

Paul Basagoitia – #irideforpaul
This year's Red Bull Rampage hosted another wild contest of mountain biking's best and bravest riders in the unique free ride competition. Five time Red Bull Rampage competitor, Paul Basagoitia, the two time Crankworx Whistler slopestyle winner and first rider to land a double backflip in natural terrain — was injured during their run at this year's Rampage finals on Oct. 16.
Paul was rushed by helicopter from the contest site with little word on their condition. The web broadcast stated that it was a minor leg injury but hours later we found out it was a bit more severe.
A fellow rider and friend who was also in the finals, Cam Zink posted this on their Instagram the day after the event:
“@camzink Everyone sends Paul Basagoitia positive vibes! This champion has started a long road to recovery after shattering their T12 vertebrae yesterday and undergoing 9 hours of surgery. They had a winning run going and may have set the record for biggest step down just before going down. Lots of tears have been shed. Keep Paul in your prayers to regain feeling in their legs. There were some horrible people spreading false news that they were OK, but they need your support more than ever to walk again. Paul, you are the most tenacious human and competitor ever. Love you bud! You'll be back!”
At Road 2 Recovery we fully understand their journey ahead. Road 2 Recovery has already been in contact with family and friends as well as event personnel. We have been sharing the knowledge of our board of directors (including Jimmy Button who has had a similar injury) and are currently laying out a path to recovery for them and their family. Unfortunately even the best insurance will fall short in many areas. To assist Paul and their family with the opportunity to get the best care available you can make a tax deductible donation in any amount on the special link provided here.
If you are on a mobile device make sure to go to the bottom of the page to use the specific Paul Basagoitia link. Please leave Paul a comment of encouragement below as well.

Update: Oct, 19th, 2015 from girlfriend Nichole Munk, “His chest tube that was put in to assist with access to their spine during surgery was removed today and they are such a fighter that they are already looking forward to rehab! This is all new territory for us and we are flooded with information right now, but they will beat this! Thank you to all the riders, sponsors, friends and people involved with the event that have shared their support”.

Every year, countless vacuums fall to the wayside after accumulated hair clogs the rapidly spinning brushes at the base of the appliance and tangles up within its attachments. My significant other and their copious amounts of long hair can spell out at least five minutes of tediously cutting away tangles from the brush after a floor sweep.
Dyson recently unveiled a new attachment -- labeled the "Tangle-free Turbine tool" -- for its expensive line of vacuums that promises to reduce hair entanglements that occur while cleaning. Instead of a horizontal spinning brush, Dyson's $69 accessory uses a vertical axis of movement. The device features two flexible counter-rotating heads with built-in brushes that actually send hair past the spinners and into the vacuum bin.
A video from Dyson highlighting the story behind the tool states that this invention involved more than 50 engineers, 187 prototypes, and four years of research and development to perfect the process.
The results of the brush, which only works with the DC19 onward (excluding DC24 and cordless) could borrow from the motto of a famous baby shampoo: "No more tangles!"
With all of the growth that we've experienced in the world wide fat-bike tribe in the last five years, we have lot's of new fat-bikers that might be looking down the barrels of their first Global Fat Bike Day celebration. Like all holidays, GFBD has traditions, so we thought that we'd share some of the GFBD culture that we've experienced along the way and ask the question to our audience, “How do you Celebrate Global Fat-Bike Day?”
GFBD Celebrations can be as large or as small as you like. You could take a selfie on your solo cruise, and share it with the world; or get together with your bicycle family and have a small or mid-sized gathering; or perhaps, bring your bike family to a larger group celebration ride! GFBD is the first Saturday in December. If you have a scheduling conflict with Saturday, then ride on Friday or Sunday. GFBD is about FUN and freedom. This is a day to ride your bike for FUN! All bikes are welcome at GFBD celebrations. If you own a fatty, GFBD is the perfect time to let someone that comes to the ride on their 29'r, ride a fatty for the first time (by lending them yours). If you have more than one fat-bike, introduce your roadie friend or your dirt jump amigos to the fun side of fat-bikes. What if you want to go to a race on GFBD? If racing is how you like to have FUN, then definitely go for it! Be sure to wish your fellow racers a Happy Global Fat-Bike Day! So by now, I hope you get the idea that GFBD centers around FUN!
GFBD GROUP RIDES take on many forms. In the upper Great Lakes, the weather in early December usually makes for an interesting forecast, that sometimes throws a real curve ball; but if you ride in the winter, you eventually learn to hit curve balls by maybe – going to the opposite field (as in) a beach ride or a Booze Cruise. I'm a big fan of the ‘pot-luck' tradition and in Wisconsin, we have a solid tailgating game. A pot-luck tailgate party at the trailhead, or a picnic/warming shelter with a big ole campfire is one of our GFBD traditions along with cervesas y agua fria. One tradition that's part of all of my group rides, is Derby. DERBY is a game (Explained Here) that has always been a part of GFBD rides, that I've attended in Wisconsin. Derby is a great tradition. Blaze Orange is a tradition and a necessity in Wisconsin, because GFBD coincides with deer gun season. I usually try to hide a cooler of beverages out along the route, where the group can gather for a beer and a quick meeting of the Safety Committee, before heading back; and that is what we call the art of bicycle chillification, right here, in America's Dairyland. Bicycle chillification is a core tradition of GFBD. Several GFBD rides (in the US) hold Toys for Tots donation drives in a true act of kindness during GFBD. Kindness is a pretty great Global Fat-Bike tradition to embrace.
GFBD celebrates the social aspect of riding fat-bikes! I've met hundreds of incredibly fun people through the bicycle community and GFBD is one of those beautiful opportunities, for all of us, to connect and celebrate all of the good things that life has to offer. This year, my wife and I are going to join 300+ Santas (along with Sven & JK Livin) to celebrate GFBD at the Santa Cycle Rampage in Milwaukee. I guess another of GFBD's traditions is not being very traditional and celebrating free thinking. As long as you're riding a bike and having fun, I think you're probably on target for a successful GFBD mission. GFBD celebrates “the Ride” and the Ride is the prize that goes to the GFBD winners (which is everyone that has fun).

On last week's Dose of Fat I asked Chris Daisy if they had any GFBD Traditions at their celebration and they mentioned that BBR Test Pilot Dave Krueger had brewed a batch of beer for their ride. I thought that was such a great idea and that's what got me going on this long winded, well intentioned, ramble about the potential cornucopia of traditions that folks from around the world follow on GFBD. So I open it up to all of you out there in fat-bike land. How does your tribe celebrate and what are your Global Fat-Bike Day traditions?

Washington — Lawmakers in the U.S. Senate have dropped self-driving trucks from legislation from that would allow automakers to operate thousands of autonomous cars per year on U.S. roads. The action came after a high-profile campaign from labor unions to protect the jobs of professional drivers.
The measure, drafted with input from U.S. Sen. Gary Peters, D-Bloomfield Township, would allow automakers each to operate more than 100,000 self-driving cars per year on U.S. roads. But commercial trucks are excluded under a bipartisan agreement that was reached between Peters and U.S. Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., who is chairperson of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.
Both lawmakers touted the agreement to move forward on the self-driving bill without trucks as a necessary compromise to keep the autonomous vehicle legislation moving in Congress. They said the Commerce Committee will hold a hearing on the revised legislation on Wednesday.
“This legislation proposes commonsense changes in law to keep pace with advances in self-driving technology,” Thune, who had argued in favor of including trucks in the self-driving bill, said in a statement.
Peters, a member of the Senate Commerce Committee who was opposed to including trucks in the legislation, added: “Self-driving vehicles will completely revolutionize the way we get around in the future, and it is vital that public policy keep pace with these rapidly developing lifesaving technologies that will be on our roads in a matter of years.”
Trucking groups expressed disappointment that they lost out in the fight over whether commercial vehicles should be included in the self-driving legislation. They had pressed lawmakers to offer the same protections for self-driving truck operators they are considering for autonomous cars.
“If more automated cars and trucks are to share the roads, they should also share the same framework,” American Trucking Associations President and CEO Chris Spear said in a statement, arguing that lawmakers will still have to address the advent of self-driving trucks in the near future.
“Delaying an inevitable, commonsense solution will only make the issues surrounding more automated trucks more difficult to deal with,” Spear said.
Labor unions mounted an aggressive campaign against the inclusion of commercial vehicles like trucks in the self-driving legislation, pointing out that they could cost thousands of professional drivers their jobs. They applauded lawmakers in the Senate for agreeing to move forward without trucks in the self-driving legislation.
“This approach will give Congress more time to thoroughly examine how driverless technology will impact the jobs, wages, and safety of bus and truck drivers, and develop a plan to address these concerns,” said AFL-CIO Transportation Trades Department President Larry Willis.
Automakers applauded lawmakers in the Senate for reaching an agreement to move the self-driving bill forward.
“Legislation like the bill introduced today will allow manufacturers to conduct more testing and to safely deploy self-driving vehicles to realize the safety, mobility, congestion, environmental, land-use and other benefits of this transformative technology,” General Motors Co. said in a statement.
The Washington, D.C.-based Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents major auto manufacturers, added: “Chairman Thune's and Senator Peters' bipartisan leadership on the AV START Act will help advance self-driving technologies and help keep the United States at the forefront of these innovations.”
The Senate's self-driving measure would allow the Secretary of Transportation to grant exemptions to federal motor vehicle rules that require cars to have human operators. Initially, 50,000 cars per automaker could be operated if companies can prove they meet existing safety standards for traditional cars. After a 12-month period, the number of exemptions per manufacturer would increase to 75,000, and it would go up to 100,000 in the third year.
Automakers would be able to apply for exemptions to operate more than 100,000 self-driving cars after five years under the proposed legislation. The current limit for such exemptions to federal auto standards is 2,500 cars for two years at a time.
A similar measure that would allow automakers each to operate up to 100,000 self-driving cars per year on U.S. roads was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives earlier this month.
Both versions of the proposed legislation prohibit states and other local jurisdictions from adopting regulations related to cars' design, construction, software or communication. States still would be allowed to regulate registration, licensing, liability, education and training, insurance or traffic laws.
The new proposed exemptions would apply to vehicles in which there is a system that operates with the expectation that a human driver will take over upon being prompted. The legislation would also cover cars with high automation levels, where the automated driving can perform maneuvers even if a human driver does not take over when promoted – and for full automation, when the automated system is responsible for all driving tasks.

Edward Snowden, who worked as a contract employee at the National Security Agency, is pictured in Hong Kong in June 2013. (Guardian/Associated Press)
In June 2013, reporters at The Washington Post and the Guardian ran a series of stories about the U.S. government's surveillance programs. According to documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency was harvesting huge swaths of online traffic — far beyond what had been disclosed — and was working directly with top Internet companies to spy on certain people.
Glenn Greenwald, one of the Guardian journalists who reported the disclosures and a surveillance skeptic, argued in a 2014 TED talk that privacy is a critical feature of open society. People act differently when they know they're being watched. “Essential to what it means to be a free and fulfilled human being is to have a place that we can go and be free of the judgmental eyes of other people,” they said.
Privacy advocates have argued that widespread government surveillance has had a “chilling effect” — it encourages meekness and conformity. If we think that authorities are watching our online actions, we might stop visiting certain websites or not say certain things just to avoid seeming suspicious.
The problem, though, is that it's difficult to judge the effect of government-spying programs. How do you collect all the utterances that people stopped themselves from saying? How do you count all the conversations that weren't had?
A new study provides some insight into the repercussions of the Snowden revelations, arguing that they happened so swiftly and were so high-profile that they triggered a measurable shift in the way people used the Internet.
Jonathon Penney, a PhD candidate at Oxford, analyzed Wikipedia traffic in the months before and after the NSA's spying became big news in 2013. Penney found a 20 percent decline in page views on Wikipedia articles related to terrorism, including those that mentioned “al-Qaeda,” “car bomb” or “Taliban.”
"You want to have informed citizens," Penney said. "If people are spooked or deterred from learning about important policy matters like terrorism and national security, this is a real threat to proper democratic debate."
Even though the NSA was supposed to target only foreigners, the immense scale of its operations caused many to worry that innocent Americans were getting caught in the dragnet. A Pew survey in 2015 showed that about 40 percent of Americans were “very” or “somewhat” concerned that the government was spying on their online activities.
The same survey showed that about 87 percent of American adults were aware of the Snowden news stories. Of those people, about a third said they had changed their Internet or phone habits as a result. For instance, 13 percent said they “avoided using certain terms” online; and 14 percent said they were having more conversations face to face instead of over the phone. The sudden, new knowledge about the surveillance programs had increased their concerns about their privacy.
Penney's research, which is forthcoming in the Berkeley Technology Law Journal, echoes the results of a similar study conducted last year on Google Search data. Alex Marthews, a privacy activist, and Catherine Tucker, a professor at MIT's business school, found that Google activity for certain keywords fell after the Snowden stories were splashed on every front page. Both in the United States and in other countries, people became reluctant to search for terrorism-related words such as “dirty bomb” or “pandemic.”
Penney focused on Wikipedia pages related to sensitive topics specifically flagged by the Department of Homeland Security. In a document provided to its analysts in 2011, the DHS listed 48 terrorism terms that they should use when “monitoring social media sites.” Penney collected traffic data on the English Wikipedia pages most closely related to those terms.
This chart from the paper shows how the number of views dropped after the June 2013 news articles. The amount of traffic immediately dropped and stayed low for the subsequent 14 months.
accounts for 43 percent of English Wikipedia traffic, more than any other country.
Penney narrowed the list to the most suspicious-sounding articles, as judged by an online survey they administered. The results became even more dramatic.
Here, in black, are the combined monthly traffic totals for the Wikipedia pages related to the 31 top words on the DHS list. In the year and a half before the Snowden revelations, traffic to these pages was rising. After June 2013, traffic not only fell immediately, but continued to decline over the next dozen months.
For comparison, the chart also shows the combined page views for 25 Wikipedia pages that are security-related but not terrorism-related. These are less provocative articles containing the words “Border patrol” or “Central Intelligence Agency.” There was a slight but statistically insignificant dip in traffic for these pages, which makes sense because people may not be as worried about visiting these kinds of pages.
The Wikipedia data suggest that the Snowden revelations had a noticeable impact on people's Wikipedia behaviors, says Penney. “I expected to find an immediate drop-off in June, and then people would slowly realize that nobody is going to jail for viewing Wikipedia articles, and the traffic would go back up,” they said. “I was surprised to see what looks to be a longer-term impact from the revelations.”
Penney has provided evidence that spying programs, once the public knows about them, cause collateral damage. It's unlikely, of course, that the patterns here were caused by actual terrorists changing their Internet habits.
Instead, the study suggests that the shift in Wikipedia traffic was the result of people who stifled their curious impulses because they didn't want to seem like they were doing anything wrong. “This is measuring regular people who are being spooked by the idea of government surveillance online,” Penney said.
That's one plausible conclusion we could draw from the data. There is, however, an alternative explanation for these results.
The Snowden revelations ignited a huge debate about the NSA. Stories about government surveillance dominated the news cycle for months. Perhaps people stopped looking at terrorism-related Wikipedia articles not because the Snowden leaks made them paranoid, but because the news distracted them from their previous curiosity about terrorism.
In other words, maybe it wasn't a “chilling effect” that caused the dip in terrorism-related Wikipedia traffic — but rather the short attention spans of online audiences.
It will require more research to fully understand what happened. But even if the evidence is still being examined, chilling effects continue to occupy a prominent position in privacy debates.
In March 2015, the American Civil Liberties United filed a lawsuit in federal district court challenging the NSA's surveillance practices, with Wikipedia's parent organization as one of the eight plaintiffs. Writing with their colleague Lila Tretikov in the New York Times, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales accused the NSA of tracking Wikipedia users:
So imagine, now, a Wikipedia user in Egypt who wants to edit a page about government opposition or discuss it with fellow editors. If that user knows the N.S.A. is routinely combing through their contributions to Wikipedia, and possibly sharing information with their government, they will surely be less likely to add their knowledge or have that conversation, for fear of reprisal.
The result, argued Wales and Tretikov, “represents a loss for everyone who uses Wikipedia and the Internet — not just fellow editors, but hundreds of millions of readers in the United States and around the world.”
In October, a judge threw out the case, declaring that the plaintiffs "have not alleged facts that plausibly establish an injury attributable to the NSA's Upstream surveillance." In other words, there wasn't enough evidence that anyone was harmed. The decision has been appealed.

The New York Times is reporting that Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III is in possession of a draft of a letter laying out a rationale for Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey, prepared at President Trump's urging by aide Stephen Miller in the days leading up to Comey's dismissal. White House counsel Donald F. McGahn III stopped the pair from finalizing and sending the letter, according to the report, because of its “problematic” contents.
“It is unclear how much of Mr. Trump's rationale focuses on the Russia investigation,” the Times reports, “although Mr. Trump told aides at the time they were angry that Mr. Comey refused to publicly say that Mr. Trump themselves was not under investigation.”
This revelation needs to be read along with Trump's tweet from this morning:
Wow, looks like James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton long before the investigation was over...and so much more. A rigged system! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 1, 2017
Trump's tweet shows that they are working hard to deflect attention from the special counsel's investigation by reviving their claims that it is Hillary Clinton, not he, who broke the law, and that a “system” that would absolve them and investigate them is “rigged.”
But the Times piece reminds us that Mueller's probe is proceeding in a very serious manner, regardless of Trump's efforts to deflect from it. And indeed, their efforts to resuscitate attacks on Comey and Clinton look more desperate, and transparently stupid, than ever.
Let's try to unpack what Trump was trying to say here. In their tweet, Trump was apparently referring to a letter, written two days ago by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley and committee member Lindsey Graham, to current FBI Director Christopher Wray.
The six-page letter demands further information about whether former FBI Director James Comey acted inappropriately when, in 2016, they began drafting a statement concluding that Hillary Clinton should not be criminally charged for using a private email server as Secretary of State, two months before the FBI closed the investigation. The letter, dated August 30, was posted on the Judiciary Committee's website, and it was quickly picked up by the media yesterday. Grassley and Graham said in the letter that they suspected that Comey did this, based on information that emerged from an internal Justice Department look at the FBI's handling of Clinton's emails.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked about this letter during yesterday's press briefing with reporters. They insisted that this supposedly shocking revelation is proof that Trump had good reason to fire Comey — ten months later. “I think that would certainly give cause and reason that Jim Comey was not the right person to lead the FBI,” they told reporters, although they offered no evidence that this was the “cause and reason” in Trump's mind when they fired the FBI director on May 9.
Sanders was trying to rewrite history, by hinting that Trump could not possibly have obstructed justice in the Russia investigation by firing Comey, because they had good reason to do so — Comey's botching of the Clinton investigation. Trump's tweet today reiterated this idea.
But come on. Trump themselves admitted on national television that they fired Comey because of the Russia probe, saying flat out that it was because “this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story.” But in this White House, not even the president's own words can be permitted to interfere with their ongoing effort to grasp at whatever they can to vindicate them in the Russia probe.
What's more, all sentient Americans will remember the history here. The notion that Comey somehow let Clinton off the hook is absurd. It's true that Comey announced in July 2016 that the investigation into their emails was over. But Comey's press conference was harshly critical of Clinton, calling them “extremely careless,” something that may have contravened Department of Justice policy and which Trump and Republicans continually exploited throughout the campaign. And Comey revived the focus on supposed Clinton wrongdoing when they announced they were re-opening the investigation into Anthony Wiener's laptop just before the election — something Republicans also exploited.
In Trump's telling, though, Clinton was given some special kid-glove treatment, and they are a victim of the “deep state.”
The White House must believe the public to be dimwitted, because Sanders' effort to prop up their boss falls to pieces under the most basic scrutiny. It's obvious that Trump is trying to litigate, in the court of public opinion at least, a claim that they did not obstruct justice in firing Comey, a sure sign that Mueller's investigation into their possible obstruction of justice has them very worried.
But this is also destructive in another way. Like Trump's previous accusations that the Russia investigation is a “witch hunt” and a “hoax,” he's again trying to undermine public confidence in an investigation which, after all, is supposed to establish what Russia did to sabotage our democracy.
This afternoon's Times scoop strongly suggests Trump has good reason to worry about the focus on their possible obstruction of justice. The Wall Street Journal reported last night that Trump's legal team has been trying, in meetings and memos, to convince Mueller that Trump committed no wrongdoing in firing Comey. One memo, the Journal reported, “laid out the case that Mr. Trump has the inherent authority under the constitution to hire and fire as they see fit and therefore didn't obstruct justice” in firing Comey. Another “outlined why Mr. Comey would make an unsuitable witness, calling them prone to exaggeration, unreliable in congressional testimony and the source of leaks to the news media.”
Trump's latest efforts to deflect attention from the Mueller probe — with this latest silly attack on Comey — would be laughable if the constitutional and national security stakes weren't so dire. Mueller's team, by all accounts, will just keep doing its work. But going forward, Trump and their defenders are likely to kick up a firestorm of renewed “but their emails!” distractions from the Russia probe. In the right-wing media, these efforts will likely get a lot of backup. But with Trump's approval ratings hovering in the low 30s, it's likely only their most diehard supporters will fall for it.
If you were one of the 3,000 people who attended the Natural Products Expo in Anaheim, Calif., in 1981, you would have been surrounded by Birkenstocks, the smell of patchouli, and you might even have been tagged granola or hippie, yourself, for going. That's because in 1981, the so-called health foods like tofu, smoothies, and brown rice featured at Expo were very far outside the mainstream American diet. Talking about organic, natural, and whole foods, was enough to qualify someone as “one of those health food nuts from California.”
Fast-forward 35 years to this year's trade show, which wrapped up Sunday. This year's 75,000 attendees and exhibitors represent the brands you're likely buying at a mainstream supermarket. Walmart, even. The granolafication of America is almost complete: what used to be health food is now, simply, what America eats. The hippies were right.
While Natural Products Expo used to be a niche convention, today it's anything but. Without question, it is the single most important trade show in the food and beverage consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry. In fact, those in the business find it hard to get much done the week of the show since most sales, marketing, innovation, R&D, product development, and other teams are OOO for 3 days and a weekend.
But Expo is so much more than a convention. It's become the place where big CPG companies like General Mills , Nestle , Campbell's, Smuckers, and Pepsico (all of whom visited our booth) come to scout for potential acquisitions. It's the place where private equity sniffs around for opportunity; and if you're in the innovation business, as I am, Expo is the place you go to absorb what's trending, gain inspiration from competitive product launches, and take this free insight home to inform what's next.
Expo is also the place to launch new products. This year, it was home to the exciting launch of a new trade organization.
Beef, eggs, and chicken all have representation in Washington, D.C. thanks to their lobbying arms: The National Cattlemen's Beef Association, The American Egg Board, and The National Chicken Council. It's about time that plants had the same voice. The brand-new Plant Based Foods Association officially launched at this year's Expo West. The organization of 23 food companies (including Califia Farms, Daiya Foods, and Tofurky) will, “engage in education, promotion, and advance policies to meet the increasing consumer demand for plant-based foods.”
We used to call plant-based foods vegan. Today we avoid the V-word, for the unpalatable images it conjures of tasteless tofu and watery lentil stews. Today, plant-based foods represent a large and growing part of the grocery business, estimated at $3.5 billion excluding what's sold at Whole Foods (which is significant). With the Plant Based Foods Association's insider connections, especially Elizabeth Kucinich, wife of former U.S. House of Representatives Dennis Kucinich, the organization is poised to make quick inroads on topics like shifting government recommendations on what Americans should eat: from animal to plant-based foods.
And plant-based foods were everywhere at Expo. Daiya introduced a line of dairy-free mac-n-cheese, along with creamy salad dressings like ranch and blue cheese. Sir Kensington took a shot at Hampton Creek with their banner taunting, “Taste the Latest Chapter of Eggless Innovation.” Their plant-based Fabanaise is not only free of eggs, but utilizes a waste stream ingredient: aquafaba, the protein-rich liquid that's a by-product of cooking (and processing) chickpeas. Talk about packing a bunch of trends into a single product!
Here are a few things I thought were interesting.
Portable, shelf-stable versions of real food were everywhere. The easiest way to do this? Get the water out! I tasted hundreds of products made by roasting, baking, dehydrating, or freeze-drying whole, sliced, or cut fruits, vegetables, and even meat.
There was beef jerky in every aisle: mixed with fruit, honey glazed and flame-grilled, made from grass-fed beef or filet mignon. Vegetable snacks continue to grow, like the vivid maroon beet chips from Rhythm Superfoods. An interesting spa water fruit mix from Mercer foods uses dehydrated whole fruit to flavor water.
Snapz is an interesting line of vacuum-dehydrated foods with a true taste that comes from starting with the real thing. Their frankfurter slices and cheesy poof snacks are made from real hotdogs and 100% edam cheese. These products tap into consumers' desire for authentic, real foods that don't feel fake, yet offer the convenience and snackability that defines the way most people eat these days.
I'm a believer that gluten-free (GF) is here to stay, but there were way more companies offering GF products than there is a market for in the long run. Right now, the natural channel is a gluten-free-for-all. I think we'll see a shakeout of companies that have built their entire business proposition on GF. The issue is that a cookie brand that stands for nothing but GF is narrow and limited and, frankly, at risk. It's just too easy for an established cookie brand with great breadth to launch a few key GF items in their portfolio. The barrier to entry is nothing but a good formula.
Say goodbye to any lingering love of the non-fat foods of the late-80s and early 90s. Fat is back! Healthy fat, that is. All around the show were examples of products not just calling out the type of fat they contain, but touting fat as a beneficial ingredient. Avocado oil, algae oil, coconut oil, grapeseed oil, grass-fed butter, and clarified butter, were just a few. You can buy the oils, but also products made with them, like Kettle Brand's line of potato chips fried in avocado oil.
Americans were recently told by the government to reduce sugar consumption, and as a result, we're going to start seeing savory versions of typically sweet foods. The whole yogurt category has been under pressure for high levels of added sugar. Yogurt-maker Chobani launched a line of yogurt dips, which don't use sugar at all. It's a great way to diversify a product portfolio.
Those convenient packets and cups of breakfast oatmeal may contain added sugar. So, oats have crossed the daypart barrier into lunch and dinner. Grainful's Steel Cut Meals and Steel Cut Sides are savory oat-based meals and mixes that prove the versatility of this heart-healthy grain. They come in flavors like Cheesy Oats and Tomato Risotto: both sans sugar.
And lastly, I want to mention Spice & Simmer from TastyBite. This shelf-stable product taps into the completely separate dinner kit trend. Instead of needing to sign up for a subscription (like Blue Apron or Plated), you can buy this product at Whole Foods and keep it in your pantry. The clever 3-component kit is a simple, foolproof way to make Indian food. For those who would never attempt daunting Indian recipes at home, it's a culinary experience made simple with your fresh ingredients. Exotic, fresh, and simple. Welcome to health food, 2016.
Note: my colleague Barbara Brueckner-Shpizner will be compiling a much more exhaustive summary of Expo 2016. Email me if you'd like to receive a copy.

Westworld is built on loops. The series is explicitly about repetition and the breakdowns repetitions eventually bring about — especially if you pay close enough attention — so it's fitting that its first season ended with a spectacular reenactment. Ford has made the biggest loop of all. The church we've seen in flashbacks has been rebuilt, the town around it has been unearthed and restored. The first and biggest surprise is that Ford's long-awaited "new" narrative, titled "Journey Into Night" — a narrative we've watched them plan with their younger self with apparent excitement — begins with Ford's death at Dolores' hands.
This is an apparent reprise of their partner Arnold's death over three decades earlier. "That is the gun you used to kill Arnold," Ford tells Dolores before going out to address the guests at the gala. "You were always drawn to it, so I had Bernard leave it somewhere where you might find it." It's less a command than a suggestion, and that's supposed to be the point. This is Dolores' opportunity to develop free will. "Journey Into Night" begins, Ford tells their audience, "in a time of war, with a villain named Wyatt. And a killing, this time by choice." The show has been shot through with allusions to gods and "blood sacrifice." This is a historical reenactment, and to hear Ford tell it, it's an intensification of the original. Arnold killed themselves through Dolores — or so Ford thought at the time. This time, the blood to be spilled is Ford's, and Dolores will pull the trigger because they choose to. And they do!
It's a stunning development, no question. We've spent so much time watching Maeve and Dolores gearing up for a revolution — and fearing that it would somehow be scripted and neutered out of significance when it came — that it's both rewarding and gutting to have something with permanent stakes take place. The Man in Black (aka William) agrees. He's long wished that the hosts could fight back, and Ed Harris looks positively tickled when the army of decommissioned robots show up like Birnam Wood and shoot them in the shoulder. We've all, it seems, been aching for consequences.
But as satisfying as this all is, much of the finale gave the impression of conclusiveness, of questions answered, without actually offering much in the way of persuasive detail. Listening to Ford's latest monologue, I kept thinking of the inadequacy of Logan's "visceral demonstration" of Dolores' essence when they cut their open. Logan intended to prove to William that Dolores was fake. Technically, they did. But Billy remained unconvinced because exposing Dolores' mechanical guts was a) a fantastically violent answer to a question no one was asking and b) a disappointingly literal approach to a philosophical problem. There's a mismatch between the truth test Logan came up with and the truth it was testing.
The finale suffers from a similar problem. What does it really mean, for instance, that Arnold merged Dolores with the Wyatt character? This is supposed to explain something, and yes, we do indeed see Arnold upload this storyline into Dolores. This proves, I guess, that their murder spree was scripted and therefore not the ideal rise to consciousness we've been waiting for. But what happens when two characters are merged in this way? Why did the Wyatt script go dormant for so long? Why is it back?
If the answer to all these things is, one way or another, "Ford," that's more than disappointing. For one thing, it muddies which parts of Dolores' rise were programmed storylines and which parts were genuine maze-solving breakthroughs. Was their sudden aggression toward the Man in Black, for example, just a sneak peek of Wyatt's return, as programmed by Ford? Or was it a hint of their "true" aggression, generated by their suffering in that moment as they realize who they are? Similarly, does their rise to self-awareness, their interview with herself, mean she's managed to override Ford's Wyatt programming even though Wyatt is also back? Or is Dolores consciously adapting Wyatt's aggression — an available script — for their own ends (just as they adapted that speech about pain in a conversation with Arnold)? Dolores' development is one of the things we care most about in this show, but for all the time we've spent with them and with theories of consciousness, the mechanism driving it is still way too fuzzy. Do Dolores' breakthroughs change their programming? What explains their final climb to consciousness? The repetitions? The suffering? Wyatt? Arnold? William? Ford?
We could ask similar questions of Maeve. We know, thanks to Bernard, that their apparent leap into a sentient fugitive was, as we feared, scripted. But what does this mean? Whose storyline is this? Yes, there's code that looks like it was modified by "Arnold," but we still have no idea what that means in the most literal terms. Has Ford been somehow coding as Arnold? If so, why? If not, then the fact that other hosts have been talking to "Arnold" too means that something is afoot and we should really know what that is by now. And how much of the story of Maeve's awakening do we lose by the revelation that it was programmed all along? Were the drawings they made and hid for themselves to find scripted? We kind of need to know whether Maeve was part of Ford's new storyline all along, or whether they were manifesting someone else's plans, and whether any part of what happened was theirs alone in order to understand what their journey in the finale means.
We also don't know what their break from the storyline means philosophically for the story — or if it was a break at all. Maeve's code showed they had an ESCAPE storyline, but that script assumed she'd reach the mainland. Does their decision to turn back mean that she's achieved free will? Have they broken with their own scripts? Or is this just another instance of the million ways the park is designed to keep them there, as Sylvester suggested?
The lack of clarity on any of these points robs them of resonance.
Westworld's real problem, though — the source of this uncertainty — might be a lack of definition when it comes to Robert Ford himself. Ford is both the ultimate arbiter of reality in the park while also being its most unreliable narrator. Instead of developing as a character, Ford has spent the season personality- and conviction-hopping. (It's a testament to Hopkins' acting that they make these gaps in characterization seem nonexistent.) I said last week that the version of Ford we saw in Episode 9 seemed puzzlingly omnipotent compared to former iterations, which seemed powerful but capable of doubt (remember when they caught a glimpse of the maze on the domino table and went running to their office to consult Arnold's notebooks? Why, given how perfectly they seem to understand the maze in the finale, was they so concerned?)
This week, he's leveled up and become Savior Ford, a Christ figure willing to die for beliefs we've never seen them espouse either publicly or privately. Ford's speech and their actions retcon them into a noble figure when most of what we've seen them do suggests the contrary. We've seen Ford brag about their godlike achievements, ambition, and willingness to sacrifice others. Only two episodes ago, they said "one life is a small price to pay for the dominion I shall acquire." This is a man with big plans; this is not a man with a death wish. This is a guy who channels their childhood disappointments into a hunger for power: "My father told me to be satisfied with my lot in life. That the world owed me nothing. And so I made my own world. Tell me Dolores: Do you remember the man I used to be?" (What does this mean? What man did they used to be?)
It could be argued that because both the foregoing statements were delivered to hosts, they're intrinsically untrustworthy. Maybe Ford's trying to shock them into consciousness by showing them how awful humans are. Maybe, like the Man in Black, they perform cruelty to torture them into sentience. (I confess this strategy never made much sense to me — the guests of Westworld seem perfectly capable of causing the hosts massive suffering without Ford or William's help. That seemed to be the whole problem.)
So let's look instead at a speech Ford delivers to a human being. Remember how Not-Savior Ford explained their understanding of consciousness to Theresa before killing her? The whole dramatic point of a typical villain's monologue — a confession delivered safe in the knowledge that the recipient will soon be dead — is that it's honest because it has no reason not to be. It's as good a test of Ford's real feelings as we're likely to find in a show this cagey. "I read the theory once that the human intellect was like peacock feathers, just an extravagant display intended to attract a mate," Ford says.
All art, literature, William Shakespeare and Michelangelo and the Empire State Building, just an elaborate mating ritual. Maybe it doesn't matter that we've accomplished so much for the basest of reasons, but of course the peacock can barely fly. It lives in the dirt, pecking insects out of the muck, consoling itself with its great beauty. I have come to think of so much of consciousness as a burden, a weight, and we have spared them that. Anxiety, self-loathing, guilt. The hosts are the ones who are free. Free here, under my control. "
This is not a definition of freedom that squares easily with Ford's new account of themselves in the finale as a broken man completing their 30-year quest to fix their mistake and free the hosts. (Nor, despite explicitly mentioning Michelangelo, is it a vision of art that maps on particularly well to their fascinating take on The Creation of Adam in the finale.) Ford just doesn't make very much sense: The man tells Theresa he's "not the sentimental type," but they keep a robot version of their family in the woods, builds themselves an Arnold-clone, and claims the grief they felt at their partner's passing led them to understand the link between suffering and sentience and free their creation.
One way to reconcile Hero Ford with Villain Ford is to conclude that the power-hungry version was real. Maybe Villain Ford printed a host version of themselves in that lab where they killed Theresa, and maybe Dolores killed that instead of the human version. Or maybe Ford hopes to dispense with their human form and live forever as a host (therefore becoming the music, as they say Mozart and Beethoven did in their final speech.) Maybe they were a host all along. What a disappointment all three solutions would be, though. Any of these would rob the finale of its most arresting, most astonishing moment.
The risk of a show as intricately composed as Westworld is that it invites you to read its loops through a loupe yourself. By inviting the viewer to look for inconsistencies at a resolution so fine you sometimes need to analyze screenshots to tell time periods apart, it accepts that it needs to nail every detail perfectly. This is a series with exceptional acting, freakishly gorgeous cinematography, mind-bending ideas, and beautiful speeches, but as long as it kept us in suspense as to what was really happening, its handling of character development was hard to judge. Now we can, and it's somewhat ironic that the hosts — Bernard, Maeve, Dolores, even Lawrence — are much more fleshed out as characters than the human beings whose histories we've been trying to piece together all season. William's arc — which was finally joined to the Man in Black's — was almost as underwhelming as Ford's (and not just because Jimmi Simpson and Ed Harris deliver very different performances). Defined more by narrative backstories explaining how they've changed than by observable arcs, the Man in Black and Robert Ford are the least believable inhabitants of the world they own and created, respectively. Here's hoping Season 2 leaves their mysteries behind.

WEST SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (WWLP)-- In a decision made Tuesday, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that the names of jurors who serve in criminal cases are to be available to the public.
The new ruling means that if you serve on a jury, your name will become public record by the end of the trial at the latest, but the decision that isn't sitting well with everyone. Those opposed to the ruling argue it will create harassment and other risks for those jurors.
While those in support of the decision, like Jana Seiler of West Springfield, told 22News that deciding if someone committed a serious crime or not is a big deal, and they want to know who's behind making that decision.
"I think everybody has a right to know who sat on that jury and made that decision, especially the family of the victim or of the person being accused," Seiler said.
Attorney Justin Dion told 22News that it seems the intention of the ruling is to promote an open judicial system, but along with safety concerns, there are additional risks of the jury getting pressure by those involved the trial to sway them one way or the other.
"The concern is really about safety for the jurors and making sure that they are not going to issue a decision in a conservative manner, because they are concerned about the public outcome," Dion said.
Dion said the change won't impact the Boston Marathon bombing suspect's trial, because that case is being carried out on the federal level.

Next year's edition of City v Country will be the traditional fixture's last.
The NRL has scrapped NSW Rugby League's annual City v Country clash, with the last-ever edition to be played in Mudgee next year.
City v Country has been played annually since 1928, but its run will come to an end in 2017, ending a 89-year-old fixture.
The traditional fixture has often doubled up as a State of Origin audition for aspiring New South Wales players.
The final farewell in Mudgee will see some of the greatest players to ever represent Australia honoured before the match.
Country Rugby League chief executive Terry Quinn said they were determined to see off the historic match in style.
"Country NSW has produced some of the finest players to wear the green and gold and we will pay tribute to them during this final match," Quinn said.
"Players like Mick Cronin, Blocker Roach, Boyd Cordner, Tyson Frizell and so many others learnt their craft in country areas and went on to become greats in our game."
NSWRL chief Dave Trodden said that City players had enjoyed playing in matches against the country teams over the years.
"The Country-City clash is one of the most exciting days on the Rugby League calendar for the host country town," Trodden said.
"This match will be a great opportunity for fans in the country to see some of the state's best players in action as we say farewell to this special event."
The 2016 edition saw City shock Country 44-30 in front of over 8,000 fans.
In just 21 minutes on Thursday, the Atherton High School school-based decision making council ended weeks of discussion and debate on how transgendered students are treated by passing a policy that allows students to use the restroom and locker room of their sexual identity.
Atherton principal Thomas Aberli said the council, which voted 8-1 in support of the policy at a special meeting, took a stand on the issue that will last for "this administration and all further administrations."
"I hope other schools are paying attention to this issue," Aberli said.

RELATED: Atherton Oks transgender non-discrimination policy
Henry Brousseau, a transgender student who will be a junior at Louisville Collegiate School this fall, said they and their mother were paying attention to the outcome at Atherton.
Their mother spoke in support of the new policy at the Tuesday council meeting when it was first read, and they said it's heartwarming that they stood up for transgender rights in Louisville.
They said they hope the action taken at Atherton will push Jefferson County Public Schools to take an official stand on the issue.
Atherton previously passed a nondiscrimination policy, which bars discrimination based on a range of factors, including age, race or sexual orientation — but goes a step beyond a similar districtwide policy by also including gender identity.

Before I get started, I want to make it clear that I am an avid fan of Rand Fishkin and the Moz community; their ethical approach to SEO and the TAGFEE ethos is both highly commendable and genuinely enriching for the wider Internet community. This article does not set out to belittle or condemn any of the valuable journalistic and research-led work that Moz produces.
With that said, it is becoming increasingly frustrating to read updates on Fishkin's shock when Google penalizes his/related sites. Take their latest Tweet and Moz blog post, for example.
That feeling I get when Google Webmaster Tools' tells someone a totally legit link is "inorganic": pic.twitter.com/7fd773enyG — Rand Fishkin (@randfish) July 22, 2014
Unfortunately, Moz, Fishkin and many of their followers seem to assume that Google, one of the world's largest and most powerful corporations, will hold the same TAGFEE values (transparent, authentic, generous, fun, empathetic, exceptional) they do.
You see, Google's “quality guidelines” are nothing more than a PR document set out to create a certain image. Yes, Google want you to think they are transparent and ethical and completely “focused exclusively on solving search problems“, but in reality they are 100% committed to increasing the bottom line.
Google will never follow TAGFEE, nor will they ever be “fair”; anything can and will violate Google's Quality Guidelines. And here's why.
Nice Guys Finish Last
In Q2 of 2014, Google published a 22% rise in revenue, bringing the gross figure to $15.96 billion. You can read the complete breakdown here. At the end of January 2014, Moz released a detailed financial breakdown of the company, reporting an overall $5.7 million loss. It's clear to see that we're talking about two very different companies here and the one that is genuinely committed to user experience doesn't make any money. In fact, they lose a ton of it. The company that pretends to care about UX, on the other hand, is raking it in.
As part of their company philosophy, Google makes many dramatic statements, such as “You can make money without doing evil” and “great just isn't good enough”, and holds wild fanasies about their intentions:
Whether we're designing a new Internet browser or a new tweak to the look of the homepage, we take great care to ensure that they will ultimately serve you, rather than our own internal goal or bottom line. Our homepage interface is clear and simple and pages load instantly. Placement in search results is never sold to anyone and advertising is not only clearly marked as such, it offers relevant content and is not distracting.
By using micro-text saying “advertisement” or “sponsored result”, Google purports to be an ethical pioneer, making the world a better place. To be honest, I (and 67% of other online searchers) agree that Google is the most user-friendly, attractive and fruitful search engine in existence. It's easy to forget, therefore, that this product is just that, a product. Google know their market – searchers want a clean and reliable service and that's what they provide. Google is dedicated to providing the best search results to its users because it helps them retain and grow market share. In fact, it's a vital part of their business model.
Profiting From Chaos
Does Google care about Webmasters and SEOs getting a fair shot at Page 1 results? Hell no! And why would they? Google Ads, launched in 2000, is Google's primary revenue source. Despite the numerous “help” documents and best practice guidelines Google produce, their sole aim, when it comes to dealing with Webmasters, is to sell more AdWord campaigns. All the training, tools (especially Analytics and Webmaster Tools) and resources are there to aid the process along. Moz, on the other hand, produces a wealth of what I'd call “stand-alone resources”. Yes, they promote their analytics tools and pro accounts, but their blog, Whiteboard Friday series and learning guides are accessible to everyone.
Now I'm not privy to any of the inner workings of Google and its Web Spam Team, but the more unstable and unpredictable the numerous animal-ed search algorithms become, the more money is spent on Google Ads. This trend has continued for years. Let's put it another way: the less genuinely useful Google's Webmaster documents become, the more money the company makes. Does this sound like a company dedicated to helping people?
Let's get back to the matter in hand – why does Moz and Rand continue to praise, cooperate with and pander to Google's sketchy demands guidelines?
There's One Rule In Google Club…
There's only one rule in Google Club – don't talk about the rules. Instead, let's use ambiguous and generic terminology like “guidelines” and “best practices”. Instead of “must”, we hear “should”; in place of “definitely”, we get “recommended”. The bottom line is, there is not (nor will there ever be) a clear, direct, fool-proof, one-fits-all document to getting ranked on Google (or any search engine for that matter).
If SEO was like Fight Club, Rand Fishkin would be Edward Norton, engaged in a hopeless battle against Google's Tyler Durden. Let's forget the film's ending for a minute – can Norton ever overcome Durden's hold on him? No! Why? Because he's fictional. Tyler Durden, in the SEO world, is Google's Quality Guidelines. You think you know what they are, but they keep evolving just out of reach. BECAUSE THEY DON'T REALLY EXIST.
Links From YouMoz Can Violate Google's Quality Guidelines
In a Moz blog post today, Rand Fishkin wrote an open letter to Google titled: Dear Google, Links from YouMoz Don't Violate Your Quality Guidelines. In the piece, they get offended by a Google guideline violation notice that Moz contributer Scott Wyden received in WMT. Wyden's personal blog, http://scottwyden.com received a notice about inorganic links, with 3 examples given (posted below, the red text was added by Scott himself).
Rand took particular issue with the third link, http://moz.com/ugc/build-relationships-not-links, from the YouMoz section of the site. In response, they post:
As founder, board member, and majority shareholder of Moz, which owns Moz.com (of which YouMoz is a part), I'm here to tell Google that Scott's link from the YouMoz post was absolutely editorial. Our content team reviews every YouMoz submission. We reject the vast majority of them. We publish only those that are of value and interest to our community. And we check every frickin' link.
Despite the protest, it's easy to see how (and why) Google might see YouMoz post links as guest post spam. Here's a breakdown of the Scott Wyden example:
YouMoz is exclusively for guest posts.
This fact is made clear the by the disclaimer placed below each post (” This entry was written by one of our members and submitted to our YouMoz section.The author's views below are entirely their or their own and may not reflect the views of Moz.”). The YouMoz url is also under the “ugc” directory, otherwise known as User Generated Content, aka not editorial.
Guest posting as an SEO practice has recently been condemned by Google, and widely reported. According to those infamous Quality Guidelines, guest posting is one example of a link scheme, especially if it uses “keyword-rich anchor text links“.
Scott used a “keyword-rich anchor text link” in their guest post
Although the link has now been removed, Google's cache (posted above) shows us that Scott used the exact-match keyword anchor “best business books for photographers”, with a link to “http://scottwyden.com/business-books-for-photographers/”. As you can see, the linked page is optimised for that exact longtail keyword so Google understandably spotted it as “unnatural”. What's more, the content of the page is completely off-topic and is only loosely linked to the article, under the guise of an “example”.
The text “Photographers SEO Community” was also used as the anchor for Scott's link to their site http://photographers-seo.com. Aside from using an partial-match domain (and forgetting the apostrophe in photographer's), the link could be seen an spammy because it's neither contextual nor related to the article topic. Yes, theirs the site is about SEO, but that's a pretty generic connection.
[highlight color=”eg. yellow”]UPDATE: Scott confirmed in the comments section that they do not own nor manage http://photographers-seo.com[/highlight]
The guest post links are dofollow
As YouMoz has its nice little disclaimer about not being responsible for the views of its authors, why does it insist on giving dofollow links? Yes, Rand might check every frickin' link, but doing so does not make the content any less of a guest post and, as such, Google's guidelines don't need to be analysed in much detail to see the problem here.
It's interesting to note that Scott's offending YouMoz post went live way back in October 2012. Perhaps, at the time, these practices were harder for Google to take down. In mid-2014, that's obviously not the case.
Some Advice For YouMoz
YouMoz makes up a significant portion of Moz's overall output. What's more, it brings a lot of SEO professionals to the site for one, sneaky, reason. Yup – FREE LINKIES! We can pretend all we want about “enriching communities” and “sharing our knowledge” but at the end of the day, I'd hazard a guess that 100% of all YouMoz posts are written for self-promotional purposes. Some of that promotion comes from SEO (in the form of a nice link or 2 from an authority site), but the rest comes from community outreach, building reputation and engaging with peers. It's the latter that YouMoz needs to focus on.
I believe that Moz made a conscious decision to allow dofollow links on YouMoz to encourage SEOs to write good quality content (for free, duh). The link is the payment. Yes, Moz polices the content to ensure it's of high-enough quality to avoid diluting their brand presence and SEO efforts. Nofollow link attributes should have been a no-brainer but would have undoubtedly discouraged writers, especially several years ago.
As you can see above, Moz comments are nofollow as standard; it is my opinion that all YouMoz links should be nofollow too, in order to avoid guest post penalties in the future and preserve the importance of the blog as a outpost for knowledgeable professionals.
Will people still write for YouMoz? Of course they will. Moz has earned itself a position as knowledge leader in a competitive field. Part of that status came from being early to the game, but has since been sustained thanks to its genuine dedication to TAGFEE. Guest blogging on Moz will always carry a badge of honour.
In summary, let us never forget Google's real code of ethics: ROE – Revenue Over Everything. The Quality Guidelines will always remain just out-of-reach enough to get all site owners to up their Google Ads spend. What you think is acceptable today might bite you in the SEO ass 2 years from now. Even if you are Rand Fishkin.
Plus remote working, self-publishing and other things you might not know about releasing games on Wii U and 3DS
Nintendo has demonstrated that launching games on its eShop platform might be easier than you think, with no parity clause and the newly added ability to work remotely.
Speaking at the Italian Game Developers Summit today, the platform holder's Ed Valiente clarified some of the perceived stumbling blocks that developers might think are against them.
Firstly, the platform holder has no parity clause – something that rival Microsoft has received criticism for.
“There is no exclusivity or parity clause,” said Valiente. “We understand that small teams can't work on multiple platforms at once. If you want to release on other platforms first, we're happy for you to bring it to the platform when you're ready.
“Of course, we'd like it on ours at the same time but it's not a dealbreaker.”
They also emphasised that developers can run sales and promotions on their titles whenever they want – pointing to a number of indies that have already done so – and that developers can set the release date and price of their games themselves.
“That's different from some other platforms in the past, where you had to wait for a slot and you're told when it's coming out,” they said. “We leave that up to you.
“There's no concept approval, either. People often think ‘Nintendo's not going to like this so they won't let us release it'. But if you want to release your game on our platform and it gets a rating by PEGI or USK, you can do that.”
One of the policies that has changed in the last year is allowing developers to work from home. Previously, Nintendo preferred devs to have a registered office but in an age of remote working and one-man studios, this isn't always practical.
Said Valiente: “If you have a lockable space where you can keep your dev kit locked, you can actually work from home. That also means you can work remotely, so if you've got a coder in one city, an artist in another city, a sound designer in another country, you can get approved as a team.
“By signing up with us you can release in Europe and America. If you want to release in Japan, you have to have an office in Japan, because you have to provide customer service in Japanese. Or you can go through local publishers there – there are three or four that will take Western games over to the Japanese eShop.”
They also added that there are no fees for certification or patching. The only cost to developers is the purchase of dev kits.
Static: There is an argument PSOs could be better utilised. It was back in 2012 that the then state government began to roll out the first of a promised 940 PSOs to staff suburban railway stations from 6pm until the last train. (Actually, they stuffed up the maths and needed more than 1100.) This was done without even asking senior police if it made a scintilla of sense. When Daniel Andrews was voted into power there was no way they were going to change the popular policy – indeed, the new mob became enthusiastic cheerleaders. Announcing a fresh deployment in May, Police Minister Lisa Neville said: "Every Victorian has the right to feel safe using our city's public transport network and these new Protective Services Officers will play a critical role." Sure the PSOs in their uniforms are a reassuring sight as we wander off the platform but are they actually doing anything?
There is no doubt their visible presence make people feel good but so do puppy dogs, Ugg boots, comfortable underwear and food trucks serving ribs – but not on the taxpayer's tab. Finally, earlier this year the Auditor-General released a report on the PSOs that states the obvious. "The PSO program was intended to reduce crime and improve public perceptions of the safety of the train system. I found that while there is evidence that PSOs have increased perceptions of the safety of Melbourne's train network at night, it is not possible, on the available data, to determine if their presence has had an impact on crime," Acting Auditor-General Dr Peter Frost found. They said there were "no measures in place to determine whether the PSOs are having the effect the policy intended. So, while 1145 PSOs may make people feel safer, it is not clear whether safety has actually improved." What? We were told they would do a Clint Eastwood on Railway Ruffians turning our train trips from a manspreading nightmare where glue sniffers hog the seats into a Puffing Billy type tea and scones experience. First a few facts. In 2013-14 there were 847 reported assaults at Melbourne train stations. That is less than one per PSO (who are on a starting wage of around $60,000).
Out in the wider world we have around 74,000 crimes against the person with around 6000 general duties police available as first responders. That is 12.3 crimes per uniformed cop. During 2014 there were around 9600 criminal offences reported on Melbourne's train system or a little over eight per PSO. In the same time there were around 470,000 reported offences in Victoria or 78 per operational general duties police officer or 36 for every police officer from Chief Commissioner to junior constable. But wait – only half the crimes on the train system happen after 6pm when PSOs are on duty, which works out at 4.2 crimes per officer per year – or about one every three months. PSOs issue around 20,000 infringement notices (fines) per year. They work over 200,000 shifts so that is an average of one fine every two weeks per PSO. While senior Victoria Police are trying to free officers from working in police stations to increase the number of mobile patrols we have more than 1100 trained and armed PSOs unable to leave their railway posts. It is the modern version of the Maginot Line, only we do it on the Belgrave, Sandringham and Hurstbridge lines (stopping all stations).
Put it this way: If every station on the Frankston line is staffed with PSOs we have 60-armed law enforcement officers protecting around the same number of passengers on a late night train. At the same time we have around 200 police in 100 mobile units out on Melbourne roads, which works out at one police officer per 26,000 citizens. Which is leaving the PSOs frustrated that they are under used and confined to the railway precinct when there are desperate needs for their services elsewhere. As one PSO wrote in a submission to the Police Association: "We want to help our fellow police members ... I have been on duty, standing on one side of the road and watched drug deals taking place. Why? Because nobody is sure about whether I/we have the power to arrest. Where is this nebulous line on the ground that can't be crossed? "We have had the situation that when the boom gates on crossings get stuck down, two units have to be taken off the road to do traffic control at the boom gate while PSOs stand on the platform metres away watching."
"Last night on shift I had to let two offenders walk by because there were no vans available for transporting them." This PSO says their limited powers mean they can't search suspected drug dealers. "We can see druggos from other areas of Melbourne, who come to my area, disappear up the road for 20 minutes and come back to catch the next train out. We know they are carrying or dealing drugs, but are powerless." The author, a former national logistics manager whose job was to improve results with existing resources, says the system is not working. This is nuts. Fact – most railway crime and anti-social behaviour happens on trains and not at stations. Fact – you could provide better protection by having two sets of two PSOs on each line moving from train to train linked to a passenger text helpline. This would require a commitment of 170 PSOs to provide a seven-day a week service.
Just think what we could do with the remaining 975 PSOs. In the submission to the Police Association, mentioned above, several options are explored that would free up police. For example police are transporting people suffering mental illnesses to hospital at a rate of one an hour and are then forced to wait with the patient until assessed by a doctor – which can take hours. Added to this there are growing reports of violence in hospital casualty wards from ice- affected patients. So what about placing armed and trained PSOs in hospitals to guard patients brought in by police and protect hospital staff? Police complain they are losing hundreds of shifts per year when assigned to court security, a job perfectly suited to PSOs. They could also do traffic duty, guard crime scenes, act as drivers for supervising police and staff police station front counters. This would provide thousands of extra operational police shifts at no cost.
Certainly the Auditor-General's office agrees: "The full value of the PSO program is yet to be realised ... There is also the potential for PSOs to be used more efficiently and effectively." And so very quietly former senior Victorian police officer and retired South Australia Commissioner Mal Hyde has completed a review of the PSO program and recommends more than 30 changes to build a more flexible and practical system. But will there be a political will to change? In most areas of government endeavour such as education, health and transport there are long-term plans. But in the emotion-charged area of law and order, governments react to headlines with tougher laws and promises of more police. As a result our prison numbers have tripled in the past 15 years and the crime rate climbs. Police stations are built in swinging seats not to catch crooks but to catch voters. The government is ramping up the Police Academy to full capacity to increase police numbers, despite the police 2025 planning Blue Paper saying more staff alone is not the answer.
The police computer system is closer to a crystal set than an iPhone 7, the paperwork a nightmare and communications questionable. But there are more votes in cops on the street than nerds in a backroom. The trouble is that in the world of crime perception is reality. If you fear being attacked then your quality of life is diminished. People are clearly worried by the threat of home invasions when the truth is that 99 per cent of the community have not been victims and don't know anyone who has been. And that is the true purpose of PSOs. To make us feel better – a bit like a hug when you feel sad. But at $80 million a year that is a hell of a lot of hugs.
A couple of months ago, when the NFL announced that for the first time ever, it would show a regular season game (almost) exclusively on the Internet, it didn't know who would handle the streaming or how much it would cost fans to watch the game.
Now it does: Yahoo will host the livestream of the Oct. 25 Jacksonville Jaguars-Buffalo Bills game, and it'll be free to viewers around the world.
The move is at least symbolically significant for the NFL, which wants to start experimenting with digital distribution. Likewise for Yahoo, which has become very interested in Web video under CEO Marissa Mayer but has yet to generate much buzz for its efforts.
Industry executives familiar with the NFL's negotiations think Yahoo paid at least $20 million for the rights to stream the game; in return it has exclusive ad rights for the game. The league bid out the streaming rights and at least one other tech company made a very competitive offer, sources say.
It will be interesting to see how much those ads can generate for Yahoo: On the one hand, the novelty of the Web stream will generate lots of attention from media types. On the other hand, the game will take place in London on a Sunday afternoon, which means it will air at 9:30 in the morning on the East Coast and 6:30 am on the West Coast. And since it features two small/tiny-market teams, its aggregate U.S. audience may be miniscule.
But! If you had a third hand, you could also factor in the appeal of a free NFL game for curious audiences in Europe, where it will air in the afternoon.
Other unknowns for the game (which will also air on conventional broadcast and cable TV in Buffalo and Jacksonville) include the streaming quality, and the overall experience for digital viewers, who are supposed to be able to watch the game on a variety of devices: Phones, PCs, and TVs with built-in Internet connections or those connected to devices like Apple TVs, Google Chromecasts and Xbox 360s.
Brian Rolapp, who heads up the NFL's media business, says the game will be produced by CBS, at the same quality level the network uses for its traditional broadcasts. But high-profile Web streaming events have a history of misfires, and he's not making any guarantees for this one.
“Our hope is that it will be a very high-quality experience,” they say. “But this is one of the reasons we're doing it — to figure out how close are we to high quality streams of our most valuable property.”
Even if the game streams without incident, that doesn't mean we're going to see many more of these in the future. That's primarily because the rights to most NFL games are locked up with TV networks until 2022 at the earliest. The one exception: A slate of Thursday night games, which CBS will broadcast this fall and which could become available after that.
It's possible that the NFL could sell those games to Yahoo or another digital outlet for 2016. Or, just as likely — it could convince a broadcaster that a digital buyer is a real possibility, which would increase competition and the price for those games. Football wins either way.
Former Democratic Party presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is back doing what they do best: selling books. What Happened, their newest, doesn't feature a question. It has answers. Clinton blames the FBI. They blame sexism and fake news. They blame the "godforsaken" Electoral College and the "deep currents of anger and resentment" running through society.
They also blame Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for out-promising them at every turn. They probably blame clandestine Russian mind-control laser beams for persuading tens of millions of Americans that they were nothing more than a calculating, deceptive and insipid career politician.
And they blame the media. Political journalists, writes Clinton, "can't bear to face their own role in helping elect Trump." Now, hearing a Democrat argue that the institutional media wasn't accommodating enough in helping them win an election is, I admit, a bit jarring.
Support from journalists is so embedded in the Democratic Party's strategy that any negative coverage—even something as unavoidable as writing about an unprecedented FBI investigation into a leading presidential candidate—must be quashed.
Yet Clinton's claim happens to contain a morsel of truth, if not in the way they intended. When supporting Trump seemed advantageous, the media—not only left-leaning outlets like CNN or the Washington Post but also rating chasers like NBC's Joe Scarborough—did much to help lift the fortunes of the soon-to-be president. This was obvious to anyone observing coverage of the primaries. But for those who need confirmation, a study by the Harvard Kennedy School Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy found that during the year 2015, major news outlets covered Trump "in a way that was unusual given their low initial polling numbers—a high volume of media coverage preceded Trump's rise in the polls."
A big chunk of this coverage, the report found, was positive in tone. Of course, that tone would drastically change as soon as Trump won. It was a curious happenstance, but somehow, the preponderance of ugly stories regarding their past only began pouring forth after they captured the nomination. The man didn't change at all; the coverage did.
While all this is true, the problem is that Clinton and their advisers were part of the same effort. "The variety of candidates is a positive here, and many of the lesser known can serve as a cudgel to move the more established candidates further to the right," read one Clinton campaign agenda item, according to WikiLeaks. "In this scenario, we don't want to marginalize the more extreme candidates, but make them more 'Pied Piper' candidates who actually represent the mainstream of the Republican Party." Those candidates included Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Dr. Ben Carson and Trump.
In fairness, some were worried that the strategy would backfire. "Right now I am petrified that Hillary is almost totally dependent on Republicans nominating Trump," Brent Budowsky emailed John Podesta. Most, however, liked the plan. Another agenda item involved how to prevent candidate Jeb Bush "from bettering himself/how do we maximize Trump and others?" Neera Tanden emailed Podesta: "Bush sucked. I'm glad Hillary is obsessed with the one candidate who would be easiest to beat. ... Besides Trump, of course." Of course!
Although Bush was a concern, most Democrats seemed to fear Sen. Marco Rubio. Not that their takes would have swayed many conservative voters, but it's worth remembering that left-wing pundits played the same cynical game, which makes their histrionics today unconvincing. "Why I'm More Worried About Marco Rubio Than Donald Trump," read a Vox headline. "Donald Trump Is Actually a Moderate Republican," wrote Slate. "Why Cruz Is Worse Than Trump" read one headline by The New York Times' Paul Krugman. "Why Liberals Should Support a Trump Republican Nomination" was New York's contribution to this genre.
The major media outlets, the Clinton campaign and the liberal punditry all got what they wanted: Trump. The problem was they also got Clinton. The media did cover the FBI investigation into Clinton's emails and server. "It was a dumb mistake," Clinton now says. "I think it was a dumber scandal, but it hurt." This kind of attitude speaks to the entitlement they carried around with them
Attempting to bolster the chances of an opposing candidate who is perceived to be the weakest isn't a unique strategy. The problem is—and I understand that many people disagree with me—Clinton probably would have lost to virtually any Republican candidate, and probably by even larger margins. But the bigger question now is: Why did Clinton's campaign prop up Trump, "the most dangerous White House candidate in modern history"? It seems irresponsible and selfish to put Americans in such a precarious position for personal gain. Maybe someone with access will take a break from sitting shiva and ask them

More than a year later, MIT is still grappling with the questions at the center of Aaron Swartz's case.
Photo by Noah Berger/Reuters
On Sunday, the Boston Globe ran a long story about Aaron Swartz, the Internet activist who killed themselves in January 2013. At the time of their death, Swartz was under federal indictment for allegedly accessing the computer network at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology without explicit authorization and using that network to download millions of documents from a subscription database called JSTOR. Since then, MIT—which maintained institutional silence throughout the Swartz case—has drawn sharp criticism from those who feel that its conduct was unworthy of a great university.
The Globe's story centers on MIT's role in the Swartz saga and particularly the “dissonant instincts the university grappled with” in the Swartz case: its professed commitment to openness versus its need to maintain network security. Drawing on hundreds of internal emails sent by MIT and JSTOR employees during the time of Swartz's alleged crimes, the Globe does a good job indicating the roots of this dissonance. The piece helps explain why MIT failed to live up to its professed ideals in the Swartz case—and why the case remains so very relevant now, more than a year after Aaron Swartz's death.
More so than any other top-tier university in the United States, if not the world, MIT attempts to foster a culture of openness. The front doors to its main building are rarely locked. Its computer network is configured for easy guest access. Students are tacitly encouraged to pull elaborate pranks that often involve breaking and entering. The share-and-share-alike “hacker ethic” that was born in MIT's computer labs during the 1950s and '60s has become part of university lore. To a very real extent, MIT encourages its affiliates to follow their curiosity wherever it may lead them—even if it leads them somewhere they are not explicitly authorized to be.
But the university has failed to consider the broader implications of this philosophy.
Over the past several decades, the rise of digital networks has brought the concept of open access into the mainstream, which is of great relevance to anyone who has ever downloaded an MP3 file or evaded a pay wall to read a news story. The rise of digital file-sharing and online publishing has raised questions for publishers, for authors, and for information consumers worldwide. Among them: Are physical property and intellectual property functionally indistinguishable? Is downloading 25,000 files from an academic database the same thing as stealing 25,000 books from a library, as one JSTOR employee suggested in an email? What are the moral obligations of publishers and consumers in a world where data holds no corporeal form and can be disseminated with unprecedented ease?
These are serious questions that deserve serious consideration. And if any university ought to be at the forefront of this discussion, it's MIT, with its unlocked doors and its “hacker ethic.” As the world's center of technological innovation, MIT is uniquely positioned to lead the debate on open information, to produce scholarship that helps clarify and frame these issues for the rest of us. And yet the university has not engaged with the concept of openness on any meaningful conceptual level.
In July, an independent panel convened by MIT released a report largely absolving the university of blame in the Swartz affair. Swartz's family blasted the report as “hyper-legal” and a “whitewash,” but I actually thought it was pretty interesting, particularly the section about how “Aaron Swartz's suicide has embroiled MIT in an Internet uproar that the Institute did not anticipate and with which it is not well prepared to grapple as a legal, policy, or social phenomenon”:
If MIT had had a locus of scholarly activity around issues of information access during Swartz's arrest and prosecution, one can imagine that there would have been more active participation by the community as events were transpiring, more appetite for engaging the larger issues the prosecution brought to light, and more recognition of MIT's opportunity and responsibility to play a leadership role.
MIT has absolutely no excuse for being “not well prepared to grapple” with the political and conceptual issues that have come to define the Internet age. Great universities are supposed to take on epochal issues. That's one of their most important functions in a democratic society. But not only had MIT as an institution not bothered to think about these issues, it was completely unaware that it should have been thinking about these issues.
You can see this in the university's first responses to Swartz's JSTOR stunt back in 2010 and 2011. As the Globe story demonstrates, the IT employees who first discovered Swartz's network incursion were unsure how to react. In the absence of any strong counterargument, it came to be seen as criminal activity. “We need to escalate the seriousness of our response,” one employee wrote in January 2011. “This looks like grand theft.” MIT's complete lack of institutional leadership on IP issues effectively encouraged its employees to conclude that bulk downloading was theft, rather than pausing to admit any other possibilities. And so MIT Police became involved. You know the rest of the story.
Note: I am currently writing a book about Swartz, free culture, and the open access movement. If you want to learn more about the project, or receive periodic updates about the writing and reporting process, send me an email at justintrevett@fastmail.fm.
NEW YORK (October 18, 2012)—Scientists from the Wildlife Conservation Society, the American Museum of Natural History, City University of New York, and other organizations have published the first range-wide genetic analysis of the bowhead whale using hundreds of samples from both modern populations and archaeological sites used by indigenous Arctic hunters thousands of years ago.
In addition to using DNA samples collected from whales over the past 20 years, the team collected genetic samples from ancient specimens —extracted from old vessels, toys, and housing material made from baleen—preserved in pre-European settlements in the Canadian Arctic. The study attempts to shed light on the impacts of sea ice and commercial whaling on this threatened but now recovering species. The study appears in the most recent edition of Ecology and Evolution.
"Our study represents the first genetic analysis of bowheads across their entire range," said Elizabeth Alter, the study's lead author and now a professor at City University of New York. "The study also illustrates the value of ancient DNA in answering questions about the impact of changing climate and human exploitation on genetic diversity in bowhead whales."
Specifically, the study authors examined mitochondrial DNA from whales from all four or five putative populations—the Canada-Greenland population (sometimes designated as two separate populations, the Baffin Bay-Davis Strait and Hudson Bay-Foxe Basin populations), Bering-Beaufort-Chuckchi Seas, the Okhotsk, and the Spitsbergen populations—for the purpose of gauging gene flow between those groups.
The team also used DNA gathered from relics found at the now-abandoned settlements of the Thule people (the likely ancestors of the Inuit) on Somerset Island on the western side of Prince Regent Inlet. The site was inhabited between 500-800 years before the present. Existing data from older DNA samples from Spitsbergen (some 3,000 years in age) samples were also used in the analysis.
The ancient samples from Prince Regent Inlet were brought to the lab at AMNH's Sackler Institute for Comparative Genomics, where researchers isolated and amplified segments of mitochondrial DNA, which is passed on exclusively through the maternal lines of a population.
The genetic analysis revealed differences found between ancient and modern population diversity, including the recent disappearance of unique maternal lineages over the past 500 years, the possible result of habitat loss during the Little Ice Age (a period of climatic cooling that occurred between the 16th to 19th Centuries) and/or extensive whaling in the region.
Another finding of the study: the frozen—and seemingly impassable—inlets and straits separating Atlantic and Pacific populations appear to be little obstacle to the ice-savvy and morphologically adapted bowheads. The team found the whale populations in both regions to be so related that individual whales must be able to make the journey across the Arctic, although the finer details on the directions whales traveled in are still uncertain.
"The assumption that Arctic sea ice has separated bowhead whale populations over the past several thousand years is contradicted by the genetic analysis, which indicates that significant migration between the Atlantic and Pacific populations has recently taken place," said Dr. Howard Rosenbaum, Director of WCS's Ocean Giants Program and senior author on the study. "The finding reveals much about the abilities of bowheads to find navigable routes through sea ice and helps illuminate hidden connections between populations."
The authors point out that understanding the effects of shifting sea ice conditions and commercial whaling are important for future management decisions for the bowhead whale, particularly in light of the disappearance of sea ice due to climate change, maritime tourism, and increased shipping in the Arctic environment.
Reaching up to 65 feet in length and up to 100 tons in weight, the bowhead whale is a baleen whale that lives in Arctic and sub-Arctic waters. The bowhead gets its name from its enormous arched head, which it occasionally uses to break through ice up to 60 centimeters thick in order to breathe. The species widely hunted for centuries by commercial whalers, who prized the species for its long baleen (used in corsets and other items) and its thick blubber (the thickest of any species of whale). The bowhead whale may also be among the most long-lived mammal species. In 2007, aboriginal whalers on the Alaskan coast landed a whale carrying a valuable clue about the animal's probable age. The whalers discovered a harpoon point manufactured in the 1890s embedded in the whale's blubber, indicating the animal may have survived an encounter with whalers more than one hundred years ago.
The bowhead whale has been protected from commercial whaling by the International Whaling Commission since 1946. Currently, limited subsistence whaling by coastal communities on the Bering, Beaufort, and Chuckchi Seas is permitted by the IWC. Bowheads are listed on Appendix I of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species), a listing that completely prohibits international trade. The Okhotsk Sea and Spitsbergen populations are listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as "Endangered" and "Critically Endangered" respectively, while the other populations are designated as "The Least Concern."
The authors include: Elizabeth Alter of the City University of New York; Howard C. Rosenbaum of the Wildlife Conservation Society and the American Museum of Natural History; Lianne Postma, Melissa Lindsay, and Larry Dueck of Fisheries and Oceans Canada; Peter Whitridge of the Memorial University of Newfoundland; Cork Gaines, Diana Weber, Mary Egan, and George Amato of the American Museum of Natural History's Sackler Institute for Comparative Genomics; Robert Brownell Jr. and Brittany Hancock of the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (National Marine Fisheries Service/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration); Mads Peter Heide-Jørgensen and Kristin Laidre of the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources; and Gisella Caccone of Yale University.
In addition to novel bowhead whale genetic research, WCS is working to advance conservation initiatives for Arctic marine mammals in general. Through its Ocean Giants Program and Arctic Beringia Program—a transboundary initiative that works closely with scientists, government agencies, indigenous groups and others from North America and the Russian Federation, —WCS is working to strengthen Arctic research and governance efforts, while evaluating the potential impacts of disappearing sea ice and increased anthropogenic activities, such as shipping, on whales, walrus, and other marine wildlife, as well as the indigenous communities that have lived in the region for millennia.

RaceRoom Racing Experience has received a major update that introduces Vive and Rift support through SteamVR. The update also includes a number of improvements and adds new content to this often underappreciated racing sim.
Developer Sector3 has been largely silent about potential VR support for RaceRoom, despite the title offering an excellent, experimental VR mode for the Rift DK2 dev kit back in 2014. Today's update has, along with some major feature and content additions, enabled a ‘first pass' of VR support, much to the delight of the community.
RaceRoom can be considered an established racing sim at this point, despite being technically still a ‘beta'. It has a colourful history, having been originally developed by the SimBin, famous for classic racing sims such as GT Legends (2005) and GTR (2005). RaceRoom's approach was different, both in terms of being a free-to-play title with paid additional content in the form of cars and tracks, as well as aiming to have accessible physics. This lead to the sim being dismissed by large sections of the community, and ultimately, the demise of SimBin.
Now that Sector3 is at the helm—which operates effectively as a restructured SimBin— RaceRoom is back on track, having seen massive physics and force feedback improvements, making the sim far more appealing to the enthusiast. The return of VR support is another indication that RaceRoom is heading in the right direction.
The update, detailed here, also adds leaderboard divisions, a revamped multiplayer browser, manual pit stops, AI changes, DTM physics improvements and the Silverstone and Stowe circuits.
Here are the steps to enable VR mode, according to the developer post on the Sector3 forums:
Satellite photo showing the Usoi Dam, the western end of Sarez Lake and the smaller Shadau Lake
The Usoi Dam is a natural landslide dam along the Murghab River in Tajikistan. At 567 metres (1,860 ft) high, it is the tallest dam in the world, either natural or human-made. The dam was created on February 18, 1911, when the 7.4-M s Sarez earthquake caused a massive landslide that blocked the flow of the river.[1]
The dam is formed of approximately 2 cubic kilometres (0.48 cu mi) of rock dislodged from the steeply sloped river valley of the Murghab, which cuts from east to west through the high and rough Pamir Mountains. It is named after the village of Usoi, which was completely buried by the 1911 landslide. The dam rises to a height of 500 to 700 metres (1,600 to 2,300 ft) from the original valley floor.[2]
The basin formed by Usoi Dam now holds Sarez Lake, a 55.8-kilometre (34.7 mi)-long lake holding 16.074 cubic kilometres (13,031,000 acre⋅ft) of water. Water does not flow over the top of the dam, which would quickly cause it to erode away; instead, water seeps out of the base of the dam at a rate which approximately matches the rate of inflow, maintaining the lake at a relatively constant level. The flow averages about 45 cubic meters per second,[3] and dissipates about 250 megawatts.
Geologists are concerned that the Usoi Dam may become unstable during future large-magnitude earthquakes, which are relatively common in the seismically active Pamirs, and might collapse due to liquefaction or subsequent landslides during such an event.[4] Collapse of the dam would unleash a locally catastrophic flood.[5] The Murghab's river valley tends to be relatively narrow and steep. This would focus and maintain any flood's destructive power as it swept through the valley of the Murghob District.
PARIS (Reuters) - Most French people in the region bordering Belgium would like to see France re-unite with Belgium's francophone region if the country breaks apart, according to an opinion poll published on Saturday.
Talks to form a new government in Belgium have dragged on for some 150 days since elections in June, and the absence of an agreement has prompted speculation that the country might split along linguistic fault lines.
A poll released before Sunday's publication of Le Journal du Dimanche said that 54 percent of those questioned wanted the mainly French-speaking southern Belgian region of Wallonia incorporated into France if a breakup occurred.
The region was briefly absorbed into the French empire after the 1789 revolution, but it has few happy memories for France because it was there, at Waterloo, that Napoleon suffered their final defeat in 1815 by a British army and its German allies.
The land was subsequently attached to the Netherlands until modern Belgium took shape in 1830.
The Journal du Dimanche survey, carried out by Ifop pollsters, showed that 66 percent of French people living along the border with Belgium wanted to see Wallonia become part of France against 53 percent in the rest of the country.
Some 41 percent were against the idea of unification and five percent declined comment.
source: www.rgj.com/article/20111214/NEWS/111214029/Man-who-killed-f The Reno man who killed the first bear in Nevada's highlycontroversial black bear hunt faces charges they illegally baited theanimals.Timothy Kawelmacher, 55, isscheduled to appear in Reno Justice Court on Monday.  They are charged withtwo misdemeanor counts of baiting big-game mammals for the purpose ofhunting, said Chris Hicks, Washoe County deputy district attorney.“Itis very discouraging that the very first bear killed in thiscontroversial hunt is now the subject of prosecution,” Hicks said.Kawelmacheris charged with using apples and bacon grease to bait for bears on Aug.11 and anise oil for the same purpose between Aug. 5 and Aug. 20, whenthe season opened, Hicks said.Kawelmacher killed theseason's first bear — a 9-year-old, 180-pound female — with a rifle nearGarson Road west of Reno on Aug. 20, according to officials with theNevada Department of Wildlife.He was later cited by game wardens, andthe bear's head and hide were seized as evidence.Kawelmacher,who Hicks said has cooperated with authorities, could not be reachedfor comment. It appears they will be acting as their own attorney Monday,Hicks said.The hunter faces fines of up to $1,000 and jailtime of up to 6 months for each count, Hicks said. Additional civilpenalties of up to $2,000 for each count are also possible.“What is most significant about this case is that it was the very first year ofthe bear hunt, and there was a very heated debate about whether thereshould even be a bear hunt,” Hicks said.Since the seasonopened Aug. 20, 13 bears — eight males and five females — have beenkilled. The season ends Dec. 31 or once 20 bears total or six femalesare killed.At least 33 states have a black bear hunting season inplace. While some do allow baiting, Nevada wildlife officials outlawedthe activity when adopting hunting regulations.Forty-onehunters who successfully drew tags for the hunt attended an Aug. 6orientation hosted by the Department of Wildlife to make clear specificsof hunting regulations, among other things. Kawelmacher was present,officials said.Considering the controversy of the hunt,which was widely attacked by critics, wildlife officials stressed theimportance of obeying the rules.“You guys are under themicroscope,” Department of Wildlife biologist and bear expert CarlLackey said at the time. “Please do everything right.”
The government has today released its latest quarterly energy statistics, confirming that the UK's renewable energy sector is continuing to expand rapidly, while also fuelling concerns that high gas prices are forcing energy companies to switch to more polluting coal power.
The statistics from the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) show renewable electricity output during the second quarter of 2012 rose 6.5 per cent year-on-year to 8.13TWh, while capacity soared 42.4 per cent to 14.2GW, largely as the result of the opening of a raft of new large-scale on- and offshore wind farms and the conversion of the Tilbury B power station to dedicated biomass.
The increases meant that renewables' share of the UK's electricity mix edged up from nine per cent in the second quarter of 2011 to 9.6 per cent a year later.
The performance would have been stronger still, but low rainfall and winds led to a 31 per cent drop in hydroelectricity production and an 11 per cent drop in power output from onshore wind farms.
In contrast, output from offshore wind farms soared 47 per cent year-on-year to 1.64TWh, bioenergy edged up 6.5 per cent to just over 3TWh and energy from Solar PV and wave and tidal systems increased more than nine-fold to 0.47TWh.
The figures come just days after the UK set a new record for wind power output and mean the UK is now on track to set a host of new renewable energy records during 2012, despite on-going concerns that policy uncertainty is harming investor confidence.
However, the new data will also further fuel environmentalists' fears that the currently high price of natural gas is driving a new "dash for coal" that is likely to result in a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions.
DECC revealed gas accounted for 29.8 per cent of the electricity mix during the second quarter, its lowest second quarter share in 14 years, while coal accounted for 36.1 per cent, its highest second quarter share in 14 years. With nuclear's share of the electricity mix also falling slightly to 21.9 per cent, coal was the dominant fuel source during the second quarter.
There was also a blow for the UK's energy efficiency efforts, with the figures revealing total primary energy consumption for energy uses rose 6.3 per cent year-on-year. The increase was largely a result of the poor weather, but DECC admitted that even when adjusted to take account of weather differences between the second quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2012, primary energy consumption rose by 0.8 per cent.
Hillary Rodham Clinton has been the favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination for several years, and in recent months the only unanswered question has been when they would announce them candidacy.
Now, an equally important question appears to be: How long will it take for concerns about their use of a private server for e-mails to blow over?
A new poll from Quinnipiac University suggests that public mistrust continues to linger. In the meantime, a number of new Republican challengers have begun to edge ahead of them in key swing states, the poll says – a fact that could accelerate their campaign announcement.
The poll, released Thursday, shows Mrs. Clinton falling narrowly behind Sen. Rand Paul (R) of Kentucky in Iowa, and by three points in Colorado.  They are effectively tied with every Republican candidate in Colorado, according to the poll, and has a narrow lead over most GOP candidates in Iowa, with the exception of Senator Paul.
Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said in a statement that the results are "a boost" for Paul, who officially launched their 2016 presidential campaign earlier this week.
The one positive in the poll for Clinton is that they lead all Republican candidates in Virginia – the largest of the three swing states polled – including a four point lead over Paul.
But it's still early in the 2016 presidential cycle and polls are often volatile. In March 2014, Clinton led Paul by 10 points in a hypothetical Hawkeye State matchup, according to a Quinnipiac poll. At that time, their lead against other GOP prospects in Iowa was even stronger: Clinton was up 16 points against Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, 14 points against former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, and 13 points against Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.
Since mid-February, Clinton has lost ground in almost every matchup in Colorado and Iowa, according to a Quinnipiac poll released Feb. 18. Them the closest challenger in Iowa in February was former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, and they trailed Clinton then by seven points, 45 percent to 38 percent. Now they are tied at 42 percent.
"Ominous for Hillary Clinton is the broad scope of the movement today compared to their showing in Quinnipiac University's mid-February survey," said Mr. Brown. "It isn't just one or two Republicans who are stepping up; it's virtually the entire GOP field that is running better against her."
So far, Paul and Senator Cruz are the only Republicans to have formally announced their 2016 candidacy. Other GOP contenders are expected to include Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, as well as Governors Christie, Bush, and Huckabee.
The majority of respondents in each of the three swing states said they do not think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, though a majority of respondents said they think they have strong leadership qualities, and that they approved of the way they handled their job as secretary of State.
"It is difficult to see Secretary Clinton's slippage as anything other than a further toll on their image from the furor over their e-mail," said Brown. "Voters do think they are a strong leader – a key metric – but unless they can change the honesty perception, running as a competent but dishonest candidate has serious potential problems."
Just a few months ago, it appeared that Clinton was in no rush to formally announce their campaign, happy instead to stay on the sidelines raising money. Back in December, their biggest concern was waiting too long and potentially having their campaign thunder stolen by left-wing firebrand Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D) of Massachusetts.
Senator Warren still says that they are not planning to enter the race in 2016, but in the wake of the e-mail scandal last month Democratic strategists urged Clinton to launch their campaign early.
"The whole situation underscores the need for them to announce their candidacy, as an actual campaign would be the best way to deal with issues like this if they come up," said Kathy Winter, chairperson of Iowa's Osceola County Democrats, in an interview with Politico.

In the meantime, the growing field of Republican presidential hopefuls are reaping the benefits of the scandal.
"The e-mail controversy is opening doors to candidates who had little traction as Hillary Clinton gets bad numbers on trust and honesty," said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll.

Steve Bould is in line to succeed Arsene Wenger as Arsenal manager.
Bould was one of the key backroom team who, like Wenger, signed new three-year contracts last week.
The 51-year-old was chosen by Wenger to be their assistant two years ago when Pat Rice retired.
Wenger appointed Bould as the Gunners' youth team coach in 2001 after the former central defender gained their UEFA coaching badges.
They progressed to taking the Premier Youth Academy squad and led them to the title in 2009 and 2010. Under Bould, Arsenal also won the FA Youth Cup in 2009.
Wenger was hugely impressed with Bould's work and had no hesitation in promoting to them to first-team duties.
Now there is a growing belief inside Arsenal that Bould is being prepared for a tilt at management.
With three more years' experience in the No.2 role, it is hoped they will be ready to take over, should Wenger decide to retire in 2017.
“Steve and Arsene have a great working relationship,” said a club source. “He communicates well and there is a lot respect for him.”
Welcome to the 131st edition of the Carnival of Mathematics, a monthly blogging carnival which scoots its way round the internet, rounding up maths-related blog posts from the month of January.
As is traditional, I'll start with some mathematical facts about the number 131. Not only is it a prime number, it's determinedly so: if you reverse it, it's still prime (so it's a Palindrome Prime), and if you permute the digits in any order, it's still prime (so it's an Absolute Prime). It can also be written as a sum of three consecutive primes: $131 = 41+43+47$.
On with the Carnival!
Can you believe that a dodecahedron folds into a cube?
Mike Lawler, over at Mike's Math Page, is always looking for new ways to share their enjoyment of mathematics with their kids. They spotted Simon Gregg's blog post from 2014, in which he's made a cube that transforms into a dodecahedron – and was inspired to try to recreate it using zometool.
Amazing maths from mathematicians to share with kids
Mike's also rounded up some of their favourite examples of mathematicians using cool maths to inspire kids – which I have to say includes some excellent choices ok fine my fold and cut video is in there.
How much would you pay for a 20% discount?
Patrick Honner, who blogs at MrHonner.com, has discovered a quirk in their local OfficeMax's sale – they offer a 20% discount when you buy a certain number of items – meaning a wily shopper can actually save money by buying more things…
Math Becomes Art in Byrne's 1847 colourful Euclid
The artwork on this site has been inspired by Oliver Byrne's amazing 1847 illustrated edition of Euclid's Elements, in which their beautiful coloured illustrations brought to life Euclid's beautiful geometry. This blog post from the Rare Books section at the library at St Andrews includes some lovely photos, and clever animations, from Rare Books librarian Daryl Green.
A new way to read (and print) double-sided paper
Computer scientist Brent Yorgey, who blogs at The Math Less Travelled, has an inspired alternative to back-to-back printing. I wonder if it'll catch on?
What's your favourite number number? The top ten best number songs
Greetings, pop-pickers! Maths-botherer Alex Bellos has rounded up some numerical melodies from the charts of days past.
John Conway: Genius Behind The Numbers
Siobhan Roberts' new book, Genius at Play, is a fascinating autobiography of the mathematician John Conway. This piece at 52-insights is a lovely interview with Conway by Roberts.
Number factoids
Brian, who blogs at bit-player, has satisfied their own curiosity about how number factoid websites like numbersaplenty.com and numberworld.info work – by building their own. Whack in your favourite integer (below $10^{15}) and it'll hit you up with some facts.
Visualising the DFT Matrix
Over on their blog, John D Cook has found a nice way to visualise the discrete fourier transform matrix, using a range of colours, and unicode images of a clock.
Irrational Sunflowers
Meanwhile, over on Calculus 7, there's a nice representation of rational and irrational numbers using polar angles, resulting in sunflower-like constructions.
A New Solid of Constant Width
The Wolfram Blog hosts many excellent maths posts, including this one from Ed Pegg, who's discovered a new solid of constant width, with tetrahedral symmetry.
And finally, in honour of Pancake day (which wasn't in January but just squeaked by the submission deadline) – as well as my Open Season post on Pancake Flipping, the Sheffield University Made-Up Media Formula squad Maths Society has come up with the “formula for the perfect pancake“, known to many as the “formula for the volume of a cylinder”, which they are actually given credit for devising – although I'm pretty sure that was someone else.
It is an admirable and apparently genuine attempt to get people calculating stuff, although it's presented in the same ‘boffins crack formula' style which makes maths seem so opaque to non-mathematicians. They have, however, created a handy pancake recipe calculating gadget, based on Delia Smith's recipe, which gives you your quantities to the nearest hundredth of an egg. Now that's perfection.
I hope you've enjoyed this edition of the Carnival of Mathematics, and keep an eye on our Carnival of Maths page for more! If you see any mathematical nuggets of bloggy, videoey or otherwise internetly goodness, please submit them. The next Carnival will be hosted by Brent at The Math Less Travelled.
When people talk about Basel Abou Hamrah‘s home country of Syria, it can be hard to hear some of the words they use.
Death, destruction and displacement have become common vernacular for the war-torn nation.
This weekend Abou Hamrah is hoping to add another descriptor to the list, one that should have particular resonance to their new home in Canada: Diversity.
“I want people to know that we are a diverse people in Syria; we have many cultures,” the young refugee said Saturday at the Edmonton Heritage Festival, perhaps the perfect venue from which to spread a message of multicultural pride.
“I hope when we have peace in my country again, people will come to see it for themselves. For now we are here to show the beautiful side of Syria.”
Without the resources to organize their own pavilion for the festival, the city's fledgling Syrian community has instead claimed a corner of the tent operated by the Edmonton Mennonite Centre for Newcomers. Alongside are entries from Mali, Burundi, Togo and Barbados, making the tent a truly intercontinental experience.
“Syria is a newly developing community in Edmonton … and it's important to have them here to showcase their culture, “ said Steffanie Beekman, from the Mennonite centre.
They said putting together a Syrian display at the tent proved challenging, as most newcomers had next to nothing with them when they arrived in Canada.
Eventually, the centre was able to acquire a few items including a traditional coffee set, a small Syrian flute, a stringed instrument called an Oud, and a woman's wedding garment.
But the best advertisements for the Middle Eastern nation were Abou Hamrah and their family, who were eagerly showing off pictures of their country, telling tales of its long history, or performing a dance for people walking by.
The group, including brother Rani, sister Sabrin and mother Laila, arrived in Canada last New Year's Eve, more than three years after fleeing a decimated apartment building on the outskirts of Damascus.
After a week or so of adjusting to Edmonton weather — “It was sooo cold,” Rani recalled — the family has been busy in school, learning English and trying to figure out their lives.
They have also found time to help other refugees settling in Edmonton, and pitched in with the emergency relief effort following the evacuation of Fort McMurray. Basel said it was easy to empathize with people who lost everything to forces beyond their control.
As for the Heritage Festival, they said they and their family have seen nothing like it before. Yet seeing all the countries and cultures celebrating together is a small reminder of their own diverse home, and makes them feel less like an outsider, they said.
“We have been planning for what we want to try,” Basel said, eyeing all the food on display at Hawrelak Park. “I think all of them. Well, small portions from all of them.”
One pavilion the Abou Hamrahs might want to visit is Puerto Rico, which has its own tent for the first time at the 2016 festival.
Organizer Jamie Dolorier said it has been difficult to put together an entry, in part because there might be no more than 100 Puerto Ricans in Edmonton.
“Puerto Rico is a really rich fusion of music and spices and food and flavour,” they said. “We wanted to bring those elements here and make sure we do it right,” they said.
Beside platefuls of carne salteada (sauteed beef with peppers, onions and tomatoes) and yuka frita (fried cassava), the pavilion was also offering dances and lessons on playing the conga.
Heritage Festival spokesperson Deborah Forst said organizers are hoping for about 350,000 visitors over the long weekend — the record is 380,000 set in 2013 — though much depends on weather. A record 67 pavilions are on site this year.
The event kicked off Saturday with the singing of O Canada across the park. Groups at each pavilion were asked to sing the words in their own language, videotape it and send it to festival organizers, who will put together a montage that will be posted on Facebook.
Marjorie Bencz, executive director of the Edmonton Food Bank, said the festival is the single largest food driver for the agency each year. About 81,000 kilograms of food were collected last year, while $50,000 in unused food tickets were donated.
The food bank has had a particularly busy year serving Fort McMurray evacuees, and people who have lost jobs in the poor economy.

Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has recently been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. VBS.TV is broadband television network of VICE. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers.
Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Set beside the Imperial Valley in southeastern California, the Salton Sea area was supposed to be Hollywood's answer to the Riviera back in the '50s. But its developers failed to anticipate the raw sewage that would run up the New River from Mexico and make survival impossible for many aquatic species.
Rotting fish guts and toxic debris soon littered the shoreline. Construction projects were abandoned and yet another impotent vision of luxury tourism was left flaccid. Thanks again, trash!
See the rest of Toxic: Imperial Valley at VBS.TV
Today the entire Imperial Valley is an apocalyptic dustbowl in the center of the California badlands.
We set out to explore this fetid bouillabaisse. What we found were remnants of the Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range, a half-million-acre plot that was once the practice site for various governmental bombardiers.
It is the place of business for the residents of a nearby compound known as Slab City -- a mostly insane coterie of fun-hunting drifters, vets, addicts, artists and crazies who subsist on sautéed snake, lukewarm Tecate, money earned from scrapping bombshell fragments and what's left of their wits.
It's pretty much all that remains of the Wild West.
Please, please, please, when you are little bit depressed read this paper : http://innovativejournal.in/index.php/jpro/article/view/678 , it's a laughing-tears-paper (LTP).
It should have dealt with the conversion of -OH to -NH2 in one pot, or at least the abstract state that.
Now, after the first three lines…. Where the hell the nitrogen come from??? React alcohol, sodium oxide, TsCl and zinc and you will magically get some nitrogen. Amazing.
Ahhhhhh sodium azide, not sodium oxide. Ok, ok, at least now it makes a little bit more sense. Let's go check the experimental section then:
And here is the apotheosis of hilarity… First of all we are back on using sodium oxide but now the zinc disappeared.
Then we are not using 65-70C but we raised a little bit the temperature to 650C.
Then we need to quench few mmol with the fair amount of 5 LITERS of water.
Ok, now we have 5 L of water in the flask, we should deal with it.
What shall we do? Extract it with 25mL of ether!!!
5L of water….. and 25mL of ether….. ok….ok….
Now filter the ether off… well, we cannot really filter it off, are two liquids….
Right, right, then filtur it off. Ok, now makes way more sense, thank you.
Now dry it over unhydrus sodium sulfate, pay attention that it must be unhydrus!!!
No, no please, stop, please stop, I'm dying. Please stop.
And then the last nail in the coffin…….
Purify it with a silica get!!!!
Applause, applause, applause.
And thanks to one of my colleague that sent me this paper, fun for everyone from 6+.

Hey this is interesting, some people really prefer single slot high-end cards over dual-slot ones, yet you have to face the fact they will be noisy as heck though. GALAX however is prepping a single slot wide cooled GeForce GTX 1070.
As Xfastest reports, GALAX at their yearly GEC/GOX 2016 event showed a number of new graphics cards. They mostly are intended for the ASIA market, but among them was the single-slot GeForce GTX 1070 graphics card. Now here's the thing, I am not sure this is a GTX 1070 ? XFastest captions it that way but it could very well be a 1070. Let's presume the latter one. The card looks great though in that slim single slot design. Some copper fins are visible so that should help with cooling. If we are ever going to see this card launched I do not know, but hey until then, you can look at the pretty pictures.
GALAX will also introduce some M2 SSD series based on a Phison PS5008 controller and what looks to be Toshiba FLASH NAND. Also they are showing a PCI-Express based SSD, but they have been showing this stuff for years now without any proper retail availability. GALAX is also to relase a Gamer line of DDR4 memory, pics included.
Updated with some added pconline photos.
Rachel Dolezal Now Claiming to Be Founding Member of Bad Brains
SPOKANE, Wash. – After resigning from their post as president of the Spokane, Washington chapter of the N.A.A.C.P due to a highly publicized scandal regarding their race, Rachel Dolezal created even more controversy on Monday by claiming to be a founding member of legendary hardcore punk band Bad Brains.
The 37-year-old Dolezal claims to “have been there since day one” when describing their association with the band that formed in 1977 (when Dolezal was less than a year old).
Dolezal's parents, who are white, have stated publicly that their daughter was no where near Washington D.C.'s punk scene in the late '70s, or 171-A Studios, and that they have never expressed any interest in punk music until very recently.
“I… don't understand… why people have a hard time… believing this,” stated a confused Dolezal when confronted by reporters. “Being in the Bad Brains shaped my entire identity, they are like family to me.”
Bad Brains frontman HR has remained relatively quiet on the situation, and refused to comment on a picture Dolezal produced of the two, which they say proves HR is their father.

Security researchers at the Georgia Tech Information Security Center (GTISC) have discovered a way to jailbreak current generation Apple iOS devices (e.g., iPhones and iPads) running the latest iOS software.
The jailbreak, which enables circumvention of Apple's closed platform, was discovered by analyzing previously patched vulnerabilities with incomplete fixes.
It shows that quick workarounds mitigating only a subset of a multi-step attack leave these devices vulnerable to exploitation. Patching all vulnerabilities for a modern, complex software system (i.e., Windows and iOS) is often difficult due to the volume of bugs and response-time requirements.
" Our work shows that software vendors must patch all publicly disclosed threats, as they may be exploited in other, equally disruptive attacks," said Yeongjin Jang, one of the Ph.D. students who led this study.
During Black Hat USA, the GTISC research team will disclose the process for jailbreaking the current version of iOS (7.1.2) on any iOS device, including the iPhone 5s.
"We start by finding new ways to exploit vulnerabilities with incomplete patches," said Tielei Wang, a GTISC faculty member who worked closely with Jang as lead of the project. "Then, we use those vulnerabilities to discover new avenues of attack. We'll detail these vulnerabilities and the exploit techniques that we developed."
A Georgia Tech team that includes Ph.D. students Yeongjin Jang and Byoungyoung Lee, and research scientists Tielei Wang and Billy Lau discovered the jailbreak.

Vision Zero—the no-excuses approach to street safety that's been gathering steam in many of our peer cities—ended up punching above its weight as a political issue in this year's mayoral campaign. Tomorrow, the Bicycle Coalition and Thomas Jefferson University are hosting a Vision Zero Conference to explore what a comprehensive street safety policy would look like here in Philadelphia.* Leah Shahum, Executive Director of the newly-formed national Vision Zero Network, and former director of the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition, will be in town to participate in the conference, and we connected with them earlier this week to get their take on the politics of Vision Zero and what they hope to accomplish by networking Vision Zero cities.
PlanPhilly: Vision Zero in the U.S. context has been mostly a city-level phenomenon, although you now see the Federal Highway Administration and state DOTs taking up a similar cause with the Toward Zero Deaths campaign. Can you tell us a little about your background, and what made you want to start organizing nationally around this?
Leah Shahum: I started the Vision Zero Network earlier this year in the spring, so it's very new. I was the Executive Director at the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition for just over 13 years, and worked on promoting bicycling for everyday transportation. And we, along with our colleagues at Walk San Francisco, were the ones who brought Vision Zero forward in San Francisco in 2014. We had become very frustrated with the lack of progress on biking and walking safety, and we were very impressed with what we were reading about in New York City, who really got out ahead of other US cities on this.
I've been really impressed at how strongly and quickly Vision Zero has taken hold, particularly at the local level, and I recognized that this was going to be a growing movement, so I started this organization to help communities learn about and support each other's work. Every city is different, but the reality is that most of the things safety advocates are working on in all cities are pretty common.
One of our goals is just to advance the concept of Vision Zero and get it some attention. And secondarily, we're creating a network of cities working toward Vision Zero. How do we learn from each other and avoid wasting a lot of time and expending a lot of energy and resources trying to reinvent the wheel? With a network, we can see what worked in Philly, what didn't work in Chicago, and so on.
PP: Where is the Vision Zero Network's funding coming from?
LS: We got funding from Kaiser Permanente, who became interested in this because they realized that their goal of trying to get people to be more active, and use active transportation, wasn't going to be successful if people are scared of being on the streets.
PP: How is this effort different from what organizations like NACTO [National Association of City Transportation Officials] are doing to promote safer and more multi-modal street designs?
LS: NACTO does a great job of providing a forum for city transportation officials to exchange ideas, and we hope we can do the same with Vision Zero for other kinds of public officials.
Vision Zero engages other key stakeholders like police officers who are focused on traffic enforcement, and public health officials who are focused on data collection and analysis, as well as elected officials and community leaders.
We'll be helping to coach and support local advocates, and supply them with the stories and information about what's working well, and what's not working so well. We can also provide outside experts to testify on best practices.
PP: What do you think is the most impactful part of a Vision Zero initiative?
LS: I know it sounds very vague and overwhelming, but the idea of culture change is really important. It's a conversation that we haven't had in America very robustly around the issue of street safety. So there's a lot of work to do to start winning hearts and minds on this issue.
Injuries and deaths aren't something we have to accept as an unfortunate cost of doing business in society. In fact, we have control over our streets, we have control over city policies, we certainly have control over things like speed limits. We can make changes that save people's lives, and offer them greater mobility without fearing lack of safety.
PP: Here in Philly, our district Councilmembers are a lot more involved in street design issues than in some other places. Since 2012, any street design changes that remove a car travel lane or a lane of parking now require a Council ordinance. This made the politics of street design changes more similar to development politics under Philly's councilmanic prerogative tradition, and it seems to be having the effect of kicking some of these traffic calming debates down to a much more local level. Have you seen examples of the Vision Zero message being able to transcend some of the narrow neighborhood-level politics, because that seems like it's going to be the specific challenge in Philadelphia.
LS: In San Francisco, it's been a mixed bag, but the politics are different. Bike lanes, road diets, and stuff like that usually doesn't make it to the Board of Supervisors, our City Council, it's happening at the SFMTA. You could say it takes the politics out of it a bit, and that's sort of the case, but frankly as an advocate, sometimes it's helpful to have the politics.
For better or for worse sometimes very important transportation and traffic safety issues end up becoming bogged down in a Not In My Backyard kind of pushback. And I think it's become too common in many cities that safety projects can get watered down, or delayed, or worse, because of fear of change.
I think one way we are seeing Vision Zero address that challenge is by raising the conversation to the highest level. What Vision Zero can do is change the question to: What is the priority here? Are we taking a data-driven approach to safety, and choosing the safest options for everyone? We have to keep that focus even if some of the changes make people nervous. We can also test changes for a few weeks or months or years to see what works, to take away some of the nervousness.
Where we've seen San Francisco change, having Vision Zero as a priority and a framework for doing business has really increased the attention traffic safety has gotten from our Mayor's office. It's not so much that the politicians weren't doing and saying the right things, as that it was all just moving painfully slowly. And now our Mayor and City Council members will stand up in front of groups of people and say these crashes are preventable, they are committed to reducing them, and safety is their first priority. And then advocates can point back to those commitments later when individual projects are facing resistance.
It also gives politicians cover and department leaders cover. They're still going to get beat up verbally or debated when people are afraid of change. But they can point back to this higher need for safety, which is actually a higher political priority. It's every elected official's priority right? It's their job to keep residents and visitors safe, so then we build everything off of that.
PP: Pedestrian crash statistics are a pretty potent tool for public education and advocacy purposes. I've noticed locally though that there's no guarantee the Vision Zero interpretation of those statistics—that high-crash corridors need traffic calming and enforcement—will automatically be the takeaway. There have been a few instances here where the media would cover the same crash statistics, but then chalk the problem up to pedestrians being too distracted, or to motorists and cyclists having bad manners, while ignoring factors like over-engineered streets or lax traffic enforcement. The Nutter administration received a federal grant for a public awareness campaign about pedestrian injuries which utilized the same statistics, but had a distinctly pre-Vision Zero flavor that sort of ridiculed all street users equally, and rubbed some of the local Vision Zero supporters the wrong way. How do Vision Zero supporters reclaim the meaning of those statistics and steer the public conversation toward policy and design interventions?
LS: I haven't seen that specific PSA, but from what you're describing I can imagine it. You know we've had many debates at the local level over the years about what's the right message for this. I think safety is the base, where we need to design the streets so they are encouraging safety.
I think we spend a lot of time and resources, with mixed success, around educating the general public on behavior, and I don't want to say there's no place for that, but I think the more important education efforts going forward will be educating policymakers, decision makers, media—the influencers in our society. If we spent even a fraction of our time and resources on educating those influencers, that would be a far greater pay-off than some billboards and PSAs. There is a place for general public education, but it's very hard to measure, and hard to get it right.
PP: On that point, People for Bikes seems to have hit upon a good strategy to influence the influencers, where they take elected officials on junkets to Copenhagen with local transportation advocates to see some of these safe street designs up close—and of course have a nice little vacation in the process. As Sarah Goodyear wrote in Next City, elected officials tend to come back energized and enthusiastic about applying some of these ideas at home. [much like Gary Levitt, the Godfather of Open Streets PHL, did with the Walk on Walnut Street after returning from a vacation to Copenhagen - Ed.]
LS: It's one of the things we're thinking about with the Vision Zero network. We don't have a fleshed out plan yet, but we're looking at some of these programs, like how NACTO (National Association of City Transportation Officials) does these road show, or People for Bikes has the trips to Copenhagen and the Netherlands. How do we do that with the Vision Zero lens? Moving beyond the planners, how are we helping police meet their peers in other cities, or City Councilmembers meet their peers? It helps to show people what the environment and cultural context is that reinforces those policy changes.

For the nearly two years that I have lived in Kazakhstan, there haven���t been many opportunities to play games that have just fallen into my lap. No matter where you live in the world, ���playing games��� is still considered to be a fairly niche hobby for adults, but that is especially the case here. Despite living in place that could reasonably be called a ���gaming desert,��� (although ���gaming steppe��� might be a better term, looking at the local geography), I have still been able to create opportunities. The truth is that it simply takes a little bit of work and an openness about a desire to play.
When my wife and I first arrived, and we were getting to know our coworkers, I gradually noticed that there were a few people here and there that seemed like they might be easily convinced to try out some games they had never heard of. Little clues were everywhere: I went to a couple of low-stakes poker nights where people talked about some other card games they had played. Another evening we visited a couple that had a small stack of party games in the vein of Apples to Apples that they were excited to break out with a bigger group. One guy even had a copy of Diplomacy hidden in the bottom cabinet of a bookshelf��� and although I am not a huge fan of that particular game, the fact that they had played it before implied that they could surely endure something that wasn���t nearly as long or complicated.
These kinds of situations are what I see as openings. If you don���t act quickly, they disappear, and even if you do, they may not turn into an actual opportunity. Poker is almost a hobby unto itself, and I would hazard to say that most people who play Poker don���t play much of anything else. Despite making some suggestions for other kinds of Poker (i.e. something that didn���t have ���Texas Hold-Em��� in the title), or trying to suggest games that hold a bit more interest for me, nothing really came of it. The party-game couple was a bit more receptive – we rounded up some people and played some games of Apples to Apples (and a few other things), and kind of got our foot in the door with some of the attendees. The trick with big-group games, of course, is that a big group can be hard to herd into playing a game��� the other night, we were with some people who were very excited to play Taboo, and we actually got the game all the way unboxed and set up, but almost no one wanted to stop their conversations and gather around a little buzzer. That party ended with no game played.
The key to turning those openings into a real chance to play a game is being open about what you want to do. The Poker bros didn���t want to play anything else, but eventually word got around through them that I did. I���m not a huge fan of party games, but when people see me having fun and I suggest a different kind of game later, they listen. When I saw the copy of Diplomacy, and put that together with the stuff I knew about the owner (big fan of history, politics, especially when it has something to do with Soviet Russia), I took the chance to mention that I had a game they might really like: Twilight Struggle. Turns out, they were more excited about it than I expected. Those situations are obviously specific to my experience, but I have had countless others, and they all work the same way. If someone expresses an interest in some sort of game, I do, too, and it creates opportunity after opportunity. If a person asks me what I do for fun, I mention my collection of games and the podcast I run, and if they genuinely seem interested, I ask if they might be interested in trying something. If someone mentions that their daughters played Dutch Blitz with some friends on vacation, but they can���t find a copy anywhere, I tell them about the game stores I visit and help out. Another opportunity!
I don���t just have to wait for other people to express an interest, though. We have friends here, we���ve gotten to know some of the people really well, and they have likewise gotten to know us. They know we enjoy playing games and they���ve seen our game shelves. So if we invite someone over to our place for dinner, or are invited to theirs to make Christmas decorations, we ask if anyone would be interested in a game, too. Small gatherings like this work best; as I mentioned above, it can be incredibly difficult to rope a bunch of people in a large party together to sit down, shut up, and roll dice. So we tend to do it in small groups, four to six people, and eventually, no matter how long we shoot the breeze or dab leftover sauce of our plates with rolls, someone says ���So, about that game?��� And we are off to the races! I can���t tell you how many times we���ve tossed a light board or card game into an evening of chatting and snacking, and despite the worries that I sometimes have, it���s very rarely gone poorly.
I haven���t limited myself to small get-togethers, though. This month, we are hosting a big time Game Night at a community center, and although I don���t have any idea how many people are going to end up coming, I suspect that it will be moderately popular. This kind of thing takes more effort, but can end up even more rewarding. Of course, we had to get out fliers and information so that people know what���s happening, we had to prepare the location and make sure that the games won���t be too heavy on rules or too light on play, and we had committed to the possibility that we won���t be playing as much as we will be explaining��� but when the evening is over, there will be more people than ever that know about these games, associate us and their other friends with the fun of playing the games, and even more doors will be open for game playing in the future. We���re planning a mix of super-light filler (No Thanks!, Get Bit!, and Love Letter) with some slightly more complex gateway games (7 Wonders, CV, and Ticket to Ride).
Frankly, we should have done something like this earlier, but it can be hard to get the motivation to start. There���s fear of failure, fear of rejection, and fear of disorganization that get in the way, but the excitement that comes from it working is so much greater. I���m excited about doing this kind of thing wherever we end up living in the future, possibly scheduling it with ���International TableTop Day.��� If you have ever wanted to find gamers or get more games played in your life, there is no better way than putting together an event yourself.
Another thing I���ve done to create gaming opportunities is travel, which I suppose is less about ���creating��� a chance to play, and more about taking advantage of chances to play that exist elsewhere. Last year, my wife and I traveled to Essen, Germany to attend the Internationale Spieltage event, an unbelievably huge four-day board game festival. I played more games in those four days than I did in the year preceding them, and got to see a lot of really cool stuff in the Messe Essen convention center. If you do not live in a place where there are a lot of other gamers, I cannot recommend highly enough going to something like this��� even if the event in Essen is one of the biggest in the world, there is probably something nearby where you live that won���t break the bank and will give you some great fun. We���ve been to several gaming gatherings all over the world, and some of our favorites were right where we lived, with no travel or lodging costs, just the small cover fee to get in and play games for three straight days.
Outside of conventions, there are other gaming opportunities that traveling provides. For us, we happen to have an ever expanding scatter plot of friends living all over the world. Some I know from college or grad school, others I met in Japan or one of the handful of other places I���ve called home. Without exception, they are always excited to see us when we visit, and we feel the same way when people have come to stay with us. We visited a friend this year over a long holiday, and part of our plans included a Tex-Mex dinner and Game Night; we made burritos (glorious, succulent burritos) and afterward, cleared the table and got through several games of Dixit and The Resistance. There were some other things we had planned, but those were so popular with the nine or so people there that we didn���t get to anything else. That���s alright, though! How can I complain about getting to play some great games with a friendly group of people? Similar things happened when we visited friends in Indiana earlier this year. We got to play Hanabi and Space Cadets Dice Duel with one group, and Rampage and Funf Gurken with another. The moral here is this: Make every opportunity you can – you are very rarely annoying anyone by asking if anyone is up for a game, despite your concerns to the contrary, and it���s far more likely that the people you ask will have a lot of fun whatever you end up doing.
In the final part of this series, I���m going to write about the most common of my gaming experiences in living abroad: two-player board, video, and role-playing games. Even if you don���t have a significant other, though, two-player games are generally the easiest to get running – they just require you and one other willing participant! I also want to close on a short discussion of where we will be living next, and what our plans are once we are no longer ���gaming in Kazakhstan.���

× Florida Man Could Face Jail Time After Accidentally Shooting Self in Genitals
A Florida man was rushed to the hospital in the Jacksonville area on Friday after suffering an accidental gunshot wound to the penis, Tampa Bay television station WFTS reported.
Cedrick Jelks, 38, of Jacksonville climbed into their car and sat on their gun, which accidentally went off. Jelks immediately rushed into their girlfriend's house and went straight to the bathroom, according to WKMG-TV in Orlando.
Their girlfriend, Shanekia Roberts, quickly saw that Jelks had suffered a gunshot wound to their genitals and immediately rushed them to the hospital, where they underwent surgery.
Jelks potentially faces charges for possessing a firearm, as they were previously convicted of cocaine possession and not legally allowed to own a gun, according to reports.
If prosecuted for possessing a firearm, they could face a minimum sentence of three years in prison, according to the Miami Herald.
The Brierleys gave Saroo a loving home and a second chance, but memories of their birth family haunted him. As they grew older, these echos became louder until their early 20's when they were finally compelled to search for their lost home and family. Right around this time, Saroo heard about a new program called Google Earth. They realized they could use the tool's satellite imagery to find familiar landmarks, and lead them to the train station from their fleeting memories of that fateful night. Night after night for three years, Saroo followed train lines from space, combing through thousands of stations until one day in early 2012, they finally found the proverbial needle in a haystack.
Thanks to their unwavering determination, Saroo reunited with their birth mother after 25 years. Saroo's improbable story has been a source of inspiration to all of us on the Earth team and to many around the world. We're especially excited their story will reach new audiences with the release of the new film, Lion , on November 25.

It looks as though Disney's Hollywood Studios will soon be getting a new 'flex space' theater on Sunset Blvd.
A recently filed permit includes plans that outline a new theater space between Rock 'n' Roller Coaster and Tower of Terror. The backstage area has previously been used to host Darth's Mall during Star Wars Weekends, and various events during the old ESPN The Weekend.
The new 'flex space' theater being built may indicate that the park's other flex space, the Premiere Theater on Street of America may soon be closed. The Frozen Sing Along that currently plays in the location is being relocated to the Hyperion Theater, previously home to the American Idol Experience. Closure of the Premiere Theater without a replacement would leave the park short of locations of visiting high school bands and other special events.
The development is significant because the Premiere Theater sits in a key area that is expected to be used by the major rebuild of Disney's Hollywood Studios that is expected to be announced in the coming months.

Vanderbilt's Blair Schools Precollege Festival is music appreciation for all ages. (Photo: Submitted Photo)
Most people know that both Vanderbilt University and Belmont University have big bold, highly regarded music programs.
But did you realize that between Vanderbilt's Blair School of Music and the Belmont School of Music, there are more than 200 concerts each year that are free and open to the public.
It is everything from large orchestras, to chamber music, to chorale programs, to ensembles and any number of other combinations of fresh musical talent.
This fall at Vanderbilt, you can enjoy the Blair Jazz Faculty 50th anniversary performance of Miles Davis' legendary "Birth of the Cool" album; a collaboration between the Vanderbilt Opera Theater and Vanderbilt University Orchestra to present "The Marriage of Figaro;" a fun family musical afternoon; and several performances by noted soprano Ah Young Hong, during their week-long residency at Blair.
Or you could go to Belmont and take in a Belmont Symphony Orchestra concert, a program featuring an international piano competition winner, a unique Carillon Concert, umpteen student ensemble performances, and a brownbag lunchtime concert series.
Both schools see their free concerts as a way to connect with the community, as well as a chance to give their talented students exposure and practice.
"By providing almost all of our performances free of charge, we hope to expose as many people as possible to the joys and possibilities of musical expression," said Kristin Whittlesey at Blair, who added that providing "the highest-caliber musical performances to the Nashville community is a key part of our mission."
"Our performance schedule offers something for every listener," said Belmont Dean Stephen Eaves, who said the upcoming season includes "faculty and student concerts of classical masterworks, jazz, bluegrass and everything in between."
In most cases you can just show up for these concerts, and there is even free parking.

Mason Earle onsighting the "hard-hard crack." Photo courtesy of Salt Pump Climbing Co.
While visiting family in New England over the holidays, trad master Mason Earle stopped in at the new Salt Pump gym and walked away $1,000 richer. Earle earned the prize (sadly there was no oversize TV-style check) by onsighting the “hard-hard crack” at the new gym in Scarborough, Maine.
Salt Pump offered the prize as soon as it opened in late July, with backing from La Sportiva, Metolius, Doug Madara, and Mark Richey. The gently overhanging thin-hands and off-fingers crack, with a bulge in the middle, is protected by bolts alongside but would take purple and green Camalots for pro. Several locals had gotten close to the onsight before Earle claimed the bounty on December 22. After warming up on a couple of the easier crack climbs in the gym, Earle sent the hard-hard crack with a climbing shoe on their left foot and taped-up toes (no shoe) on the right.

“The Salt Pump cracks were super fun,” Earle said. “The hard one was probably 12+/13-. I taped my right foot, although it was probably more painful than helpful!”

Earle used the same taping technique to send one of North America's hardest crack climbs last March: the so-called Bartlett Wash Project, which they redpointed after two and a half years of efforts and called 5.14a/b.
Japanese college students, having apparently resigned themselves to living out the stereotype that Japan is one big, racially homogenous hive mind, seem to be foregoing their chance to really do something unique after years of mandatory school uniforms and opting to just wear whatever the guy or girl next to them is wearing.
This is resulting in some eerie Twitter photo galleries of literal rooms full of students wearing more or less the exact same outfit.
We have to give them credit, though: This is a step above the standard American college student uniform of whatever you were wearing when you got in bed, which, if you're lucky is pajamas, and if you're not, is whatever you wore during that bender last night plus a bunch of mysterious stains you can't remember how you got.
We can't blame you if the gallery below reminds you of some Twilight Zone episode:
▼ Okay, this would freak us out…
▼ Okay, enough shirts- on to the ladies.
Keep it real, guys.

A sneak peek at the new Trader Joe's at Quarry Village, set to open at 8 a.m. Friday, shows plenty to make shoppers happy, including 16-ounce packages of Italian-made pasta for 99 cents and nearly one-pound boxes of Joe's O's (Cheerio's type cereal) for $1.99.
The 11,000-square foot store is light, airy and inviting, with extra-wide aisles, light wood and a pale avocado and brown color scheme.
Murals depicting San Antonio scenes and signage mark the walls and aisles, all created by Trader Joe's crew members.
Jorge Macias, store manager or Captain, as TJ's titles him, says things are set for Friday's opening. For days, they and crew members have turned away potential customers who have been stopping by, ready to shop.
“In San Antonio, there are lots of foodies looking for great tasting products with high quality and value,” they say. After shopping once, typically visitors become Trader Joe's customers, they add.
Some 80-85 percent of items (more than 2,000) on TJ's shelves are store brand, says Macias. I counted some 14 salsas on the chip aisle, all bearing the Trader Joe's label.
Eight checkouts stand ready to handle customers. When the store opens to potential crowds, parking could be problematic, though Macias says they're working to find ways to make sure enough parking is available near the store, by other Quarry Village retail locations and in the parking garage.
Macias expects the store's products to “shift in and out, depending on customer demands.” The store gets about 12 new items each week. At present, there's a heavy emphasis on items for Thanksgiving dinner. Fresh turkeys will be available on Nov. 9.
Two-buck Chuck wines by Charles Shaw are priced at $2.99 here. The wines are more than about price, Macias says. “The quality of the wine itself is why it's popular,” they note.
More than 850 applicants tried for staff positions at the store; 80 percent of workers were hired in San Antonio. Macias declined to disclose how many workers the store hired.
Macias considers TJ's a “true neighborhood store”, though it's a store with a difference. Trader Joe's products have no artificial coloring, preservatives, additives or genetic modifications.
Friday morning's grand opening will include a lei cutting at 8 a.m., music and food demonstrations. The store will be open from 8 a.m.-9 p.m. daily.
There are more than 360 Trader Joe's nationwide with four in Texas. The store has a no-hassle return policy in which any item can be returned for a refund or exchange.
The first half of Thursday's Senate Select Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russian disinformation campaigns wasn't quite as fun as watching James Comey squirm their way around classified intel in the House, but it did provide some valuable context on Russian cyber methods and social media campaigns.
The morning hearing lacked the big names that are a little further down the pike, including former Trump campaign members Paul Manfort and Roger Stone and Trump son-in-law and senior advisor Jared Kushner, focusing instead on academics and researchers.
While most of the hearing was scene-setting, including a thorough Russian counterintelligence history lesson, some of its more compelling insights came from Clint Watts, a senior fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute's program on national security. Watts, a former FBI special agent who specializes in terrorism and online influence campaigns, spelled out some of the methods Russia uses to create and optimize its disinformation efforts.
“The first thing we need to understand is it's not all automated and it's not all human, it's a combination of the two,” Watts explained to the committee. “You can have someone engaging with you as an individual and using a bot to amplify their message… or [they] can create more personas on Twitter, for example.” This sort of thing saw an uptick in 2014, but Watts says it wasn't until 2015 that “they tied hacking and influence together for the first time.”
They went on to explain how Russia state actors create believable sock puppet accounts by insinuating themselves into the middle of a demographic they wish to influence. Using Wisconsin as an example, Watts described how such an actor would first “inhale” all of the accounts from a given slice of the population, parsing out details so they can then replicate the prevailing qualities in an average account. “They look exactly like you. It looks like an American from the Midwest or the South.”
They go on to build an audience within that target group, but they run into a bit of a problem when they wish to rebrand the sock puppet with a different identity. “They build an audience they don't want to get rid of it,” Watts explained. “These accounts are reprogrammed strategically. Then when they play both sides the audience will go with them once they have them.”
Those strategic accounts then work together to create the news of the day. Accounts associated with Russian intelligence “tweet heavily at Trump during times they know he's online [in order] to push conspiracy theories.”
After pushing coordinated waves of the propaganda du jour, such a high volume of content usually ends up trending. “Once it pushes to the top of the feed, mainstream news pays attention.”
When established news organizations must weigh in in order to debunk those fake news pushes, it still sets the national conversation for the day and distracts from other news that might work against Russia's interests, continuing the story's spread “organically.”
To combat this, Watts thinks that news stories need warning labels or certifications, not unlike nutrition labels on food, “a trusted integer that you can go to” so news consumers would know what they're getting.
The Senate committee stands in sharp contrast to the corresponding investigation in the House, which this week stalled after erratic behavior from its chair led to a full-fledged partisan meltdown. In the Senate, Republican Chairman Richard Burr and Democratic Vice Chairman Mark Warner appeared Wednesday to put their spirit of bipartisan cooperation on display, and led with opening remarks at Thursday's hearing that were friendly and collaborative.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Diane Abbott, new shadow home secretary, were greeted with a standing ovation as they entered the Stand Up To Racism conference today, Saturday.
Chants of, "Tories out, refugees in", rang out across the hall as they took to the stage. The conference saw over 1,500 people take part during the day.
Corbyn told the conference, "I consider it an honour to be amongst people I have known for many years who have stood the test of time in standing up for a decent society that drives racism from its midst."
Referring to Islington councillor and refugee Michelline Ngongo they said, "They're the heroes that we should be celebrating."
And they thanked Labour Lord Alf Dubs, who has pushed for more refugee children in Calais to be let into Britain.
Corbyn talked about the importance of fighting racism and fascism on the streets. "Tomorrow I'm going to be in the East End," they said. "I'm going to Cable Street to remember those who stood up against the fascists coming in.
"1936 was an absolute turning point in the battle against fascism in Britain. That demonstration sealed the fate of the fascists and Mosley. We should remember them and remember the unity that helped to stop them in their tracks."
Corbyn noted a "big spike in hate crime and abuse" since the Brexit vote.
They added, "It's important that we confront this. Confront it by legal means. Confront it by supporting communities. But above all confront it by reaching out to all communities so that we can come together."
And they spoke of the need for solidarity with refugees. "There are more displaced people around the world now than at any time on record," they said. "There are desperate people dying in oceans and seas across the world."
But they said solidarity involves seeking, "a political solution to the war in Syria and the places that are causing people to flee in the first place."
And it also involves doing more to help refugees. "Surely somewhere there has to be the hand of humanity, the hand of support to reach out to those people," they said. "Don't allow those people who are so desperate to be demonised."
Corbyn finished by saying, "Campaigning is very important. When we come together we can achieve a great deal. Think of the strength of communities together.
"Think of what they can achieve when we understand that diversity is not a problem, it's a strength."
There could be no more important time to hold this conference. We are going to stand up to racism" Diane Abbott
Abbott welcomed the conference, telling the rally, "There could be no more important time to hold this conference. We are going to continue to stand up to racism."
They attacked the Tories' promised racist attacks on migrants at their party conference last week. "What sort of country is this becoming when senior politicians are talking about companies and businesses keeping lists of foreign workers?" they asked.
"We know that post the Brexit vote is a difficult time for this country. But however you voted everyone in this hall can agree that the rise in racism and racist attacks that we've seen since it is utterly deplorable."
On their move to shadow home secretary they said, "I am proud to be shadow home secretary. It is no small thing for someone who's parents emigrated here in the 1950s.
"I will also work to uphold our rights. And I will also work to fight against racism, antisemitism, Islamophobia and anti-immigrant policies.
"I am not pretending that taking this political position will be easy. We will find weekend after weekend of smear stories in the press. I will not be put off by that.
"I, as your shadow home secretary, will be there in the struggle."
Ultimately, it would be a question of who we go to war against - Assad or the jihadis?
In Syria's largest city, Aleppo, rebels aligned with Al Qaeda control the power plant, run the bakeries and head a court that applies Islamic law. Elsewhere, they have seized government oil fields, put employees back to work and now profit from the crude they produce. Across Syria, rebel-held areas are dotted with Islamic courts staffed by lawyers and clerics, and by fighting brigades led by extremists. Even the Supreme Military Council, the umbrella rebel organization whose formation the West had hoped would sideline radical groups, is stocked with commanders who want to infuse Islamic law into a future Syrian government. Nowhere in rebel-controlled Syria is there a secular fighting force to speak of.
All those high profile defections of Syrian officers and men over the past year - defectors who were supposed to make up the bulk of the Free Syrian Army - have melted away or been absorbed by the jihadists. Obviously, western governments are not announcing this turn of events because it represents the most spectacular policy failure since the Iranian revolution. We've been encouraging the Gulf states to give arms to these groups to fight Assad and sure enough, they are beginning to turn the tide toward victory.
But what kind of "victory?"
This is the landscape President Obama confronts as they consider how to respond to growing evidence that Syrian officials have used chemical weapons, crossing a "red line" they had set. More than two years of violence have radicalized the armed opposition fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad, leaving few groups that both share the political vision of the United States and have the military might to push it forward. Among the most extreme groups is the notorious Al Nusra Front, the Qaeda-aligned force declared a terrorist organization by the United States, but other groups share aspects of its Islamist ideology in varying degrees. "Some of the more extremist opposition is very scary from an American perspective, and that presents us with all sorts of problems," said Ari Ratner, a fellow at the Truman National Security Project and former Middle East adviser in the Obama State Department. "We have no illusions about the prospect of engaging with the Assad regime -- it must still go -- but we are also very reticent to support the more hard-line rebels." Syrian officials recognize that the United States is worried that it has few natural allies in the armed opposition and have tried to exploit that with a public campaign to convince, or frighten, Washington into staying out of the fight. At every turn they promote the notion that the alternative to Mr. Assad is an extremist Islamic state. The Islamist character of the opposition reflects the main constituency of the rebellion, which has been led since its start by Syria's Sunni Muslim majority, mostly in conservative, marginalized areas. The descent into brutal civil war has hardened sectarian differences, and the failure of more mainstream rebel groups to secure regular arms supplies has allowed Islamists to fill the void and win supporters. The religious agenda of the combatants sets them apart from many civilian activists, protesters and aid workers who had hoped the uprising would create a civil, democratic Syria.
This is a far worse blunder than Egypt or any of the other "Arab Spring" revolutions. The same myopia that sees the Muslim Brotherhood as "moderate," blindly led the West to believe that the few secularists in the Syrian opposition - most of them living outside the country - would be able to build a political coalition that reflected a pluralistic, democratic Syria.
But the Sunnis have never been interested in anything but establishing a state where their dominance is assured. Much like the Shias in Iraq who could care less about the Sunni minority, the Sunnis in Syria are looking to establish an Islmaic state.
How did we miss this? When you imagine things that aren't there - "moderate" Islamists - your worldview is likely to reject the nose on your face if it conflicts with your version of reality. We are paying the price for our governmnet's stupidity. And even if Assad employs large scale attacks of chemical weapons, we aren't likely to intervene and help establish a radical, enemy government in Syria that would be a threat to every nation in the region.
Children Want Factual Stories, Versus Fantasy, More Often Than Adults
Enlarge this image iStockphoto iStockphoto
Childhood is a time for pretend play, imaginary friends and fantastical creatures. Flying ponies reliably beat documentaries with the preschool set.
Yet adults are no strangers to fiction. We love movies and novels, poems and plays. We also love television, even when it isn't preceded by "reality."
So, what happens as we make our way from childhood to adulthood? Do we ever really outgrow a childlike predilection for make-believe? Or does our fascination with fiction and fantasy simply find new forms of expression?
In a paper published earlier this year, psychologists Jennifer Barnes, Emily Bernstein and Paul Bloom set out to compare children's and adults' preferences for fact versus fiction in stories. Their results are surprising — and reveal something important about why we're so drawn to fiction in the first place.
In their first study, Barnes and their colleagues had 4- to 7-year-old children and adults choose which of two books sounded like it contained "the better story" based on a brief description of what it was about. For instance, participants had to decide between a story about a child "who found buried treasure" and one about a child "who discovered a dinosaur bone." But for half the participants, the treasure story was introduced as "true" and the dinosaur bone story as "make-believe" — while, for the other half, this pairing was reversed. This allowed the researchers to detect overall preferences for fact over fiction, over and above any preferences for particular content or themes.
Here's what they found: Children were significantly more likely to prefer fact over fiction. They were also significantly more likely to select the factual stories than were adults, who chose factual and make-believe stories equally often.
In a second study, Barnes and colleagues turned to the fantastical, pitting stories with fantastical characters or plots against realistic alternatives. For example, participants might choose between a story about "a boy who lives on an invisible farm" versus a story about "a boy with lots of brothers and sisters." Once again, they found that the children were more compelled than by realism than were the adults. The 4- and 5-year olds chose fantastical and realistic stories equally often, but the adults had a consistent preference for the fantastical.
These results are potentially counterintuitive — isn't childhood the bastion of fantasy and make-believe?
Barnes and colleagues offer a compelling explanation: Children are still learning about the real world. What's routine for us might be novel for them. In fact, we know that children (and adults) can learn from fictional stories, but children more readily apply what they've learned when the story is realistic as opposed to fantastical. Fiction and fantasy might be luxuries we can afford only after we've mastered the basics.
Taking a speculative step farther, we might expect stories to be an especially reality-bound medium for children. When children hear stories, they're typically receiving information from experts — older children and adults who know more about the world than they do. If stories are essentially a form of testimony about the world, it makes sense to favor fidelity.
But other forms of make-believe, such as pretend play or conversations with imaginary companions, need not be so constrained by reality. Activities like these are more likely to be initiated by children among children. And, unlike hearing a realistic story from an expert, engaging in imaginative play doesn't offer new data about the way the world works — it instead offers an opportunity to explore what we think we already know, including its limits and entailments. If stories are a form of input, imagination and pretense may be mechanisms for elaboration and assimilation.
At least, that's one story. And it might not even be fictional.

The Word of Faith Fellowship church members indicted for beating gay student Matthew Fenner
A day at church resulted in a nearly deadly beating according to out gay student Matthew Fenner. But their life wasn't in danger while in transit to church. Fenner says they were beaten in the sanctuary by five members of The Word of Faith Fellowship church in Spindale, North Carolina.
Now a student at the University of North Carolina, the 21-year-old Fenner told The Associated Press that they believed their life was in danger that night.
Nearly two years later, five Words of Faith Fellowship church members have been indicted for kidnapping and assault in connection with Fenner's beating, Reports the AP.
Fenner said they had to press authorities to investigate their allegations because of the church's influence in the community.

Booking photos have been released for the five Word of Faith Fellowship church members indicted for allegedly assaulting a former member.
Sarah Anderson and Brooke and Justin Covington are all charged with second degree kidnapping and simple assault. Anderson is also charged with assault by strangulation.
Robert Walker Junior and Adam Bartley are also charged with kidnapping and assault.
Former member Matthew Fenner alleges they were beaten and strangled by members of the church in January of 2013 because he's gay.
All five have been released on bond.

Libertarians speak often of private property, but to people not educated in libertarian philosophy, this notion can be confusing and seemingly subjective. In fact, the opposite is true: the concept of private property is objective and quite simple to understand.
Self Ownership
Before understanding man's ability to own other objects, one must understand man's ownership of themselves (or herself).
Each human being is the sovereign owner of them or herself. While this conclusion seems fairly obvious, we can arrive at it several ways. I will focus on the method used by Murray Rothbard and others below because I think that it is the easiest method for the common person to understand. For a more detailed and completely different approach, take a look at Ludwig von Mises' “action axiom,” and Hans-Hermann-Hoppe's “theory of argumentation.” This piece by Gennady Stolyarov II also summarizes the point as well.
One way to prove self-ownership is by assessing three possibilities of who owns a person: that everyone in the world owns fractions of everyone else in the world, that some group of elites owns everyone else, or that every person owns them or herself.
The first such possibility is that everybody has an equal claim to ownership over everyone else. Murray Rothbard (page 36) explained that this scenario
“holds that every man should have the right to own their equal quotal share of everyone else. If there are two billion people in the world, then everyone has the right to own one two-billionth of every other person. In the first place, we can state that this ideal rests on an absurdity: proclaiming that every man is entitled to own a part of everyone
else, yet is not entitled to own himself. Secondly, we can picture the viability of such a world: a world in which no man is free to take any action whatever without prior approval or indeed command by everyone else in society. It should be clear that in that sort of. . . world, no one would be able to do anything, and the human race would quickly perish.”
Thus, we are able to reject any notion that people can be co-owners of each other. Seeing that it is impossible for humans to all own equal shares in each other, we must now examine the notion that one group of people owns all of the rest of the people (page 28).
“a certain class of people, A, have the right to own another class, B…. Th[is] alternative implies that while Class A deserves the rights of being human, Class B is in reality subhuman and therefore deserves no such rights. But since they are indeed human beings, th[is] alternative contradicts itself in denying natural human rights to one set of humans. Moreover, as we shall see, allowing Class A to own Class B means that the former is allowed to exploit, and therefore to live parasitically, at the expense of the latter. But this parasitism itself violates the basic economic requirement for life: production and exchange.”
Thus, we are left with our third option, that every human is the sovereign owner of them or herself.
Acquiring Property
Property can be acquired in three different ways–two of the methods are just, while the third is unjust.
Homesteading
The concept of acquiring property through homesteading has a long philosophical tradition. In 1690, John Locke famously wrote (page 71):
“Though the earth and all inferior creatures be common to all men, yet every man has a “property” in their own “person.” This nobody has any right to but himself. The “labour” of their body and the “work” of their hands, we may say, are properly his. Whatsoever, then, they remove out of the state that Nature hath provided and left it in, they have mixed their labour with it, and joined to it something that is their own, and thereby makes it their property. It being by them removed from the common state nature has placed it in, it has by their labor something added to it that excludes the common right of other men. For this labor being the unquestionable property of the laborer, no man but they can have a right to what that is once joined to…”
Under homesteading, a person who improves or makes use of a natural resource becomes the owner of that resource. For example, if a person landed on an uninhabited island, and picked an apple off of a tree would become the obvious owner of that apple. No one else could rightfully claim ownership to the apple. Similarly, if this man were to cut down several trees on the island and use the lumber to build a home, this home and the land surrounding it would become their property.
Homesteading has its limits–one must improve or change the resource to be considered a just owner of that property. For example, if a man were to simple build a large fence around an area the size of Texas, they could not seriously claim to be the owner of all land inside of the fence. Similarly, if I were to claim ownership of the planet Saturn, I would be ridiculed, and when the time came that humans visited Saturn, my descendants could not expect to collect rent from these astronauts.
Murray Rothbard explains this concept (page 170):
“If Columbus lands on a new continent, is it legitimate for them to proclaim all the new continent their own, or even that sector ‘as far as their eye can see'? Clearly, this would not be the case in the free society that we are postulating. Columbus or Crusoe would have to use the land, to ‘cultivate' it in some way, before they could be asserted to own it…. If there is more land than can be used by a limited labor supply, then the unused land must simply remain unowned until a first user arrives on the scene. Any attempt to claim a new resource that someone does not use would have to be considered invasive of the property right of whoever the first user will turn out to be.”
Voluntary Exchange
Under voluntary exchange, a person can trade any of their justly acquired resources with another person in exchange for some of that person's justly acquired resources. For example, the man above who took an apple off of an unowned apple tree could trade their apple with another person for a product of that person's, as long as the trade was voluntary.
This right also derives from the right of self-ownership. I own myself and I may sell my labor to another person for a wage or a product (I could sell 8 hours per day of my time to an employer for a fixed rate of $10 per hour). At the end of the day, I now own the $80 (meaning that the employer no longer has any claim to this money), which I am able to trade with a different merchant for some of their products.
Thus, any resources which are acquired justly can be traded for any other resources that are acquired justly. In completing such a transaction, original owners must completely give up their right to the property that they have sold.
Theft
Theft is taking things by force (including fraud or threat of violence). Theft is immoral and unjust, and one who acquires resources by theft should not be considered to be the legitimate owner of that resource.
If I were to take $10 from a person without their permission, it is obvious that I have stolen from them. If this person is paid $10 per hour by their employer for their labor, I have effectively stolen an hour of this person's life.
Similarly, if a food merchant were to market a meal as “non fat,” knowing that the meal contained 10 grams of fat, they would have acquired the money from that trade through fraud. Thus, the person who purchased the meal would have a strong claim against the merchant and should be entitled to receive a refund or some form of compensation.
Additionally, if a man with a gun were to demand that unless you pay them 1/3 of your income they would lock you in a cage, they would be guilty of initiating the use of force with the intent of committing theft. It would not matter if the man promised to use this money to pay for a school for your children, for a new highway, or for a missile defense program. Taking things from a person without their permission is, by definition, theft. Silver-tongued rhetoric may be employed to obscure this fact, but it cannot change it.
Taking something from another person without their permission is always theft and should be condemned as theft. It does not matter what the “reason” or “justification” for this action is. It does not matter who committed this theft, what was stolen, or how many people told the aggressor to act.
People often use majority support as a justification for increases in taxes, large new social programs, war, and government debt because “the people overwhelmingly support them.”
Rothbard (Pages 57-58) shoots this idea down as well.
“even if 90% of the people decided to murder or enslave the, other 10%, this would still be murder and slavery, and would not be voluntary suicide or enslavement on the part of the oppressed minority. Crime is crime, aggression against rights is aggression, no matter how many citizens agree to the oppression. There is nothing sacrosanct about the majority; the lynch mob, too, is the majority in its own domain.”
Unfortunately, our current system does not always respect private property rights. Remember, that property rights are inviolable, and that action taken against a person's property without their permission is aggression. It is a sad fact that property rights (often including the right to self ownership) are regularly discarded by the very government which was instituted to protect our liberties.

Transducers: Why and How?
By Beerend Lauwers
I encountered the notion of transducers about a year ago, but didn't really look into it. Recently, I encountered it again in a presentation about functional programming in C++ (slide 37).
The article on the Clojure website didn't really help, and a Google search for “Haskell transducers” gave me discussions such as “Clojure's Transducers are perverse lenses” (What?) and transducers are functions a -> [b] cleverly transformed with a bit of continuation passing so that the Kleisli composition operator becomes (.) (What?!?).
Franklin Chen's blog post made things a little clearer, but the why was still escaping me. And with this StackOverflow post, I think I got the gist of it.
Why?
Transducers are useful to compose transformations together:
Transducers are composable algorithmic transformations. (Source)
They generalize over the input and the output containers, so a little like fmap :
They are independent from the context of their input and output sources and specify only the essence of the transformation in terms of an individual element. Because transducers are decoupled from input or output sources, they can be used in many different processes - collections, streams, channels, observables, etc. (Source)
Note that there is nothing that ties transducers to any concrete “collection” type. We could write instances of Foldable and Conjable for some kind of “channel” abstraction, for example, and instantaneously be able to munge data coming from it and to another. (Source)
This allows for more code reuse.
How?
In Clojure, some functions produce a transducer based on how many arguments you provide the function.
In Haskell, we have to define some functions that give us (or even: lift a function to) a Transducer (examples taken from here:
-- Left reduce type Reducer a r = r -> a -> r type Transducer a b = forall r . Reducer a r -> Reducer b r -- Produces a Transducer that maps stuff from a to b. -- mapping :: (a -> b) -> (r -> b -> r) -> r -> a -> r mapping :: (a -> b) -> Transducer b a mapping f xf r a = xf r (f a) -- A really simple 'reducer' to append something to a list. -- conj :: [a] -> a -> [a] conj :: Reducer a [a] conj xs x = xs ++ [x] -- Takes a transducer and a list, then applies conj to the transducer and folds the entire thing to list as the output. -- xlist :: Transducer a c -> [a] -> [c] xlist :: (([a] -> a -> [a]) -> [b] -> c -> [b]) -> [a] -> [c] xlist xf = foldl (xf conj) []
xlist is very interesting, because it's what can be abstracted over: it is the container in which our data lives. We could have an xvector instead, for example.
This also explains why, in the Transducer type, r is universally quantified: the transducer functions like mapping are not allowed to know what the container is for this generalization to work.
This is exactly the point the Clojure documentation makes:
They are independent from the context of their input and output sources and specify only the essence of the transformation in terms of an individual element.
Franklin Chen's blog post has some code that shows which typeclasses are necessary to abstract over the container type. For our purposes, we won't do this exercise, but continue with the list representation.
An example
Let's take xlist ( mapping (+1) ) [1..5] as an example.
xlist becomes:
-- xlist xf = foldl (xf conj) [] -- xf = mapping (+1) xlist = foldl ( (mapping ( + 1 )) conj ) [] [ 1 .. 5 ]
mapping then becomes:
-- mapping f xf r a = xf r (f a) -- f = (+1) -- xf = conj -- r = we don't know yet. -- a = we don't know yet. mapping = \r a -> conj r ( ( + 1 ) a )
Working out the iterative step of foldl:
-- foldl f z (x:xs) = foldl f (f z x) xs -- f = (\r a -> conj r ( (+1) a )) -- z = [] -- (x:xs) = [1..5] f z x = ((\r a -> conj r ( ( + 1 ) a )) [] 1 ) = conj [] (( + 1 ) 1 ) = conj [] 2 = [ 2 ]
So this is where it happens: the (+1) function given to the mapping transducer ends up in here. The foldl function will collect it all into a list, giving us [2,3,4,5,6] .
To reiterate, the generalized transducer functionality allows you to abstract over the container and just say “I want to map over it and then filter it and then use it in a formula”.
That is, we can compose “recipes” out of functions that then work on every type of container for which the appropriate typeclasses are defined. Let's see how such a recipe works behind the scenes.
Another example
-- A filter lifted to a Transducer. filtering :: (a -> Bool ) -> (r -> a -> r) -> (r -> a -> r) filtering p xf r a = if p a then xf r a else r -- concatMap lifted to a Transducer. flatmapping :: (a -> [b]) -> (r -> b -> r) -> (r -> a -> r) flatmapping f xf r a = foldl xf r (f a) -- Three composed transducers. xform :: (r -> Integer -> r) -> (r -> Integer -> r) xform = mapping ( + 1 ) . filtering even . flatmapping (\x -> [ 0 .. x]) xlist :: (([a] -> a -> [a]) -> [b] -> c -> [b]) -> [a] -> [c] xlist xf = foldl (xf conj) []
Let's write out xlist xform [1..5] .
First, xlist :
-- xlist xf = foldl (xf conj) [] -- xf = mapping (+ 1) . filtering even . flatmapping (\x -> [0 .. x]) xlist = foldl (mapping ( + 1 ) . filtering even . flatmapping (\x -> [ 0 .. x]) conj) [] [ 1 .. 5 ]
Then, flatmapping (\x -> [0 .. x]) conj :
-- flatmapping f xf r a = foldl xf r (f a) -- f = (\x -> [0 .. x]) -- xf = conj -- r and a = don't know yet, they'll be given to us in the foldl call. flatMapping = \r a -> foldl conj r ( (\x -> [ 0 .. x]) a ) = \r a -> foldl conj r [ 0 .. a]
Then, filtering even (\r a -> foldl conj r [0..a]) :
-- filtering p xf r a = if p a then xf r a else r -- p = even -- xf = \r a -> foldl conj r [0..a] -- r and a = don't know yet, they'll be given to us in the foldl call. filtering = \r a -> if (even a) then (\r a -> foldl conj r [ 0 .. a]) r a else r
Then, mapping (+1) (\r a -> if (even a) then (\r a -> foldl conj r [0..a]) r a else r) :
-- mapping f xf r a = xf r (f a) -- f = (+1) -- xf = \r a -> if (even a) then (\r a -> foldl conj r [0..a]) r a else r -- r and a = don't know yet, they'll be given to us in the foldl call. mapping = \r a -> (\r a -> if (even a) then (\r a -> foldl conj r [ 0 .. a]) r a else r) r (( + 1 ) a)
Finally, working out an iteration of the foldl step:
-- foldl f z (x:xs) = foldl f (f z x) xs -- f = \r a -> (\r a -> if (even a) then (\r a -> foldl conj r [0..a]) r a else r) r ((+1) a) -- z = [] -- (x:xs) = [1..5] f z x = (\r a -> (\r a -> if (even a) then (\r a -> foldl conj r [ 0 .. a]) r a else r) r (( + 1 ) a)) [] 1 = (\r a -> if (even a) then (\r a -> foldl conj r [ 0 .. a]) r a else r) [] (( + 1 ) 1 ) = if (even 2 ) then (\r a -> foldl conj r [ 0 .. a]) [] 2 else []) = if (even 2 ) then (foldl conj [] [ 0 .. 2 ]) else [] = foldl conj [] [ 0 .. 2 ] = [ 0 , 1 , 2 ]
It is now obvious that each transducer results in a left-to-right embedding: while the definition of xform is mapping (+ 1) . filtering even . flatmapping (\x -> [0 .. x]) , the functions are executed left-to-right:
[1,2,3,4,5] becomes [2,3,4,5,6] ( mapping transducer)
transducer) [2,3,4,5,6] becomes [2,4,6] ( filtering transducer)
transducer) [2,4,6] becomes [0,1,2,0,1,2,3,4,0,1,2,3,4,5,6] ( flatmapping transducer)
Hopefully this clarifies how transducers work!

A Piece Of Immigration Debate Returns To Senate
The issue of immigration reform has been dormant of late on Capitol Hill, and a lack of bipartisanship has been keeping it and some other matters from moving anywhere.
toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images
But this week, Democrats are seeing if they can open a window of opportunity -- one that could quickly close because of the looming midterm elections.
They're looking to attach the DREAM Act to the annual defense policy bill that the Senate is scheduled to take up Tuesday. The measure would put illegal immigrants who come to the United States as children on a path to citizenship if they fulfill several requirements. (DREAM stands for Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors.)
It's one of two high-profile issues that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has said will be voted on when senators take up the defense legislation. The other, which is already a part of the defense measure, is repeal of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy that bars openly gay Americans from serving in the military.
Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), has been trying for 10 years to get the DREAM Act through Congress.
Web Resources The DREAM Act
"Here is how it works," says Durbin. "The student would have the chance to qualify only if they or they meet these requirements: came to the United States as a child; lived here for more than five years; has good moral character; has not engaged in criminal activity; does not pose any threat to national security; passes a thorough background check; and graduates from an American high school."
If they meet those tests, young people would qualify for temporary legal status. They would have to go to college or join the military in order to get a green card.
The proposal had been floating around Congress without much momentum until last week, when Reid raised eyebrows with the announcement that they want the DREAM Act added to the annual defense policy bill.
Republican Sen. John McCain, their party's 2008 presidential nominee and the ranking minority member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, says this is all about politics.
"This is turning legislation related to our national defense into a vehicle to force a partisan agenda through the Senate -- often on a party line vote," they say. According to McCain, the Democrats' "desperation" about what could happen to their numbers in Congress this November "is palpable."
Reid, who's locked not only in a tight re-election race for their own seat but also has to consider whether their party will still have control of the House and Senate after November, objects to such characterizations.
"I don't think we should talk about how beneficial the Dream Act is for Democrats," they say. "I think we should talk about how fair it is to people who should be able to go to school if they want -- join the military if they want to. It has nothing to do with Democrats [or] with Republicans, and everything to do with fairness."
Sweeping immigration overhaul bills are considered dead-ends on Capitol Hill because they won't get anything close to bipartisan support. The more narrowly focused DREAM Act has had Republican sponsors, and so is considered by some a foot in a door that stands some chance of passage and perhaps leads to more overhaul efforts in the future.
But Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports strict immigration control, says Democrats are going to "get pinched by that door closing on their foot."
They see the DREAM Act firing up conservative voters. Democrats, they say, have given opponents "something specific to work against."
There will be DREAM Act supporters, though, also lobbying their senators. Carlos Coronel was among some of the hundreds who rallied on Capitol Hill with hundreds of immigration supporters last week. They say their mother, who's from Guatemala, benefited from the 1986 Immigration Reform bill, and they call the DREAM Act a stepping stone.
"I understand a point of view that it's just a way to get voters excited," Coronel says. "But at the same time, more people are going to stand up and ... come out of the shadows and show how successful such a reform as the Dream Act can be -- which will be like a sample of how great a reform a comprehensive bill would be."
In today's Photoshop tutorial we're going to create a cool portrait effect using a long passage of text that bends and deforms around the contours of the face. Known as a Calligram, this effect is particularly powerful when used to present famous quotes or speeches by depicting the author/speaker with the actual words. Photoshop's Displace filter is the key ingredient in this recipe which allows us to accurately wrap the text around the subject.
In my example, I'm combing a stock photo with a transcript of the speech from the movie The American President (1995) to create a totally fictional presidential address, but this calligram effect would be a great style for a series of famous speeches from the real American presidents of the past.
Begin with your chosen image in Photoshop. I'm using this stock portrait of a senior man from Shutterstock. Crop your image to fit into your final poster dimensions.
Add a Black and White Adjustment Layer and add more contrast to the image by darkening the Red channel. Unlike a normal Levels or Brightness/Contrast adjustment, altering the Red channel only produces some lovely tones.
Select the image layer then add a Gaussian Blur from the Filter menu. Enter around 20px for the radius. This blurring will help soften the displacement effect.
Go to File > Save As and save this document as displace.psd, then use the Step Backward shortcut of CMD+Alt+Z to undo the blurring effect.
Select the Type tool and draw a container across the entire document. Paste in your chosen quote/speech and delete any line breaks to leave a continuous wall of text. Turn off the Hyphenate option and select a Justified paragraph layout.
If the text doesn't completely fill the image simply copy and paste the contents to fill out the required space. Select a font for your design, I'm using Montserrat Bold in uppercase. Reduce the text size and leading so the text densely covers the portrait.
With the text layer selected, go to Filter > Distort > Displace. Agree to Rasterize the type, then enter 10 in the Horizontal and Vertical scale options. After clicking OK, navigate to the displace.psd file we saved earlier.
CMD+Click the thumbnail of the displaced text layer to load its selection, then turn off the layer visibility. Go to Edit > Copy Merged (or CMD+Shift+C) to take a clipping of the face using the outline of the words.
Create a new document, which Photoshop will automatically size to the dimensions of your text clipping. Paste in the artwork, then fill the background with black to see the original portrait constructed out of tiny words that warp around the facial contours.
Thanks to the displacement effect, the portrait image is still clearly visible despite being made from a wall of text. From a distance it looks like a simple pattern overlay, but up close it becomes intriguing to read the tiny words that construct the image.

SAN FRANCISCO (March 7, 2013) -- Heart attack rates have spiked in Greece since the start of the country's financial crisis, especially among women and residents older than 45, according to a study of patient records being presented at the American College of Cardiology's 62nd Annual Scientific Session.
The study examined the medical records of 22,093 patients admitted to the cardiology department of the General Hospital of Kalamata over an eight-year span, with patients divided into a pre-financial crisis period from January 2004 through December 2007 or the crisis period, January 2008 through December 2011. The crisis period was defined by change in the country's gross domestic product, or GDP. Patient numbers and demographics were similar in both groups, with 10,870 (49.2 percent) pre-crisis patients and 11,223 (50.8 percent) crisis patients. Because General Hospital has the only cardiology department in Messinia prefecture, one of the country's regional units, these data represent this entire region in southwest Greece.
Researchers found a significant crisis-period spike in heart attacks, with 1,084 heart attacks compared with 841 pre-crisis (22.46 per 10,000 people vs. 17.43 per 10,000). Heart attack incidence rose across the board: 20.8 percent for patients age 45 or younger (64 vs. 53), 25.7 percent for men (807 vs. 642), 29.4 percent for those older than 45 (1,020 vs. 788), and 39.2 percent for women (64 vs. 52).
"Greek women have a higher unemployment rate than men, they are responsible for child care and they also work outside the home--a formula for stress," said Emmanouil Makaris, MD, a consulting cardiologist at Kalamata's General Hospital.
Factors that might contribute to the higher heart attack rate among older patients include limited job opportunities for unemployed middle-aged men and their much greater prevalence of atherosclerosis, a major risk factor, they said.
"Unemployment is a stressful event and stress is connected with heart disease, but other issues also come with financial difficulties," Dr. Makaris said. "In these times a lot of people do not have money to buy medications or to go to their primary care doctor. There's a great increase in cardiovascular diseases across the country. The cost to the society is very high."
Researchers plan to continue to track heart health and the economy and also hope to expand their work to encompass all of Greece.
"Although Messinia has both urban and agricultural regions, we don't know what is going on in Athens," Dr. Makaris said. "The capital has almost 3 million people and is an urban industrialized area that may be more affected by the financial crisis."
The total GDP loss has been almost 25 percent since the crisis began, and the country remains in financial crisis, with a GDP in 2012 of minus 6 percent and an unemployment rate of 26.8 percent that is still growing.
"We need more support for doctors and patients, more people who can recognize warning signs of myocardial infarction earlier in hospitals," Dr. Makaris said. "In everything surrounding health care--biomedical supplies, personnel in hospitals--there are shortages."
With these findings, researchers aim to educate health professionals and policymakers about the serious impact the financial crisis is having on heart health at a time when austerity measures are leading to reductions in medical staff, supplies and services--and, ultimately, to increase the resources required to cope with escalating need by changing the country's health policy.

The University of Massachusetts basketball team got a bit of good news late Tuesday night in the form of a verbal commitment from talented Chicago point guard LuWane Pipkins.
Pipkins, a 5-foot-9, 155-pound high school junior at Bogan Preparatory School, is rated a 3-star prospect by most of the major online scouting outlets, including 247sports.com, Scout.com and Rivals.com (No. 122 overall). News of their commitment was first reported by the Daily Hampshire Gazette.
Pipkins, who plays AAU ball for Mac Irvin Fire, becomes the first member of the Minutemen's 2015 recruiting class. Expected to receive more attention than ever from recruiters this summer, he's also drawn interest from power conference schools like Creighton, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Tennessee, West Virginia and Atlantic 10 rival La Salle.
"I just felt it was right for me," Pipkins told the Chicago Tribune. "I watch them play, and I saw that Coach (Derek Kellogg) let Chaz (Williams) play their game."
Sized similarly to outgoing point guard Chaz Williams, Pipkins is also described as a playmaker who can lead a team offensively. They possess a pretty jump shot and is a strong on-ball defender with a knack for pick-pocketing lazy ball handlers.
Per the Chicago Tribune, which named Pipkins its January athlete of the month, they were averaging 27 points, five steals and four assists to go with 90 percent free-throw and 46 percent 3-point percentages though Feb. 8 for Bogan.
We know Hillary has their rats inside of many of the mainstream media outlets, but now it looks like they may even have some sources inside of Fox News.
A new email from the Wikileaks release show a source “heard that they could ask about carbon tax and late-term abortion restrictions.”
Low and behold, the transcript from that debate did have moderator Bret Baier asking them about abortion!
Remember the first debate against Trump when everyone thought Hillary's answers were extremely scripted sounding?
People were saying the same thing during their debates against Sanders and now we know why!
As that email clearly alludes to, they had the question and prepared an answer for it!
While much of the media applauded Hillary Clinton for being super prepared for the debate, the first thing most of us said was that they had to have those questions ahead of time. I don't care how much preparation you do, you cannot have answers like that ready for every question asked.
They were not thinking of replies, they were rattling off prepared speeches for each and every one of them. Then, of course, there was the question as to whether or not they also had an ear piece in with someone also feeding them information.
Hillary is pulling out all of the stops now.  They are getting debate answers, signaling moderators, and more than likely paying people off to make accusations against Donald Trump as election day gets nearer.
All we can do is fight back by educating people and making sure everyone we know pulls that handle for Trump in November. Don't waste your time talking to their die-hard supporters, because they drank the kool-aid already.
Let's concentrate on this middle of the road people that have yet to make a decision. If we can show them how corrupt Hillary Clinton is, we can take this thing and take back OUR White House!

A disabled boy meets the paralysed man who gave up their dream of walking again in order to help the youngster take their first steps.
Selfless Dan Black – who was left in a wheelchair by a 2009 cycling accident – has given £20,000 to Brecon Vaughan, five.
The money, raised over the last four years, was supposed to pay for pioneering stem cell treatment that could have helped Dan, 25, get back on their feet.
However, after reading about the plight of Brecon, who suffers from spastic diplegia cerebral palsy, Dan decided the boy had a better chance of walking so handed the money to them instead.
Brecon's parents have described Dan's generosity as “phenomenal” and a huge boost towards the £60,000 needed for an operation which will allow their son to walk unaided.
Dan, from Chepstow – the same Welsh town as Brecon – said: “For me, things are not getting better soon.
"I wanted to help someone whose life could get better. If I can help someone to walk, I will. Brecon can walk if they have the surgery.”
Brecon, who uses a walking frame, was born with the rare disease which causes stiffness in their legs.
Before Dan's gift, the family had managed to raise £11,000 for the US operation.
The boy's mum Ann, 44, said: “What Dan has done is brilliant. It is a phenomenal gift. They clearly understand the frustrations our son has.”
Dad Rob, also 44, added: “It's heartbreaking that Brecon can't play with their friends.
“Dan has taken us well over halfway to our target. How do you even start saying thank you for something like that?”
To help Brecon, visit www.justgiving.com/Brecons-SDR-Journey .
We at the Mirror are so impressed with Dan that we have nominated them to be considered for a Mirror Pride of Britain Award. UPDATE: Dan was an award winner at our 2013 Pride of Britain Awards.

Rust merge process
New contributors on the Rust project are generally a bit lost on how the merge process is working. This little article intends to make things a bit more clear. But first, let's start with steps before opening a Pull Request.
Things to do before asking a review
First, it might seem obvious but better sure than sorry: run tests! The command is as follow:
make check
It can take some time so don't worry and go do something else meanwhile.
Next, it's a very common mistake: new contributors (and all contributors more generally) don't know or don't think about running the make tidy command. As long as this command doesn't end successfully, this work won't get merged!
Once this done, you can open the pull request.
Review process
Once the pull request has been opened, a Rust contributor/reviewer will review it. Don't be surprised if it isn't accepted at first try: it's normal. A few typos or formatting issues can still be present, so don't worry and just fix them.
If you update your code (and don't add new features in this process), you'll need to squash your commits. If you don't know how to do it, you can take a look here.
When it's all good, a reviewer will then "r+" your pull request. It means that it's now added to the pull requests list that need to be tested with buildbot (an open source test platform, the rust instance is hosted by Mozilla). You can see the current pull request queue here.
buildbot
It tests your changes on a wide range of platforms (Windows, Linux, OSX, ...) and architectures (32 bits, 64 bits, arm, ...). Once again, it can take some time so once your pull request has received "r+", just go do something else. Either your changes have succeeded or not, buildbot will leave a message on the pull request (with bors pseudo).
Confusion with travis and buildbot
It's important to differentiate both of them: travis is an online platform which tests changes. If travis passes, it doesn't mean that your changes will succeed on buildbot too. However, if travis fails, buildbot will as well.

Caches are important in helping to solve time complexity issues, and ensure that we don't run a time-consuming program twice. You never know when your scripts can just stop abruptly, and then you lose all the information in your cache, and you have you run everything all over again.
In order to counter this, saving your cache to a disk is something that can be very helpful in that it allows state to be saved to disk, and be retrieved from it anytime as long as its there.
The function below can be used as a decorator for methods to ensure that the cache is persisted to the disk with a specific filename you can determine to wrap around the original function.
import atexit import pickle # or import cPickle as pickle def persist_cache_to_disk ( filename ): def decorator ( original_func ): try : cache = pickle . load ( open ( filename , 'r' )) except ( IOError , ValueError ): cache = {} atexit . register ( lambda : pickle . dump ( cache , open ( filename , "w" ))) def new_func ( * args ): if tuple ( args ) not in cache : cache [ tuple ( args )] = original_func ( * args ) return cache [ args ] return new_func return decorator
You can then use the decorator as such:
@persist_cache_to_disk ( 'users.p' ) def get_all_users (): # your method here pass
A gist for the code is located here.
Mozilla is planning a version of the Firefox OS for wearables, and one of the top priorities is to break down barriers among smartwatches, smart glasses and other body-hugging devices based on Apple's and Google's operating systems.
The Firefox OS is already being used in low-cost smartphones, and will be used in 4K TVs released by Panasonic in 2015. Mozilla now wants to expand the OS to a wider range of devices, including wearables and home appliances, said Joe Cheng, manager of product and project management of the mobile devices group at Mozilla, in an interview on the sidelines of the CES conference.
©IDG News Service/Agam Shah
It's important to push the OS into more Web-connected devices and to provide a consistent user experience, Cheng said.
The goal for the Firefox OS is to provide an underlying operating system for all mobile devices, TVs, appliances and wearables to easily communicate and exchange information with each other, Cheng said.
For users, the Firefox OS would provide an alternative to wearables being developed based on Google's Android Wear, or Apple's iOS, which will run on the upcoming Apple Watch. Firefox OS is already being used in low-cost handsets, and a version of the wearable OS could be attractive to low-cost smartwatch makers in countries like China, who sell products for under $100.
Wearables like smartwatches are today considered secondary devices to mobile phones. Smartwatches can track fitness information and also display notifications, social networking updates and news feeds from handsets.
But there's a problem -- wearables with Android Wear can talk only with Android devices, and the upcoming Apple Watch is expected to exchange information only with the iPhone.
Mozilla wants to break that walled garden and make sure wearables with Firefox OS communicate with all devices, regardless of OS. The company is betting that its use of open-source technologies will make that possible.
"We want to break that single-brand barrier," Cheng said.
Cheng didn't provide a timeline for when the Firefox OS would reach wearables. The company, however, is talking with partners who may be interested in using the OS.
"We want to make sure what we're building is right for user instead of just another product on the market," Cheng said.
In an animated presentation, Mozilla demonstrated what a Firefox OS could bring to wearables. A smartwatch could receive a notification once a washing machine completed a cycle, or track fitness information that could then be passed on to smartphones -- a typical feature of current smartwatches on the market.
Firefox OS has struggled for adoption in smartphones, but had some success at CES, with Panasonic adopting it for TVs. The biggest asset in Firefox OS is the use of open-source technologies, which could make it attractive to hardware makers. But Firefox OS has been criticised for its slow speed on handsets, and it remains to be seen if Mozilla can create a truly competitive, lean OS for wearables.

Since their defeat in the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton is no longer the world's second most powerful woman.
In fact, the former presidential candidate fell down 63 spots all the way to number 65 on the Forbes Magazine list.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has taken over the number 2 spot. Maintaining the number one spot for another year is German Chancellor, Angela Merkel.
It's the seventh year in a row for Merkel as the most powerful woman in the world.
While Clinton's lost leaves the United States as one of the few top democracies that have never had a woman leader, she's number 20 on the list of powerful women in politics.
Since the election Clinton has been focused on building up future leaders through their organization, Onward Together.
New to the world's most powerful women's list is Ivanka Trump at number 19.

Prior to the trade, they had pitched 104 innings for the Cubs with a 2.25 ERA but the move to the American League was rough for him. With the Rangers, they threw 69 innings with an ERA of 5.09, despite a better strike out rate. They do offer teams significant durability; since converting to the starter's role in 2008, they have topped 200 innings four times and last season they pitched a total of 173.
It will be interesting to see if they do find a three year deal this off-season. They will be 36 years old in May and their mixed results last season may be cause for concern. However, with the high salary expectations for Zack Greinke and Anibal Sanchez, Dempster could certainly be one the better values this off-season, even at three years.
"(Charter schools in Missouri) are actually failing in a greater capacity than the public school systems."
Since the confirmation hearing for U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, charter schools have been under increased scrutiny.
In Missouri, charter schools have only been built in Kansas City and St. Louis, but a bill now before the legislature may make it easier for the schools to pop up in other towns.
On March 17, the Missouri House of Representatives narrowly passed and sent House Bill 634 to the Senate to allow for the expansion of charter schools. One legislator who didn't vote in favor for House Bill 634 was Rep. Nate Walker.
The Republican from Kirksville told MissouriNet that Speaker Todd Richardson, R-Poplar Bluff, tried to persuade them to change their mind, but Walker wouldn't budge. One reason, Walker said, was because "(charter schools in Missouri) are actually failing in greater capacity than public school systems."
But are they? Walker didn't provide a definition for what they meant by failing, and the Missouri education department doesn't have a specific definition, either. However, after looking at the education department's performance reviews, the data shows that charter schools are performing about the same as nearby public schools.
Definitions of failing
When PolitiFact called Walker and asked them where they got their data, they said they got it from a "lot of different things," and began providing some numbers.
"Sixty-four percent of Missouri Charter Schools have failed or are failing," they said, without citing the source of these statistics. "Since 1999, we've had 59 charter schools open in the state. Thirty-eight of the 59 charter schools have failed or are failing students."
However, according to the data from the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, for the 2016-17 year there were 72 individual charter schools within 39 charter school districts. And since 1999, the year after charter school law was enacted, there have been 63 charter school districts, and 21 — or 33 percent — have closed.
When we asked Walker in a phone interview what their definition was for "failing," this was their response:
"Well, they're not meeting the standards of the (education department). You go check the facts, I'm not a reporter. You've got a degree in journalism and understand factual information, but I stand by my comments, and all you need to do is go do your research and find I'm absolutely right. Probably more than right."
We went to the education department to learn more. Sarah Potter, the communications coordinator for the department, wrote in an email, "There are no parameters in state statute for a ‘failing' charter school."
However, the department does issue an Annual Performance Review score for both charter and traditional public schools to determine how well they're educating the students. Charter schools are independent public schools freed from certain regulations. They are also subject to other rules defined by their contracts with their sponsors, such as universities, who then hold charter schools accountable for their results instead of the state.
This performance review takes into account standardized test scores, attendance rates and graduation rates along with financial status and leadership stability.
There are four levels of accreditation. "Accredited with Distinction" and "Accredited" signify that the school or district is meeting performance standards. Schools or districts must earn a 70 percent or higher on their performance review to earn those classifications. "Provisionally Accredited" and "Unaccredited" indicate that the school or district isn't meeting performance standards and earned a performance review score below 70 percent and below 50 percent, respectively.
In fact, in our phone interview with Walker, they did mention accreditation, saying: "Of the 38 charter schools (districts) currently open for business, 11 have been deemed Provisionally Accredited, six would have been deemed Unaccredited and four were too new to receive a score. Right now 46 percent of the active charter schools would be classified as Accredited."
These numbers are correct — though there were 39 districts and not 38 as Walker said — according to the latest data available at the state education department's website.
For comparison, 99 percent of traditional public school districts earned Accredited or above while only 46 percent of charter school districts earned that status. It's not looking so good for Missouri charter schools.
Charter schools vs. traditional public schools
Not so fast, said Doug Thaman, the executive director of the Missouri Charter Public School Association.
"One of the concerns we have is that when statements are made like (the one) Walker made, that's a comparison of charter schools to an entire school district, and that is just not a true comparison," they said. "You can't compare a single school to an entire district or to the entire state."
What Thaman means is that performance scores are assigned to both individual schools and the districts in which several schools reside, and the scores are often different. They also pointed out that charter schools, which have to accept any student who applies, often educate lower-performing students whose needs haven't been met by traditional public schools, so charter schools score poorly on the performance review because they're helping students who score below grade level catch up.

A new ad from the Obama campaign makes the following claim: “Mitt Romney made $20 million in 2010, but paid only 14 percent in taxes — probably less than you.” Is this true? PolitiFact comes to the following odd conclusion:
There are two main ways to make this calculation, and they lead to opposite conclusions. While we believe that including payroll taxes in the calculation offers a more accurate picture of what the American public pays the IRS, it's also true that the Obama ad didn't specify which measurement it was using, and in fact used a figure for Romney — 14 percent — that was based on income taxes alone. On balance, then, we rate the claim Half True.
If it were true that the Obama campaign used one number for Romney — federal income taxes paid — and used a different number for everyone else — income taxes plus payroll taxes — PolitiFact would have a point. But what makes them think this is what the Obama campaign did? According to their most recent tax return, Romney paid 13.89% in federal income taxes. If you add in the payroll taxes they paid, that number probably rises to about 13.95%. In other words, 14%, which is the number the Obama campaign used. And as PolitiFact itself concludes, that's less than most taxpayers pay in total federal taxes.
So why does PolitiFact claim that Obama used two different tax calculations? I don't think they did, and if PolitiFact agrees that including payroll taxes offers a better picture of total federal tax liability — as they say they do — then Obama's ad is 100% defensible and accurate. Am I missing something here?

In this weekend's New York Times Magazine, there's an interview with President Obama in which they assess their economic legacy, and as you might expect, they have a complicated view of things. They think their administration did an excellent job pulling us out of the Great Recession: “I actually compare our economic performance to how, historically, countries that have wrenching financial crises perform. By that measure, we probably managed this better than any large economy on Earth in modern history.” But they wish they had been able to pass more infrastructure spending: “it was the perfect time to do it; low interest rates, construction industry is still on its heels, massive need.”
Obama also makes an argument about what Republicans propose to do on the economy that gets directly to the competing stories that the two parties are going to be presenting to the American public this fall.
Even if a contest between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton may be more focused on personality than your typical presidential campaign, it's still the case that the outcome of the election will be determined in significant part by which of these economic stories the voting public finds more persuasive. And each story has two parts: a description of the American economy as it is now, and a proposal for what the candidate would like to do and how that plan will change things. Here's Obama's assessment of the Republicans' second part:
“If you look at the platforms, the economic platforms of the current Republican candidates for president, they don't simply defy logic and any known economic theories, they are fantasy,” Obama said. “Slashing taxes particularly for those at the very top, dismantling regulatory regimes that protect our air and our environment and then projecting that this is going to lead to 5 percent or 7 percent growth, and claiming that they'll do all this while balancing the budget. Nobody would even, with the most rudimentary knowledge of economics, think that any of those things are plausible.”
You won't be surprised to hear that I happen to agree with them on this, though I'd describe how ridiculous it is in somewhat stronger terms. I can't stress this enough: Republicans argue that if we just cut taxes on the wealthy and reduce regulations on corporations, then the economy will explode in a supernova of prosperity for all. You can call this belief ahistorical, or unsupported by facts, or baseless or implausible, but if you want to be frank you'd have to say that it's absolutely lunatic.
But let's put this in context of the stories the two candidates will be telling. Here's Donald Trump's economic story:
The economy is an absolute nightmare. Americans are living in such misery that they're practically eating their own shoes in order to survive. If we cut taxes on the wealthy, reduce regulations on corporations, renegotiate trade agreements, and deport all illegal immigrants, then our economy will be spectacular and working people will experience American greatness again.
And here's Hillary Clinton's economic story:
The economy is doing pretty well, and a lot better than it was eight years ago when the Republicans were in charge, but it could be even better. If we pass some worker-focused measures like increasing the minimum wage, stronger overtime protections and guaranteeing equal pay, and make infrastructure investments, then our economy will improve for everyone.
Trump's story is the same one other Republicans tell, with the addition of the idea that “bad deals” on trade have had a crippling effect on the country. For the moment we'll put aside the merits of Trump's claim that imposing enormous tariffs on Chinese goods will cause all those jobs sewing clothing and assembling electronics to come pouring into the United States, but the political question around Trump's story is whether people will believe their over-the-top description of both what's happening now and the transformation they will be able to produce.
We've known for some time that voters' perceptions of the economy are colored by partisanship: to simplify a bit, when there's a Democrat in the White House, Republican voters will say that the economy is doing poorly and Democratic voters will say it's doing great; when there's a Republican president, the opposite is true.
For instance, in 2012 when Barack Obama was running for reelection, 49 percent of Democrats told the National Election Studies that the economy had gotten better in the previous year, while only 17 percent said it had gotten worse. On the other hand, nine percent of Republicans said it had gotten better, while 56 percent said it had gotten worse. Go back to 2004 when George W. Bush was running for reelection, and we see the reverse: 43 percent of Republicans said the economy had gotten better and 22 percent said it had gotten worse, while only 10 percent of Democrats said it had gotten better and 63 percent said it had gotten worse.
So obviously, people aren't just reacting in an objective way to what they see around them. At the same time, there is a reality that can eventually poke its way through the veil partisans place over their eyes. In 2008, when the economy was in a catastrophic decline, everyone in both parties agreed on what was happening (94 percent of Democrats and 88 percent of Republicans said it had gotten worse).
Times like 2008 are rare, though. Today, the objective reality is a lot closer to the way Democrats describe it, in large part because they aren't offering an extreme version of their truth. If Obama and Clinton were more rhetorically similar to Donald Trump, they'd be saying that this is the greatest economy in the history of human civilization, everybody has a terrific job, and there's so much prosperity that the only question any American has is whether to spend their money on everything they could ever want or just roll around in it like Scrooge McDuck.
But they aren't saying that. Instead, they're attempting the tricky balancing act of emphasizing the progress Obama has made while acknowledging the long-term weaknesses in the economy. Both of those things are real. Since the bottom of the Great Recession early in Obama's first term, the economy has added 14 million jobs, and unemployment is now at 5 percent. On the other hand, income growth has been concentrated at the top and Americans still feel uncertain about their economic futures.
Donald Trump has chosen to pretend that the good things about the American economy don't exist, and weave a laughable fantasy about what their policies will produce (“I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created”). Can they convince voters — particularly those in the middle who might be persuaded to vote for either candidate — to believe it? I guess we'll see.

GOES-16 to GOES-East Drift Plan
In May, it was announced that GOES-16 would become GOES-East late in the calendar year. This week, detailed drift plans were released!
GOES-16 will begin drifting from the checkout position (89.5W) on 30 November, reaching the GOES-East position (75.2W) on 11 December. After a period of calibration, the satellite will return to operations as GOES-East on 14 December.
GOES-16 ABI, GLM, SUVI, SEISS, and EXIS data will not be available between 30 Nov and 14 Dec.
GOES-13 (current GOES-East) will remain at 75W until 2 January, when it will begin drifting to its storage location at 60W. It will reach the storage location on 22 January.

“The GOES-16 data posted on this page are preliminary, non-operational data and are undergoing testing. Users bear all responsibility for inspecting the data prior to use and for the manner in which the data are utilized.”
Signing off on the 2014 accounts, the European Court of Auditors seemed to lose patience and urged the European Commission to come up with a whole new approach on spending.
“The EU must invest its money better, ” said Vítor Caldeira, president of the European Court of Auditors on Tuesday (10 November), presenting the annual report to the European Parliament.
EU budgetary spending totaled €142.5 billion in 2014 or just around 1% of EU gross national income and represents approximately 2% of total public spending in EU member states.
Even though the Court found the estimated error rate for expenditure at 4.4%, roughly the same level of 2013 (4.5%), it was concerned by the lack of responsiveness to tackle pressing needs, such as the migration crisis.

“Taken together, our audit results over recent years point to a need for a wholly new approach, if the EU budget is to be invested better and more quickly to meet the challenges that Europe now faces,” Caldeira insisted, echoing last year's remarks.
At the moment, financial backlogs are preventing the EU from using the money effectively. “Greater flexibility is needed in the EU Budget,” Caldeira added.
According to EU auditors, decision-makers must align the budget better with the EU's long-term strategic priorities and make it more responsive to crisis.
“The EU must ensure its investments match its priorities more closely, simpler rules are framed to achieve results and resources are managed more efficiently,” argued the Court's president.
European Commission Vice-president responsible for budget Kristalina Georgieva didn't disagree with the auditors and, speaking in Parliament, they said that the EU executive is already aligning budget with needs.
Agree w/ @EUAuditorsECA Pres Caldeira: new realities require new action. We are aligning #EUbudget with priorities and focusing on results. — Kristalina Georgieva (@KGeorgievaEU) November 10, 2015
Every year the European Commission tables a draft EU budget. It proposes how to distribute the amounts under the different headings according to EU political priorities and within the limits set by the 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), the seven-year budget cycle of the EU.
Locked in these limits, the budget lacks flexibility, insist the auditors, urging decision-makers to make the MFF mid-term review scheduled for 2016 a real moment for rethinking the EU budget and inject a dose of common-sense.
Pointing at the inflexible seven-year budget cycle, the auditors are hinting in favour of a system that is more in sync with national budgets, where planning cycles range from three to five years.
“The long planning cycle puts the budget under immense strain,” explained a court spokesperson, adding that as such the EU budget is unfit to tackle unforeseen
challenges—like the migration crisis.
The Court also stressed the importance to ensure transparency for EU policies not directly funded from the EU budget. “New ways of funding EU policies should not put financial risks beyond public scrutiny and audit. That would be short-sighted and may prove counterproductive in the longer term,” stressed the EU auditors.
EU countries' absorption capacity
A closer look at the revenue and spending per budget area also shows that some countries are struggling to absorb the EU funds they have been allocated.
“The Commission has put funds at the disposal of member states without sufficiently considering their capacity to invest them,” said EU auditors, adding that the backlog of unused funds represents a significant share of overall government spending.
Pointing to the progress of Europe 2020, the EU's 10-year jobs and growth strategy launched in 2010, the Court slammed the lack of consistency alignment between the two budgetary periods (2007-2013 and 2014-2020). On the other side, member states seem to give inadequate attention to Europe 2020 achievements in partenership agreements and programmes.
“The Commission has so far reported on the contribution of the EU budget to the Europe 2020 objectives in a limited way,” said the EU auditors.
Overall, the five headline targets, seven flagship initiatives and for the European Structural and Investment (ESI) 11 objectives are neither individually nor as a whole designed to translate the political aspirations of Europe 2020 into useful operational objectives, stressed the Court.

The MLS Players Union has once again released the player salaries for the 2016 season. Here are the numbers for FC Dallas.
A reminder, these are not cap numbers, but are a good guideline give or take.
2016 FC Dallas Salaries
Player Pos Base Salary Guaranteed Compensation Acosta Kellyn M-D 220,000 240,000 Akindele Tesho M-F 90,000 107,500 Barrios Michael M-F 70,000 70,000 Bonner Colin F 51,504 51,504 Castillo Fabian M-F 155,750 170,750 Craft Coy F-M 70,000 87,083 Diaz Mauro M 466,000 544,400 Figueroa Maynor D 115,000 138,333 Gonzalez Jesse GK 67,500 76,875 Gruezo Carlos M 450,000 686,500 Guillen Aaron D 51,500 51,500 Harris Atiba D-M 143,000 143,000 Hedges Matt D 152,000 152,000 Herman Ryan GK 62,508 62,508 Hernandez Moises D 100,000 105,000 Hollingshead Ryan M-D 122,500 122,500 Jara Agustin F 62,508 62,508 Lizarzo Carlos M-F 62,508 130,633 Loyd Zach D 200,000 221,666 Ortiz Juan Esteban M 160,000 204,500 Pitter Timo M-F 51,504 51,504 Rosales Mauro M 62,500 62,500 Seitz Chris GK 136,000 136,000 Ulloa Victor M 130,000 132,500 Urruti Maximiliano F 250,000 250,000 Zendejas Alejandro M 70,000 88,466 Zimmerman Walker D 174,000 174,000
Most expensive player: Carlos Gruezo at $685,500 passing up Mauro Diaz.
Of note is the exceptional value of Fabian Castillo at $170,750. Their actual cap number may be higher dues to their large transfer fee and the murky MLS roster/cap rules.
Michael Barrios at $70k is also a steal.
Kellyn Acosta also makes a lot more money than I expected at $240k.
What do you think of the FCD wage scale?
Greenlight as a process has numerous issues, among them being buried in Steam, a process that makes no sense to anyone and a lack of proper updating. However, that is not what we are here to discuss at this time beyond in how it impacts the story here.
Given the hidden process of Greenlight and the fact that a lot of games stall out at a certain interest level, game developers have attempted to come up with different ways to promote their game. Sometimes that is through other game shops like Greenman Gaming, Indiestand, Desura, Gamersgate, and so forth. Sometimes, it is via promoting it on social media, getting out and talking a lot and doing whatever you can. Oftentimes, it is a mixture of various things that small business' everywhere are known to face – trying to run and work on your product while promoting it.
That makes it all the more understandable that the people who are working to get greenlit would push the boundaries of what might be acceptable. With a process that fails to work in many cases, it does make sense that someone like Eugene Ivanov, founder of Iosoftware, would create a facebook group like Indie Gamedev Greenlight to help push games forward. The focus of Indie Gamedev Greenlight, at least at first, was to force vote games up the Greenlight ladder and share status and stories on Greenlight to an extent to get worthy projects out of the slow lane and onto Steam.
The original rules for the group were pinned at the top in a featured post saying the following (on October 24th)
RULES OF THIS GROUP:
1) STRICTLY no off-topic
2) Look through the posts, you MUST vote for ALL games submitted here.
3) After you voted for all others' games, you can submit your greenlight projects.
4) you should post updates about your projects with screenshots of greenlight stats.
The 2nd rule in particular caught some attention as it seemed to be against the spirit of Greenlight but it does not that it would violate the rules strictly. The group doesn't carry a massive weight having grown up to about 370 members now, but that can get a game moving some in theory. However, and this matters a lot, Greenlight is a subjective process by Valve in most cases and it's supposed to be based on community interaction ideally. As one might expect, they weren't particularly happy with this group's existence.
Commenting on the group and its method the Valve representative said “Clearly this is not the feedback we are seeking from Greenlight. We do track these sorts of things and folks ‘going this route' will likely not find the results they may have hoped for.” The quote here hints that Valve may blacklist games that are posted here or make it more difficult for them to get approval regardless of actual support for the game.
Perhaps responding to that, or to private concerns from Valve, Eugene updated the rules of the group on October 29th to say the following
RULES OF THIS GROUP:
This group is a place to showcase your games. We don't ban for your honest wish to spread the word about your project.
1) STRICTLY no off-topic
2) Look through the posts, vote for games you like.
3) After you viewed and voted for others' projects (your choice which ones), you can submit your greenlight projects.
4) you should post updates about your projects. What you did to promote it, and if it was successful.
5) we DO ban for showing hatred, intolerance, or discrimination. Please respect each other!
These set of rules appear to be more in line with what in theory Valve approves of in building a community interest and only voting on games that you are interested in. The previous set of rules though may hang over the group as an anchor-weight due to the perception of gaming the system that may stay in Valve headquarters.
Despite that, the Indie Dev Group is a vibrant group with plenty of people posting games, updates and sharing stories about greenlight. Perhaps, instead of being a way to get onto Greenlight faster by force voting, it will be one that allows them to focus, and share their projects more.
