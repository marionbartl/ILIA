The following is a partial list of currently operating independent schools in Scotland.
Many of the schools are perceived to be heavily influenced by the culture, practices and ethos of English independent, or "public", schools. Author James Robertson described Glenalmond College as "a Scottish boarding school modelled on the English public school system". The perceived English influence in many of these schools was such that in 1887 one author referred to them as "English schools". 43% of Scottish independent secondary schools offer boarding as an option, although there is more of a trend to attend as a day pupil compared to in England.
There are 102 independent schools across Scotland of which 72 are members of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS). According to the SCIS, its members educate around 29–30,000 pupils in Scotland representing around 4.1% of the school age population in Scotland. The figure is significantly higher in Edinburgh, with around 1 in 4 pupils educated at an independent school, the highest proportion in the UK.
Scottish students from independent schools are over-represented at the four ancient universities of Scotland. They represented 26% of the student body at the four institutions in 2014/15 with 71% in total receiving an offer of admission at one of the four ancient universities compared to only 29% of state-school entrants.

Sir William Howard Hearst, (February 15, 1864 – September 29, 1941) was the seventh premier of Ontario from 1914 to 1919.
Hearst was born in Bruce County, Ontario. He practiced law in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario before being voted to provincial parliament as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario. After six years representing Sault Ste. Marie in provincial government, Hearst became Premier of Ontario following the death of Premier James P. Whitney in 1914.
Hearst's was the first Conservative provincial government to enact women's suffrage. He was in favour of the prohibition movement, and restricted the unlicensed sale of alcohol in Ontario. As a wartime administration, his government improved munitions production and hydroelectric infrastructure.
Early life and career
William Howard Hearst was born in the Township of Arran in Bruce County, Ontario. He studied law in Owen Sound and was called to the bar lawyer in 1888. Hearst moved to Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, where he established the law firm Masson, Hearst, McKay in the Ganley Block at 604 Queen Street. Hearst participated actively in the Sault Ste. Marie community and was on the building committee to erect a new Methodist church at the corner of Spring Street and Albert Street in Sault Ste. Marie. The Methodist church that was eventually built still stands and is now known as Central United Church.
Hearst was an unsuccessful candidate in the Algoma East riding in 1894. In 1902, he organized support in Northern Ontario for James P. Whitney. Hearst was also appointed Sault Ste. Marie's volunteer fire chief from 1891 to 1892. Hearst built a house at the corner of Queen Street and Upton Road. Known as Eastbourne, it would become a designated heritage property in the City of Sault Ste. Marie.
In 1908, Hearst was elected member for the riding of Sault Ste. Marie. He became Minister of Lands, Forests and Mines in 1911. On the death of Whitney in 1914, Hearst became his successor and was sworn in as Premier on October 2, 1914, the first premier from Northern Ontario.
Premiership
Under his administration, a comprehensive measure to provide compensation to workers for injuries was put into operation. He took steps to deal with housing problems and provide loans to settlers. Municipal acts were passed. School fairs and the teaching of agriculture were inaugurated. Measures were taken to increase war production. Reforestation and fire prevention services were established. The Orpington Hospital, in England, was built as a gift from the people of Ontario.
An increase in demand for electricity in Ontario led Hearst's government to commission the construction of the Queenston-Chippawa Hydroelectric Generating Station in 1917, which was one of the largest hydroelectric projects in the world.
During the 1917 conscription crisis, Hearst supported conscription and the federal Unionist government. In March 1918, Hearst and the Ontario Liberal leader, William Proudfoot, agreed to extend the existing provincial government until Canadian forces returned home in 1919.
Prohibition
The Hearst government struggled to find consensus on the question of prohibition. Hearst personally identified with the temperance movement, but barkeepers and alcohol producers formed part of the voter base of his party. Hearst established the Board of License Commissioners (BLC) in 1915, which distributed licenses for businesses seeking to sell alcohol.
In 1916, the Ontario Temperance Act (OTA) was introduced as a temporary wartime measure by Hearst, a temperance advocate and pillar of the Methodist Church. It made possession of liquor and beer outside one's home illegal. Although one could retain a cellar supply for personal consumption, it was illegal to sell a drink. As a result, the government shut down bars, taverns, clubs, and liquor stores. The establishment of the Acts were controversial among anti-temperance Canadians.
In 1919, after Canadian soldiers had returned from Europe, Hearst called a plebiscite on prohibition, which was held the same day as the 1919 general election. Prohibition was approved by the voters, but his government was defeated in the election.
Women's suffrage
Beginning in 1915, Liberal representatives proposed bills enabling women to vote in Ontario. Hearst initially opposed suffrage but by 1917 had changed his opinion on the subject. Ontario was the fifth province to pass legislation permitting women to vote, and Hearst's government was the first Conservative provincial government to do so.
1919 general election
In the election of 1919, Hearst was surprised by his loss to the United Farmers of Ontario. Historians have varying opinions on the reason for the result of the election, including federal conscription, the OTA, and poor opinions of the industrial workers and the rural population.
Later life
After his loss in 1919, Hearst remained in Toronto, where he had lived since 1912.
Hearst served as a member of the International Joint Commission, which had been formed to settle international boundary waters disputes between the United States and Canada.
Legacy
The Town of Hearst, in Northern Ontario, is named for William Hearst.
A street in North York, south of the intersection of Keele Street and Wilson Avenue, is named after him. The Humber River Hospital and offices of the Ministry of Transportation are on this street.
A plaque honouring Sir William H. Hearst stands in Tara Park in the Municipality of Arran–Elderslie in Bruce County. It was erected by the Ontario Archeological and Historic Sites Board.
Sault Ste. Marie
William Howard Hearst was the first premier from northern Ontario. He has an enduring legacy in Sault Ste. Marie. A street in the northern city has been named after him. A city streets directory from 1914 shows the street was previously called "Hurst Street", but by 1915, the year after Hearst became Premier of Ontario, the name was changed to "Hearst Street".
In July 2015, the city recognized Hearst by naming the holiday on the first Monday in August (previously known as Civic Holiday) as Sir William H. Hearst Day.

Ilse Getz (born Ilse Bechhold; 24 October 1917 – 4 December 1992) was a German-born American painter and collagist active in New York and Newtown, Connecticut, from the 1950s through the 1980s. She specialized on three-dimensional works, made mostly with found objects. She exhibited at several galleries in New York City including the Bertha Schaefer Gallery and Rosenberg Gallery, as well as in Europe, namely in Switzerland, Germany, France and United Kingdom.
Life
Ilse Bechhold was born in Nuremberg, Germany, on 24 October 1917 in a family of Abraham Bechhold and Pauline Mann. When her father committed suicide in 1929, she was sent to Hamburg to live with her sister. In 1933, she and her sister left Germany, traveling to Italy, Spain, Cuba and Mexico. Bechhold then joined immediate family in New York. In 1937 she married lawyer David Getz and settled in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Three years later she gave birth to a child and became naturalized citizen of the United States. In 1942 Getz visited her sister in Mexico. In 1943, upon returning to New York, she attended Art Students League, studying with George Grosz and Morris Kantor.
In 1945 Getz worked as freelance artist and already had her first exhibition at the Norlyst Gallery in New York. During 1947–1948, she traveled and worked in Europe, visiting Switzerland, France, Spain and Portugal, and Brazil. From 1954 to 1959 Getz worked in various art galleries in New York. In summer 1956 and 1958 she taught and exhibited at the Positano Art Workshop in Italy along with Piero Dorazio. In 1958 Getz married her second husband, artist Manoucher Yektai.
The following year she received Yaddo foundation fellowship to the artists' community. In 1960 Getz designed backdrop for Eugene Ionesco's play “The Killer” in New York. The next two years she spent in Paris where she was represented by Iris Clert Gallery. In 1962, Getz returned to New York City and maintained studio on the Upper East Side. In summers 1962, 1963 and 1965 she painted on Mykonos in Greece.
Getz married in 1964 to Gibson Danes, Dean of Yale School of Art and Architecture. It was the third marriage for both of them. The couple lived in New York and Connecticut, and eventually settled in Newtown, Connecticut. Later in life, Getz suffered from advanced Alzheimer's disease and Danes feared that he would no longer be able to properly care for his wife.
On 4 December 1992 Getz and Danes died of carbon monoxide poisoning the garage of their home in Litchfield, Connecticut. They were 75 and 81, respectively. As police said, Getz was apparently killed by her husband who committed suicide. Getz is survived by a daughter, Patricia Getz-Preziosi.
Art and career
In 1942 Getz created her first oil painting while visiting her sister in Mexico and by 1945 she had her first exhibition at the Norlyst Gallery in New York. As a result of solo shows in New York at the Bertha Schaefer Gallery (1957-1958), Stephen Radich Gallery (1960), and inclusion in numerous important group exhibitions, Getz enjoyed a secure reputation as painter, when, in 1959, she included the assemblage, or collage construction, to the scope of her work.
Her collages and constructions incorporated game boards, playing cards, birds, dolls and musical instruments. Some of her three-dimensional works were exhibited at the Museum of Fine Arts in Phoenix, Arizona, the Neuberger Museum in Purchase and the Alex Rosenberg Gallery in Manhattan. Retrospective exhibitions of Getz's work were also held at the Kunsthalle Nürnberg in 1978 and at the Goethe House, New York in 1980.
Recently her works were included in group exhibitions at Neuberger Museum of Art, Purchase College (2008-2009), Pavel Zoubok Art Gallery, New York (2014, 2016) and Invisible-Exports, East, New York (2016). Her works are in the collections of Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, Hood Museum of Art, Dartmouth College, Philadelphia Museum of Art, New-York Historical Society Museum & Library, Hopkings Center at Dartmouth College, the Kunsthalle, Nuremberg, and the Tel Aviv Museum in Israel among others.
Getz's work has been offered at auction multiple times, with the record price $134 USD for “Timeless Game”, sold at James Adams & Sons in 2007.

Hot Crossover 30 was a weekly record chart published by American magazine Billboard that ranked the 30 top-performing songs on "crossover" radio stations in the United States featuring a combination of Black, dance, and pop music. It was first published in the February 28, 1987, issue of Billboard. The chart was renamed Top 40/Dance on September 9, 1989, and last published on December 1, 1990. Unlike the guitar-oriented rock music heard on contemporary hit radio stations at the time, songs that appeared on the Hot Crossover 30 were often typified by their up-tempo nature, featured drum machines and electronic keyboards, and had varied dance, pop, and R&B influences. Club Nouveau's "Lean on Me" was the first of 65 different songs that topped the chart, and Mariah Carey's "Love Takes Time" was the last.
To formulate the chart, Billboard created a panel of crossover radio stations which reported their current playlists by rank every week. The magazine converted these ranks to points using a weighting system based on the station's Arbitron rating. The most-played song on a station received a base of 25 points while songs ranked below number 40 received 5 points. The points were multiplied 0.5 times if it was played by a station with a weekly cumulative audience of under 100,000 people, 1 time if the station had an audience between 100,000 and 249,999, 1.5 times if the station had an audience between 250,000 and 499,999, 2 times if the station had an audience between 500,000 to 999,999, and 2.5 times if the station had an audience over 1 million. Songs were eligible to chart regardless of a commercial release, as long as they received a combined 175 points from at least 10 stations.
Hot Crossover 30 allowed programmers at burgeoning crossover stations to observe the national popularity of songs on similar stations, some of which had been previously unrecognized because such stations did not contribute to any other Billboard chart. The Hot Crossover 30 panel of stations originally included those that reported exclusively to the chart and some that also reported to either the Hot 100 or Hot Black Singles charts. Effective September 9, 1989, stations formerly exclusive to the Hot Crossover 30 panel also contributed to the Hot 100. By the chart's last issue on December 1, 1990, Billboard considered its composition of songs too similar to the Hot 100's and announced its discontinuation. The Black/dance/pop crossover genre became known as rhythmic contemporary, and Billboard launched the Top 40/Rhythm-Crossover chart on October 3, 1992.

The Athens Suburban Railway, also known as Proastiakos Athens (), is a commuter rail service that connects the city of Athens with its metropolitan area and other regions beyond Attica, including Corinthia, Boeotia, Euboea and Achaea.
The first Proastiakos line, linking central Athens with Athens International Airport, was inaugurated two weeks before the 2004 Olympic Games. Over the years, the network has been successively expanded to Corinth (2005), Piraeus (2007), Kiato (2007), Chalcis (2009) and Aigio (2020).
History
"Proastiakos SA" was founded in 2003 as a subsidiary of OSE to serve the operation of the suburban network in the urban complex of Athens during the 2004 Olympic Games. The first line, linking central Athens with Athens International Airport, was inaugurated on 30 July 2004, two weeks before the 2004 Olympic Games. This first section was not electrified and operated DMU'S every half hour. In January 2005 the test routes to Corinth started and the line was delivered to the public on 27 September that same year. Also in 2005 Proastiakos was absorbed by the company TRAINOSE SA., which was now responsible for providing all rail passenger and commercial transport. In 2007, with the completion of the works of the Airport-Patras line to Kiato, Proastiakos expanded services on what is now Line 5 while in 2009 services where expanded to Chalkida forming Line 3. TrainOSE has been operating since 2008 as a company independent of OSE, still using the Proastiakos emblem. In 2009, with the Greek debt crisis unfolding OSE's Management was forced to reduce services across the network. Timetables were cutback, and routes closed as the government-run entity attempted to reduce overheads. Services from Athens Airport & Athens were cut back, with some ticket offices closing, reducing the reliability of services, and passenger numbers.
However, from 2010, the electrification works of the lines with 25 kV AC, 50 Hz began to be completed, allowing the use of the Siemens Desiro 460 trains. The electrification projects were completed in the SKA department. - Kiato in 2010, on the Oinoi–Chalcis line in 2013, in the sections SKA-Oinoi and Treis Gefyres – SKA in 2015, and finally in the section Three Bridges – Piraeus in 2018. In fact, the advent of electrification in SS. Athenson July 30, 2017 led to the modification of the lines of the Suburban Railway to have as a starting point the central station of the capital. In 2017 OSE's passenger transport sector was privatised as TrainOSE, currently, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane infrastructure, including stations, remained under the control of OSE. On 1 February 2018, the electrification of the Piraeus-Athens Central station section of the network was completed. Proastiakos was extended to Aigio in 2020.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, TrainOSE provide free antiseptic gel to the passenger public in order to disinfect those who use the commuter train.
Lines and services
The Proastiakos network of Athens consists of five routes: Piraeus–Airport via Athens, Piraeus–Kiato via Athens, Athens–Chalcis via Oinoi, Ano Liosia–Airport via Koropi, and Aigio–Athens/Airport via Kiato. Trains run from 4:30 am to midnight daily, and there are 53 stations in total.
On 18 January 2012 services were "temporary" suspended on routes from Piraeus - Ano Liossia. According to a TrainOSE spokesperson, the interruption is due to technical problems, however no information on the progress of any work was given, services were rerouted via SKA.
Main services
The following table lists the routes and the stations for the Proastiakos network of Athens since 15 May 2022:
List of Stations
The suburban railway connects with other rail services at the following stations:
Network map
Tickets and Scheduling
The suburban train, in the sections Magoula-Koropi and Piraeus-Dhekelia are part of the urban zone of OASA, therefore the single ticket that is used and combined with all means of transport in Athens is valid. Outside the urban area, a different ticket is valid, which is priced in stages and issued by Hellenic Train.
Photography on the network
The photography in the publicly accessible areas of both OSE and Proastiakos (defined as passenger space on trains and at stations) is permitted, as the right of photographers to photograph within the Suburban Railway is covered by the Constitution. The issue was mediated by the Ombudsman between 2004 and 2008 on the occasion of the attempt to temporarily ban photography during the Olympic Games. The court ruled that "the requirement of a 'photography permit' is tantamount to a ban" and that "there is no legal authority to impose restrictions on the right to photograph spaces and slides by definition accessible to the public".
Future expansion
New stations
Additional station in Kryoneri by 2021.
Additional station in Gerakas.
New services
Larissa Station-Agios Dionysios via Piraeus connection with Cretan ships, (with the final destination being Thessaloniki)
Reopening the suburban double line from SKA to Ano Liosia, MAK, Neoktista, Aspropyrgos Refineries, Old Aspropyrgos Station, and Elefsina, with the service of Hellenic Petroleum. The Elefsina line is planned to continue to Loutropyrgos and the old Megaron railway with a single regular line.
Reopening from Agios Apostolos to Isthmus.
Lavrio branch line
A nine-station, 32 km extension of the Proastiakos network from Koropi to Lavrio was announced in 2016, potentially connecting 300,000 more people to the rail network at a cost of €160 million. The project involves the construction of two new stations at Markopoulo and Lavrio Port, and five intermediate stops at Kalyvia, Keratea, Daskaleio, Thorikos and Kyprianos. The Athens-Lavrio distance will be 55 minutes and Koropi-Lavrio 28 minutes with the completion of the extension.
Loutraki line reopening
In February 2019, OSE accepted a bid for the €12 million project to convert the former metre-gauge line between Isthmos and Loutraki to standard gauge, connect it to the Athens Airport–Patras railway and reopen it to passenger traffic by November 2021. Mytilineos–Xanthakis was selected as the contractor of the project. Due to an appeal by a rival bidder, the signing of the contract was delayed until 12 June 2019. The project consists of the electrification of the Isthmos–Loutraki line and building two new stops, one at Casino and the other in Loutraki.
Rafina branch
A €40 million branch line from Doukissis Plakentias station to the town of Rafina has also been proposed. with an extension to the Airport via Artemida and Rafina.

The Bonaparte Historic Riverfront District is a nationally recognized historic district located in Bonaparte, Iowa, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. At the time of its nomination it contained 38 resources, which included 24 contributing buildings, one contributing structure, 11 non-contributing buildings, and two non-contributing structures. Three mill-related buildings near the Des Moines River are associated with the Meek's family who had a central role in the town's development from its founding through the turn of the 20th-century. They include the woolen mill (1863), the flour mill (1878), which is individually listed on the National Register, and the pants factory (1892). Eighteen commercial buildings are of brick construction. Of those, eight are two-story structures, and ten are single-story structures. The remaining three buildings are wood frame commercial buildings. The single historic structure is the stone lock in the city park, which is also individually listed on the National Register.
In addition to the industrial buildings, the commercial buildings historically housed stores, a bank, an opera house, and a fraternal society. Bonaparte's commercial area was built on the riverfront to take advantage of the riverboats that were important for commerce when the town was founded in the 1830s. As the railroad came through the focus of river town commerce moved away from the river and focused on the rail station. Because of the Meek's facilities, Bonaparte continued to focus on the river until the mills closed in 1909. The period of significance is 1852 to 1909, and most of the non-contributing buildings and the structures were built after 1909. A couple of buildings have been altered to the point that they have lost their historic significance.

Howard Schenken (September 28, 1903 – February 20, 1979) was an American bridge player, writer, and long-time syndicated bridge columnist. He was from New York City. He won three Bermuda Bowl titles, and set several North American records. Most remarkably he won the Life Master Pairs five times, the Spingold twelve, and the Vanderbilt Trophy ten times; the LM Pairs and Vanderbilt records that still stand today.
Schenken is ACBL Life Master number 3, dating from 1936. He was named to the bridge hall of fame by The Bridge World in 1966, which brought the number of members to nine, all made founding members of the ACBL Hall of Fame in 1995.
Career
Schenken was playing with the Raymond Club team in the late 1920s when he was spotted by the "Father" of the game Ely Culbertson, who invited him to play as a substitute during the much publicized "Bridge Battle of the Century" against Sidney Lenz, which was won by Culbertson's team. In 1932, Schenken formed a partnership with David Burnstine who had left the "Four Horsemen", the most successful team in tournament play at the time. Burnstine created the "Bid-rite Team" consisting initially of himself, Schenken, Richard L. Frey and Charles Lochridge. By 1935, roster changes saw the team comprise Burnstine, Schenken, Oswald Jacoby (from the Four Horsemen) and Michael T. Gottlieb. They became known now as the "Four Aces" and rose to be the most successful team yet seen at contract bridge. They published a book of their methods in 1935, The Four Aces System of Contract Bridge, and tried to challenge Culbertson into another of his much publicized matches, but he declined. Schenken is recognized by the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) as Life Master #3, one of ten named in 1936 – behind Burnstine and Jacoby.
Beside his brilliant play, Schenken was renowned for his unbreakable calm at the table. As declarer, it was impossible to tell whether he was in a comfortable contract or an impossible one (and his commanding dummy play often made an impossible one). He was a formidably difficult opponent but a remarkably easy partner. On the Four Aces, for example, he was the only one who played with every other member of the team.
The Bermuda Bowl was first held in 1950 and Schenken was on the winning USA team. He also took part in the successful defenses of the trophy in 1951 and 1953, but subsequently played on the US or North America team only on four occasions during the early 1960s. That was during the reign of the Italian Blue Team, which proved unbeatable from 1956 to 1972. Yet one great compliment came from members of the Blue Team who said, "If your team had had another Schenken, we never could have won."
Schenken was an ACBL board member for many years. In 1943 he took over the Four Aces syndicated bridge column and in 1957 merged it with the column by Frey. They wrote it jointly until 1970 when Schenken became the sole author once more; meanwhile it became the longest continuously published national bridge column.
Schenken wrote only three books but they presented some important ideas. (Two focus on ; one is a memoir.) He is credited with the discovery and introduction to the tournament world of several play techniques and examples of deceptive play which are now considered standard.
In the field of bidding theory, Schenken is credited with the idea of the forcing two-over-one response, the prepared opening bid, and the weak two bids. (The "weak two" was part of Harold Vanderbilt's Vanderbilt Club system, however.) Schenken also developed his own strong club system, the Schenken Club, played with Peter Leventritt.
Schenken died in Palm Springs, California, at age 75 in 1979.

The Cup of Fury is a 1920 American silent drama film directed by T. Hayes Hunter and starring Helene Chadwick, Rockliffe Fellowes, and Frank Leigh.
Plot
As described in a film magazine, Davidge (Fellowes), while on business in London for the United States government, attends a dinner given by wealthy Germans, Sir Joseph Webling (Standing) and his wife Lady Webling (Lester). He meets their adopted daughter Marie (Chadwick) and recalls having seen her before in America, where she was billed as "Mamsie" in a vaudeville act. That evening Scotland Yard's secret service men raid the Weblings and their daughter, whereupon she confesses that she is an American and is allowed to return to the United States. The Weblings take poison and die before the detectives can prevent it. Mamsie obtains employment in a ship builder's office under Davidge. The secret launching of a ship is innocently disclosed by Mamsie to her brother-in-law, a confessed member of the Industrial Workers of the World, who in turn advises a German spy. The ship is destroyed off Cape Charles by a German U-boat. Mamsie then proposes to run down the criminals and, while employed as a "passer boy," unearths a scheme to blow up the dockyards. She notifies Davidge and he comes to her assistance, throws the criminals into the ocean, and saves the dockyards.

James Hegney (27 September 1891 – 5 May 1970) was an Australian politician who was a Labor Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia from 1930 to 1947 and again from 1950 to 1968. He served as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly from 1956 to 1959.
Early life
Hegney was born in Melbourne, as was his younger brother Bill Hegney (also a future MP). The brothers came to Western Australia as children, where their father worked for Western Australian Government Railways. After leaving school, Hegney worked as a boilermaker at the Midland Railway Workshops, and was a member of the Boilermakers' Union. He also played high-level Australian rules football, appearing in 23 games for the Midland Junction Football Club (a West Australian Football League club) between 1909 and 1910.
Politics
Hegney stood for parliament at the 1930 state election, and was elected to the new seat of Middle Swan. After the 1933 election, Hegney was appointed deputy chairman of committees in the Labor government. He remained in the role until the 1947 election, when he was narrowly defeated in his seat by Bill Grayden, the Liberal candidate. Hegney regained Middle Swan at the 1950 election, and after Labor's victory at the 1953 election was made chairman of committees in the Hawke government. He was elevated to the speakership after the 1956 election, replacing Aloysius Rodoreda, and remained speaker until the Labor government's defeat at the 1959 election. Hegney switched to the seat of Belmont at the 1962 election, and remained in parliament until retiring at the 1968 election.

Senchán Torpéist (c. 560–649 AD) was a Gaelic-Irish poet.
Background
Seanchan Torpest was the Chief Poet of Connacht c.640 AD when he succeeded Dallán Forgaill as Chief Ollam of Ireland. He died in c.649 AD.
His father was Cuairfheartaigh from the Araidh sept on the northern Tipperary-Limerick border. According to suggestion of James Carney, Senchán recorded his own pedigree in a genealogical work on the Concangab Már which he composed about 630. It states: Senchán, son of Úarchride, son of Adóer, of the Araid.
Senchan's mother's name was Dediva (also called Editua or Dedi or Deidi or Deighe or Deidiu or Deaga or Mediva), daughter of Tren, son of Dubhthach moccu Lughair, who was also a previous Chief Ollam of Ireland and royal poet of King Lóegaire mac Néill. Dediva's other children were Saint Senan of Laraghabrine, son of Fintan, Saint Diarmaid the Just, son of Lugna, Saint Felim of Kilmore son of Carill, Saint Daigh of Inniskeen son of Carill, Saint Femia, daughter of Carill, St.Mainchín of Corann, son of Collan of Corann and Saint Caillin, son of Niata, who in the Book of Fenagh, page 215 states:
"My blessing on thy men of song
Who from mild Senchan may descend.”
Seanchan must have been born about 560 AD to have allowed him time to complete the long course of study to be named Chief Ollam of Ireland. Furthermore, in Tromdámh Guaire he is referred to as "the aged Senchan" in c.640 and Geoffrey Keating's History of Ireland states that at the Synod or Convention of Drumceat in c.593 AD, "Seanchán mac Cuairfheartaigh" was made chief ollam over the province of Connacht. An explanation for his nickname is given in the Cóir Anmann (The Fitness of Names)-
"Entry 272: Senchán Toirpéist .i. Senchán [dororba péist] día rothogaibh spirat na h-écsi cenn do fo sceib (leg. scéim, dat. of scíam) dodheilbh, intan luidh Senchán for cuáirt a n-Albain dochoíd spirat na h-écsi a richt pesti gráinchi fora chiund forsan sligi a m-bói, gurus aigill tré fordhorcha filidhechta é. Conid [d]e rohainmniged e.(Senchán Torpest, i.e. Senchán whom a péistor monster profited when the spirit of wisdom appeared under a hideous form. At the time that Senchán went on a circuit into Scotland the spirit of poetry came in the shape of a loathly monster to meet him on his road, and conversed with him in the obscurity of poetry. Hence he was so named.)"
Senchan's wife was Brigit, his son was called Muircc or Murgen and his daughter was Maeve Neidigh.
Some of Senchan's work is preserved in the Book of Lecan, folio 17, col. 2, a poem on the battles of Fergus, son of Rossa. He wrote a poem beginning "Abbair fri sil nEogain moir", in Laud 610, fol 73 b 2 (ZCP 12, 1918, p. 378 Kuno Meyer); another called Trí meic Ruaid; another beginning Find Taulcha tuath cuire Cailte and a poem beginning "Co slonnad Conmaic fri Connad" (ZCP 14 1923 p. 48 Margaret Dobbs). Cath Maighe Léna contains a poem by Senchán commencing 'Adhaigh Luain rucadh an rí'.
In a list of ancient Irish authors contained in the Book of Ballymote, p. 308, it states "Sencan Toirpeist in Rigfili".
King Guaire of Connacht
According to the old tale called Tromdámh Guaire (The Heavy Company of Guaire) or Imtheacht na Tromdhaimhe (The Proceedings of the Great Bardic Institution) he visited the residence of the King of Connacht, Guaire Aidne mac Colmáin accompanied by one hundred and fifty other poets, one hundred and fifty pupils "with a corresponding number of women-servants, dogs, etc". The accommodating powers of Guaire's establishment were strained during their stay of "a year, a quarter, and a month."
To shame Seanchan into leaving, Guaire asked him to recite the long-forgotten epic the Táin Bó Cúailnge, with the words:
Bear the cup to Seanchan Torpest
Yield the bard his poet's mead
What we've heard was but a fore-taste
Lays more lofty now succeed.
Though my stores be emptied well-nigh
Twin bright cups there yet remain
Win them with the raid of Cualigne
Chant us, bard, the famous Tain.
Seanchan was deeply offended;
Thus in hall of Gort spoke Guaire
for the king, let truth be told
bounteous though he was, was weary
of giving goblets, giving gold
giving aught the Bard demanded
but when for the Tain he called
Seanchan from his seat descended
shame and anger fired the skald.
Seanchan departed, with the following farewall:
We depart from thee, O stainless Guaire
A year, a quarter, and a month
Have we sojourned with thee, high King
Three times fifty poets, good and smooth
Three times fifty students in the poetic art
Each with a servant and a dog
They were all fed in the one great house.
Each man had his separate meal
Each man had his separate bed
We never arose at early morning
Without contentions, without calming.
I declare to Thee, God
Who canst the promise verify
That, should we return to our own lands
We shall visit thee again, O Guaire, tho' now we depart.
Táin Bó Cúailnge
The result of this incident was the gathering of all the poets of Ireland by Seanchan, to determine which one of them knew the entire of the Táin. While some knew different parts, none knew the whole epic, it has been written in a book long since taken abroad.
To rectify this, Seanchan, accompanied by his son Murgen and his second cousin Eimena, undertook to travel in search of the book and return the Táin to Ireland.
This resulted in Murgen being lost in a magical mist, when he encountered the ghost of Fergus mac Róich at his grave. Fergus related the whole of the Tain to Murgen, who returned and related the story to his brother and father, thus preserving the tale for future generations.
Senchan and his wife also appear in the old tale Scéla Cano meic Gartnáin and in Cormac's Glossary where he visits the Isle of Man. The Middle-Irish poem c. 1100 'Aimirgein Glúngel tuir tend', attributed to Gilla in Choimded Úa Cormaic of Tulach Léis, refers to Senchan- Stanza 57. "Senchán Toirpéist ba rind ráid." ('Senchán Torpéist he was the apex of speech'). He also appears in the tale "Mac telene do feraib Muman".
Senchan's wandering band of poets occur in traditional tales as far apart as Scotland and Nova Scotia, where they are referred to as "Cliar Sheanachain" (Senchan's lot) or "Cleith Sheanchair". A popular Highland tale featuring Senchan is "Great Bríd of the Horses" which is based on 'Tromdámh Guaire'.
References by Shakespeare
William Shakespeare mentions the power of Irish poets "rhyming rats to death", a remark apparently based on an incident when Seanchan, finding that rats had eaten his dinner, uttered the vindictive aer: "Rats have sharp snouts/Yet are poor fighters..." which killed ten of them on the spot.

Rapsoul is a German hip-hop group.
History
Färger and Neumann first worked together producing remixes for the Frankfurt-based record label 3p (Pelham Power Productions), working with the German pop/soul band Glashaus and rapper Sabrina Setlur. The two first appeared together as a rap duo as Dreckskind & Pechvogel (lit. "Child of Squalor and Unlucky Devil"), releasing an EP named LebensArt von Dreckskind & Pechvogel ("The LifeStyle of Child of Squalor and Unlucky Devil").
The duo's talent was spotted by a radio station based in Hesse, Germany, and one of their songs became a regular part of the radio station's 2004 summer tour of public swimming baths in Hessen. During this time, German commercial television station RTL's attention was drawn to the pair.
It was at this time that Jan and Steve, together with soul singer C.J. Taylor, decided to rename the band Rapsoul; a name which described the band's musical style. Following several successful live gigs, the band was invited to perform as the supporting act for the Backstreet Boys' October 2005 tour of Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
At the end of 2005, the band recorded their debut album, Unbeschrieblich ("Indescribable"), which was released in Germany on 31 March 2006. Their debut single, Verzweifelt ("Desperate"), released on 25 November 2005, peaked at number 21 in the German singles chart. Following the success of their debut single, the band released their second single, Gott schenk ihr Flügel ("God Give Her Wings"), on 17 March 2006. Their third single, Du und ich ("You and Me"), was released on 23 June 2006. All three of these singles made it into the German singles charts. 2006 also saw the band headline a tour for the first time.
The band recorded their fourth single, Sonnenschein ("Sunshine") with Vanessa Jean Dedmon, a semi-finalist from the third series of Deutschland sucht den Superstar (the German version of Pop Idol). The song reached number 17 in the German charts.
Rapsoul's second album Achterbahn ("Rollercoaster") was released in 2007, from which the singles Erste Liebe ("First Love"), Laura, König der Welt ("King of the World") and Sterben für dich ("Die for You") were taken.

Convoy was a rock band based out of San Diego, CA, releasing a total of three albums from 1997–2003.
History
The band's founding members Jason Hill, Brian Karscig, Robbie Dodds, and Mark Maigaard were childhood friends, growing up in Poway, CA. They initially started a band called Dishwater.
Convoy's first song, “Weekends”, was written on a beach in Hawaii by Dodds and Hill, while touring with Dishwater. The song became a catalyst for Convoy, as they eventually dissolved Dishwater, and formed Convoy with Dishwater bass player Jeff Winfrey.
Their first recording was “Red Tape”, a 5 song self-released cassette that was recorded at Golden Track Studios in San Diego. It was recorded along with the one track, “Ladyfinger”, recorded live from the band's very first appearance, opening up for music legend, Leon Russell. The songs on the red tape are described as having a carefree honkey tonk vibe laden with rock guitars. Only one thousand copies of “Red Tape” were released.
Their next self-release, “Pineapple Recording Sessions”, was their first full length album. The band recorded in Jamul, CA, a small rural town outside the city of San Diego. Spending much of their early years in Pacific Beach,CA, the band rented a house far from populated neighborhoods in order to write, rehearse, and record at all hours. In this secluded, small and dilapidated rental house in Jamul, the water would intermittently stop working due to the property's poor producing well, leaving the band members without running water for days. The band self-recorded at this house on an outdated analog 8-track recording machine. Limited equipment and knowledge of the recording process produced raw and authentic results. The albums sound has been compared to the Beach Boys, The Byrds, The Rolling Stones, and The Beatles. The creative environment in Jamul encouraged song writing and endless rehearsing which would then lead to tracking their songs to tape. This living while creating arrangement was modeled after The Band's recording of their “Music From Big Pink” album. The vintage and crude equipment and recording process enhanced the performance and sound.
Convoy was evicted from their Jamul home and recording studio due to complaints by neighbors for making “too much noise and ruckus.” They rented another house in Jamul, only accessible by dirt roads. They were eventually evicted based on similar disturbance issues.
“Pineapple Recording Sessions” won multiple San Diego Music Awards and secured the band a record deal with Hybrid Recordings, a New York based label with ties to Atlantic Records.
Their final album, “Black Licorice”, was recorded in Burbank, CA at Mad Dog Studios and released by Hybrid Recordings. A different process for the band, they were required to enlist the help of an outside producer. Co-produced by David Bianco and Jason Hill, Black Licorice was their most commercially successful release. Some of the songs from “Pineapple Recording Sessions” were re-recorded for “Black Licorice” in an effort to land a radio hit. The rawness and blissful lo-fi of the previously self-recorded works was traded for a more glossy and polished sound. Highlights of the album are songs, “Caught Up In You” and “Eleventeen.”
Convoy performed at legendary venues, Red Rocks Amphitheater and The Great American Music Hall. With a loyal West Coast following, Convoy toured relentlessly in California and had occasional national tours that included dates opening up for the White Stripes and Coldplay. They also performed multiple shows as an opening act for Tom Petty and Aerosmith. They performed on the CBS Late Show with Craig Kilborn.
After the release of “Black Licorice” Jeff Winfrey was replaced by Shaun Cornell to play bass. Shortly after Winfrey's departure, Convoy recorded and starred in a national TV commercial for Sheraton Hotels, featuring a remake of The Rolling Stones song, “Lets Spend the Night Together”
The band disassembled in 2003 and members, Jason Hill, Brian Karscig, and Mark Maigaard formed the band Louis XIV.

Arthur Cornwallis Madan (1846–1917) was a British linguist and Anglican missionary who became famous for his research on African languages and his Swahili dictionaries.
Family background and education
Madan was born on 8 March 1846 in the parish of Cam, Gloucestershire, England, as the third child of the Anglican pastor George Madan. He was educated at Marlborough College and studied at Christ Church, Oxford from 1865 to 1869.
After obtaining his bachelor's degree, he taught at Christ Church as a tutor from 1870 to 1880; during this period he also got a master's degree. He joined the Universities' Mission to Central Africa.
Work in Africa
In 1880 he was sent to Zanzibar, where he learned Swahili and assisted bishop Edward Steere in his language research and translation work. When Steere died in August 1882, Madan finished Steere's manuscript of a Swahili grammar until the end of the year. ("A handbook of the Swahili language as spoken at Zanzibar, edited for the Universities' Mission to Central Africa").
Madan was considered the mission's chief linguist in East Africa. He continued to work on Swahili dictionaries. Initially this was a pioneer's work, as Ludwig Krapf's dictionary of Swahili, the first for this language, had not yet been published. In 1894 Madan's English-Swahili dictionary was published, followed by a Swahili-English dictionary in 1903.
1906 Madan moved to Northern Rhodesia (today: Zambia), where he continued researching a number of African languages like Lenje and Wisa. In 1911 he returned to Oxford, where he taught until his death in 1917.
Legacy
He is remembered mostly for his dictionaries and other writings about the Swahili language. His dictionaries became the base for the Standard English-Swahili Dictionary and Standard Swahili-English Dictionary, which are known under the name of "Madan-Johnson".

The Contax I, or Original Contax, is a 35 mm rangefinder camera made between 1932 and 1936 by Zeiss Ikon. The Contax I had six identifiable variants, but fundamentally identical; every aspect was designed to outperform the Leica. For instance, the removable back was for faster loading and reloading, the bayonet lens mount was designed for rapid lens interchangeability, the long-base rangefinder allowed more accurate focusing, and the vertical metal shutter not only gave a faster maximum speed but also banished the problem of shutter blinds burning.
History
In 1932, Zeiss Ikon of Dresden decided to produce a competitor to the Leica II, designed to be superior in every way. The name Contax was chosen after a poll among its employees. Dr. Ing. Heinz Kuppenbender was listed On patents as the inventor of this camera. But, in fact, Dr. Emanuel Goldberg was the designer of the Contax. Goldberg continued to work on this camera design until he was forced to leave Dresden in 1933 for France.
Made between 1932 and 1936, the original Contax (later known as Contax I after later models were introduced) was markedly different from the corresponding Leica II. Using a die-cast alloy body, it housed a vertically travelling metal focal-plane shutter. The shutter was reminiscent of the one used in Contessa-Nettel cameras, made out of interlocking black-finished brass slats. somewhat like a roll-up garage door
The interlocking slats were aligned by specially made silk ribbons, which were very strong but subject to wear. The coupled rangefinder had a very long baseline, with its own eyepiece next to that of the viewfinder.
Other main differences included focusing drive built into the camera body for use with standard lens, removable back, shutter speed knob integral with film wind knob placed at the front of the camera body, and finished in black.
The young lens designer Ludwig Bertele, formerly of Ernemann, was charged with the responsibility of designing the lenses.

The 2009–10 season was Bolton Wanderers 11th season in the Premier League, and their ninth consecutive season in the top division of English football and covers the period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010. Bolton Wanderers failed to win the 2009–10 Premier League title, making it the 71st time that they have competed at the top level without winning the title, the most of any club.
The team kit for the 2009–10 season was produced by Reebok who were replaced as shirt sponsor by 188BET after nineteen years. Reebok still held naming rights to the stadium. To reflect the change in sponsor the home kit was changed to an all-white body with black vertical lines nearer the bottom. The away kit was the same as the home but blue, whilst the 188bet logo was white.
Pre-season
Bolton confirmed that they would not be taking up the option of signing Euzebiusz Smolarek, Sébastien Puygrenier or Ariza Makukula after the end of the previous season, and all returned to their parent clubs.
Bolton announced on 6 May 2009 that long serving goalkeeper Jussi Jääskeläinen had been granted a testimonial against Hibernian at the Reebok Stadium on 8 August. This was later followed by an announcement that the club would play Hibs' neighbours Hearts at Tynecastle four days earlier. On 12 June, the club published its full set of pre-season fixtures which included a three-game tour of Germany and the Netherlands, where the team met Borussia Mönchengladbach, Den Bosch and FC Eindhoven. Local fixtures were organised against Leigh Genesis, Altrincham, Fleetwood Town and Chorley.
The first team finished its pre-season unbeaten, drawing all their games with the exception of Den Bosch, which they won 2–1, with Sam Ricketts and Kevin Davies scoring. The younger players did not do as well, the game against Leigh Genesis, where the new away kit was revealed, being their only victory.
Full season
Bolton's Premier League season did not get off to the best of starts, a 0–1 home defeat to Sunderland. This was followed by a similar reverse away to Hull City. This immediately put pressure on manager Gary Megson, with some fans chanting for his resignation during Bolton's 1–0 League Cup victory at Tranmere Rovers three days later. Bolton went into the international break on the back of a 2–3 defeat to Liverpool, Sean Davis being sent off with Bolton leading 2–1. This would prove to be Davis' last game of the season after an operation on his articular cartilage.
The international break appeared to do the team some good as they went on a five-game unbeaten run, lasting until the next international break. A last-minute Gary Cahill goal saw Portsmouth fall in a 3–2 victory at Fratton Park, and a week later another last-minute goal, this time a penalty converted by Matt Taylor, salvaged a point at home to Stoke City. Another late goal, this time from captain Kevin Davies, took Bolton's third round League Cup tie against West Ham United into extra time, from which Bolton prevailed 3–1, and yet another late goal, time from Lee Chung-yong, gave Bolton a 2–1 victory at Birmingham City, pushing Bolton up to 13th place. The team returned from the fortnight's break to suffer a narrow defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford, Matt Taylor scoring in a 2–1 defeat which saw Zat Knight score an own goal. The club, however, bounced back a week later to defeat Everton 3–2 at Reebok Stadium, with Ivan Klasnić scoring the winner, his first goal for the club, after having been knocked unconscious minutes earlier. This, however, was Bolton's last win for seven games as they went on a run that included two successive 4–0 defeats to Chelsea, the first away in the League Cup, the second at home three days later with Zat Knight scoring another own goal. A 5–1 defeat at Aston Villa followed before a 0–2 home defeat to local rivals Blackburn Rovers, who had not managed to collect an away point all season before the game and whose manager, the former Bolton manager Sam Allardyce, was incapacitated due to an impending heart operation. This run off defeats was halted after a 1–1 draw at Fulham but a 2–1 loss to fellow strugglers Wolverhampton Wanderers led to renewed pressure on the manager and calls for him to be replaced.
This, however, was the team's last defeat of the calendar year, a 3–3 draw at home against big spending Manchester City being followed with a 3–1 home victory against West Ham, which again lifted Bolton out of the relegation places. A chance to move further away from the bottom three was curtailed by the postponement of the last game before Christmas at Wigan Athletic. The Christmas programme started with a 1–1 draw at Lancashire rivals Burnley, managed by Bolton's former striker Owen Coyle, before former Bolton player and assistant manager Phil Brown brought his Hull side to the Reebok. The game ended in a 2–2 draw after Bolton had led 2–0, the home fans loudly booing the decision to replace goalscorer Ivan Klasnić with Gavin McCann while leading 2–1. The following morning, it was announced that manager Gary Megson had been relieved of his duties, with assistant manager Chris Evans and head coach Steve Wigley put in temporary charge.
Various names were mentioned when it came to replacing Megson, who called his dismissal "galling",
with ex-Bolton players Peter Reid and Gary Speed mentioned as manager and assistant to Alan Shearer respectively, as well as Darren Ferguson and Alan Curbishley. Two people who ruled themselves out of the running were Mark Hughes and Owen Coyle. In the meantime, the club safely came through its FA Cup third round tie at home to Lincoln City, winning 4–0. Despite earlier seeming to rule himself out of the job, however, Coyle quickly became the favourite to take the job and within three days of the FA Cup game, Burnley confirmed that their manager wanted to leave and join his former club. On 8 January 2010, it was announced that, after the clubs had agreed compensation, Coyle had been appointed manager of Bolton on a two-and-a-half-year deal. With Bolton's weekend game at Sunderland being postponed due to the weather, this meant that Coyle's first two games were due to be against Arsenal, home and away, losing the first 2–0 and the return 4–2. On Coyle's appointment, both Wigley and reserve team coach Alan Cork left the club on 10 January, with Evans following them out of the club two days later.
Coyle's first win in charge came in the FA Cup Fourth Round with a 2–0 defeat of Sheffield United and his first win in the Premier League was a 1–0 defeat of his former club Burnley, during which he was subjected to abuse from the away fans. January finished with a 2–0 away defeat at Liverpool. The January transfer window saw Bolton loan Vladimír Weiss from Manchester City and Jack Wilshere from Arsenal, as well as bringing in American international Stuart Holden on a free transfer, all until the end of the season, while the club loaned out Nicky Hunt to Derby County, Tope Obadeyi to Rochdale and Mark Connolly to St Johnstone, all again until the end of the season. Meanwhile, Ricardo Vaz Tê refused a loan deal to Hamilton Academical.
February started with a 0–0 draw at home to Fulham after which it was confirmed that Gary Cahill had suffered a blood clot in his arm and could be out for the rest of the season. Cahill, however, returned to the side in mid-March. In Cahill's abscene, the team did not win a game until the end of February, going down 2–0 at Manchester City and 3–0 at Blackburn while drawing 0–0 at Wigan Athletic. They were also knocked out of the FA Cup by Tottenham Hotspur when, after a 1–1 draw at the Reebok, Spurs won the replay 4–0. Bolton recorded their first win in a month on 27 February with a 1–0 win over Wolves, during which Zat Knight scored his first goal for the club. March began with Bolton securing a second successive win for the first and only time in the season, winning at West Ham 2–1, before the run immediately came to an end with a 4–0 reversal at Sunderland. Bolton then beat Wigan by the same score with Fabrice Muamba scoring his first goal for the club.
Bolton then went on another poor run with four successive defeats to Everton, Manchester United, Aston Villa and Chelsea, failing to score in the process. This lasted until the 85th minute of the following game at Stoke before Matt Taylor scored two quick goals in a 2–1 win. A point from the next game against already relegated Portsmouth all but ensured Bolton's participation in the following season's top flight and although they lost to Spurs the following week, results in other games made sure. Bolton finished the season with a 2–1 home win against Birmingham.
After the final game of the season, it was announced that Lee Chung-yong has been awarded the club's Player of the Year as well as the Players' Player of the Year and Newcomer of the Year. The following day, when the club released the names of those that would be leaving the club, the two highest profile names were Ricardo Vaz Tê, who had been at the club since 2003, and Zoltán Harsányi, who had been there for three years.

The Tren de la Costa (Train of the coast) is a planned railway in the Valencian Community in Spain.
History
The cities of Valencia and Alicante are currently linked by rail via an inland route. The "Tren de la Costa" is the name given to the planned project to extend the Cercanías Valencia C-1 line, which currently terminates at Gandía, to Dénia and eventually Alicante, along the corridor of the AP-7 motorway. The line from Gandía to Denia closed in 1974, however the town is connected to Alicante by Line 9 of the Alicante Tram system.
Planning
A study was produced in 2016 in regard to planning and construction of the line, outlining upgraded stations on the C-1 line at Tavernes de la Valldigna, Xeraco and Gandia, and new stations at Oliva, Dénia and Benidorm before reaching Alicante.
The construction is to be split into four phases. The first consists of installing a third rail to the existing line from Valencia to Gandia to allow operation, and new track from Gandia to Oliva. The second is a new standard-gauge line from Oliva to Dénia; the third from Alicante to Benidorm and the fourth from Benidorm to Dénia. The total cost for all four phases was estimated at €957 million in 2017.

USS Runner (SS/AGSS-476), a Tench-class submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the runner, an amberfish inhabiting subtropical waters.
Construction and commissioning
Runner′ s keel was laid down on 10 July 1944 by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 17 October 1944, sponsored by Mrs. R. H. Bass, the wife of the prospective commanding officer, and commissioned on 6 February 1945.
Service history
World War II
After shakedown and preliminary training off the United States East Coast, Runner departed New London, Connecticut, on 5 April 1945, conducted intensive training at Key West, Florida, and Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, and arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 21 May 1945. Her first war patrol of World War II was off the east coast of Honshū, Japan, where her primary mission was to scout for the presence of defensive minefields guarding the Japanese Home Islands. On 10 July 1945, while on patrol in the Sea of Japan, she intercepted two worthwhile Japanese targets, a tanker and a minesweeper. The tanker and her two escorts escaped the spread of torpedoes Runner fired at them, but three of Runners torpedoes splintered the minesweeper W-27. Before departing station, Runner took aboard 16 downed aviators from the submarines and for transfer to Guam, where Runner concluded her patrol with her arrival on 24 July 1945.
Runner′s second war patrol began a week prior to the Japanese capitulation on 15 August 1945, and by the time she arrived on station off the east coast of Honshū, peace had come. Runner, with ten other U.S. Navy submarines, entered Tokyo Bay on 31 August 1945 and represented the U.S. Navy submarine service at the formal surrender ceremonies on 2 September 1945.
Post-World War II
Runner and the other submarines in Tokyo Bay departed Japan on 3 September 1945, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 12 September. She continued east until reaching New London on 6 October 1945 . A few weeks later, in company with other vessels of Submarine Squadron 6, Runner proceeded south, arriving for duty at Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, on 14 February 1946. For the next three years, she was based at the Panama Canal Zone and participated in annual fleet exercises in the Caribbean Sea.
In June 1949, Runner was reassigned to Norfolk, Virginia, her base for the next seven years. In the autumn of 1957, she participated in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) exercises in the North Atlantic Ocean, visiting ports in France and England. Home-ported in San Juan, Puerto Rico, from July 1958 to July 1959, she operated in the Caribbean Sea as a Regulus missile guidance submarine.
Returning to Norfolk in July 1959, Runner operated with the fleet along the U.S. East Coast for the next three years. She deployed to the Mediterranean Sea from January to early May 1962, operating with the United States and NATO units. She spent the remainder of 1962 on local antisubmarine warfare exercises and overhaul.
Throughout 1963 and 1964, Runner engaged in various antisubmarine warfare exercises in the western Atlantic. She spent the summer of 1964 in the Great Lakes, training United States Naval Reserve personnel. After operating with the fleet in the spring of 1965, she entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard at Portsmouth, Virginia, for overhaul. In 1966, her operations included services for antisubmarine warfare exercises, type training, and participation in Exercise Springboard in the early spring. Runner deployed to the Mediterranean Sea with the United States Sixth Fleet from 8 July to 28 October 1966. She spent most of 1967 on school services for future submariners.
Runner began 1968 by providing services for the Underwater Demolition Team school at Little Creek, Virginia, and antisubmarine warfare training off the U.S. East Coast. On 4 April 1968, she departed on her last Mediterranean Sea deployment. She returned to Norfolk on 31 July 1968 having visited ports in Spain and Portugal, and participating in the NATO exercise Dawn Patrol.
Decommissioning and disposal
On 25 January 1969, Runner was decommissioned at the Boston Naval Shipyard in Boston, Massachusetts, and towed to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station in Lake County, Illinois, where she was reclassified as an "auxiliary submarine," redesignated AGSS-476''', and served as a Naval Reserve Training vessel until stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 December 1971. She was sold for scrap on 19 June 1973.

Uncovering Our Earliest Ancestor: The Link is a one-hour television documentary made by Atlantic Productions for the BBC, first aired on 26 May 2009 on BBC One. It explores the story behind the discovery of an early primate fossil, Darwinius masillae, nicknamed Ida, in a shale quarry in Germany. The fossil is believed to be around 47 million years old, and is extraordinarily well-preserved. Originally unearthed in 1983, Ida lay in the hands of a private collector for 20 years before it was shown to a Norwegian paleontologist, Dr Jørn Hurum. Realising that Ida could turn out to be a significant missing link between modern primates, lemurs and lower mammals, he persuaded the Natural History Museum in Oslo to purchase the fossil and assembled an international team of experts to study it. Their findings were announced in a press conference and the online publication of a scientific paper on 19 May 2009.
The BBC programme was narrated by David Attenborough. An alternative edit of the programme entitled The Link debuted on the History Channel on 25 May 2009 in a two-hour slot.

Inna Ivanovna Lubimenko (Любименко Инна Ивановна), or Lioubimenko, (1(13) April 1878 – 15 January 1959) was a Russian and Soviet historian of the early modern period and a specialist in Anglo-Russian relations. She earned her doctorate in Paris and travelled regularly to London and Moscow in the course of her researches, publishing articles in English language and French journals. She was the only woman to address the International Congress of Historical Studies in London in 1913.
From 1916 she was based in Russia, working as a researcher, archivist, and lecturer at official academic institutions, particularly the Academy of Sciences whose history she researched and helped to write. She was evacuated from Leningrad during the Second World War with her institute and received the medals for the "defence of Leningrad" and for "Valiant Labour in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945." After her retirement she wrote essays on the history of Saint Petersburg where she died in 1959.
Early life and education
Inna Lubimenko was born in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, on 1(13) April 1878. Her father was the botanist Ivan Parfenievich Borodin and her mother Alexandra Grigoryevna. She received her basic education at the Obolenskaya Gymnasium before taking higher classes in the history of the Middle Ages under Ivan Mikhaĭlovich Grevs and Georgīĭ Vasilevich Forsten, graduating in 1904.
On Grevs' advice, in 1905 she went to the Sorbonne in Paris. There she studied under Charles Bémont and received her doctorate on the subject of John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond. It was published in 1908.
She married the distinguished botanist and academician Vladimir Nikolaevich Lyubimenko, who worked in the Nikitsky Botanical Garden in Crimea where they lived for a time. He was also at the Sorbonne in 1905.
Career
During her studies in Paris, Lubimenko made regular trips to London and Moscow and developed an interest in Anglo-Russian diplomatic and commercial relations of the early-modern period which became her specialist subject. Her first articles in this area appeared in French and Russian in 1912. She also wrote on Dutch and French relations with Russia.
She was the only woman to address the International Congress of Historical Studies in London in 1913 when she read a paper titled "The Correspondence of Queen Elizabeth with the Russian Czars". It was published in The American Historical Review in 1914 and told how the English accidentally made contact with the Russians in 1553 when the ship Edward Bonaventure was forced to seek shelter on the north coast of Russia due to weather conditions, leading to the English crew coming in contact with the court of Ivan the Terrible, the forming of the Russia Company, and diplomatic contacts between Ivan and Elizabeth I of England.
Later articles explored the subject through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries from the diplomatic and trading perspectives, identifying the impact of one on the other in strengthening or loosening ties between England and Russia. Multi-part articles in French historical journals explored the different classes of persons who travelled to Russia and their activities there.
After Paris, Lubimenko joined the main Saint Petersburg botanical garden as a foreign correspondent and translator in 1916 before teaching and lecturing at various institutions including the Central Archive. In 1923 she attended the fifth International Congress of Historical Sciences in Brussels and in 1925 travelled to Latvia, Germany, France and England to study archiving methods there and acquire archival material.
Her health began to decline from 1926 but she continued to hold research positions at academic institutions in Russia, particularly the Academy of Sciences about whose founding and history she published a number of articles. She joined the Saint Petersburg branch of the Institute of History in March 1942 and was evacuated in July that year to Yelabuga, then to Tashkent, where she worked until 1944.
She was awarded medals for the "defence of Leningrad" and for "Valiant Labour in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945."
Later life
Lubimenko retired in 1952 but continued to participate in academic life, writing essays on the history of Saint Petersburg for a volume on the history of the city that was published in 1955 and editing chapters of the first volume of the history of the Academy of Sciences. She died in Saint Petersburg on 15 January 1959. She received an obituary in the Revue Historique.

The Wirral Endurance Ride is a ride on the National Championship calendar of Endurance GB. It is run by the Cheshire group of the organisation.
The ride normally is split into two, on a local beach and the Wirral Way route on Wirral Country Park.
As with each of the rides in the championship, the competitors are split into distance classes, in this case for the Wirral ride, there are normally six. Winners of these classes are determined by the average speed and grade they receive on the ride. The format is also used to determine the overall winner, which is usually one of these distance class winners.

Akira Kanayama (金山明 Kanayama Akira; 1924–2006) was a Japanese avant-garde artist and an early member of The Gutai Art Association. An active contributor to Gutai's exhibitions and performance events, Kanayama was one of the pivotal figures of the group. His artworks were characterised by witty experiments with unconventional materials such as toy cars and signal lights for level crossing. He left Gutai in 1965 with Atsuko Tanaka, whom he married later in the same year.
Biography
Kanayama was born in 1924 in Amagasaki, Hyogo Prefecture. He withdrew from Tama Art University in 1947 and attended the Osaka Municipal Institute of Art (an art school affiliated with Osaka City Museum of Fine Arts) instead, where he continued to study until 1954. During this period, he participated in exhibitions held by Shin Seisakuha Kyōkai (新制作協会 New Production Association). In 1952, in order to pursue more radical artistic experiments, he founded Zero Society (Zero-kai) with other young members of the Shin Seisaku Association, including Kazuo Shiraga and Saburō Murakami. Kanayama also invited Atsuko Tanaka, who was then also a student at the Osaka Municipal Art Institute. Zero Society mounted its first group exhibition in 1954.
In 1955, Kanayama and three other members of Zero Society (Shiraga, Murakami, and Tanaka) joined Gutai upon Jirō Yoshihara's invitation. During his time as a Gutai member, Kanayama significantly expanded his oeuvre by exploring diverse media and means of artistic expression. He exhibited large-scale installations at Gutai's outdoor exhibitions and playfully used remote-control toys cars to create paintings that resemble Abstract Expressionist works. He also showed two works at Gutai's performance events, 'Gutai on Stage', in 1957 and 1958.
Kanayama left Gutai in 1965 and married Tanaka. Due to Tanaka's health condition, the couple decided to move to the Myōhōji temple in Osaka for a restful environment. Kanayama took care of administrative issues for Tanaka, while her artistic career soared. The couple moved to Nara in 1972. In later decades, Kanayama continued to make art and exhibited his works in various exhibitions. He received his first solo exhibition in 1992 at Gallery Kuranuki in Osaka. Kanayama died of lung cancer in September 2006. A retrospective exhibition of his artworks opened at Toyota Municipal Museum of Art in 2007.
Zero Society
In 1952, Kanayama formed Zero Society with fourteen other artists, including Kazuo Shiraga and Saburo Murakami. The name of the collective, 'Zero', given by Murakami, encapsulates its members' pursuit of simple, non-artificial, and 'primary' expressions of art. Shiraga also explained that the group's name connoted neutrality and the sense of having a 'new start'.
Kanayama shared other Zero Society members' interest in simplification. During this period, he created extremely minimal paintings, which often showed only several small dark rectangles painted at the edges of completely empty canvases. While the geometric abstraction resembled Piet Mondrian's works, Kanayama's paintings pushed further the exploration of the relationship between positive and negative spaces. He highlighted the tension and interplay between the narrow dark shapes and the expansive blankness.
Kanayama's minimalistic paintings also drew inspirations from Japanese calligraphy and Zen aesthetics. The striking emptiness of the paintings not only directed viewers' attention to the spatial interplay of the white canvases and the dark shapes but also recalled Zen concepts such as 'nothingness' (mu). The asymmetric compositions and random positions of the rectangles also echoed the visual tradition of Zen-inspired ink paintings.
Gutai
Around June 1955, Kanayama, Tanaka, Shiraga, and Murakami joined Gutai when the Gutai member Shōzō Shimamoto invited them on Yoshihara's behalf.
Kanayama exhibited Work B at the 1955 'Experimental Outdoor Exhibition of Modern Art to Challenge the Midsummer Sun' held by Gutai at Ashiya Park. Work B presented an unfixed small red ball placed on a 7m x 7m white wooden board. The work embodies Kanayama's continued exploration of abstract geometry. He expanded the visual language of his earlier paintings into three-dimensional space. The choice of colour evidenced the artist's awareness of the work's embeddedness in a natural environment since the saturated red helped to make the work stand out from the greenery of the park. At the same time, as the ball was constantly moved by winds and passers-by, the work animated the static modernist geometry by introducing the elements of movement, instability, and unpredictability. Kanayama also remarked that the work was not only an experiment with physical space but also an attempt to capture the mysterious balance of the celestial bodies.
For Gutai's 1956 outdoor exhibition at Ashiya Park, Kanayama created more site-specific works that further interacted with the surroundings. Footsteps (1954) was a long sheet of vinyl fabric on which the artist stamped his footprints. Over hundreds of metres long, the fabric ran across the pine grove of the park, climbed up trees, and passed through other artworks at the exhibition. The footprints both echoed visitors' actions of moving through space and recorded the temporal aspect of such movements.
Another work created by Kanayama for the outdoor exhibition, Clock, also played with the concept of time. It was a house-shaped clock on a tall pole. Despite the mundane look of the clock, its pointers were set to move anticlockwise, thus distorting visitors' perception of time and its passage.
At the 1956 outdoor exhibition, Kanayama also presented Crossing Light, a set of level-crossing signal lights used for local railways. Re-situated in the grove of Ashiya park, the lights signified the changes of natural landscapes brought by industrial developments and urbanisation in post-war Japan. The work also reflected Kanayama's interest in the rapid development of the transportation system in the 1950s Japan and, particularly, in the Kansai region: the Tōkaidō express trains were running on electricity by 1956, and the promotion of Shinkansen first started in 1957.
Kanayama began using remote-control toy cars to paint in 1957. He attached felted pens or punctured cans of synthetic paint to an automatic toy car and set the car to move on cavasses laid on the floor. By doing so, Kanayama sought to remove the artist's presence completely. Reflecting upon the role of artists, these toy car paintings both invoked Surrealist automatic drawing and parodied the legacy of Pollockian Abstract Expressionism.
Kanayama frequently used balloons to explore the spatial and temporal potential of seemingly static and quotidian objects. His 1955 Balloon was a huge inflated red rubber globe hung in the middle of an exhibition room. Two inserted light bulbs illuminated the balloon from within. As the bulbs shone brightly, the balloon emanated a red glow and tinted other artworks in the space red. The work thus invasively dominated the room, interfering with viewers' sight and movement.
In 1957, Kanayama again created an installation with balloons. This time he placed a large elliptical balloon on the floor. Since the dark balloon was slightly deflated, it displayed textured wrinkles. Its slightly flattened shape also drew viewers' attention to the oft-overlooked surface of the floor in exhibition spaces.
At Gutai's first performance event, the 1957 'Gutai on Stage', Kanayama presented Giant Balloon, a performance in which he gradually inflated a huge balloon to fill the stage. He then illuminated the balloon with lights in different colour and punctured it with a knife, leaving it to leak air and shrink slowly. Although the performance showed no vigorous movements, the process of inflating and deflating the balloon underscored the process-based nature of artmaking. In addition, the changing size and shape of the balloon encouraged the audiences to reconsider the relationship between objects, bodies, and space. The brochure of 'Gutai on Stage' stated that Kanayama's performance invited viewers to think of the familiar childhood toy, balloon, from a new perspective. A year later, Kanayama again used balloons to create Biological Balloon at 'The Second Gutai on Stage'. The work showed a floating biomorphic balloon with multiple limb-like appendages. It sought to evoke the existence of unexpected creatures beyond the known and the imaginable.
After Gutai
After leaving Gutai in 1965, Kanayama devoted his time to assisting Tanaka's career. However, he also continued his own artistic adventure. In the late 80s, he created a series of paintings that visualise the invisible beams of ultraviolet and infrared light. The canvases are vertically divided into blocks of radiant red, sombre violet and black. In some paintings, sharp lines in contrasting colours run through the lengths of the canvases and penetrate the colour blocks. While the glossy surface of these paintings enhances the complexity of their visual effect, Kanayama's extremely smooth and almost invisible brushwork erase traces of the artist's intervention.
Around 1992, Kanayama began incorporating music and sounds in his works. He recorded the sounds emanated from classical music in waveforms on paper. The soundwaves generate rhythmically undulating lines. Paralleling the ultraviolet and infrared works, these soundwaves again give visual forms to invisible elements. Kanayama's works explore the artistic potential of such visualisation. Later in the 90s, he revisited his early fascination with the universe and celestial balances. He used the astronomic records of asteroid trajectories, electromagnetic waves, and photos of the changing appearance of the galaxy in his artworks. For example, his Northern Galaxy Atlas (1996) is a large collage (101.5 cm x 201.5 cm) of numerous black-and-white photographs of peculiar galaxies. The photos are blurry and pixelated, forming an almost illegible mosaic-like composition.
Kanayama's most recent works, created after the turn of the century, returned to visuality and two-dimensionality. Mirroring early paintings from the Zero Society period, his latest paintings, such as Three Primary Colours (2004), focus on the flat surface of canvases and the optical effects of colours. In this painting, three vertical blocks in yellow, blue, and red are connected and penetrated by numerous horizontal lines in the same three colours. Bright primary colours and symmetric composition characterise Kanayama's latest paintings.

George Pilcher (26 February 1882 - 8 December 1962) was a British journalist and politician, who served as the Conservative MP for Penryn and Falmouth in 1924–29, and as a member of the Indian Central Legislative Assembly in 1924.
Early career
Pilcher was born in Folkestone, the son of Walter Pilcher, a grocer. He was educated at Kent College, Canterbury, and then at Wadham College, Oxford, where he studied modern history. He then trained as a barrister, qualifying at the Inner Temple.
In 1907, he joined the Morning Post, first working as the private secretary to the editor, Fabian Ware, and then becoming foreign editor in 1909. While with the Post, he reported extensively from overseas, including with the Ottoman army in the First Balkan War. He then moved to India in 1914, where he became joint editor of the Statesman, as well as a foreign correspondent for the Post. At the Statesman, he reported from the Waziristan campaign of 1920 and the royal tour of 1921.
Political career
In 1924, Pilcher was elected to the Central Legislative Assembly, the Indian colonial parliament. He was one of the two members representing the "European" constituency in the Bengal Presidency. He resigned the seat in August.
Later that year, in the 1924 United Kingdom general election, he returned to the UK where he was elected for Penryn and Falmouth as a Conservative, defeating the incumbent Liberal. During his time in the Commons, he was involved in overseas affairs, part of a delegation visiting Brazil in 1927, and the British delegation to the 1928 Empire Parliamentary Conference in Canada. After standing down at the 1929 United Kingdom general election (he did not seek re-election), he became secretary of the Royal Empire Society, retiring from that post in 1935. His successor as Conservative candidate for Penryn and Falmouth in 1929, Maurice Petherick, was defeated by the Liberal, Tudor Walters.

Ewald Lienen (born 28 November 1953) is a German football manager and former player. He is the current technical director of FC St. Pauli.
Playing career
Lienen began his professional career at Arminia Bielefeld of the 2. Bundesliga North in 1974. After three seasons, he moved up to the top flight with Borussia Mönchengladbach. The club had just won three successive titles, but Lienen did not manage to achieve this as the team finished runners-up in his first season then failed to mount a title challenge in the subsequent years.
However, Europe was to prove a more successful venture as the club's runners-up finish of 1977–78 qualified them for the UEFA Cup. This, they duly lifted beating Red Star Belgrade 2–1 on aggregate in the final in May 1979. Lienen played in the final, and in each of the previous rounds, scoring two goals along the way (against Manchester City and future club MSV Duisburg).
As holders, they were entered into the following season's tournament, where Lienen again would make it through to the UEFA Cup final. This time, he was not to capture the prize as the team frustratingly lost on away goals to countrymen Eintracht Frankfurt. Lienen again played in all rounds of the trophy and again chipped in with two goals (against Viking and Saint Étienne).
After a further season here, he returned to Arminia Bielefeld, newly promoted to the Bundesliga. The club managed to survive and stabilise as a top-flight team during Lienen's spell here in the early 1980s. On 14 August 1981, Lienen suffered a severe injury, as Norbert Siegmann of Werder Bremen slit his thigh open with his studs resulting in an open deep wound of 25 cm (10 in), exposing his muscles and femur.
The wound required 23 stitches; nevertheless, after just 17 days, Lienen started practicing again.
After two seasons with Bielefeld, Lienen decided to move back to Borussia Mönchengladbach. Here, he and the team achieved a string of top-four finishes but fell short of collecting a league title medal. He did, however, play in the 1984 DFB-Pokal final where he narrowly missed out as the team lost on penalties to Bayern Munich.
In Summer 1987, Lienen left Borussia Mönchengladbach to set up a union for professional footballers in Duisburg, along with Benno Möhlmann and Frank Pagelsdorf. He also concentrated on studying for a football coaching license, which he achieved with an A grade in 1989.
Meanwhile, he also continued his footballing career at MSV Duisburg of the Oberliga, winning promotion on the second attempt to the 2. Bundesliga in 1989. He won promotion again to the top flight two years later and played out a final year in the Bundesliga. When the club suffered relegation in May 1992, Lienen retired.
Management career
Early career (1989–1997)
Lienen remained at MSV Duisburg after ending his playing days, coaching the club's amateurs from 1 July 1989 to 22 March 1993. He quickly got the opportunity to move up into the first team management on 22 March 1993, after the club regained its Bundesliga status. His first season coaching at this level saw him attain a comfortable ninth-place finish in the 1993–94 season. The next year started less favourably though, and saw MSV Duisburg rock bottom by November (with just two points from 22). Lienen was fired on 1 November 1994 after a 0–5 home defeat to Hamburger SV on 30 October 1994. He finished his reign with a record of 25 wins, 14 draws, and 26 losses in 65 matches.
He then accepted the invitation of his former Borussia Mönchengladbach coach Jupp Heynckes to join him at Spanish club CD Tenerife as his assistant. The team achieved an excellent fifth place spot in 1994–95 in La Liga. The following season was not as spectacular but still a solid tenth-place position.
Hansa Rostock, 1. FC Köln, Spain, and back to Germany (1997–2005)
When Heynckes left Tenerife to move to Real Madrid C.F., Lienen's time in Spain was up and he returned to his homeland as head coach of Hansa Rostock. He started on 1 July 1997.
Lienen led the club to a sixth-place finish in the 1997–98 season. The next season proved a far trickier affair as the club sat in the relegation zone throughout the majority of the campaign. Lienen paid the price on 8 March 1999 for a 1–4 away defeat by MSV Duisburg on 5 March 1999. The club had only won one of their last 14 matches. He finished his reign with 18 wins, 18 draws, and 24 losses in 60 matches.
Another opportunity soon fell his way as 1. FC Köln, newly relegated to the 2. Bundesliga, called on his services. His first match was a 7–1 win against SG Wattenscheid 09 in the DFB-Pokal. Lienen immediately returned the club to the Bundesliga, as champions in his first season. The 2000–01 season saw them finish a comfortable tenth, but the next season proved tougher and they slipped back down to the second tier, ending Lienen's time here. He was sacked on 28 January 2002. He finished his tenure with a record of 38 wins, 24 draws, and 32 losses in 94 matches.
He returned to Spain in the following season, when CD Tenerife returned to him after suffering relegation. His first match was a 1–1 draw against Compostela on 31 August 2002. His spell back in the Canary Islands was less successful as before as the team failed to mount a promotion challenge. After a string of poor results, Lienen was fired in January 2003, just six months after his appointment. His final match was a 2–0 loss against Real Murcia on 18 January 2003.
Lienen was not on the sideline for long, as his former club Borussia Mönchengladbach looked to him after the sudden resignation of Hans Meyer and hired Lienen on 1 March 2003. The club had slumped into the relegation zone, but Lienen stabilised them in their remaining 11 games and moved them up to 12th. He was retained for the next season, but after a weak start (one win in six), he was replaced by Holger Fach on 21 September 2003. He finished with a record of seven wins, five draws, and six losses in 18 matches.
After a six-month absence from the Bundesliga, Lienen was recruited by Hannover 96 on 8 March 2004 after their dismissal of Ralf Rangnick. The club were flirting with the drop, but Lienen again proved adept at taking over in such circumstances, as he maintained the club's top-flight status with a 14th-place finish. The 2004–05 season was Hannover's best Bundesliga finishes up to that time, as they recorded a 10th-place position. The next season began poorly though, and hopes of building on the previous campaign's strong outcome evaporated. The club acted quickly and fired Lienen on 9 November 2005, after 12 games. His tenure finished with 22 wins, 17 draws, and 24 losses.
Greece and Germany (2006–2011)
Lienen again looked abroad for his next position, and headed for a new challenge in the Greek Super League with Panionios for the 2006–07 season. His first match as manager was a 0–0 draw against Irakis Thessaloniki. His first season in Athens was a success, as the club finished fifth, enough to qualify for the UEFA Cup. They knocked out Sochaux-Montbéliard 2–1 on aggregate. to qualify for the group stage. The following season was equally successful for the club, again finishing in fifth position, only to lose their UEFA Cup berth on the following playoff.
He was released from the Greek club by mutual consent on 11 November 2008. This followed the club's decision to sack his assistant, Abder Ramdane because of an incident with striker Lambros Choutos. Panionios cited various disagreements from the start of the season, as well as the tension developing between players and staff, as the reasons for this decision. His final match was a 2–0 loss against PAOK.
On 13 May 2009, he was named as the new manager of 1860 Munich. Lienen and 1860 Munich agreed to mutually terminate his contract on 17 June 2010 so he could make the move to Olympiakos. He finished his tenure with 15 wins, eight draws, and 16 losses.
Lienen became the new head coach of Olympiacos on 17 June 2010. He defeated Besa Kavajë 11–1 on aggregate in the second qualifying round of the Europa League. On 6 August 2010, the German coach was fired by Olympiacos because of the club's elimination from the Europa League after Olympiacos lost against Maccabi Tel Aviv.
On 8 November 2010 he was named the successor of Christian Ziege at Arminia Bielefeld, Lienen decided not to be manager of the club if they are relegated. however Bielefeld were relegated to the 3. Liga after only four wins in the 2010–11 season, three of which were under Lienen (one of which was won as VfL Osnabrück scored two own goals, resulting in Bielefeld winning 2–1). On 18 April 2011, Arminia announced that Markus von Ahlen would replace Lienen starting in the 2011–12 season. He finishes his tenure with three wins, seven draws, and 13 losses.
Third stint in Greece and to Romania (2012–2013)
Lienen became AEK Athens's manager. His first match was a 1–0 loss to PAOK. He was sacked on 10 April 2013 while the club was a point above the relegation zone with two matches remaining.
On 6 November 2013, Lienen was appointed as the new manager of Romanian Liga I club Oțelul Galați on a two-year contract. His first match was a 1–0 loss to Politehnica Timișoara. On 16 May 2014, he managed to save Oțelul Galați from relegation, a team that won the title three years earlier, and he imposed a good and spectacular football at the team. Also he is very appreciated by the Romanian fans. He ended his contract after only one season.
FC St. Pauli (2014–2017)
He was hired as the head coach of FC St. Pauli on 16 December 2014. His first match was a 2–1 loss to FC Ingolstadt 04 on 17 December 2014. His first win was a 3–1 against VfR Aalen on 20 December 2014 in his home debut. Then they went on a four match winless streak. During this time, St. Pauli lost to Greuther Fürth 1–0. Lienen was critical of the referee after the match and was eventually fined 3,000 Euro. The club's next victory was a 2–0 win against Eintracht Braunschweig on 7 March 2015. St. Pauli defeated Fortuna Düsseldorf 4–0 on 6 April 2015. He has a record of four wins, three draws, and five losses since becoming head coach. He re-signed and moved to the technical director position for the 2017–18 season.

Malaysia's armed forces, which encompasses three major branches, originate from the formation of local military forces in the first half of the 20th century, during British colonial rule of Malaya and Singapore prior to Malaya's independence in 1957. The branches have undergone several restructuring, but fundamentally includes the army, navy and air force.
Malaysian Army
The first military in Malaysia can be traced back to the Malay States Volunteer Rifles which existed from 1915 to 1936. The birth of the Malaysian Army came about when the Federal Council of Federated Malay States eventually passed the Malay Regiment Bill on 23 January 1933. This allowed the initial recruitment of 25 males for the First Experimental Malay Company on 1 March 1933. Major G. McI. S. Bruce of the Lincolnshire Regiment was the first Commanding Officer.
By 1 January 1935, the Experimental Company became The Malay Regiment with a complement of 150 men. A battalion was formed on 1 January 1938 and eventually a second battalion on 1 December 1941,.
The 1st Bn Malay Regiment was famous for its successful defence of Opium Hill (), Singapore, in the Battle of Pasir Panjang during the Battle of Singapore. The Battle of Opium Hill on 14 February 1942 involved 42 soldiers commanded by Lt. Adnan Bin Saidi who defended their position against attack from the 18th Division of the Japanese Imperial Army under Lt. Gen. Renya Mutaguchi. After World War II and during the Malayan Emergency, the number of battalions was increased to 7 in the early 1950s.
The Kor Armor DiRaja (Malay; English: Royal Armoured Corps) can trace its roots to the formation on 1 September 1952 of the Federation Reconnaissance Squadron. It was later merged with the Federation Regiment to form the Federation Reconnaissance Corps. The name underwent a few transformations from the Malaysian Reconnaissance Corps (16 September 1970), Royal Malaysian Reconnaissance Corps (May 1979) to Royal Cavalry Corps (December 1979) and finally to Kor Armor DiRaja (Royal Armoured Corps) on 8 December 1986.
Royal Malaysian Navy
The Royal Malaysian Navy originated from the Straits Settlement Volunteer Reserve Force formed on 27 April 1934 in Singapore. The formation of a Penang branch in 1938 saw its expansion. When the Second World War broke out in 1939, Britain strengthened its Naval Force in Southeast Asia by forming a unit called the "Malay Section of The Royal Navy" to protect the security of Singapore and Malaya. This unit which consisted of 400 men underwent training at a training camp called HMMS Pelandok, a British naval base in Singapore. Expansion saw the unit increase to 1450 men during World War II. Due to shortage of funds, the British disbanded the force after World War II in April 1947. The Malayan Naval Forces was again created in 1948 in response to the Malayan Emergency with the loan of one landing ship and five fast surface launches from the Royal Navy. In 1953, Queen Elizabeth awarded the Malayan Navy a Royal status to become the Royal Malayan Navy. The first vessel was a minesweeper called HMS Penyu or Turtle. After independence, it was transferred from Singapore on 12 July 1958 as an independent sovereign navy. On 16 September 1963 it was renamed as the Tentera Laut Diraja Malaysia (Royal Malaysian Navy) in accordance to the formation of Malaysia.
Royal Malaysian Air Force
The Royal Malaysian Air Force was founded in 1936 as the Straits Settlement Volunteer Air Force (SSVAF) and later in 1940 as the Malayan Volunteers Air Force (MVAF) until 1942 during the Fall of Malaya. It was then reactivated after World War II as the Malayan Auxiliary Air Force in 1950. The passing of the Air Force Ordinance by the Parliament on 2 June 1958 saw the creation of Royal Malayan Air Force (RMAF). The first adviser was seconded from the Royal Air Force (RAF), Air Commodore A.V.R Johnstsone who became the first Chief of the RMAF. The proud few who formed the RMAF were Flying Officer Lim Heng Lip, Sergeant Subramanian, Corporal Othman Mohd Ismail, Corporal Wan Said, Corporal JD Parsley, Corporal Mahadeven, Senior Aircraftman (SAC) Surindam, SAC Md Noor, SAC Zainal, SAC Mohd Hussain and Junior Technician (JT) Ismail Ariffin. The first aircraft acquired for Squadron No 1 was a Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneer which served the RMAF for 12 years. It was named Lang Rajawali by Tunku Abdul Rahman, the first Prime Minister of Malaya. With the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963, the name of the force was changed to Tentera Udara Diraja Malaysia (Royal Malaysian Air Force).
Engagements
At the time of independence in 1957, the Malayan Armed Forces, together with British Commonwealth troops were engaged in the Emergency, a communist insurgency in the Malayan interior. The Malayan Communist Party, led by Chin Peng, found support mainly among the ethnic Chinese. Independence for Malaya removed the major grounds for the rebellion, and by 1960 Chin Peng had ordered an end to the fighting.
Three years after the end of the Emergency, the merger of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak and North Borneo (now Sabah) to form the current Federation of Malaysia was opposed militarily by the Sukarno regime of Indonesia. Called the Confrontation, this was mainly a low-level conflict fought in the jungles of Borneo. Malaysian forces were once again assisted by Commonwealth troops. By 1966, Sukarno had been toppled, and the war was at an end.
However, just three years later, Chin Peng reignited the dormant communist insurgency. The communists never gained much ground, and were engaged mainly by the Royal Malaysian Police. Nevertheless, it was twenty years before a peace agreement was signed in 1989.

Phone Story is a satirical mobile video game conceived by Yes Lab activist Michael Pineschi and designed by Paolo Pedercini for Molleindustria with the stated aim of demonstrating what the developers refer to as "the dark side of your favorite smart phone." The game consists of four minigames which require the player to complete activities such as forcing children in the Third World to mine coltan and preventing suicides at a Foxconn factory.
The creators of the game stated the main purpose was to elicit a response from people who "fail to realize how their fashionable consumption can have negative effects on people in the globalized world.
Release
Phone Story was released on the iOS platform on September 9, 2011, though it was banned by Apple after only four days. Apple cited violations of their developer guidelines as the reason for removing the game, though an article published in The Guardian questioned the validity of their concerns. Following the removal of the game, it was released for Android phones, and a free playable Adobe Flash version was made available on the developer's website.
The Phone Story website contains extensive information about the topics touched on by the game, and all profits from the sale of the app go to charities which work in the areas described, including a donation of over $6000 to a girl injured in a suicide attempt at a Foxconn factory.
The game is offered as freeware under a Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-SA.
Gameplay
Phone Story consists of four self-contained minigames, each featuring narration by a voice which represents the user's phone, detailing the real world conditions which the minigames represent. The first game deals with the mining of coltan in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and has the player controlling guards to ensure that labourers are not allowed to rest. The second takes place at a factory, in which the player must move a net back and forth in order to catch workers who are attempting suicide. The third is set in a phone store, in which the player must slingshot phones into the hands of consumers. The final minigame concerns the recycling of discarded phones in Ghana, tasking the player with dividing components from the phone among workers that are salvaging the parts in unsafe ways. Each minigame requires the player to complete the relevant action successfully a certain number of times before a timer runs out; if they do not, the narrator admonishes them, saying "do not pretend that you are not complicit."
Reception
Phone Story has received mixed reviews. Android Rundown said that it was "not that entertaining or enlightening", criticising the game's short length and repetitive gameplay and awarding it 5 points out of 10. Pocket Gamer were more positive in reference to the game's educational content, stating that it encouraged them to read up on the issues raised, but were similarly critical with the game's simplistic gameplay and short length.

An oil can (oilcan or oiler) is a can that holds oil (usually motor oil) for lubricating machines. An oil can can also be used to fill oil-based lanterns. An occupation, referred to as an oiler, can use an oil can (among other tools) to lubricate machinery.
Oil cans were made by companies like Noera Manufacturing Company and Perfection in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Around this time, oil cans frequently leaked and contributed to fires. In 1957, aluminium oil cans were introduced, produced by companies like the American Can Company.
Rocanville, Saskatchewan, Canada is home to a large-scale oil can industry because of the Symons Oiler factory which produced oil cans during World War II.
Design
Oil cans come in a variety of designs, from a simple cylindrical disposable can opened with a churchkey (or with a combined spout-opener), to a hemisphere base and tapered straight spout to more intricate designs with handles and push-buttons, to the modern plastic bottle. In 2000, the 3-In-One Oil can was redesigned to look like the early 20th century design (hemisphere base with tapered straight spout).

Esther Réthy (22 October 1912 – 28 January 2004) was a Hungarian operatic soprano who had a major career in Europe from 1934 through 1968. She was notably a principal artist at the Vienna State Opera for over a decade and was a frequent performer at the Salzburg Festival. She performed a broad opera repertoire that encompassed French, German, Italian, Czech, and Hungarian operas. The latter part of her career was dedicated mainly to performing the German operetta literature at the Vienna Volksoper. A very beautiful woman, she was a greatly admired Angele in Richard Heuberger's Der Opernball.
Biography
Born in Budapest, Réthy studied singing with in her native city and in Vienna. In 1934 she made her professional opera debut at the Hungarian State Opera House as the Shepherd in Richard Wagner's Tannhäuser. She remained at that house for the next three years, drawing particular acclaim as Micaëla in Georges Bizet's Carmen. She also appeared as a guest artist at a number of opera houses in Central Europe.
In 1937, Réthy became a principal artist at the Vienna State Opera, where she committed until 1949. She made her first appearance at that house as Marguerite in Charles Gounod's Faust with Jussi Björling in the title role. Her other roles with the company included Agathe in Carl Maria von Weber's Der Freischütz, Countess Almaviva in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro, Alice Ford in Giuseppe Verdi's Falstaff, Desdemona in Verdi's Otello, Eva in Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, Lauretta in Giacomo Puccini's Gianni Schicchi, Mařenka in Bedřich Smetana's The Bartered Bride, Micaela, Mimì in Puccini's La bohème, Pamina in Mozart's The Magic Flute, Violetta Valéry in Verdi's La traviata, and the title role in George Frideric Handel's Rodelinda among others.
While singing in Vienna, Réthy was active as a guest artist with many European opera houses. She remained a frequent performer at the Hungarian State Opera House and appeared often as a guest at the Bavarian State Opera, Berlin State Opera, and Semperoper under such conductors as Karl Böhm, Victor de Sabata, Wilhelm Furtwängler, Hans Knappertsbusch, Clemens Krauss, and Josef Krips. She became internationally famous through her many appearances at the Salzburg Festival where she sang Susanna in Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro (1937–1939, 1941 with Ezio Pinza as Figaro), Sophie in Richard Strauss'a Der Rosenkavalier (1937–1939), Donna Elvira in Mozart's Don Giovanni (1950), and Europa in the first public performance of Strauss's Die Liebe der Danae (1952). She also appeared at the 1940 Salzburg Festival in an operetta concert. In 1940, she was supposed to appear in several roles at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, but the events of World War II made this impossible.
After World War II, Réthy became a highly lauded performer in operettas, beginning with a triumphant portrayal of Rosalinde in Johann Strauss II's Die Fledermaus under the baton of Herbert von Karajan at the Vienna State Opera. From 1948 she sang frequently at the Vienna Volksoper in the operettas of Emmerich Kálmán, Franz Lehár, and Strauss. Her first performances at the house were as Annina in Eine Nacht in Venedig and Saffi in Der Zigeunerbaron. Her operetta repertoire grew to include Angèle Didier in Der Graf von Luxemburg, Angele in Der Opernball, Fiametta in Boccaccio, Gabriele in Wiener Blut, Hanna Glawari in Die Lustige Witwe, and Laura in Der Bettelstudent among others.
Réthy retired from the stage in 1968, after which she was committed to teaching singing in Vienna. She died there at the age of 91 in 2004. She was married to Dr. Vincent Imre. Her son, Laszló Imre, became a successful conductor.

The 32-bar form, also known as the AABA song form, American popular song form and the ballad form, is a song structure commonly found in Tin Pan Alley songs and other American popular music, especially in the first half of the 20th century.
As its alternative name AABA implies, this song form consists of four sections: an eight-bar A section; a second eight-bar A section (which may have slight changes from the first A section); an eight-bar B section, often with contrasting harmony or "feel"; and a final eight-bar A section. The core melody line is generally retained in each A section, although variations may be added, particularly for the last A section.
Examples of 32-bar AABA form songs include "Over the Rainbow", "I Got Rhythm", "What'll I Do", "Make You Feel My Love", "The Man I Love", and "Blue Skies". Many show tunes that have become jazz standards are 32-bar song forms.
Basic song form
At its core, the basic AABA 32-bar song form consists of four sections, each section being 8 bars in length, totaling 32 bars. Each of these 8-bar sections is assigned a letter name ("A" or "B"), based on its melodic and harmonic content. The sections all share the same melody (possibly with slight variations), and the recurring title lyric typically falls on either the first or last line of each A section. The "B" section musically and lyrically contrasts the A sections, and may or may not contain the title lyric. The "B" section may use a different harmony that contrasts with the harmony of the A sections. For example in the song "I've Got Rhythm", the A sections are in the key of B, but the B section involves a circle of fifths series of dominant seventh chords going from D7, G7, C7, to F7. Song form terminology is not standardized, and the B section is also referred to as the "middle eight", "bridge", or "primary bridge".
The song form of "What'll I Do" by Irving Berlin is as follows:
{| class="wikitable"

|-

|}
Terminology
Sectional verse
Some Tin Pan Alley songs composed as numbers for musicals precede the main tune with what was called a "sectional verse" or "introductory verse" in the terminology of the early 20th century. This introductory section is usually 16 bars long and establishes the background and mood of the number, and is musically undistinguished, with a free musical structure, speech-like rhythms, and rubato delivery, in order to highlight the attractions of the main tune. The sectional verse is often omitted from modern performances. It is not assigned a letter in the "AABA" naming scheme.
The introductory verse from "What'll I Do" by Irving Berlin is as follows:
Gone is the romance that was so divine,'tis broken and cannot be mendedYou must go your way, and I must go mine,but now that our love dreams have ended...
Bridge
In music theory, the middle eight or bridge is the B section of a 32-bar form. This section has a significantly different melody from the rest of the song and usually occurs after the second "A" section in the AABA song form. It is also called a middle eight because it happens in the middle of the song and the length is generally eight bars.
Terminological confusion
In early-20th-century terminology, the main 32-bar AABA section, in its entirety, was called the "refrain" or "chorus". This is in contrast to the modern usage of the term "chorus", which refers to a repeating musical and lyrical section in verse–chorus form. Additionally, "verse," "chorus", and "refrain" all have different meanings in modern musical terminology. See the below chart for clarification:
History
Though the 32-bar form resembles the ternary form of the operatic da capo aria, it did not become common until the late 1910s. It became "the principal form" of American popular song around 1925–1926, with the AABA form consisting of the chorus or the entirety of many songs in the early 20th century. It was commonly used by composers George Gershwin, Cole Porter, and Jerome Kern, and it dominated American popular music into the 1950s.
The 32-bar form was often used in rock in the 1950s and '60s, after which verse–chorus form became more prevalent. Examples include:
George Gershwin "I Got Rhythm" (1930)
Jerry Lee Lewis' "Great Balls of Fire" (1957)
The Everly Brothers' "All I Have to Do Is Dream" (1958)
The Shirelles' "Will You Love Me Tomorrow" (1960)
The Beach Boys' "Surfer Girl" (1963)
Though more prevalent in the first half of the 20th century, many contemporary songs show similarity to the form, such as "Memory", from Cats, which features expanded form through the B and A sections repeated in new keys. Songwriters such as Lennon–McCartney and those working in the Brill Building also used modified or extended 32-bar forms, often modifying the number of measures in individual or all sections. The Beatles ("From Me to You" (1963) and "I Want to Hold Your Hand" (1963)), like many others, would extend the form with an instrumental section, second bridge, break or reprise of the introduction, etc., and another return to the main theme. Introductions and codas also extended the form. In "Down Mexico Way" "the A sections… are doubled in length, to sixteen bars—but this affects the overall scheme only marginally". The theme tune of the long-running British TV series Doctor Who has, in some incarnations, followed 32 bar form.

The Huttwil–Wolhusen railway line is a single-track standard-gauge railway line in Switzerland and currently operated by BLS AG. It was built by the Huttwil-Wolhusen-Bahn (HWB), based in Willisau, and opened on 9 May 1895. Operations were managed by the Langenthal-Huttwil-Bahn (LHB), which owned and operated the Langenthal–Huttwil railway. On 1 January 1944, the HWB was merged into the Vereinigte Huttwil-Bahnen (United Huttwil Railways, VHB), which was later merged into BLS AG.
History
The initiators of the Huttwil-Wolhusen-Bahn, which were mainly politicians from the Willisau District, saw their project in the 1870s as part of through route that would have connected France and the Gotthard Railway (Gotthardbahn, GB) at Altdorf by the shortest route via Delle, Delémont, Balsthal, Langenthal, Huttwil, Wolhusen, Lucerne and Stans. However, the Jura-Gotthard-Bahn (Jura-Gotthard Railway) project was not completed.
Shortly after the opening of the Langenthal–Huttwil railway by the Langenthal-Huttwil-Bahn, a new initiative committee received a concession for the Huttwil–Wolhusen line on 10 April 1890. The main investor in the railway company, which was founded on 29 March 1893, was the Canton of Lucerne. In addition, the Canton of Bern and various communities participated in the railway. The HWB transferred the operation and maintenance of the Huttwil–Wolhusen line under contract to the LHB on 23/24 June 1894. This allowed the rolling stock of the two railway companies to be used over the whole Langenthal–Wolhusen line. Construction began in the summer of 1893. The opening, which was originally planned for 1 March 1895, was delayed and operations did not begin until 9 May 1895.
The HWB acquired steam locomotive Eb 3/4, listed as number 4, from the Bern-Neuenburg-Bahn (Bern-Neuchâtel Railway) in 1930. However, it proved unsuitable and was scrapped in 1937. Steam locomotive Ec 3/3 5, which was built as a tram engine, began operations in 1936. This high-performance machine, known as the Motorlokomotive was operated by one man and allowed very economical operations. After electrification, it was sold to Sulzer, where it was used as a factory locomotive. Today it is owned by the Historic Heritage Foundation of the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB Historic).
In order to obtain federal aid for rail electrification, the HWB merged with the LHB and the Ramsei-Sumiswald-Huttwil-Bahn (RSHB) on 1 January 1944 to form the United Huttwil Railways (Vereinigten Huttwil-Bahnen, VHB), which immediately formed a joint venture called the EBT Group with the Emmental-Burgdorf-Thun-Bahn (EBT) and the Solothurn-Münster Bahn (SMB). The VHB commenced electrical operations on the Huttwil–Hüswil section at 15 kV AC 16 ⅔ Hertz on 6 August 1945. Electric trains have run on the whole line to Wolhusen since 7 December 1945. The VHB merged with the other railways of the EBT Group in 1997 to form the Regionalverkehr Mittelland (RM), which was merged in turn with the BLS AG in 2006.
Operations
The Wolhusen–Huttwil line has been served hourly by three-part NINA DMUs since the timetable change in 2013. It is part of line S6 of the Lucerne S-Bahn, which runs between and Langenthal as part of a portion worked train. The other half of the train runs from Wolhusen to Langnau. On the Wolhusen–Willisau section the timetable is complemented by S7 services, which run every half hour at peak times to Langenthal. It uses the same rolling stock as the S6.
Feight traffic still also plays an important role. The Makies company transports gravel from Zell to the gravel works in Gettnau. It acquired four BDe 4/4 railcars from the Südostbahn (SOB) for this role, with one serving as a source of spare parts. A double-track section between Gettnau and Gettnau freight yard has facilitated operations since 8 December 2006.

Makers of Indian Literature is a series of biographical monographs published by Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters.
Background
In 1964, the Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters, decided to publish the first in a series of monographs on writers who had made significant contributions to the development of literature in an Indian language. The Sahita Akademi planned to title the series Indian Men of Letters. Among the authors invited to contribute to the series was C. Rajagopalachari, who was asked to write on the ancient Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar. Responding to the request, Rajagopalachari objected to classifying Thiruvalluvar as one of the "Indian Men of Letters". He felt that the series' title should be changed if rishis and sages such as Valmiki and Tulsidas were to be included. Alternative titles were considered. Eventually, in order to encompass both old and modern writers, from sages and rishis to men of letters, the series was named Makers of Indian Literature.
Krishna Kripalani prepared detailed guidelines for the authors to ensure a measure of uniformity. Each volume was to be of about 80 printed pages, or 30,000 words. They were intended primarily for the general reader who had not necessarily read the work of the writer concerned, and might not be burdened with references and allusions more likely to deter than hold the attention of the target audience. The story of the life and work of the writer concerned was to be told simply and lucidly and in such a manner as to convince the reader of the historic significance of their contribution to Indian literature. The merit of an author's worth and the quality of their work was to be established on the evidence of the totality of their contribution. This was to be assessed in the context of the age in which they had lived and, if possible, in the context of Indian heritage as a whole. Selected passages from works discussed were to be interwoven with the narrative, in order to assist the reader to appreciate the author's style and mode of expression.
Monographs
Within twenty years, 120 monographs, on figures who wrote in 20 languages, were published by the Sahitya Akademi. A total of 250 translated volumes were also published, in 13 languages. The next 20 years saw the publication of a further 531 monographs, on historical figures who wrote in a further 21 languages; as well as 586 translations. Of the 651 monographs published up to 2003, 274 were originally written in English; 96 in Hindi; 51 in Urdu; 41 in Tamil; 28 each in Kashmiri and Maithili; 27 in Kannada; 15 each in Bengali and Rajasthani; 14 each in Marathi and Telugu; 10 in Gujarati; seven in Odia; six each in Malayalam and Sindhi; five in Nepali; four each in Assamese and Dogri; two each in Konkani, Punjabi and Sanskrit. Of the 836 translations, Hindi was the most common, with 151 volumes being translated into it; followed by Tamil, 98; Kannada 76; Telugu 70; and Urdu 63.

Lachesis, also known as bushmasters, is a genus of venomous pit vipers found in forested areas of Central and South America. The generic name refers to one of the Three Fates, Lachesis, in Greek mythology who determined the length of the thread of life. Four species are currently recognized.
Description
Adults vary in length from , although some may grow to as much as , making it the longest venomous snake in the Western Hemisphere. Bushmasters are the longest type of viper in the world. L. muta is possibly the largest of the three species currently recognized, although more scant information suggest L. stenophrys broadly overlaps in size and may average at a similar size, while L. melanocephala and L. acrochorda are seemingly slightly smaller than the prior two species. Although they are not the heaviest vipers, being surpassed in mass by the Gaboon viper and the Eastern diamondback rattlesnake, large adults still can weigh up to . Bushmasters are sexually dimorphic in size, with males reaching larger sizes than females. The bushmaster's tail ends with a horny spine which sometimes vibrates when disturbed like rattlesnakes. This has led to some calling it 'the mute rattlesnake'.
Geographic range
Found in central and South America, including the island of Trinidad.
Reproduction
Bushmasters lay eggs: about a dozen in an average clutch. The female reportedly remains with her eggs during incubation and may aggressively defend the nest if approached. The hatchlings average in length and are more colorful than the adults. Lachesis is thought to be unique among New World pit vipers by laying eggs rather than giving birth to live young, although some evidence suggests that the species Bothrocophias colombianus found in Colombia may do the same.
Venom
This snake is capable of multiple-bite strikes and the injection of large amounts of venom. Even the bite of a juvenile specimen can be fatal. However, this snake is rarely encountered so snakebite incidents are not common. The venom of Lachesis has several activities, such as the activation of plasminogen, leading to increased permeability of blood vessels, causing edema and lowering of blood pressure, it also has coagulant activity where thrombin-like enzymes act on fibrinogen, forming small clots that settle in organs such as lungs and kidneys, obstructing capillary blood flow, hemorrhagic activity is caused by metalloproteases, which damage capillary walls, both coagulant and hemorrhagic activities act in combination triggering local and systemic hemorrhagic disorders, proteolytic activity is due to direct action of proteases (thrombin for example), metalloproteases, and important myotoxic and cytolytic factors, myotoxic action occurs due to the action of phospholipase, generating an inflammatory infiltrate composed of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages around necrotic cells. phospholipases can induce necrosis of skeletal muscle fibers, while the defibrinating action results in blood incoagolability, the venom also has a kininogen-like action, it causes the body to release substances such as bradykinin and kallikrein inducing hypotension, bradykinin-enhancing peptides interfere with the bradykinin metabolism causing it to last longer in the blood, leading to lasting hypotension the venom also has a neurotoxic action, isolated from basic phospholipase, is capable of inducing irreversible blockage of neuromuscular transmission in vitro at as low concentrations as 1 mg / ml.
Species
*) Not including the nominate subspecies.
T) Type species.
Taxonomy
Campbell and Lamar (2004) also recognize a fourth species, L. acrochorda (García, 1896), referring to it as the Chochoan bushmaster. It is found in western Panama and northwestern Colombia and Ecuador. Its evolutionary relationships are not certain, but Lachesis acrochorda is thought to be closer to the South American bushmaster L. muta than to the two Central American species L. stenophrys and L. melanocephala. The snake is known to be one of the deadliest snakes in the world.
Cultural depictions
The bushmaster snake is the antagonist in the tenth show of the old time radio show Escape. The show's title was "A Shipment of Mute Fate", and starred Jack Webb and Raymond Lawrence. It was broadcast on 15 October 1947. The story was also adapted for Suspense starring Jack Kelly, broadcast on January 6, 1957. Jack T. Colton killed a bushmaster in the film Romancing the Stone from 1984 when seeking shelter in a crashed plane.
The following weapons and military vehicles are named after this viper:
M242 Bushmaster, a chain gun manufactured by Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems;
Bushmaster IMV, an Australian infantry mobility vehicle;
A variant of the amphibious Landing Vehicle Tracked introduced in 1944, the LVT-3 Bushmaster.

Sinhakulathipati Papanarya Yatiraj Surendranath Voegeli-Arya was an Indian independence activist from the Madras Presidency.
Early life
Surendranath Arya was born Ethiraj to Dhanakoti Raju Naidu in a Telugu-speaking family of the city of Madras. On completion of his initial education, he got involved in extremist political activities and moved to Bengal in 1897 where he lived until 1906 and formed contacts with Bengali revolutionaries. On his return, he adopted the name "Surendranath" after the Bengali revolutionary Surendranath Banerjee and styled himself "Arya" or "native of India".
Arrest
Once in Madras, he established a close bond with the Tamil revolutionary Subramanya Bharathi and was one of the founders of the Chennai Jana Sangam. He was arrested on 18 August 1908 on charges of sedition and sentenced to transportation for 11 years.
According to the prosecution, Ethiraj is believed to have said on 3 May 1908:
Imprisonment
Surendranath Arya was released from prison in 1914 after six years of rigorous imprisonment in Bellary. During his imprisonment, his health had broken down and he had contacted leprosy. He was treated by Danish Christian missionaries and in gratitude towards them, Arya converted to Christianity.
Arya went to the United States to study divination where he earned Masters of Arts degree from Grove City College in 1917. After he returned to Madras as a missionary of the Danish Mission Church. On returning to India, Arya married a Swedish American woman whose name "Voegeli" he added to his own. Arya was one of the few who attended Bharathy's cremation in 1921 where he delivered an eulogy in Telugu.
Later life
Arya divorced his Swedish American wife and reconverted to Hinduism in the late 1920s. He became a member of the Brahmo Samaj and supported the Self Respect Movement. During this time, he became a close friend of Periyar E. V. Ramasami.
In popular culture
Nizhalgal Ravi played the part of Surendranath Arya in the 2000 Tamil film Bharathi.

Samuel Ichiye Hayakawa (July 18, 1906 – February 27, 1992) was a Canadian-born American academic and politician of Japanese ancestry. A professor of English, he served as president of San Francisco State University and then as U.S. Senator from California from 1977 to 1983.
Early life and education
Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Hayakawa was educated in the public schools of Calgary, Alberta, and Winnipeg, Manitoba, and graduated from the University of Manitoba in 1927. He received his M.A. in English from McGill University in 1928 and his Ph.D. in the discipline from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1935.
Academic career
Professionally, Hayakawa was a linguist, psychologist, semanticist, teacher, and writer. He served as an instructor at the University of Wisconsin from 1936 to 1939 and at the Armour Institute of Technology (Illinois Institute of Technology as of 1940) from 1939 to 1948.
His first book on semantics, Language in Thought and Action, expanded its forerunner (and Book-of-the-Month Club selection) Language in Action, written from 1938 to 1941. With five editions from 1949 to 1991, Language in Thought and Action helped to popularize Alfred Korzybski's general semantics and semantics in general, while semantics or theory of meaning was overwhelmed by mysticism, propagandism and even scientism.
Hayakawa lectured at the University of Chicago from 1950 to 1955. He presented a talk at the 1954 Conference of Activity Vector Analysts at Lake George, New York, in which he discussed a theory of personality from the semantic point of view. It was later published as The Semantic Barrier. The definitive lecture discussed the Darwinism of the "survival of self" as contrasted with the "survival of self-concept." His ideas on general semantics influenced A. E. van Vogt's Null-A novels, The World of Null-A and The Pawns of Null-A. Van Vogt in The World of Null-A (i.e., non-Aristotelian) makes Hayakawa a character, introducing him as: "Professor Hayakawa is today's Mr. Null-A himself, the elected head of the International Society for General Semantics."
Hayakawa was an English professor at San Francisco State College (now San Francisco State University) from 1955 to 1968. In the early 1960s, he helped organize the Anti Digit Dialing League, a San Francisco group that opposed the introduction of all-digit telephone exchange names. Among the students he trained were commune leader Stephen Gaskin and author Gerald Haslam. He was named acting president of San Francisco State College on November 26, 1968, during a student strike, when Ronald Reagan was governor of California and Joseph Alioto was mayor of San Francisco. On July 9, 1969, the California State Colleges Board of Trustees appointed Hayakawa the ninth president of San Francisco State. Hayakawa retired on July 10, 1973.
Hayakawa wrote a column for the Register and Tribune Syndicate from 1970 to 1976. In 1973, Hayakawa changed his political affiliation from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party and became president emeritus at what became San Francisco State University.
Student strike at San Francisco State College
From November 1968 to March 1969, there was a student strike at San Francisco State College in order to establish an ethnic studies program. It was a major news event at the time and chapter in the radical history of the United States and the Bay Area. The strike was led by the Third World Liberation Front supported by Students for a Democratic Society, the Black Panthers and the countercultural community.
The students presented fifteen "non-negotiable demands", including a Black Studies department chaired by sociologist Nathan Hare independent of the university administration, open admission for all black students to "put an end to racism", and the unconditional, immediate end to the War in Vietnam and the university's involvement. It was threatened that if these demands were not immediately and completely satisfied the entire campus was to be forcibly shut down. Hayakawa became popular with conservative voters during this period after he pulled out the wires from the loudspeakers on a protesters' van at an outdoor rally. Hayakawa relented on December 6, 1968, and announced the creation of a Black Studies program at the University.
Political career
Hayakawa won an unexpected victory in the 1976 Republican Senate primary over three better-known career politicians: former HEW Secretary Robert Finch, long-time U.S. Representative Alphonzo Bell and former California Lieutenant Governor John L. Harmer. Much like Jimmy Carter, Hayakawa touted himself as a political outsider.
On the Democratic side, incumbent Senator John Tunney faced a surprisingly strong challenge from another political outsider, Tom Hayden. Hayden's extremely liberal candidacy forced Tunney to run more to the left in the primary, which hurt him in the general election.
Nevertheless, Tunney was favored to easily win re-election. Comfortably ahead in the polls, Tunney did not aggressively campaign until the final weeks before the election. But Hayakawa's position as a political outsider was popular in the wake of the Watergate scandal. In addition, Tunney had a high absenteeism rate while serving in the Senate and missed numerous votes. Hayakawa exploited this with a television ad that showed an empty chair in the U.S. Senate chamber. Hayakawa gradually closed the gap with Tunney, and ultimately defeated him by just over three percentage points.
During his Senate campaign, Hayakawa spoke about the proposal to transfer possession of the Panama Canal and Canal Zone from the United States to Panama. He said, "We should keep the Panama Canal. After all, we stole it fair and square." However, in 1978 he helped win Senate approval of the Torrijos–Carter Treaties, which transferred control of the zone and canal to Panama. He also supported a bill that led to the creation of the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, which examined the causes and effects of the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II. During his time in the Senate, Hayakawa was one of three Japanese Americans in the chamber, the other two being Daniel Inouye and Spark Matsunaga, both of Hawaii.
Hayakawa planned to run for re-election in 1982 but trailed other Republican candidates badly in early polls and was short on money. He dropped out of the race early in the year and was ultimately succeeded by Republican San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson. To date, he is the only Japanese American Republican to have served in the U.S. Senate.
Hayakawa founded the political lobbying organization U.S. English, which is dedicated to making English the official language of the United States. Despite his support for creating the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, Hayakawa, who lived in Chicago as a Canadian citizen during World War II and thus was not subject to confinement, argued that the internment of Japanese Americans was beneficial and that Japanese Americans should not be paid for "fulfilling their obligations" to submit to Executive Order 9066.
Personal life
Hayakawa was a resident of Mill Valley, California, until his death in nearby Greenbrae, in 1992. He had an abiding interest in traditional jazz and wrote extensively on that subject, including several erudite sets of album liner notes. Sometimes in his lectures on semantics, he was joined by the respected traditional jazz pianist Don Ewell, whom Hayakawa employed to demonstrate various points in which he analyzed semantic and musical principles.

In 940 King Otto I gave the Zillis Church to the Bishop of Chur. This gift did not include the church's property, four large farms in Schams and Rheinwald.
In 1473 the Viamala road over the Alps opened, which increased traffic on the Splügen and San Bernardino passes. The villages flourished with this increased trade. In 1530-35 Zillis and Reischen converted during the Protestant Reformation.

The Tethysaurinae are a subfamily of mosasaurs, a diverse group of Late Cretaceous marine squamates. Members of the subfamily are informally and collectively known as "tethysaurines" and have been recovered from North America and Africa. Only two tethysaurine genera are known, Pannoniasaurus and Tethysaurus. The genera Yaguarasaurus and Russellosaurus were previously considered tethysaurines until they were grouped with Romeosaurus in the new subfamily Yaguarasaurinae. A possible member of this clade (subfamily) is a mosasaur specimen known from a maxilla fragment, found in 1960 in the Czech Republic (then Czechoslovakia), in Dolní Újezd near Litomyšl.
Like the closely related yaguarasaurines, all tethysaurines were plesiopedal (meaning primitive and not as well adapted to marine life as later mosasaurs). They generally retained relatively small sizes compared to later giant mosasaurs. The tethysaurines appeared during the Turonian and went extinct in the Santonian, possibly outcompeted by more derived mosasaurs. The etymology of this group derives from the genus Tethysaurus (Tethys from the Greek goddess of the sea and sauros, Greek for "lizard").
Description
Tethysaurines were primitive and comparatively small to medium-sized mosasaurs that lived during the earlier stages of mosasaur evolutionary history. Tethysaurus itself is approximately 3 metres long, whilst Pannoniasaurus might have reached lengths of 6 metres. They had a plesiopedal limb condition, meaning that they were not as well adapted to marine life as later mosasaurs and probably kept to shallow bodies of water. Pannoniasaurus is the only known mosasaur recovered from freshwater deposits.
Makádi et al. (2012) originally diagnosed the Tethysaurinae as all mosasaurs descended from the recentmost common ancestor of Tethysaurus nopscai and Russellosaurus coheni. By this definition, the Yaguarasaurinae would be sunk into this subfamily since Russellosaurus is now considered a yaguarasaurine. Unambiguous character states were listed as follows: "predental rostrum absent; premaxilla-maxilla suture ends anterior to or level with the midline of the fourth maxillary tooth; nearly straight frontoparietal suture; quadrate alar concavity shallow; elongated stapedial pit (at least three times longer than wide); quadrate distal condyle saddle-shaped, upward deflection of quadrate distal condyle absent; mandibular glenoid formed mainly by articular; cervical synapophyses extend below ventral border of centrum; dorsoventrally compressed centra in precaudal vertebrae; two sacrals with large ribs/transverse processes subcircular/oval in cross-section; facet for ilium on tip of sacral transverse processes; very elongated (two times longer than wide) pontosaur-like caudal centra; anteroposteriorly narrow scapula; ilium with posterior iliac process with compressed dorsal end bearing longitudinal grooves and ridges, and spoon-shaped preacetabular process overlapping the pubis".
Phylogeny
The subfamily name is derived from Tethysaurus due to Tethysaurus being the best-represented genus of the subfamily and being known from multiple partial skeletons.
The original definition of the Tethysaurinae was as all mosasaurs descended from the recentmost common ancestor of Tethysaurus nopscai and Russellosaurus coheni. The cladogram below follows Makádi et al. (2012) and the then assumed internal relationships of the Tethysaurinae.
Yaguarasaurus and Russellosaurus are today considered part of the Yaguarasaurinae instead, which is defined as the most recent common ancestor of Russellosaurus, Romeosaurus, and Yaguarasaurus, and all of its descendants.

Robert Jones (born c.1596-died c.1653) was a Welsh landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1625 and 1629.
Jones was the son of Sir William Jones and his wife Margaret Griffith, daughter of Griffith ap John Griffith of Kevenamulch, Caernarvonshire. His father was a judge and MP. Robert himself studied law as a student at Lincoln's Inn in 1617. He married by 1641 Anne West, by whom he had one daughter.
In 1625, Jones was elected Member of Parliament for Carnarvon in place of Edward Littleton, his brother-in-law, who preferred to sit for Leominster. He again replaced Littleton after the 1626 election. In 1628 he was elected MP for Flintshire and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. He held the estate of Castell-March.
A Royalist on the outbreak of the first Civil War, in 1643 he was High Sheriff of Caernarvonshire and magistrate for the county, and governor of Caernarvon Castle from 1643 to 1646. He sought immunity from delinquency proceedings by Parliament by claiming to have been party to the surrender of Beaumaris Castle to Roundhead forces. During the Second Civil War, he was detained by Parliament while he was sued by four merchants for goods seized for the Royalist war effort to damages of £1,730. He was last recorded an apparent debt prisoner at the Marshalsea in 1653, when he petitioned for relief but he apparently died without the case being resolved.

Reception
Critical response
Emanuel Levy, of Variety states in his review: "Set in Bangkok, Natural Causes is a messy, incoherent political thriller about a young American woman who finds herself in the midst of a plot to assassinate former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Pic makes good use of Bangkok's colorful scenery, but its roguish, muddled plot and maladroit, uninvolving direction should take it straight to video domestically, with some possibilities for theatrical release offshore."
Release
Natural Causes was shown at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival on March 5, 1994. It was released direct-to-video in the United States by Columbia TriStar Home Video on November 7, 1995.

William Roark Ratliff (born August 16, 1936), is an American politician and engineer who served as a member of the Texas Senate from 1988 to 2004. Between 2000 and 2003 he served as the 40th lieutenant governor of Texas, after previous Lieutenant Governor Rick Perry replaced George W. Bush, who resigned to become president of the United States.
Early life and education
Ratliff was educated at Sonora High School in Sonora in Sutton County in West Texas and then at the University of Texas at Austin, where he studied civil engineering. Ratliff, along with brothers Shannon and Jack, was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity.
Career
Ratliff worked as a civil engineer for thirty years.
Texas Senate
He was first elected in 1988 as a Republican to the Texas Senate. In 1992, he was appointed chairman of the Senate Education Committee by Lieutenant Governor Bob Bullock. From 1997 to 1998, he served as President Pro Tempore of the Texas Senate.
Ratliff and his wife, the former Sally Sandlin, have three children and eight grandchildren. Son Bennett Ratliff of Coppell, a civil engineer, served nine years as a Coppell ISD School Board Trustee and was elected in 2012 to represent District 115 in the Texas House of Representatives. Another son, Robert Thomas Ratliff (born 1967) of Mt. Pleasant, is the Republican Vice-Chairman of the Texas State Board of Education.
Ratliff announced in 2003 that he would not run for reelection to the State Senate in 2004. Instead he soon resigned the Senate seat and was succeeded in a special election by Republican Kevin Eltife of Tyler. In 2005, Ratliff was awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for "the example he has set of courage and principle in American public life".
Lieutenant governor
In 2000, for the first time in Texas history, the Texas Senate was called upon to choose a new lieutenant governor after the election of George W. Bush as President of the United States and the resultant succession of lieutenant governor Rick Perry to become governor. In accordance with a 1984 amendment to the Texas Constitution of 1876, the Texas Senate chooses one of its own members to fill a vacancy in the position of lieutenant governor.
In the election for lieutenant governor, Ratliff defeated rival David Sibley of Waco. In 2001, Ratliff first announced that he would be a candidate for election to a full four-year term to the office of Lieutenant Governor in the 2002 state elections, and he received the endorsement of several prominent Republican legislators. However, he later withdrew from the race, and the position went to David Dewhurst, the Texas land commissioner.
Political views
Ratliff is regarded as a moderate. He stated in an interview, "I am a Republican because I agree with the Republicans at least 51 percent of the time." He has taken bipartisan stands on a number of issues. While in the Texas Senate, he supported controversial reforms that transferred funds from richer to poorer school districts for more equitable funding. He also argued in favor of "patients' rights" in medical malpractice cases during a debate on tort reform, and in 2003 criticized other members of the State Senate for failing to raise taxes in order to prevent large budget cuts.
In early 2003, Ratliff was the only dissenting member of his party who joined with Democratic state senators in opposing a redistricting proposal of Texas's then thirty-two seats in the United States House of Representatives that he felt would lead to the under-representation of rural voters. In cooperation with ten Democrats, he signed a letter refusing to bring the matter to the Senate floor, which, by virtue of Texas Senate traditions that require a two-thirds vote of those present and voting to allow a bill to be debated, prevented the proposal from being passed.
Eventually a plan suitable to Republicans was enacted in the third of three special legislative sessions called in 2003 by Governor Perry. Under that plan, by 2011, Republicans held twenty-three U.S. House seats from Texas compared to nine for Democrats.

Lips: Number One Hits is a karaoke video game for the Xbox 360 console, and is the follow-up to the 2008 title Lips. Like its predecessor, the game was developed by iNiS and published by Microsoft Game Studios. It was released in 2009 and received generally average reviews. Spin-offs of the game have also been released, including Lips: Deutsche Partyknaller and Lips: Canta en Español.
Lips: Number One Hits features the use of motion-sensitive microphones, which are also compatible with other music video games such as The Beatles: Rock Band. The game is sold separately, and in packages including one or two microphones.
Each copy of Lips: Number One Hits included a redemption code for downloading one of three 5-song track packs for free.
Gameplay
Number One Hits remains with the core of its patched predecessor, while offering some new features:
Scoring has been enhanced to include a streak multiplier, much like Rock Band.
Awardable achievements.
Unlockable clothes and accessories for Xbox Live avatars.
Soundtrack
The Lips: Number One Hits song list consists solely of songs that have reached the number one position on major global charts. In addition to this, players with a Lips save data on their hard drive will be able to select songs from the first game via a hot swapping feature. 40 master tracks are included on disc in Number One Hits. Coldplay's "Viva la Vida" is featured as this game's theme song.
Downloadable content for both games was cross-compatible between both Lips titles. Some Lips DLC didn't carry over Lips: Number One Hits.
Reception
Lips: Number One Hits received "average" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Reviewers noted great improvements in gameplay and scoring, such as the inclusion of avatars throughout the game, but was criticized for long menu load times, disc swapping between Lips titles, and the number of new achievements.
Sequels
Following the release of Lips: Number One Hits, two additional titles were released specifically for European audiences. Lips: Deustche Partyknaller was released October 30, 2009 with 40 popular German language songs. Lips: Canta en Español was released November 13, 2009 with 35 Spanish language tracks.

Whites Butte is a prominence adjacent the course of the Colorado River near the beginning of the Western Grand Canyon, (west terminus of the South Rim). The butte lies at the terminus of Travertine Canyon, the adjacent canyon west of Hermit Canyon. The Boucher Trail which begins at Upper Hermit Canyon, courses the east base of Whites Butte to reach the Tonto Trail-(west), on the Tonto Platform, south side of the Colorado River.
Geology & Biology
The horizontal top of Whites Butte is a large platform of the cliff-forming Redwall Limestone, with vegetation growth. The east flank of the Redwall is slightly arcuate, and the prominence, upon the Redwall Limestone, is also arcuate, with a peak remainder of a pyramid-shaped, sloped Supai Group (4 of 4 geological units). The prominence is a minuscule cliff of Supai Group (unit 2), Manakacha Formation. Slope-forming slopes of Watahomigi Formation are below the high point of cliffs of Manachaka, which protect the slopes, and help form the pyramidal shape of the prominence.

John Oliver Barres ( ; born September 20, 1960) is an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church, who has been serving as the bishop of the Diocese of Rockville Centre in New York State since January 2017. He previously served as bishop of the Diocese of Allentown in Pennsylvania from 2009 to 2017.
Early life and education
The fifth of six children, John Barres was born to Oliver and Marjorie (née Catchpole) Barres in Larchmont, New York. His parents were Brethren ministers who met each other at Yale Divinity School and then converted to Catholicism in 1955. Oliver Barres wrote about their conversion in the book One Shepherd, One Flock. John Barres was baptized by Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen.
John Barres attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, before entering at Princeton University, where he obtained a Bachelor of English Literature degree. He then attended the New York University School of Business Administration, earning a Master of Business Administration degree in management (1984). Barres received a Bachelor of Sacred Theology degree in 1988, and a Licentiate in Systematic Theology from the Catholic University of America, and received his seminary formation at its theological college.
Ordination and ministry
Barres are ordained to the priesthood for the Diocese of Wilmington by Bishop Robert Mulvee on October 21, 1989. He served as an associate pastor at Holy Family Parish in Newark, Delaware, until 1992, and at St. Elizabeth Parish in Wilmington, Delaware, from 1992 to 1996. He went to the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross in Rome, where he earned a Licentiate of Canon Law in 1998 and a Doctor of Spirituality degree in 1999; his thesis was entitled "Jean-Jacques Olier's Priestly Spirituality: Mental Prayer and Virtue as the Foundation for the Direction of Souls."
Upon his return to Delaware in 1999, Barres became vice chancellor for the Diocese of Wilmington. In 2000, he was named chancellor and a chaplain to his holiness. In 2005, Barres was made an honorary prelate of his holiness. He served on various diocesan boards and committees, as well as the Administrative Board of the Maryland Catholic Conference, the board of St. Francis Hospital in Wilmington, and the board of the Cathedral Foundation. In addition to his duties as chancellor, Barres briefly became pastor of Holy Child Parish in Wilmington in May 2009.
Barres is a member of Opus Dei. In addition to his native English, he is fluent in Italian, French, and Spanish.
Bishop of Allentown
On May 27, 2009, Barres was appointed the fourth bishop of the Diocese of Allentown by Pope Benedict XVI, succeeding Bishop Edward Cullen. Barres received his episcopal consecration on July 30, 2009, at the Cathedral of St. Catharine of Siena in Allentown. Cardinal Justin Rigali was the principal consecrator, with Bishop W. Francis Malooly and Bishop Emeritus Michael Saltarelli as principal co-consecrators.
Barres was the first diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Allentown who had not served previously in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. Barres established the Saint Thomas More Society for lawyers and expanded the diocese's Hispanic ministry and evangelization.
Bishop of Rockville Centre
Pope Francis appointed Barres as bishop of the Diocese of Rockville Centre on December 9, 2016. He was installed on January 31, 2017 at the Cathedral of Saint Agnes. In October 2017, Barres announced the creation of the Independent Reconciliation and Compensation Program (IRCP) for survivors of acts of child sexual abuse committed by clergy in the Diocese of Rockville Centre. Barre serves on the Committee on Evangelization and Catechesis of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB). In 2017, Barres created with Telecare, the diocesan television network, a video series targeted to commuters, entitled "The Catholic Spirituality of Commuter Delays."
In August 2018, a Pennsylvania grand jury report criticized Barres for failing to remove a priest from the ministry after credible allegations of sexual misconduct while he was bishop in the Diocese of Allentown. In 2009, the diocese received a report from a man who alleged that Michael Lawrence, a diocese priest, had "fondled his genitals" when he was age 13. Lawrence, who had admitted to sexually abusing a 12-year-old boy in 1982, had previously been sent to a monitored rural facility for sex offenders. In 2002, Lawrence retired from pastoral work. At some point, Barres considered having Lawrence laicized. However, according to a spokesperson for the Diocese of Rockville Centre, Barres finally decided: "... to withdraw the application to remove Lawrence from the clerical state out of concern that if they did, he may leave the supervised, secure facility and re-enter society, where he might be a danger to children. 'Bishop Barres stands by his decision'".A second case mentioned in the Pennsylvania grand jury report involved Thomas J. Benestad, a monsignor in the Diocese of Allentown. A 2011 accusation stated that Benestad forced a boy in the 1980's to perform oral sex on him, then later he performed oral sex on the boy. According to the grand jury report "... the Diocese reported the allegation to the Northampton County District Attorney's office, which ... found the victim's allegations to be credible." No charges were filed because the statute of limitations had expired. A response from Barres to the grand jury report regarding the handling of the Lawrence and Benestad cases was posted online.

The 1901 VFL season was the fifth season of the Victorian Football League (VFL), the highest level senior Australian rules football competition in Victoria. The season featured eight clubs, ran from 4 May until 7 September, and comprised a 17-game home-and-away season followed by a finals series featuring the top four clubs.
The premiership was won by the Essendon Football Club for the second time, after it defeated by 27 points in the 1901 VFL Grand Final.
Premiership season
In 1901, the VFL competition consisted of eight teams of 18 on-the-field players each, with no "reserves", although any of the 18 players who had left the playing field for any reason could later resume their place on the field at any time during the match.
Each team played each other twice in a home-and-away season of 14 rounds. Then, based on ladder positions after those 14 rounds, three further 'sectional rounds' were played, with the teams ranked 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th playing in one section and the teams ranked 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th playing in the other.
Once the 17 rounds of the home-and-away season had finished, the 1901 VFL Premiers were determined by the specific format and conventions of the original Argus system.

The 1901 VFL Premiership team was Essendon.
The VFL's leading goalkicker was Fred Hiskins of Essendon with 34 goals.
St. Kilda took the "wooden spoon" in 1901.
Notable events
Fitzroy lodged an official protest against the result of the Second Semi-Final, which it lost against Essendon by one point, alleging that the goal umpire had erred in awarding Essendon's first goal because the ball had hit the post. Later in the week, Fitzroy withdrew its protest against the result, and the scheduling of the Final was not affected; an inquiry later in September found that the goal umpire had made a mistake, but no change was made to the score after the finding.
Against South Melbourne in Round 6, Essendon kicked 17 behinds between its first and second goals. Only Geelong against St. Kilda in 1919 and St. Kilda against Fitzroy in 1921 have beaten this unwanted record. Fred Hiskins kicked ten behinds.
In the last home-and-away match between South Melbourne and Geelong, field umpire Henry "Ivo" Crapp experiments with clearly calling out his decisions.
In Essendon's "Grand Final" victory against Collingwood, Albert Thurgood kicks three of Essendon's six goals. One of his goals was scored with an 86-yard (79 m.) drop-kick, and another (measured immediately after the match) was scored with a 93-yard (85 m.) place-kick into a strong headwind.
VFL instituted the original Argus system to determine the season's premiers.

VFL season
The 1948–49 season was the 50th completed season of The Football League.
Final league tables
Beginning with the season 1894–95, clubs finishing level on points were separated according to goal average (goals scored divided by goals conceded), or more properly put, goal ratio. In case one or more teams had the same goal difference, this system favoured those teams who had scored fewer goals. The goal average system was eventually scrapped beginning with the 1976–77 season.
From the 1922–23 season, the bottom two teams of both Third Division North and Third Division South were required to apply for re-election.
First Division
Portsmouth, the 1939 FA Cup winners, won their second major trophy by finishing as champions of the First Division, five points ahead of their nearest challengers Manchester United and Derby County.
The relegation battle was tighter than those of the previous two seasons. Sheffield United and Preston North End finished the season in the bottom two places, a single point behind Huddersfield Town and Middlesbrough. A mere five points separated the bottom 10 teams in the final table.

Daiichi-Kashima Seamount is a guyot in the Pacific Ocean off Japan. It is about high and reaches a depth of . Daiichi-Kashima formed during the Barremian as a result of volcanic activity; during the Albian reefs formed on the seamount and generated a limestone cap. The seamount later.
The seamount has been approaching the Japan Trench and a noticeable vertical offset of about between the eastern and western halves of Daiichi-Kashima appears to be the result of normal faulting as the seamount enters the trench, with the western half dropping down; it may also reflect a past sector collapse when the volcano was still active.
Geography and geology
Regional
The Daiichi-Kashima seamount lies east of Cape Inubō and Chōshi off the eastern coast of Honshu, Japan. Other seamounts in the area are Katori Seamount northeast of Daiichi-Kashima and Daini-Kashima Seamount east of Katori Seamount and the Kashima Fracture Zone ends southeast of the seamount.
Local
Daiichi-Kashima is a high and wide guyot and rises to a depth of . On the eastern part of the volcano lies an at least thick platform of clay and reef limestone with traces of past barrier reefs at its margins. The summit platform of Daiichi-Kashima covers an area of .
It is cut by several normal faults that run approximately parallel to the trench and have an offset of about in the central sector of the volcano; the carbonate platform is also offset in such a manner by a normal fault represented by a scarp into a lower western and a higher eastern part. This fault, which appears to be split in two or three subsidiary faults separated by grabens, extends past the Daiichi-Kashima seamount and covers a length of ; evidently Daiichi-Kashima has been split in half by the fault, which is much younger than the ocean floor and moved at a rate of but does not appear to be presently active in light of the sediment cover on the scarp. Aside from a normal motion, the western half of the seamount has also been moved away from the eastern half and is tilted west.
The seamount appears to be part of a seamount chain called Joban Seamount Chain or Kashima-Ryofu No.1 that formed during the Cretaceous in the Equatorial Pacific and about 30° south of their present-day position. Based on isotope ratios it was once inferred that Daiichi-Kashima consists of two separate volcanoes but a later theory indicates that these are two separate stages of the same volcano.
Relation to the Japan Trench
Daiichi-Kashima lies south of the Japan Trench on a seafloor of Valanginian age, very close to the trench. The Pacific Plate is subducting beneath Japan at a rate of and close to the Daiichi-Kashima Seamount lies the Boso Triple Junction between the Japan Trench, the Sagami Trench and the Izu–Bonin Trench. The subduction process may cause the downgoing oceanic plate to buckle and form normal faults that run parallel to the trench.
Since about 100,000 years, the western half of Daiichi-Kashima is being subducted in the Japan Trench and about one third to one quarter of the seamount has been subducted already. Part of the landward margin of the trench close to Daiichi-Kashima is uplifted, perhaps as a consequence of the subduction of the seamount, and there is periodic earthquake activity in front of Daiichi-Kashima seamount with magnitude 7 earthquakes about every 20 years. The seamount might also influence the segmentation of the trench and its earthquakes, considering that the rupture of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake spanned the trench length between Erimo Seamount and Daiichi-Kashima. The other seamounts in the area will likely be subducted after Daiichi-Kashima has been.
Composition
Volcanic rocks from Daiichi-Kashima include basanite, benmoreite and mugearite. There is a distinction between the eastern and western sectors of the volcano, with the western one consisting mainly of mugearite. Phenocrysts identified in sampled rocks include aegirine–augite, alkali feldspar, amphibole, chromium spinel, clinopyroxene, magnetite, olivine and plagioclase.
Dredging has found limestones on Daiichi-Kashima which have been subdivided into an upper and a lower formation. Especially on its western part ferromanganese crusts and phosphorites have been encountered as well. Other rocks are rudistid-coral floatstones, oolithic grainstones and peloidal wackestones containing algal pisolites and other algal remnants. Other fossils include bivalves, corals, echinoids, foraminifers and stromatoporoidea. The rudist Praecaprotina kashimae is named after the seamount.
Geological history
The volcano is of Barremian age, the limestones are of Aptian to Albian age. Magnetic traits in the seamount suggest that it formed 140–120 million years ago close to a spreading center, which is older than the age of 100 million years inferred from fossils but comparable to ages inferred from radiometric dating. Radiometric dating has yielded ages of 120.4 ± 2.7 million years ago for the eastern and of 117.8 ± 8.4 million years ago for the western side of the seamount. The seamount is thus considered to be 120–100 million years old, while the underlying crust is about 20 million years older. At the time of its formation, Daiichi-Kashima was located between 7.6° northern and 1° southern latitude, with one proposed coordinate being .
One proposal envisages that volcanism took place in two separate stages, between which the western flank of the volcano underwent a large-scale collapse. In the first stage, basalts formed a volcanic island that eventually erupted trachytes. In a second stage, the western flank of the volcano collapsed and subsequently chemically different lavas and pyroclastics were emplaced, covering the bulk of the volcano and giving it a paired appearance similar to Reunion.
During the Albian erosion and subsidence levelled the volcano, forming a flat surface. A carbonate platform developed on this surface first with fringing reefs and then with barrier reefs. The carbonate platform continued to be active for 10 million years. A research group of the Tokai University after studying dredged samples proposed that the limestones west and east of the central scarp are of different ages and developed at different sea levels: The western part would be of Barremian age and the eastern one of Albian age. This would explain why they lie at distinct depths.
After its drowning, Daiichi-Kashima continued to subside until it arrived at the Japan Trench between 250,000 and 150,000 years ago. The buckling of the ocean crust as it approached the trench induced faulting across Daiichi-Kashima and eventually another collapse of the western flank took place.

Battle Born is the fourth studio album by American rock band the Killers. It was released in the United Kingdom on September 17, 2012, by Vertigo Records and in the United States the following day by Island Records. The phrase "Battle Born" appears on the state flag of Nevada and is the name of the recording studio owned by the band, where the majority of the album was recorded.
Recorded following an extended hiatus, the band worked with five producers during the recording of the album: Steve Lillywhite, Damian Taylor, Brendan O'Brien, Stuart Price, and Daniel Lanois.
Background and recording
Following the completion of the band's Day & Age World Tour in January 2010, the Killers announced that the band would be entering an extended hiatus. During this time, frontman Brandon Flowers and bassist Mark Stoermer released solo albums, Flamingo (2010) and Another Life (2011), respectively, while drummer Ronnie Vannucci Jr. released a studio album with his side-project, Big Talk, and recorded with Mt. Desolation. Regarding the band's hiatus, Flowers noted, "Dave needed to see his kid and rest up. That was just how it worked. And so we ended up going off and doing solo things, and spending our time that way, and that was good, too. It was a good experience. It definitely taught us different ways of thinking about music."
In October 2011, the band ended its hiatus to begin work on a fourth studio album. Initial sessions were strained, with Flowers noting that the band members spent "about a week just eyeballing each other in a room." The composition of the album's first single, "Runaways", marked a turning point in their reunion, with Flowers noting: "That and 'Miss Atomic Bomb' were the backbone of this record. They made me feel we were on the right track."
Working at their Las Vegas studio, Battle Born, the band worked with producers Steve Lillywhite, Damian Taylor, Brendan O'Brien, Stuart Price, and Daniel Lanois. Initially, the band had wanted to work with just one, but scheduling difficulties led to the need for multiple producers.
The album was partially mixed by Alan Moulder, who also worked on the band's first two albums.
Release
On June 7, 2012, the Killers released a trailer for Battle Born. The track listing was announced on August 16. The album's first single was "Runaways", which received its first radio play on July 10. The single was leaked on Tumblr only hours before its official radio preview. Battle Born was released on September 17, 2012, in the United Kingdom and on September 18 in the United States. A week later, on September 25, the album was released as a vinyl disc.
Critical reception
Battle Born received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 64, based on 27 reviews.
Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly wrote:
The Killers themselves have always gone for the gold, boldly aiming to fill exotic stadiums with full-throated anthems about big ideas. Like the band's previous output, Battle Born only knows how to be epic: Opener "Flesh and Bone" begins as a glitchy Soft Cell throwback before rapidly expanding into a glorious fireworks-and-brimstone sermon, while "Miss Atomic Bomb" drives into the desert sunset in a convertible fueled by echoey guitars and glistening-eyed nostalgia. These are big songs, determined to deliver photo-finish climaxes every few seconds.
The Guardians Kate Mossman gave the album three out of five stars, saying:
With stagey soundscapes more Meat Loaf than Springsteen, and lines overloaded with postcard imagery ("Your star-spangled heart took a train for the coast"), you struggle to find the energy till the third or fourth listen, when "Heart of a Girl" (co-written with Daniel Lanois) and "From Here on Out" (which sounds just like the Eagles) reveal themselves to be the sweetest, most sincere explorations of a kind of US rock that will always raise hairs on the necks of those who like this sort of thing.
Accolades
Battle Born was voted the second Best Album of 2012 by the readers of Rolling Stone magazine. Fuse's staff listed it as the 23rd Best Album of 2012.
Commercial performance
Battle Born debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200, selling 113,000 copies in its opening week. , it had sold 344,158 copies in the United States. The album debuted atop the UK Albums Chart with first-week sales of 93,989 copies—at that point the third highest opening tally of 2012—becoming the band's fourth consecutive number-one studio album in the United Kingdom. It had sold 371,000 copies in the United Kingdom . Battle Born also debuted at number three on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 12,000 copies. The album reached the top 10 in 20 countries and became the 45th best-selling album worldwide of 2012, with sales of one million copies by the end of 2012.

Rauf Arifoghlu (born July 23, 1966, Yuxarı Öysüzlü, Tovuz District) is an Azerbaijani journalist. He is the founder and head of the Yeni Musavat Media Group. In 1988, he joined the national liberation movement. In 1989, he unofficially published “Birlik Magazine”. In 1989, he founded the “Yeni Musavat” (New Equality) newspaper. At the same time, he founded the Azerbaijan National Democratic New Musavat Party (ANDNMP). In 1992, he and several members of the Popular Front of Azerbaijan re-established the Musavat Party (Equality Party), and AMDNMP joined Musavat. At different times he was a member of the Divan (Supreme body) of Musavat, and deputy chairman. He resigned from the membership of the party on July 15, 2015.
Rauf Arifoğlu was a candidate for the parliamentary elections several times. He was imprisoned several times for his political activities. And he was recognized as a political prisoner by many international organizations. His last parliamentary candidacy was controversial. All Azerbaijani media wrote about this right. The election in that region was cancelled.
Life
Rauf Arif oghlu Abbasov was born on July 23, 1966 in Yuxarı Öysüzlü village of Tovuz District. In 1983, he graduated from the high school of this village. In 1983-1988 he graduated from the Azerbaijan Institute of Technology majoring in engineering technologist, and in 1994-1996 he graduated from the Faculty of World Politics and Economics of Western University majoring in political science.
Socio-political activity
Rauf Arifoghlu joined the Azerbaijan National Freedom Movement in 1988. In late 1989, he unofficially published “Birlik Magazine”. On November 10, 1989, he founded the “Yeni Musavat” newspaper. At the same time, he was one of the five founders of the Azerbaijan National Democratic New Musavat Party (AMDP "New Musavat"), the organization's secretary for ideological issues. The Central Office of the Party and the secret editorial office of the "Yeni Musavat" newspaper were moved to Ganja from December 1989 to the end of 1991. At that time, people's resistance groups were fighting against the Armenian-Russian saboteurs around Ganja, specifically in Chaykand village in the territory of Khanlar District (now Goygol). The first volunteer armed group of "New Musavat" was formed with the close participation of Rauf Arifoghlu. The group was headed by Safar Humbatov, a veteran of the Afghan war and a refugee from Western Azerbaijan. In one of the battles in which the group participated, on January 12, 1990, members of the AMDP "New Musavat" Bakhtiyar Aliyev, Ruzigar Gasimov, Abbasgulu Mammadov, Neman Valiyev and others were killed in the direction of Chaykand-Todan. The youth gathered around Rauf Arifoghlu and the "Yeni Musavat" newspaper and his party played an important role in organizing the protection and defense of the western regions of Azerbaijan.
In December 1991, the "Yeni Musavat" newspaper was officially registered. Since then, the newspaper's editorial office has been moved to Baku, to the headquarters of the Popular Front of Azerbaijan in the "Sahil baghi". At that time, the chairman of the Popular Front of Azerbaijan, Abulfaz Elchibey, allocated two rooms in the building of the organization for the establishment of the first editorial office of the newspaper.
As a result of Arifoghlu's close relations and talks with Elchibay, in January 1992, several people in the leadership of the Popular Front of Azerbaijan left the organization with the blessing of Elchibay and deputy Isa Gambarov (Isa Gambar) and formed a joint commission to restore the Musavat Party. The Rehabilitation Bureau was established, consisting of 5 people from "New Musavat" and 5 people from the Popular Front of Azerbaijan, and then its membership was expanded with the participation of the National Center in Ankara. As a result, in June 1992, the Musavat Party was officially returned to Azerbaijan, restored and became a partner in power. Rauf Arifoghlu was elected press and information secretary of this historic organization at the Restoration Congress. At the same time, he was one of the seven members of the Executive Committee of the Popular Front of Azerbaijan, the head of the Press and Information Department of the Popular Front of Azerbaijan. R. Arifoghlu, one of President Elchibay's most trusted sources of information, also founded the organization's new newspaper, “Jumhuriyat”, in January 1993. "Yeni Turan" newspaper and "Dunya" magazine are among the media organizations established by R. Arifoghlu at that time. He was the leader of the Musavat Party until 2006. Since 2006, the press has focused more on activity. In February 2009, he removed his newspaper from Musavat's headquarters and opened a new editorial office, and its main press success began after that date. The newspaper's independence allowed him to normalize relations with the government.
He turned the electronic supplement of the “Yeni Musavat” newspaper into an independent information portal called Musavat.com, and then, in 2013, created a new media brand. He founded the Russian-language website Minval.az and its editorial office, and today the "Minval" brand successfully operates as an information agency providing news services in both Russian and Azerbaijani languages. He also has serious success in building social media segments of the "Yeni Musavat" and "Minval" brands.
One of his latest successes is the establishment of an internet television called Musavat TV and its transformation into a powerful platform.
At present, Yeni Musavat Media Group has 1 newspaper, 5 websites, 1 TV (200,000 subscriptions), 3 large Facebook pages, 2 Instagram and 2 Telegram pages on the YouTube platform. All this is managed by a mobile team of 60 people.
Rauf Arifoghlu has been in politics for 33 years; At the same time, it has been operating continuously in the media sector for 32 years.

Bryan Alexander Green (born 30 June 1957) is a former Australian politician. He was the leader of the parliamentary Labor Party in Tasmania from 2014 to 2017, and a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly in the electorate of Braddon from 1998 to 2017.
Early life
A native of New South Wales, Green was born in Wollongong. His family later moved to George Town, Tasmania and then to Burnie, Tasmania, where he attended Burnie High School and Burnie Technical College.
From 1974 to 1993, he worked as a machinist for the Burnie mills of Australian Paper. He then spent three years as an electorate officer for Senator Kay Denman, and then several years as a state organiser for the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union (AMWU).
Political career
Green entered the Tasmanian parliament at the 1998 election. He was appointed to the ministerial portfolio of Primary Industries, Water and Environment in 2002. Following a reshuffle precipitated by the resignation of Premier Jim Bacon due to ill-health, Green was promoted to Minister of Infrastructure, Energy and Resources in 2004.
As Minister for Primary Industries, Water and Environment, Green was responsible for obtaining Parliamentary support for construction of the Meander Dam, a major water project that was opposed by conservationists. As Transport Minister he proposed lowering the states speed limits on rural roads from 100 km/h to 90 km/h, a proposition that was met with somewhat of a backlash. Green later was appointed as the chairman of the Tasmanian Road Safety Council. He was the key negotiator with freight rail company Pacific National, which in September 2005 threatened to 'pull out' of intermodal operations in the State, forcing all containerised and coal rail freight onto the road. While Green initially showed little sign of weakness stating 'Tasmania will not be held at mercy to profitable companies' he later backed down and agreed to a $120 million rescue package ($80 million funded by the Australian federal government) to the company.
Other political achievements by Green included restructuring Tasmania's four port companies into a single entity, supporting a wide-ranging review into public passenger transport services, and increasing transparency in the forestry sector, through changes to Freedom of Information laws and by supporting the role of the Forest Practices Authority. There has long been speculation, mostly arising from the Opposition, that Green has a strong ambition to become Premier.
David Bartlett quit the Premiership in 2011, and when Lara Giddings succeeded Bartlett, Green once again became Deputy Premier. In March 2014, following the resignation of Giddings (who had been defeated by Will Hodgman in the state election), Green was elected Labor leader in Tasmania after gaining unanimous support from colleagues, with Michelle O'Byrne as his deputy. As Green was Giddings' deputy prior to his elevation as leader, this marked the fourth time in a row that the Tasmanian ALP leader had been succeeded by his or her deputy.
On the morning of 17 March 2017, Green told a party meeting that he was retiring from politics. This came amid speculation that party insiders were pressuring Giddings to leave politics and clear the way for trade unionist and former cabinet minister David O'Byrne to return to the legislature and take the leadership. Shadow health minister Rebecca White was elected unopposed to replace him, and Green's seat in Braddon was filled by a recount. He was the first Tasmanian Labor leader in decades not to take the party into an election.
TCC Scandal
On 14 July 2006 Green resigned from all leadership and frontbench positions following an enquiry by Auditor-General Mike Blake. This enquiry examined Green's 15 February deal with Tasmanian Compliance Corporation. The suspect deal promised the TCC company, part-owned by two former Labor ministers (John White and Glen Milliner), a three-year exclusive business monopoly from the Government or $2.5 million compensation.
Premier Paul Lennon sought the resignation; he called in the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide whether Green broke the law in signing the secret deal. The Premier made the decision after discussions with the Solicitor-General, Bill Bale, who advised that the DPP should consider whether the deal breached the criminal code. The offence carries a jail term of up to 21 years.
On 25 October 2006, Green appeared in court in relation to this matter charged with conspiracy and attempting to interfere with an executive officer and was represented by Stephen Estcourt. One of Green's advisers, Guy Nicholson, was also charged with conspiracy. TCC director John White was originally charged on both counts. All conspiracy charges were later dropped by the DPP. White pleaded guilty to the charge of attempting to interfere with an executive officer, however no conviction was recorded.
Green faced trial in December 2007 which ended in a hung jury. A 2008 retrial also ended in a hung jury, with the DPP subsequently dropping the charges.

In 1689, the year of his death, he put together a collection entitled Poems and Translations which contains 33 poems with male-male subject matter, eleven regarding women, and 13 to a mistress named 'Idera' (considered probably imaginary). A number of the homoerotic poems have been rewritten to remove the same-sex subject matter.
Goodall's father—Dr. Charles Goodall—was a London physician.

Matthew "Matt" Porterfield (born October 6, 1977) is an American independent filmmaker. He has made four feature films to date, Hamilton (2006), Putty Hill (2011), I Used to Be Darker (2013) and Sollers Point (2017). Putty Hill and I Used to Be Darker had their international premieres at the Berlin International Film Festival. All of his features have had their local premieres at the Maryland Film Festival.
Life and career
Porterfield was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and had formal training at the Tisch School of the Arts, New York University. He teaches screenwriting and production in the Film and Media Studies Program at Johns Hopkins University.
His low-budget debut feature, Hamilton, made on 16 mm film with a cast of non-professional actors from Baltimore, proved a "minor miracle", wrote Richard Brody in The New Yorker. The magazine went on to tag the film as "the most original, moving and an accomplished American independent film in recent years".
Considered a sleeper hit, Porterfield's Putty Hill again reverted to his hometown as the film revolves around a small working class community in Baltimore city. The film was critically acclaimed for combining documentary and narrative traditions into a lyrical study of memory and loss. It was featured in the 2013 Whitney Biennial.
His 2013 feature, I Used to Be Darker, conceived as a melodrama, showcased his ability to bring "melancholic tones" to life on the celluloid. The screenplay was co-written by Amy Belk and starred musicians Ned Oldham and Kim Taylor alongside newcomers Hannah Gross and Deragh Campbell. It premiered at The 2013 Sundance Film Festival and was released commercially in the United States, France, Germany, Austria, and South Korea.
Porterfield made his first narrative short, Take What You Can Carry, in Berlin in the summer of 2014. It premiered in the Berlinale Shorts Competition in 2015.
His next feature film, Sollers Point, premiered at San Sebastián International Film Festival in 2017.

Dimensions & Extensions is an album by American saxophonist Sam Rivers recorded in 1967 but not released on the Blue Note label until 1986 with the original catalogue number and the intended cover artwork. It was originally scheduled for issue in 1967, but held back from release until 1975, when the tracks appeared as part of the double LP set, Involution (1976, BN-LA 453-H2), which combined them with tracks recorded under Andrew Hill's leadership that would eventually see release as Change.
Reception
The Allmusic review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine awarded the album 5 stars and stated "With music as risky at this, it's forgivable that it occasionally meanders (especially on the slower numbers) but, overall, Dimensions and Extensions offers more proof that Sam Rivers was one of the early giants of the avant-garde".

I Love a Man in Uniform is a 1993 Canadian film, written and directed by David Wellington. It received a score of 60% on Rotten Tomatoes.
Plot
I Love a Man in Uniform is a dark psychological drama, starring Tom McCamus as Henry Adler, a bank employee and struggling actor who finally gets his big break when he is cast as a police officer in a television series. When Adler is finally cast in his role as Flanagan on the cop show Crimewave, Adler quits his job as a bank employee and immerses himself into his role. As Adler begins to commit further to his role as Flanagan, he begins to identify too closely with the sense of power and authority that comes with wearing the police uniform.
Adler takes to wearing the police uniform from the set in public, as if he were a real police officer, and gradually loses his grip on reality. He begins to roam the streets of Toronto, acting as though he is a police officer and interacting with citizens as if he is a police officer. This leads to Adler getting in trouble with his boss, who is not impressed that Adler is pretending he is a cop off set, however, this does not bother Adler. He blurs the line between fantasy and reality as he slips further into his fictional reality.
While on the set of Crimewave, Adler falls for one of the female actresses on the show, Charlie Warner, who is played by Brigitte Bako. They begin to rehearse their roles together offset, however, Charlie is quickly put off by Adler's quirks and his intensity and cuts Adler off. This sends Adler spiralling, causing him to become sporadic with his actions.

Arion is a French record company and label founded in 1962 by Ariane Segal. The label takes its name from the ancient Greek poet and lyre-player, Arion. In the 1960s and 1970s Arion was seen as one of the most adventurous and innovative independent labels in France with an eclectic catalogue ranging from classical music to ethnic music to jazz. Its strengths were, and remain, rarely performed classical works and ethnic music.
History
In 1962 Ariane Segal, who had been working as a producer for the French division of Ricordi, left the firm with her entire team, including her sound engineer Claude Morel. She established a new independent label, Arion, serving as its president and managing director, while Morel served as the label's artistic director. By 1967 when Arion signed a US distribution deal with CBS, its recordings had already received prizes from the Académie Charles Cros and the Académie du disque français. While most single LPs produced in France during the 1960s and 70s were packaged in sleeves, Arion's records were presented in books with copious liner notes, most of which were written by Segal herself.
With the arrival of the compact disc, Arion, with its large catalogue of vinyl records, lacked the financial resources to convert to the new medium. Rather than selling the company to one of her rivals, Segal sold it to the Italian firm Ducale, who had distributed the Arion label in Italy and had begun buying stock in Arion in 1984. Ducale's owner, David Matalon, took over as president of Arion in 1985. His daughter Manuela Matalon Ostrolenk became the managing director, while Segal stayed on as head of A&R for the label's classical division. Shortly after Matalon's takeover, Arion announced plans for its first four releases on compact disc. These included Les flutes de terres Incas performed by the Andean music ensemble and Guillaume Bouzignac's Motets et scènes sacrées.
In the ensuing years Arion gradually re-released the recordings in its vinyl catalogue on CD as well as continuing to produce new CD recordings and in 1997 acquired the Pierre Verany label. As of 2015 Manuela Ostrolenk serves as both president and CEO of Arion. Ariane Segal, who was described by one of her colleagues at Ricordi as "a remarkable woman, way ahead of her time", died in 2011 at the age of 93.
Repertoire
Although from its inception Arion produced recordings in a range of genres, including jazz, dance, and film soundtracks, its core repertoire has been classical and ethnic music from around the world, including the traditional folk music of France. Between 1974 and 1984, Arion produced over 30 LP recordings of ethnic music for the French organization , many of which have subsequently been re-released on CD by the organization's own label. In the classical repertoire, Arion was known for championing composers who had fallen into obscurity such as Hyacinthe Jadin and contemporary composers such as Maurice Ohana as well as the forgotten works of established composers. An example of the latter was their 1993 recording of Daniel Auber's opera Gustave III, ou Le bal masqué, composed thirty-five years prior to Verdi's more famous setting, Un ballo in maschera. Under Ariane Segal, Arion also recorded 40 LPs of music by women composers, including that of the medieval troubador Beatritz de Dia. Amongst the label's larger-scale classical music projects were Bach's complete Well-Tempered Clavier recorded between 1972 and 1975 by organist Louis Thiry (ARN 468306) and the complete piano works of Emmanuel Chabrier recorded by Alexandre Tharaud in 1998 (ARN 368722).

Py Marie Elisabet Ulrika Bäckman Wennborn (born 5 July 1948, Stockholm) is a Swedish musician. She is a singer and songwriter of pop and rock for musicals and films. She also plays piano and harmonica.
Career
Bäckman grew up in Iggesund (Gävleborg County) and started her career at nine years old when she was discovered by a touring radio show. After that, she was called up by the Swedish TV show host, Lennart Hyland, and came down to Stockholm, where she made her TV debut in 1957. After the television appearance, she toured around and sang songs in various public parks. As a teenager, she thought it was frivolous singing pop music and began instead with rock music.
In 1973, she began touring across Europe as a lead singer with Sweden's girl rock group NQB. During the late 1970s and 1980s, she worked a lot with her former partner Dan Hylander. The couple shared the backing band Raj Montana Band, with whom she had a breakthrough album, Sista Föreställningen. After the split in 1985, she continued as a solo performer. During her solo career, she has, among other things, worked with producers such as Clarence Öfwerman (former member of the Raj Montana Band and later producer of Roxette), Mats Wester and Micke Wennborn.
In addition to her solo career, Bäckman has also been very active as a songwriter for others and has worked with numerous artists. For example, she wrote "Stad i ljus", sung by Tommy Körberg, which won the Swedish preselection for Eurovision Song Contest 1988, and since 2006, is also a Swedish hymn. In 1993, she began her collaboration with Mats Wester and created the successful Swedish folk music group Nordman. Bäckman was the group's lyricist from the very beginning until 1998, when the group split. Upon reunification in 2005, she declined to continue working with the band, and was replaced by another songwriter.
Bäckman also wrote the text to the Swedish big hit "Gabriellas sång" ("Gabriella's song") in the 2004 Kay Pollak film As It Is in Heaven. Stefan Nilsson wrote the music to the song. She has also translated musicals such as Chicago, Evita, and Garbo. In 2004, Bäckman wrote new hymns, an addition to the Swedish hymn book on behalf of the Swedish Church. She also toured Sweden and Finland for some time with the jazz legend Jukka Tolonen.
In 2010, Bäckman participated once again in the Swedish preselection for Eurovision Song Contest with the song "Magic Star" (Swedish: "Magisk Stjärna"), which she wrote together with Micke Wennborn. She was noted for being the only person playing an actual instrument (the harmonica) live on stage in the Swedish pre selection since 1999, and also for being the only Swedish artist participating in the Swedish pre selection for five decades in a row.
In March, the double album P20Y10 was released, and was Bäckman's ninth studio album. It was produced by Micke Wennborn, who was also included as a guitar player in the band, together with David Garfield on keyboards, Leland Sklar on bass, and John "JR" Robinson on drums and percussion. P20Y10 was recorded in Castle Oaks, Los Angeles, and engineered by Steve Sykes.

Heinrich Suter (4 January 1848 in Hedingen – 17 March 1922 in Dornach) was a historian of science specializing in Islamic mathematics and astronomy.
Education and career
After graduation from the Industrie Schule at Zürich, Suter studied in Berlin (1869/70) and at ETH Zürich and the University of Zürich. He received in 1871 from the University of Zürich his Promovierung (Ph.D.) with dissertation Geschichte der mathematischen Wissenschaften von den ältesten Zeiten bis Ende des 16. Jahrhunderts. His dissertation was published in 1872 as a book and was subsequently translated into Russian.
In 1874 Suter began teaching as a vicar at the Gymnasium in Schaffhausen, then taught from 1876 to 1886 in Aarau, and finally from 1886 until his retirement in 1916 in Zürich.
Suter in his early forties learned Arabic and acquired some knowledge of Syriac, Persian and Turkish. He studied the history of mathematics and astronomy in the Islamic societies. In Moritz Cantor's "Abhandlungen zur Geschichte der Mathematik“ were published in 1892 Suter's translation of the mathematically related entries in the Kitāb al-Fihrist of Ibn al-Nadim and in 1893 Suter's translation of the mathematical parts of the catalog of the Khedivial Library in Cairo. One of his most important works is his work, commissioned by the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences, on the astronomical tables of Al-Khwarizmi.

Shitim () is a community settlement in southern Israel. Located in the Arabah valley, it falls under the jurisdiction of Hevel Eilot Regional Council. In it had a population of .
History
The village was established in 1984 as a Nahal settlement, with soldiers often living at the site following the end of a combat role and working in nearby kibbutzim. In the early 1990s, the nearby army base was taken over by a different battalion, which largely operated in the West Bank. This caused disruption in the day-to-day agricultural activities of the village and it was abandoned by the IDF in 1997, with the site given to kibbutz Ketura. Attempts to establish a civilian village at the site failed and the settlement was dismantled.
In 2002 a group of followers of Rajneesh founded a guesthouse on the site under the name 'Ashram BaMidbar' (Ashram in the Desert), with people working at the guesthouse re-establishing the village.

The Porsche Supercup (officially known as Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup, known as Porsche Michelin Supercup prior to 2007) is an international one-make sports car racing series supporting the FIA Formula One World Championship organized by Porsche Motorsport GmbH.
Porsche Supercup drivers compete in identical Porsche 911 GT3 Cup cars. On average, 24 race cars take part in each race. Most circuits visited by the series are European, although circuits in Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, the United States and Mexico have been included in the calendar as well.
History
Since 1993 the Porsche Michelin Supercup has run as support to the FIA Formula One World Championship. The number of races has grown from the original nine to total 13 in 2006, although decreasing to 11 in 2017 and eight in 2020.
Regulations
Two sets of slick tyres may be used per car each weekend. The number of wet tyres is unlimited. The tyres are identical for all competitors and are not permitted to be pre-warmed or chemically treated.
The in-race pit stop is also allowed if in case of force majeure like tyre puncture, body damage, weather conditions changing and others but in-race pit stop is not mandatory due to shorter race duration and also refuelling is not permitted during race only.
Racing flags
These are the racing flags that usually used in every Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup race weekends:
Racing cars
Chassis
Porsche Supercup cars adhere to a rear-engined rear-wheel-drive design. A roll cage serves as a carbon-fibre space frame chassis and is covered by a multiple-gauge sheet metal body. They have a closed cockpit, fenders, a rear wing, and an aerodynamic splitter. Each team may purchase cars and engines from other teams.
The car has a front MacPherson strut suspension, and a rear Multi-link suspension. Brake discs must be made of steel and may not exceed diameter. The only aerodynamic components on the vehicles are the front splitter, rear wing, solid polycarbonate glass window in the windows only, and side skirts. The use of rear diffusers, vortex generators, canards, wheel well vents, hood vents, and undertrays are prohibited.
Porsche Supercup cars are required to have at least 1 working windshield wiper installed on the car for all tracks as a part of the road racing rules package.
Evolution of Porsche Supercup cars

911 GT3 Cup (Type 991)
Based on the Porsche 911 GT3 type 991, this 911 GT3 Cup was used in the Porsche Supercup for the seasons 2013–2016. The Porsche 911 GT3 Cup Type 991 features the new gearbox paddle-shifters for the first time.
911 GT3 Cup (Type 991 II)
Raced in the Porsche Supercup from the 2017 season until the end of the 2020 season. Based on the latest 911 GT3 road car it features a larger 4.0-litre flat-six boxer engine, improved aerodynamics and an enlarged escape-hatch in the roof and is priced at €189,900 excluding taxes.
911 GT3 Cup (Type 992)
The standard Porsche 911 GT3 Cup (Type 992) raced in the Porsche Supercup starting for the first time in the 2021 season and is expected to race for the next few seasons. Based on the latest 911 GT3 road car, the 911 GT3 Cup Type 992 engines will remain same as 911 GT3 Cup (Type 991 II) but the power output will increase slightly from .
Transmission, gearbox and clutches
For the transmission gearboxes, all Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup cars currently utilize a semi-automatic transmission with a 6-speed gearbox (including reverse gear) operated by paddle shifters and supplied by in-house Porsche since the 2013 season. From 1993 to 2012, all Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup cars used sequential manual transmission with a 6-speed gearbox operated by a conventional sequential shifter. The clutch of all Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup cars is a sintered metal-plate clutch operated by foot-pedal and provided by ZF Sachs. The mechanical limited-slip differential is also allowed and constant velocity joint tripod driveshafts are also used. All Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup cars drivetrain is currently rear-engine with rear-wheel-drive layout.
Cockpit and safety components
For the safety equipment, all Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup cars seating utilizes racing bucket driver's seat with 6-point seat belts. The steering wheel of all Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup cars are made exclusively in-house by Porsche Motorsport GmbH. All Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup cars are also equipped with Cosworth Omega Intelligent Colour Display units since 2013 until 2020 season until it was replaced by all-new larger in-house Porsche Motorsport display units from 2021 season onwards. The fire extinguisher of all Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup cars are included in the bottom right-hand side underneath. The interior rear-view mirror is still currently used since 1993 until present.
The cockpit of all Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup cars are fully protected by doors, windshields and roofs (shielded by polycarbonate glass for windscreen, side windows and rear windows including also windshield wipers for rain weather only in the windscreen) because of current coupé-type car.

The Porc-Épic River is a tributary of the Malbaie River, flowing into the unorganized territory of Lac-Pikauba, in Charlevoix Regional County Municipality, in the Capitale-Nationale administrative region, in the province of Quebec, in Canada. Most of the Porc-Épic River flows into the territory of the Zec des Martres, except for the last before reaching its mouth.
The hydrographic slope of the Porc-Épic River is served mainly by a secondary forest road that goes up this valley for forestry and recreational tourism purposes.
Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector; recreational tourism activities, second.
The surface of the Porc-Épic River is usually frozen from early December to late March, however, safe ice movement is generally from mid-December to mid-March.

The main hydrographic slopes near the Porc-Épic River are:
north side: Malbaie River, Cran Rouge Creek, Moreau Lake, Des Martres River;
east side: Beaulieu Lake, Lac des Martres, Barley Lake, Rivière du Gouffre;
south side: Cold Creek, Hache Lake, Coq Lake, Barley River, Malbaie River;

east of a curve of the Malbaie River;
northeast of the Barley [river];
south-west of Beaulieu Lake;
northwest of Little Malbaie Lake, head lake of the Little Malbaie River;
south-west of a curve of the upper course of the Rivière du Gouffre;
south-east of the confluence of the Porc-Épic River and the Malbaie River.
From its source (Pimpant Lake), the Porc-Épic River descends on entirely in forested and mountainous zones, with a difference of according to the following segments:
northerly crossing an unidentified lake (length: ; altitude: ) surrounded by marshes, up to the discharge (coming from the east) of Beaulieu Lake;
in a steep valley, first to the north, curving east, then north again, collecting a stream (from the northwest), a stream (coming from the northeast);
to the northwest forming two small hooks, to the discharge (from the east) of the lake of the titmouse;
northwesterly to the outlet (from the north) of an unidentified lake enclosed by mountains;
westerly in a steep valley to its mouth.
The Porc-Épic River flows into a swirl zone on the west bank of the Malbaie River. This confluence is located at:
upstream of the mouth of the La Cruche River;
northeast of the mouth of La Cruche Lake;
east of the Ha! Ha! River;
north-west of lac des Martres;
southeast of Little Ha! Ha! Lake;
west of the confluence of the Malbaie River and the St. Lawrence River.
From the confluence of the Porc-Épic River, the current flows down the Malbaie River to east, then south-east, which flows over the northwest shore of the St. Lawrence River.
Toponymy
The name "Porc-Épic River" appears in the Dictionary of Rivers and Lakes of the Province of Quebec, 1925, page 141. This name was approved on 1963-07-03 by the Commission de géographie du Québec.

Leyla Alasgar gizi Mammadbeyova, née Zeynalova (Azerbaijani: Leyla Ələsgər qızı Məmmədbəyova; 17 September 1909 – 4 July 1989), was the first Azerbaijani female aviator. She also was the first female pilot of Transcaucasia, of Southern Europe and of Southwest Asia.
Career
Mammadbeyova's father Alasgar Zeynalov was the cousin of one of Azerbaijan's pioneer film actors, Huseyn Arablinski. Her family was arts-oriented, and as a teenager she could play the piano and the tar. At age 14, she married former landowner Bahram Mammadbeyov of Kurdakhany, who would go on to become chief of the Professional Unions Bank in Baku.
Mammadbeyova was trained as a professional aviator at the Baku Airclub and performed her first flight in 1931. She continued her education at an aviators school in Moscow in 1932. On 17 March 1933, Mammadbeyova became the second woman parachutist in the Soviet Union (after Nina Kamneva) having jumped from a Polikarpov Po-2 aeroplane at Moscow's Tushino Airfield. In 1934 she won the parachute jump competition held among representatives of the South Caucasus nations. By 1941 she was Squadron Leader of the Soviet Army.
Mammadbeyova continued her career as a pilot and instructor at the Baku Airclub. She was refused to fight in World War II as at the time she was raising four children (she had six overall). Despite the Baku Airclub closing down due to war conditions, Mammadbeyova managed to launch glider and parachutist courses of her own, where she trained hundreds of combat pilots and around 4,000 paratroopers. Two of her students later became Heroes of the Soviet Union. Mammadbeyova performed her last flight in 1949 and worked as Vice-Chair of the DOSAAF's Baku branch until 1961.
Mammadbeyova's elder son Firudin fought in World War II, and her younger son Khanlar took part in the First Nagorno-Karabakh War, both as combat pilots.
Leyla Mammadbeyova became a living icon while still in her twenties. Her courage and skills were celebrated through media and the arts. Her character inspired the literary works of Mikayil Mushfig (Afshan, 1933 and Shoyla, 1934) and Samad Vurgun (Leyla, 1935), as well as the movie Ismat (dir. Mikayil Mikayilov, 1934). In the latter, Mammadbeyova appeared as a stuntwoman, having performed in plane operating scenes. In 1995 a documentary on Mammadbeyova's life and career entitled Leyla and directed by Nazim Rza Israfiloglu was released by Azerbaijantelefilm.

Charlotte Susa (1 March 1898 – 28 July 1976) was a German actress.
Biography
Susa was born Charlotta Wegmüller near Memel, East Prussia and first appeared on a stage in 1915 at Tilsit. She chose her mother's maiden name "Susa" as her stage name and began a successful career as a singer and actress at different German opera and operetta stages, e.g. at Brandenburg, Essen, Düsseldorf, Hamburg and Cologne and later at the Admiralspalast in Berlin.
Susa gave her debut as a film actress in the German silent movie Der Prinz und die Tänzerin in 1926 and became popular for her roles as a femme fatale. In 1932 she signed a contract with MGM and moved to the United States to start an international career.
Elizabeth Yeaman wrote in her newspaper column on 15 August 1932:
"Lilian Harvey, Henry Garat, Anna Sten, and now Charlotte Susa, comprise a quartet of important foreign talent that soon will be seen in Hollywood pictures. (...) Miss Susa has arrived in New York and soon will reach these shores with an MGM contract. She was born in Lithuania of German parents and has won great fame in Germany. She first went on the stage as a singer, then as a dramatic actress, and three years ago she took up screen work. Who knows, she may be the actress who will take Garbo's place, provided Garbo never returns."
However, Susa did not succeed in Hollywood, returned to Germany soon and canceled the MGM contract in 1934. Her last role in a movie was a minor one in the 1941 comedy Der Gasmann alongside Heinz Rühmann and Anny Ondra. After that she returned to theater stages.
Susa was married to Paul Cablin, Fritz Malkowsky and after 1939 to Andrews Engelmann. She died at Basel in Switzerland at the age of 78.

In economics, absorption is the total demand for all final marketed goods and services by all economic agents resident in an economy, regardless of the origin of the goods and services themselves. As the absorption is equal to the sum of all domestically-produced goods consumed locally and all imports, it is equal to national income [Y = C + I + G + (X - M)] minus the balance of trade [X - M].
The term was coined, and its relation to the balance of trade identified, by Sidney Alexander in 1952.
The term "absorption" is often used in real estate to assess demand for leasing space.

The Chemin des Canots River (rivière du Chemin des canots) is a tributary of the Malbaie River, flowing into the unorganized territory of Lac-Pikauba in the Charlevoix Regional County Municipality, in the Capitale-Nationale administrative region, in the province of Quebec, in Canada. The Chemin des Canots River crosses the eastern part of the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve; it flows into a river bend on the southwestern bank of the Malbaie River facing the zec des Martres.
The lower and middle parts of the Chemin des Canots River valley are served primarily by R0360 forest road and some other secondary forest roads, for forestry and recreational tourism purposes.
Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector; recreational tourism activities, second.
The surface of the Chemin des Canots River is usually frozen from early December to late March, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid-December to mid-March.
Geography
The middle section of Chemin des Canots River has a series of nine lakes aligned from north to south on between Lac Duquette and Lac Robitaille. Canoeing can be practiced on this river for about ten kilometers; however, this river segment has only one portage to bypass the rapids between Lake Layrac and Canoe Lake. A canoe trip or by air can admire the summits of surrounding mountains named according to the main summits of the International Organization of the Francophonie:
east side of the river: Moncton summit (), from Hanoi (), from Dakar (), of Cotonou (), of Paris (), of Quebec ();
west side of the river: summit of Mauritius () and Chaillot ().
The main hydrographic slopes near the Chemin des Canots River are:
north side: Creek des Vaches, Malbaie River, Froid Creek, Barley River, Ménard Lake, rivière à la Cruche;
east side: Malbaie River, Barley River, Little Malbaie River;
south side: Boisvert Lake, Enfers Lake, Hell River, Malbaie River;
West side: Vents Lake, Raymond Lake, Hallebarde Lake, River at Mars.
The Canots River River rises at the mouth of a mountain stream (elevation: ) at:
northeast of Stymphale Lake;
north-east of a curve of the course of the river at Mars;
west of the Malbaie River;
southeast of Cinto Lake;
northwest of the confluence of the Rivière des Canots and Rivière Malbaie.
From its source (Pimpant Lake), the Chemin des Canots River descends on entirely in forest and mountainous areas, with a difference of depending on the segments following:
northeasterly down the mountain, then southeast, to a river bend corresponding to a creek (coming from the north);
southeasterly into a steep valley, passing between two mountains whose summit reaches on the east side (the "Moncton Summit") and on the west side, as well as crossing Lake Duquette (length: ; altitude: ) to its mouth;
to the south, crossing two lakes in succession: Bernard lake (length: ; altitude: ) on and Assigny Lake (length: ; altitude: ) on its full length, to the mouth of the latter. Note: Lake Bernard receives on the west side the waters of a group of lakes, including Gautreau Lake;
to the south by collecting the dump (coming from the east) of Creux Lake and Lac de la Panetière, by cutting the forest road R0360, crossing Lake Layrac (length: ; altitude: ) on its full length and crossing Canoe Lake (length: ; altitude: ), to its mouth. Note: Lake Canoes receives the discharge (from the east) of a set of lakes (Liette, Fagots, Grouse, Oread, Raymond, Wind and Halberd);
north-east across Lake Robitaille (elevation: ), collecting the dump (coming from the south) of Bondy Lake and the dump ( from the south) of the Jeune Otter lake, to its mouth.
The Chemin des Canots River flows on the west bank of the Malbaie River downstream of a river curve and a rapids area. This confluence is located at:
east of Assigny Lake which is part of the lake chain supplying the Chemin des Canots River;
northwest of the confluence of Little Malbaie River and Malbaie River;
west of Petite Malbaie River;
south-west of lac des Martres;
southwest of the confluence of the Malbaie River and the St. Lawrence River.
From the confluence of the Chemin des Canots River, the current flows down the course of the Malbaie River on to the northeast, south and south-east, which empties on the northwest shore of the St. Lawrence River.

Alfredo Valente (1899-1973) was an Italian born American photographer known for his prolific career chronicling Broadway theatre. He is also credited as a singer, painter, art collector, dealer, and cultural administrator.
Valente was born in Calabria, Italy where he trained as a fine artist and opera singer. In 1924, he immigrated to the United States where he performed opera in public. However, his singing career did not take off and he pivoted to focus on his photography.
In 1931, he became the photographer for the newly formed Group Theater, an experimental theater company based in New York co-founded by Lee Strasberg. By the mid-1930s, Valente was regularly published by magazines and newspapers, most notably Stage, a magazine dedicated to Broadway theater. Valente was lauded as one of the leading theater photographers of the day and his use of artistic camera angles and dramatic lighting became his signature. He also became known for portraying actors and dancers in costume, but not while performing. In addition to Broadway, Valente photographed American Ballet Theatre (then known as Ballet Theatre) during the company's formative years during the 1940s. He photographed some Ballet Theatre's most prominent dancers, such as Harold Lang, John Kriza, Alicia Alonso, Nora Kaye, Vera Zorina, Igor Yousketvitch, Alicia Markova, Maria Tallchief, André Eglevsky, and Hugh Laing. Valente also extensively photographed the Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo when choreographer Léonide Massine created his most famous works.
By 1937, he became the choice photographer at the New York Times. He also worked as a contract photographer for Columbia Pictures, shooting publicity images, sporadically from 1935-37.
In addition to a photographer, he was an avid collector of American art which he bought with the profits from sale of his photography. He developed close friendships with modern painters whom he considered the best of their day including Raphael Soyer, John Sloan, Thomas Hart Benton, Reginald Marsh, and Abraham Walkowitz. In 1943, he independently produced the short film "Art Discovers America" to patriotically celebrate these American artists and their contributions to the art world at large. The film was distributed by MGM and later turned into a longer form educational film titled "Grandpa Called It Art" (1944). According to his obituary, he coined the term "American Masters".
Valente died in 1973 at his home on Long Island at age 74.
Several repositories in the United States hold Valente's archival papers and photographs including The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, Archives of American Art, and The Museum of Modern Art.

On 30 March 1996 at 7 pm Hong Kong Time, Star TV split Star Plus and Star Chinese Channel by certain areas Star Plus would serve viewers in South Asia and the Middle East, while East and Southeast Asian viewers would receive the new Star World channel and Star Chinese Channel would still be available to the viewers in Taiwan, but the television watchers in Hong Kong and the Mainland China would get the new Phoenix Chinese Channel instead.
In October 1996, Star Sports (since renamed from Prime Sports) and ESPN Asia have agreed to combine their loss making operations in Asia. The new joint venture, later named ESPN Star Sports, would be headquartered in Singapore (where ESPN's operations in Asia were based in).
In 2009, News Corporation restructured Star so Star India and Star Greater China were separated from its Hong Kong headquarters. Among the assets Star Greater China would oversee included Xing Kong, Channel V Mainland China and Fortune Star film library.
Sale to CMC
In August 2010, it was announced that News Corporation would sell a controlling stake in its assets in mainland China to China Media Capital (CMC), which was headed by Li Ruigang (of Shanghai Media Group). Xing Kong (both dosmetic and international versions) and Channel V Mainland China, plus Fortune Star film library were in the sale, and a joint venture named Star China Media was created in the process.
In January 2014, the company's management team and CMC acquired the remaining stake from 21st Century Fox (which took television businesses from the original News Corporation in the 2013 split). This marked 21st Century Fox's exit from Mandarin entertainment television market in Mainland China.

Westerhout 43, also known as W43, is a region of star formation of our galaxy located in the constellation of Aquila at a distance of 6 kilo-parsecs (nearly 20,000 light-years) of the Sun, that is considered the region of the Milky Way that is most actively forming stars. Despite this, however, it is so heavily obscured by the interstellar dust that it is totally invisible in the optical and must be studied using other wavelengths that are not affected by it, such as the infrared or the radio waves.
Physical properties
This star-forming region is located in the 5-kpc ring, a ring with that radius that encircles the central bar of our galaxy and that contains most of its molecular hydrogen as well as most of its star formation.
It is associated with a very massive complex of molecular clouds with a total mass of more than 7 million times the one of our Sun and is forming stars of all masses within star clusters that are less massive versions of those found on starburst galaxies; it still has capacity to form more clusters.
There are also massive protostars as well as stellar clusters in formation embedded within the nebula, with this star formation region likened to NGC 3603
W43's center, finally, contains a dense and massive star cluster with several O stars and Wolf-Rayet stars that has been compared due to its compactness to NGC 3603 or even Large Magellanic Cloud's R136.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo competed at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 7 September to 18 September 2016.
Disability classifications
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.

Granada Hills Charter (often abbreviated to GHCHS/GHC or simply Granada) is an independent charter school consisting of over 4,600 students in grades K–12, located in the Granada Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, United States. It is the largest charter school in the nation. Granada also has a high Academic Performance Index (API) score of 878, greatly exceeding the target API score of 800 for all schools in California. On April 12, 2011, Granada was named a 2011 California Distinguished School. On December 22, 2011, Granada became an International Baccalaureate World School. Since 2011, the school has won seven National Academic Decathlon Championships.
History
Granada Hills High School is a comprehensive public high school, founded in 1960. Bryce Schurr was the first acting principal of the school. It was in the Los Angeles City High School District until 1961, when it merged into LAUSD.
In the 1970–71 and 1971-72 school years, Granada Hills High had the largest student body of any high school in the United States. Overcrowding at the school was relieved with the 1971 opening of John F. Kennedy High School.
In 1994, the school opened a LAUSD magnet school with emphasis in math, science and technology in conjunction with the California State University, Northridge. In 2003, the school was awarded charter status which granted it fiscal and instructional autonomy.
In 2003, the Los Angeles Board of Education voted to allow the school to become a charter, making it the largest school in the United States to convert to a charter school. The school administration asked for a charter status since being directly operated the district limited its fundraising opportunities, and it also was against LAUSD funding cuts.
In mid-2013, Granada Hills Charter High School purchased the nearby Pinecrest Northridge Elementary School campus for $5.6M, using funds obtained from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Granada Hills Charter High School used this new land to create iGranada, a campus specializing in digital arts and sciences. This campus opened for the first time for the Fall 2015 school year.
As part of their Charter Renewal Petition, GHCHS has applied to increase their enrollment from 4,300 students up to 5,500 students. This includes adding approximately 200 additional grades 9-12 seats to the existing GHCHS campus, through a Charter Augmentation Grant, and adding up to 1,000 additional seats at the Pinecrest site (or at another possible property acquisition).
In 2020 the grade span changed to K12.
Technology
On campus, there are six computer labs, each with more than 35 computers. There are also laptop carts, which house many laptop computers and can be transported around the campus for enrichment activities. Science classrooms are updated with new lab technology often. Most classrooms have Smart Boards and projectors, increasing the overall student interaction in class.
Beginning in the 2015–2016 school year, Chromebooks are given to every student. Teachers may use Google Classroom to post assignments, online teaching materials, and give instant feedback to the students. Additionally, the school has wifi networks campuswide, and can provide wifi at a student's home if they cannot afford it.
Demographics
According to U.S. News & World Report, as of 2019, 75% of Granada's student body is "minority," with 47% of the student body coming from an economically disadvantaged household, determined by student eligibility for California's Reduced-price meal program.
The school is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.
Facilities
The school's sports stadium, John Elway Stadium, is used by the Los Angeles Rampage women's soccer team and is the former home ground of the San Fernando Valley Quakes United Soccer League Premier Development League soccer team.
Academics
Granada offers 29 Advanced Placement (AP) courses and 38 IB courses which include: AP Biology, AP Chemistry, AP Physics 1, AP Physics 2, AP Physics C, AP Environmental Science, AP Computer Science A, AP Computer Science Principles, AP Statistics, AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, AP English Language and Composition, AP English Literature, AP European History, AP World History, AP United States History, AP Psychology, AP United States Government, AP Macroeconomics, AP Microeconomics, AP Human Geography, AP Art History, AP Music Theory, AP Studio Art, AP Chinese Language and Culture, AP French Language, AP Spanish Language and Culture, and AP Spanish Literature.
Extracurricular activities
Granada Hills Charter High School offers a wide variety of extra curricular activities which include, Associated Student Body (ASB), Yearbook, Dance Team, Cheer, Theatre, Show Choir, Honors Choir, Jazz Band, Marching Band and Color Guard, Indoor Percussion, and Orchestra. With that, the school also offers several academic teams such as Academic Decathlon, Model United Nations, DECA, Envirothon, Robotics, Science Bowl, Science Olympiad, and Speech and Debate.
Academic Decathlon
The Academic Decathlon team won back-to-back-to-back national championships in 2011, 2012 and 2013. The 2015 team began another championship streak as Granada Hills went on to win again in 2016 and 2017. The 2019 team captured another championship, for seven titles in a span of nine years.
Model United Nations
The nationally ranked Model United Nations team at Granada Hills Charter has been recognized at various conferences across North America. During the 2017–2018 season, they won Best Small Delegation at Harvard Model UN (HMUN). In 2019, GHC Model UN won the Award of Distinction at the National High School Model United Nations (NHSMUN). GHCMUN notably hosts the Valley Regional Model United Nations (VRMUN), the first high-school Model UN conference in the San Fernando Valley.
Robotics
The school's robotics team, The Robodox, participates in both the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) and in the VEX Robotics Competition (VRC). The team builds robots that compete for these competitions. Students are responsible for every step of construction, from designing and manufacturing to coding and CADing. The Robotics team also helps out the local community with its outreach programs, spreading the importance of STEM Education. In 2018, the Robodox won the VRC California State competition. In 2021 the FIRST robotics portion of the team competed in Tidal Tumble winning the competition with its two alliance members 4414 and 973 In addition, the team mastered the use of machines using them to create tons of parts this season leading to the team going undefeated for over 3 matches this season due to the revolutionary design choices.

Alexander Mitchell Kellas (21 June 1868 – 5 June 1921) was a British chemist, explorer, and mountaineer known for his studies of high-altitude physiology. He was born in Aberdeen, Scotland.
Himalayan Club Vice President Meher Mehta characterized Kellas' papers A Consideration of the Possibility of Ascending the Loftier Himalaya and A Consideration of the Possibility of Ascending Mt Everest as "key catalysts in driving scientific thinking into climbing big peaks. His studies included the physiology of acclimatization in relationship to important variables like altitude, barometric pressures, alveolar PO2, arterial oxygen saturation, maximum oxygen consumption, and ascent rates at different altitudes. He had concluded that Mt Everest could be ascended by men of extreme physical and mental constitution without supplementary oxygen if the physical difficulties of the mountain were not too great."
In 1978, Kellas' suggestion was verified by Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler when they made the first ascent of Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen. However, Kellas was also one of the earliest scientists to suggest use of supplemental oxygen on high mountains such as Mount Everest; the first ascent of Everest and most subsequent ascents (as well as some ascents of lower peaks) have done so.
Kellas was also a noted mountaineer in his own right. He had made at least ten first ascents of peaks over 6,100 m (20,000 ft) including Pauhunri, 7,128 m (23,386 ft), in Sikkim, which was the highest peak climbed up to that point, although this was only discovered 80 years later. He reached the summit on 14 June 1911, and this world summit record was only broken in September 1928 with the ascent of Lenin Peak.
Kellas died of a heart attack in 1921 near the village of Kampa Dzong, Tibet, on his way from Sikkim to the first expedition to Everest. He had had only a brief rest of 9 days after an arduous expedition to Kabru and was only a day's hike away from seeing Mount Everest for the first time.
Former All Black John Kirwan is a distant relative of Kellas.

The Golden Comb () was an anti-ship tactic developed by the during the Second World War for use against Allied convoys taking supplies to the Soviet Union by the Arctic route. It was first employed against Convoy PQ 18 in September 1942.
Background
Before 1942 the lacked a means to attack ships at sea due to the inter-service rivalry between the , which regarded all air operations as its domain and the German navy (), which saw the development, production and use of torpedoes as naval matter. Germany had no torpedo bomber force, in contrast to the forces of other world powers, even the other Axis nations like Italy with the land-based or the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service which used the Type 91 torpedo in the Attack on Pearl Harbor, having revealed its manufacturing details to Germany in early August 1942.
In early 1942, when the Allied Arctic convoy cycle was becoming well established, the was ordered to form a torpedo bomber force. Two , III/ (III/KG 26) and III/ (III/KG 30), were assigned to train and equip as anti-ship /anti-convoy units, with Heinkel He 111 and Junkers Ju 88 bombers, modified to carry two air-dropped torpedoes under the wings.
To attack a convoy, a formation of 20 to 30 ships sailing in close formation at relatively slow speed, the commander of KG 26 Martin Harlinghausen and his units developed the (Golden Comb) anti-shipping tactic. The attack was planned for use in the half light period of dawn or dusk and would be in conjunction with a simultaneous dive bombing attack to divide opposing anti-aircraft fire.
The tactic involved the forming line abreast, about forty aircraft flying approximately apart and approaching the convoy from a forward quarter, simultaneously to launch their torpedoes at a distance of then overfly the convoy and escape in the confusion. The tracks of up to eighty torpedoes heading towards the target was likened to the teeth of a comb.
In action
The first use of the occurred on 13 September 1942 against the Allied convoy PQ 18, a collection of 35 merchant ships, with a strong escort of 18 warships including the escort carrier . After a dive-bombing attack by I/KG 30, the convoy was approached by the torpedo-bombers, I/KG 26, in a formation of 42 aircraft. The sight was described by one observer as "a huge flight of nightmare locusts". Despite anti-aircraft fire from the ships and their escorts, the group continued on course, dropping their torpedoes as planned. The convoy commodore ordered a turn too starboard to sail parallel to the torpedo tracks. In the confusion the signal was misread by the ships of the starboard columns, which continued ahead. Eight ships, six in the outermost starboard column and two further in, were sunk. This occasion was the most successful use of the . The aircraft made more attacks on PQ 18 after the torpedo attack and two more ships were sunk but no successes similar to the first day were achieved. Aircraft losses mounted after the first attack and by the end of the air offensive against PQ 18, forty aircraft from the two groups had been lost. Following PQ 18, Arctic convoys were suspended until December 1942 when the next series of convoys was able to travel under cover of the Arctic night.
Aftermath
Devastating as they had proved against PQ 18, the Allies quickly found counter-measures which reduced its effectiveness and inflicted crippling losses on the attackers. The approaching formation was unable to take evasive action and was vulnerable to AA fire from the ships and escorts and attacks by fighter aircraft from the carrier. The combination of gun and fighter attack, aided by the bold and aggressive handling of Avenger and the AA ship, Ulster Queen, caused the bombers to release and break formation earlier and earlier in their approach runs as the battle progressed.
Combing the tracks (turning into the track of torpedoes to present a smaller target) was made more effective against torpedoes running in the same direction. The confusion over signals that contributed to the ship losses in PQ 18 during the first attack was not repeated. Other air forces had found torpedo attacks were more effective against ships when delivered from different directions simultaneously. Whilst hitting eight ships in one attack was a huge success, it had taken over eighty torpedoes, ten for every hit, an inferior performance to the British attack on Bismarck (May 1941), the Imperial Japanese Navy attack on and , (December 1941) and the attack by the United States Navy attack on Yamato, (April 1945).

Carl Madison (born 1931) is a former American football coach. He spent over 45 years coaching high school football at numerous schools in Florida and Alabama, compiling a 326–129–7 record which makes him number two on Florida's all-time coaching victories list (behind Corky Rogers).
Born in Uriah, Alabama, Madison attended Escambia High School, graduating in 1949. He enrolled at Texas Tech University on an athletic scholarship, but left after his freshman year to join the United States Army. He returned to Texas Tech in 1952, starting four games in the 1952 college football season before an injury cut short his career. He transferred to Troy State Teachers College (now Troy University), where he graduated in 1955.
Upon graduation, he took on his first coaching job at Carrabelle High School. He spent the next couple of years at a number of schools, including Milton High School, where he won his first state championship.
Madison coached J. M. Tate High School in Gonzalez, Florida, to a state championship in 1980, and took Pensacola's Pine Forest High School to two state championships in 1987 and 1988. The 1988 Eagle team was named as mythical national champions by USA Today, and Madison earned the title of the High School Coach of the Year.
Coach Madison left the Pensacola area for a brief return to coaching in south Georgia at Westover High School in 1989-90 to help turnaround a struggling program. He returned to Milton High School as the head coach for several years in the late 1990s. (Need to firm up these years. I know he was there in 1994-1999. I believe he coached Long enough to retire from FL, then returned to AL to complete a retirement in AL too.)
Madison's last stint as a head coach was when he returned to the sidelines in 2002 and took over the Jackson Academy Program in Jackson, Alabama. JA was coming off a 0–10 season, and in Madison's first year with the program he led them to a 10–3 record which included a state title. In 2003, Madison again led JA to a state title and a 12–0 record. Madison coached one more season with JA before retiring after the 2004 season. Madison briefly came out of retirement in 2009 to assist his former school, Tate High School, as an offensive consultant at the age of 77.

Aaron Zucker (May 15, 1892 – September 13, 1957), better known by his pen name A. Lutzky, was a Ukrainian-born Jewish American Yiddish poet.
Life
Lutzky was born on May 15, 1892 in Demydivka, Volhynian Governorate, the son of a bookkeeper.
When Lutzky was twelve, he left the cheder to study under a cantor in Lutsk. His Hassidic father disapproved of his son becoming a cantor and sent him to a Yeshiva. Under his mother's influence, he also learned how to play the violin. He began writing poems when he was fourteen, and they won praise from I. L. Peretz. He immigrated to America following his father's death in 1914, but not before visiting Peretz in Warsaw. During the visit, Peretz unsuccessfully tried to convince Lutzky to stay in Warsaw. Lutzky initially worked as a peddler, teacher, and violinist in America. He published his first poems in the Yidishes Tageblat and Der Tog in 1917. The Forward editor Abraham Cahan recognized Lutzky's talent, had him write a weekly poem for The Forward, and gave him the pseudonym "Lutzky" for his birthplace.
A year later, Lutzky served with the American Expeditionary Forces in France for World War I and fought in the trenches of Verdun. When he returned from his military service, he began writing in a new style that needed to be read aloud to be fully grasped. His first volume of poems, Nemt Es! S'is Gut Far Aikh! (Take It! It's Good for You!), was published in 1927. This was followed by Bereshis-Inmitten (The Beginning is the Middle) in 1932, Portretn (Portraits) in 1945, and A Bukh Tsum Leben (A Book for Life) in 1948. He did dramatic impersonations of his poems, acting out through his face and body what his words hinted at. The impersonations were imitated by leading actors and entertainers and entered into the lasting Yiddish repertoire.
Lutzky was a member of the editorial staff of the Jewish Day-Morning Journal. His work appeared in a number of periodicals, including Fraye Arbeter Shtime, Tsukunft, Yidisher Kemfer, and Di Goldene Keyt. Some of his lyrics were translated to Hebrew and English. A fifth volume of his poetry, Fun Aldos Guts (Of All Good Things), was posthumously published in 1958 and included a bibliography.
Lutzky died from a heart attack on September 13, 1957. He was buried in the Workmen's Circle section of Mount Carmel Cemetery.

Nellya Baughman (August 21, 1935 – May 11, 2008) was an American professional wrestler who was best known by her ring name Judy Grable. She was an active wrestler during the 1950s and 1960s. In addition to her nickname "The Barefoot Contessa" due to her preference for wrestling barefoot, she was also known as "the acrobatic blonde with the educated flying feet."
Professional wrestling career
Grable trained for her professional wrestling career with The Fabulous Moolah in her school in Columbia, South Carolina. She debuted in 1953 using the name Peaches Grable. Moolah's female trainees worked in Boston under promoter Paul Bowser, and in Boston, Grable and Moolah were involved in a feud.
She wrestled in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) territories through the 1950s and the 1960s. In September 1956, a battle royal was held to determine the new NWA World Women's Champion, but Grable lost to long-time rival The Fabulous Moolah. On September 20, 1959, Grable made an appearance as a contestant on the popular television show What's My Line? The episode became famous in part because of the highly risque banter from guest panelist Groucho Marx and consequent malapropisms by regular panelist Dorothy Kilgallen and host John Daly.
Even though she retired in the late 1960s, Grable's last in-ring work occurred in Superstar Wrestling in 1974.
On March 31, 2017, Grable was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as a part of the Legacy wing.
Personal life
Grable was the youngest of six children, including four brothers and one sister. She was a tomboy who liked fishing, hunting, and sports. She also wrestled at Grand Junction High School. Her family later moved to Florida, where Grable became interested in the circus. She was employed at Ringling Brothers Circus as an acrobat for six months, deciding she would rather wrestle after falling off a high wire.
In the late 1960s, Grable retired from wrestling after marrying a serviceman and returned to school, graduating in 1978. She was then employed as a nurse's assistant in a home for veterans. One of her daughters works as a wrestler under the name Debbie Grable.
Grable died on May 11, 2008, after living with diabetes, strokes, and Alzheimer's.

Athens Andover is a collaborative album between The Troggs and what was then three-quarters of R.E.M. Released in March 1992, the name of the album is derived from the hometowns of the two bands: Andover, Hampshire, in England, and Athens, Georgia, in the United States.
The joining of forces was sparked by R.E.M.'s covering the Troggs' single "Love Is All Around" in live performances during promotion for the former's album Out of Time (1991). One such performance, on the American radio show Rockline in April 1991, was released as a B-side on R.E.M.'s single "Radio Song".
"We'd just done a show in a hotel, and as the lift door opened there was this crowd waiting for autographs and someone shouted out, 'What do you think of R.E.M. doing your record?'" explained Troggs frontman Reg Presley to Record Collector editor Peter Doggett. "Well, I hadn't heard of R.E.M. But my manager had, so he suggested working with them on our new album. And when I listened to their records, I thought they weren't far removed from what we were doing when we started. They invited me and Chris over to Athens to work with them for a week. By this time I'd realised quite how big they were, and so we spent the first five minutes walking around one another going, 'Wow'. It was quite different working with them. With the Troggs it had always just been you had a guitar and so you had a sound. With them, you had a roomful of 65 guitars to get exactly the right sound. They were very laid back, very normal. There was no high falutin sort of, 'Listen to this 'cos we're better than you.' After all, their drummer was selling hamburgers until a few weeks before they made it. He was doing quite well with his own business. Having been a roofer when "Wild Thing" hit the charts, I could relate to that."
Recording took place over a one-week period in September 1991 at John Keane's Studio in Athens. Bill Berry, Mike Mills and Peter Buck made up the R.E.M. contingent. Vocalist Michael Stipe was not involved. "Nowhere Road" was composed by the R.E.M. trio along with Peter Holsapple of The dB's, who was R.E.M.'s auxiliary musician for their 1991 tour.
The album was re-released by the Troggs in as Athens, Georgia & Beyond (1996) with seven additional tracks not recorded during the R.E.M. collaboration.

Richard Charles Dowell is an Australian audiologist, academic and researcher. He holds the Graeme Clark Chair in Audiology and Speech Science at University of Melbourne. He is a former director of Audiological Services at Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital.
Dowell's research is centered on hearing loss; he has been involved in clinical work and research in cochlear implants, along with developing signal processing improvements for cochlear implants.
Dowell is a Fellow of Audiology Australia. He is a former Chair of the Victorian Infant Hearing Screening Program Audiological committee and a former Chair of the Taralye Early Intervention center for hearing impaired children in Melbourne.
Education
After completing his initial studies at Carey Baptist Grammar School, Dowell studied at the University of Melbourne where he completed his Bachelor of Science in 1977, Graduate Diploma in Audiology in 1979, Masters in Audiology in 1989 and his Doctoral studies in 1991.
Career
Dowell began his career as a Research Audiologist at the University of Melbourne Department of Otolaryngology in 1980 before being promoted to Lecturer of Audiology in 1989 and to Senior Lecturer in 1991. In 1995, Dowell was promoted to Associate Professor and then Professor of Audiology from 2001 till 2013. He was appointed the Graeme Clark Chair in Audiology and Speech Science in 2013.
At the University, Dowell was appointed as Head of the Department of Otolaryngology from 2005 till 2011, and for the Department of Audiology and Speech Pathology from 2012 till 2018.
Along with his academic career at University of Melbourne, Dowell has also held clinical and hospital appointments. He devised and implemented the initial clinical trial of the multichannel cochlear implant for adults, and established and directed the Cochlear Implant Clinic at the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital with Professor Graeme Clark.
Research
Dowell has conducted significant research on hearing impairment, particularly in relation to cochlear implants. He contributed to the development of many of the clinical procedures in the cochlear implant field and to signal processing improvements for these prostheses. Dowell was a key contributor to the first successful FDA approval of multi-channel cochlear implants in adults (1985) and children (1990).
Development of Cochlear Implants
Dowell studied the psychophysical properties of electrical stimuli presented to cochlear implant patients with colleagues Graeme Clark, Yit Chow Tong, and Peter Blamey. These studies resulted in publications that established some of the fundamental basic science for electrical hearing.
Dowell then devised the initial clinical trial of the first commercial multichannel cochlear implant resulting in FDA approval for adults with profound hearing loss in 1985.
With colleagues, Peter Seligman and Blamey, Dowell helped to develop the initial sound coding algorithms for the multichannel cochlear implant.
Clinical application of Cochlear Implants
Dowell, working with Blamey and others, established factors predictive of outcomes for adults who received cochlear implants. This study was followed up in 2013 by Blamey and Dowell, with other colleagues, who collected data for 2251 adults who used cochlear implants to study the factors affecting auditory performance. The study found that the history and duration of hearing loss, age and other factors were associated with cochlear implant outcomes, but that no single factor had good predictive power.
In 2006, Dowell with PhD student Mansze Mok, published a study to address the use of cochlear implants in conjunction with conventional hearing aids in the opposite ear. The study showed that acoustic hearing can provide complementary information to that provided by a cochlear implant and thus improve speech understanding.
Cochlear implants in Children
Dowell worked on identifying the factors affecting the speech perception scores among children using cochlear implants. A large sample of children using the Nucleus 22-electrode cochlear implant and having an average age of 5 years at the time of implantation were evaluated. Multivariate analysis identified six factors, including age at implantation, educational approach, progression of hearing loss and developmental delay that were predictive for speech perception scores.
In the mid-2000s, Dowell, with colleague Shani Dettman and others, studied the risks and benefits regarding the communication development of children who received cochlear implant surgery before 12 months of age. The study showed that spoken language acquisition for deaf children depended significantly on access to auditory input in their first year.
Other audiology research
Dowell has been involved in research into auditory neuropathy with colleague Gary Rance, that established the diagnostic and management procedures for this distinct type of hearing loss identified in the late 1990s.
Dowell has also been involved in research into the evaluation and management of vestibular disorders, the use of electrophysiological techniques in diagnostic audiology, and evaluation of hearing deficits of non-peripheral origin.

Ellen Meade (born c. 1953) is an American beauty pageant titleholder who won Miss Florida 1973.
Miss Florida
At 20 years old, Ellen Meade won the title of Miss Manatee County. She then went on to compete in the Miss Florida pageant, where she was crowned Miss Florida, 1973. Following her state win, Meade headed to Atlantic City to represent Florida in the Miss America pageant. While she didn't take home the title of Miss America, she did grab a win with a talent award.
During her time as Miss Florida, Meade toured the state of Florida, emceeing and performing.
Early career
Meade began training in the arts at the age of seven. Her training began as a student with the Florida Ballet in Sarasota, Florida. In her early years, she trained under the direction of Madam Jean Spear, who founded Sarasota's first professional ballet troupe in 1962. Meade studied five days a week in ballet as an elementary student and later began training as a roller skater, practicing for hours on a concrete slab her father built in the family's backyard.
By the time she was 12, Meade was competing in both state and regional skating championships and was headed for nationals. With a performance set to a backdrop of Stravinsky ballet, "Firebird," Meade competed in and won the North American National Championships at the age of 14.
At 16, and still a senior in high school, Meade had begun studying modeling and acting after being discovered by a talent scout and notably, had opened her first school for the arts—in her own backyard. Her love of the arts would continue to propel her into new arenas, and at 17, she was developing a growing interest in pageantry.
By the late 1960s, Meade began entering local and state-level pageants. She entered and won the state Roller Skating Beauty Queen title, at 17, then continued on to take the title of Roller Skating Queen of America at nationals. Mentored by Rene Hardin, she began by competing in several small local pageants and grabbed the title of Miss Manatee County at the age of 20.
Following her local win, Meade went on to compete in the Miss Florida pageant where she took the top honor, and was crowned Miss Florida, 1973. That year she represented her home state of Florida in the Miss America pageant, held in Atlantic City. Meade took home a win in the talent portion of the competition, but Rebecca Ann King was crowned Miss America 1974.
In 1974, Meade crowned Delta Burke as the new Miss Florida and helped prepare her for the Miss America Pageant, where Burke also won a talent award.
Meade has also appeared in print, on stage and in television and film during the course of her career.
Miss Dogpatch USA
Following her reign as Miss Florida, Meade traveled to Arkansas to participate in the Miss Dogpatch USA pageant. She won the title of Miss Dogpatch USA and embarked on a year of travel around the country representing Dogpatch USA.
It was in Arkansas where she also met her future husband, Craig Thomas, who, at the time, was the star of the Li'l Abner show in the Dogpatch USA themepark.
Professional life
Meade attended Manatee Junior College and went on to become a pageant coach. Meade has mentored many pageant contestants, who have gone on to win national, state and local titles. She currently produces, directs and emcees the Manatee County annual pageant as well as several other smaller pageants and serves as a pageant judge throughout the nation.
Meade is the owner and director of Ellen Meade Studios and School of Creative Learning in Bradenton, Florida.
Family
Bruce Meade, Ellen Meade's older brother, was inducted into the Independent Softball Association Hall of Fame in the Male Player Category in Fort Myers Beach, Florida. He has also been named to the All-World Tournament Team seven times. During his career, Bruce Meade appeared in nine ISA Super Major World Tournaments and three Senior World Tournaments.

The Kadavu fantail (Rhipidura personata) is a species of bird in the fantail family Rhipiduridae.
It is endemic to Kadavu and Ono in the Kadavu archipelago, in southern Fiji. It is closely related to the streaked fantail of the rest of Fiji, and forms a superspecies with the numerous island species of fantail ranging from the Solomon Islands (the brown fantail) to Samoa (the Samoan fantail).
The Kadavu fantail is restricted to tropical moist lowland forests, where it feeds by flycatching for insects. It sometimes joins mixed-species feeding flocks with Polynesian trillers, Fiji bush warblers and silvereyes. The breeding season is October and November.
It is threatened by habitat loss.
Taxonomy
Kadavu fantail (R. personata) forms a superspecies with:
Brown fantail (R. drownei)
Makira fantail (R. tenebrosa)
Rennell fantail (R. rennelliana)
Streaked fantail (R. verreauxi)
Samoan fantail (R. nebulosa)

The Hot Chick is a 2002 American comedy film about a teenage girl whose body is magically swapped with that of a criminal. It was directed by Tom Brady and produced by Rob Schneider and Carr D'Angelo for Happy Madison and Buena Vista Pictures (though Touchstone Pictures), and written by Brady and Rob Schneider. The film stars Schneider, Rachel McAdams, Anna Faris and Matthew Lawrence. The film details a mean-spirited teenager who comes across magic earrings that causes her to switch bodies with an incompetent thief. Together with her cheerleader friends, she searches for her body while dealing with awkward social situations.
Adam Sandler served as executive producer and has a small role in the film as the Mambuza Bongo Player, a character based on one played by Schneider in a Saturday Night Live sketch. Sisters Tia and Tamera Mowry and singers Ashlee Simpson, Angie Stone, and Michelle Branch also had small roles. Parts of the film were shot at Redondo Union High School and El Segundo High School.
Plot
In 50 BC, in an Abyssinian castle, the princess Nawa uses a pair of enchanted earrings to escape an arranged marriage by swapping bodies with a slave girl. When each woman wears one of the earrings, their bodies are magically swapped while their minds remain in place.
In her modern-day suburban home, Jessica Spencer is a beautiful but selfish "hot chick". Jessica's closest friends are April, Keecia, and Lulu. April is Jessica's best friend, and all four girls are cheerleaders. At school one day, Jessica makes fun of an overweight girl named Hildenburg and a Wiccan girl named Eden. After that, Jessica and her friends visit the local mall, where Jessica gets her rival Bianca into trouble and finds the earrings in an African-themed store. The earrings are not for sale, so Jessica steals them.
Shortly afterward, a small-time criminal named Clive Maxtone robs a nearby gas station. When Jessica and her friends stop there and mistake him for an employee, he services their car to avoid raising suspicion. Jessica accidentally drops one of the earrings on the ground, the girls drive away, and Clive picks up the earring. That evening, in their respective homes, Jessica and Clive put on their earrings. When they wake up the next morning, each of them is trapped in the other's body. This is especially difficult for Jessica, who has a cheering competition and the school prom coming up soon.
After Jessica convinces her friends of who she is, they help her investigate the body swap. Hildenburg, Eden, and Bianca are all innocent, Hildenburg and Eden join Jessica after she apologizes to them, and Eden finds a picture of the earrings on the internet. When the girls return to the African store, the owner explains how the earrings work and tells the girls they must find the other earring soon or the change will become permanent.
Meanwhile, Jessica is hired for two jobs while secretly living with April. At her own home, where she works as a gardener, her parents tell her about their marital problems and she helps them rekindle their sex life. At school, while cleaning the boys' locker room as a custodian, she spies on her boyfriend Billy, who truly loves her, and April's boyfriend Jake, who has been cheating on her. Faced with Jake's infidelity, April begins to fall in love with Jessica, who agrees to take her to the prom. At the cheering competition, Jessica signals romantically to Billy while disguised as the school mascot, but when the head of her suit falls off, he becomes confused and leaves with Bianca.
During this time, Clive has been using Jessica's body to make money from men, including Billy, who gives him his money and car, believing he is Jessica. On the evening of the prom, Hildenburg sees a video of Clive in Jessica's body robbing a man on the TV news, goes to the scene of the crime, and finds a business card for the club where Clive works as a pole dancer. She informs Jessica at the prom, and the girls go to the club. When they find Clive, Jessica steals his earring and puts it on herself along with the other one. With the two earrings now on the same person, Jessica's and Clive's bodies return to their original owners.
After Jessica makes up with Billy, the film ends with the school's graduation ceremony, followed by a scene in which Clive, running from the law and still dressed in lingerie, is picked up by a bartender who believes he is a homosexual--and plans to have sex with him. Clive screams in horror.

Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A to F.

It is too vulgar for anyone under 13, and too dumb for anyone over 13." Roeper panned the film saying "it's in color. And, it was mostly in focus."
Dennis Harvey of Variety magazine wrote: "At best routinely assembled—at worst barely competent. The slapstick is labored, and the bigger setpieces flat."

Rob Schneider was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Actor of the Decade for his performance in the film.
Home media The Hot Chick was released May 13, 2003 on VHS and DVD. The DVD featured the deleted scenes that would have made the film an R, including an alternate ending.

Robert Empie Rogers (March 29, 1813 – September 6, 1884) was a United States chemist.
Biography
Rogers was born in Baltimore, Maryland on March 29, 1813. The youngest of four brothers, he was educated first under the care of his father, and then by his elder brothers. It was intended that he should be a civil engineer, and for a time he acted as assistant in the survey of the Boston and Providence Railroad, but he abandoned this in 1833.
He graduated at the medical department of the University of Pennsylvania in 1836, where he followed a full course of chemistry under Robert Hare. The active practice of medicine not being congenial to him, in 1836 he was appointed chemist to the geological survey of Pennsylvania being administered by his brother Henry. He continued in this position for six years. In 1841-42 he was a temporary instructor in chemistry at the University of Virginia and was elected, in March 1842, to the professorship of general and applied chemistry and materia medica there. There he remained until 1852, when he was called to succeed his brother James as professor of chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania, where he became dean of the medical faculty in 1856. In 1877 he resigned these appointments to accept the professorship of chemistry and toxicology in Jefferson Medical College, which he then retained till 1884, when he was made professor emeritus.
During the American Civil War, he served as acting assistant surgeon at the West Philadelphia military hospital 1862–63. There he suffered a serious accident which necessitated the amputation of his right hand.
In 1864, caught up by the "oil fever" sweeping the United States, he made a significant investment in the Humboldt Oil Company, of which he was one of the founders. By 1873, the investment turned out to be a total loss, his more than anyone's since he was the largest shareholder.
Rogers was appointed in 1872 by the United States Department of the Treasury as one of a commission to examine the melters' and refiners' department of the United States Mint in Philadelphia. He visited the mint in San Francisco in 1873, and in 1874 the assay office in New York, and subsequently until 1879 he was frequently engaged on government commissions for the various mints, making valuable reports, in addition to which he served on the annual assay commissions from 1874 to 1879. From 1872 until his death, he was one of the chemists that were employed by the gas trust of Philadelphia to make analyses and daily photometric tests of the gas.
The degree of LL.D. was conferred on him by Dickinson College in 1877. He was a fellow of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, member of various scientific societies, one of the incorporators of the National Academy of Sciences, and president of the Franklin Institute 1875–79.
Besides various articles in the transactions of the societies of which he was a member, and in scientific journals, he was associated with his brother James in editing Elements of Chemistry (Philadelphia, 1846), and edited Charles G. Lehman's Physiological Chemistry (2 vols., 1855).
In 1843 he married Fanny Montgomery. She died in 1863, and he married Delia Saunders in 1866. There were no children. He died, aged 71, died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Bubble Bobble Revolution is a 2D platform game for the Nintendo DS. Developed by Dreams, it was released in Japan on 24 November 2005 by Taito as , in Europe on 2 December 2005 by Rising Star Games (Distribution handled by (Atari Europe) and in North America on 3 October 2006 by Codemasters.
Bubble Bobble Revolution received a strongly negative reception after its release, because of poor graphics and level design, and the presence of a major software bug in the North American version that prevented the game from being completed.
Gameplay
There are two primary gameplay modes in Bubble Bobble Revolution: "Classic", and "New-Age".
"Classic" mode is a conversion of the original Bubble Bobble to the DS hardware. Gameplay is nearly identical to the original game: players must control either Bub or Bob through 100 single-screen levels, in which they must defeat a certain number of enemies in order to proceed; being hit by an enemy results in a loss of a life. Enemies are defeated by blowing bubbles to trap them and then colliding with them; each enemy produces a food item that can be collected for extra points. The original co-op multiplayer mode is also implemented; if two players own copies of the game, they can use DS Download Play to play together.
"New-Age" plays similarly to the original game, with several key differences. Characters and levels are larger (spanning the DS's dual screen), and enemies and projectiles are faster. There are additionally boss fights every tenth level, and Bub and Bob can now take three hits instead of one before dying and have several new types of bubbles. Fans are also scattered around levels, and can be spun by blowing into the DS's microphone. Rather than a co-op mode, "Revolution" includes a four-player competitive mode in which players compete for the most points in ten different levels.
Level 30 bug
All levels beyond #30 in the North American version are unplayable due to a programming error that causes the boss of that level not to spawn. This was an often criticized aspect of the game. Codemasters ultimately responded by releasing a fixed version of the game, which included a free copy of Rainbow Islands Revolution.
Reception
The game received "unfavorable" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one seven and three sixes, while Famitsu Cube + Advance gave it a score of three sixes and one five. 411Mania gave it an unfavorable review, nearly two months before it was released Stateside.
Common criticism was directed at the game's dated visuals and level design. Reviewers also heavily criticized the game's number of odd glitches (such as enemies failing to spawn in levels, as well as levels being skipped entirely), which were described by Frank Provo of GameSpot as "strange" and "bizarre". Many critics also made note of the level 30 glitch, which Craig Harris of IGN claimed "makes a bad game worse". John Walker of Eurogamer began his review off by giving praise for the original game before harshly criticizing the "new-age" remake. Reviewers also made note of the drastic redesigns of the original characters, which were described as "stupendously ugly".
Despite the negative criticism, some did praise the game's inclusion of the original Bubble Bobble. Provo called the game "a genuine classic" and "enjoyable", and praised the multiplayer modes as well. However, Harris referred to them as "unacceptable" for requiring two copies of the game, a statement echoed by Walker.

The russet-backed oropendola (Psarocolius angustifrons) is a species of bird in the family Icteridae. It is found in wooded habitats in the highlands of the northern and central Andes and the Venezuelan Coastal Range, and in lowlands of the western Amazon. It is generally common and widespread. Males are larger than females, but otherwise the genders are similar. Its plumage is mainly olive and brown, and the outer rectrices are contrastingly yellow. The lowland nominate subspecies has a black bill, while the highland subspecies all have pale bills. These have been regarded as separate species, but as they hybridize freely, all major authorities now regard them as a single species.

The term chapel perilous first appeared in Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur (1485) as the setting for an adventure in which sorceress Hellawes unsuccessfully attempts to seduce Sir Lancelot. T. S. Eliot used it symbolically in The Waste Land (1922). Dorothy Hewett took The Chapel Perilous as the title for her autobiographical play, in which she uses "the framework of the Arthurian legend, Sir Lancelot, to create a theatrical quest of romantic and epic proportions."
Other uses
As used in literature
The term as used in literature is explicated in detail by Jessie L. Weston in her 1920 book From Ritual to Romance. It is defined by Thomas C. Foster as "the dangerous enclosure that is known in the study of traditional quest romances." He cites the plot of the 1966 book Crying of Lot 49 as an example. This term is also used by Eleanore M. Jewett in her 1946 book The Hidden Treasure of Glaston.
As used in psychology
"Chapel perilous" is also a term referring to a psychological state in which an individual is uncertain whether some course of events was affected by a supernatural force, or was a product of their own imagination. It was used by writer and philosopher Robert Anton Wilson in his 1977 book Cosmic Trigger. According to Wilson, being in this state leads the subject to become either paranoid or an agnostic. In his opinion there is no third way.
The term "chapel perilous" was used by Antero Alli, in his 1986 book, Angel Tech: A Modern Shaman's Guide to Reality Selection which is based on Timothy Leary's eight-circuit model of consciousness. In Alli's book chapel perilous is a rite of passage, when moving between the four lower circuits of consciousness to the higher circuits.

is a Japanese professional sumo wrestler from Chiba Prefecture. He made his debut in November 2015 and reached the top makuuchi division in March 2020. He wrestles for Sadogatake stable. His highest rank has been maegashira 2. He is the son of former sekiwake Kotonowaka Terumasa (who is also his stablemaster) and grandson of 53rd yokozuna Kotozakura Masakatsu.
Early life
Kamatani was born on November 19, 1997, the only child of then top division sumo wrestler Kotonowaka Terumasa. Kotonowaka had married the daughter of his stablemaster, former yokozuna Kotozakura. In November 2005 when Kamatani was in the second year of elementary school his father retired and took over the running of Sadogatake stable. Kamatani was in the Fukuoka International Center to witness his father's final bout, and his father told him to one day inherit the Kotonowaka name. He was in his third year of Saitama Sakae High School (well-known for its sumo club) and had won the gold medal in the heavyweight division at the World Junior Sumo Championships when he decided to enter professional sumo at the age of 17.
Career
Kamatani made his professional sumo debut in November 2015 under the shikona . He won all three of his maezumo bouts and in the following tournament in January 2016 won the jonokuchi championship with a perfect 7–0 record. He made the makushita division in September 2016, and in May 2019 a 4–3 record at makushita 2 was enough to earn promotion to the sekitori ranks for the first time. He adopted his father's shikona surname of Kotonowaka upon the promotion, with the expectation that he would eventually adopt his grandfather's shikona of Kotozakura if ever promoted to ōzeki.
With four straight kachi-koshi or winning records in the jūryō division, Kotonowaka was promoted to the top makuuchi division in March 2020. They were the ninth father-and-son pairing to both reach the top division. Kotonowaka was ranked at maegashira 18, the first time since 1959 that maegashira had extended to an 18th rank. He secured a winning record on the 14th day of the tournament, having suffered four straight losses, and finished on 9–6. The next tournament to take place in July 2020 saw him pull out with a knee injury on Day 8, which he sustained the previous day in a loss to Kaisei. He re-entered on Day 14 but was unable to add any more wins, finishing on 4–6–5 which saw him demoted back to jūryō. He earned immediate promotion back to makuuchi for the November 2020 tournament with a 9–6 record (although he lost his last four matches).
Upon his return to makuuchi Kotonowaka only managed a 7–8 record (this time losing his last three matches) although it was enough to keep him in the top division as he fell just one place from maegashira 14 to 15. He performed better in the January 2021 tournament, scoring 10–5. He narrowly failed to get a majority of wins in the March and May 2021 tournaments, scoring 6–9 and 7–8 respectively.
In the July 2021 tournament Kotonowaka had his best career performance to date. He scored 12–3 and was awarded his first special prize, for Fighting Spirit. He moved up to maegashira 3 for the September tournament. On the eighth day of the September tournament he defeated ōzeki Shōdai. However, he had to withdraw from the tournament with a left knee injury on Day 10.
In January 2022 Kotonowaka won eleven matches from 14, and was awarded the Fighting Spirit prize for the second time. In March Kotonowaka was in contention for the championship on the final day for the second straight tournament, but lost to Hōshōryū when victory would have given him a chance of a playoff with the other two contenders, Wakatakakage and Takayasu. He finished in third place with 11–4, but did receive his third Fighting Spirit prize. In the May 2022 tournament he reached 2.
Fighting style
Kotonowaka prefers a migi-yotsu grip on his opponent's mawashi which is an left hand outside, right hand inside position. He also lists oshi (pushing) asa a favourite style in his Japan Sumo Association profile. Apart from yori-kiri and oshi-dashi (force out and push out), his most common winning kimarite include uwatenage (overarm throw), tsukiotoshi (thrust over) and uwatedashinage (pulling overam throw).

Quepos is a district of the Quepos canton, in the Puntarenas province of Costa Rica.
Toponymy
The town is named for the native Quepo Indians who inhabited the place in the colonial era.
History
The area was home to the native Quepoa people of this specific Costa Rican region. In 1563, Spanish Catholic conquistadores, led by Juan Vázquez de Coronado, settled the area and founded the settlement of San Bernardino de Quepo. The local native Quepo people were then subsequently subjugated by Juan Vázquez and his conquistadores.
In 1746, the Quepo people that remained were transferred to a reservation which already contained another native ethnic group.
Quepos offers fishing for numerous varieties of fish, especially Pacific Sailfish. Peak fishing season is from November to April for billfish.
Geography
Quepos has an area of km² and an elevation of metres.
The town is about 60 km. south (in a straight line) from Costa Rica's capital, San José, but is 157 km from that city by road if going through the localities of Atenas, Orotina and Tárcoles.
Villages
Administrative center of the district is the town of Quepos.
Other villages are Anita, Bartolo, Boca Naranjo, Cañas, Cañitas, Cerritos, Cerros, Damas, Delicias, Espadilla, Estero Damas, Estero Garita, Llamarón, Llorona, Managua, Manuel Antonio, Marítima, Mona, Papaturro, Paquita, Pastora, Quebrada Azul, Rey, Ríos and Roncador.
Demographics
For the 2011 census, Quepos had a population of inhabitants.
Transportation
Road transportation
The district is covered by the following road routes:
National Route 34
National Route 235
National Route 616
National Route 618
Economy
Quepos is the gateway to Manuel Antonio National Park. The city is very tourism-oriented, having many bars and restaurants and a vivacious night-life.
Quepos is well known thanks to being the gateway to a popular National Park and beaches in Costa Rica. Several years ago the country's park service imposed limits on the number of visitors to the park (600 per day, and it is closed on Mondays).
Climate
Quepos has a tropical monsoon climate (Am) with moderate to little rainfall from January to March and heavy to very heavy rainfall in the remaining months.

Jemima Kindersley née Wickstead (1741–1809) was an English travel writer, noted for her Letters from the Island of Teneriffe, Brazil, the Cape of Good Hope and the East Indies (1777).
Life
Jemima Wickstead was born in Norwich on 2 October 1741. She was well educated and widely read. She married Colonel Nathaniel Kindersley, of the Bengal Artillery, in 1762 at Great Yarmouth. They had a son, Nathaniel Edward Kindersley (1763-1831). She set sail for India in June 1764, her husband having traveled there earlier, and arrived in Pondicherry in June 1765, stopping along the way in Tenerife, Brazil and South Africa. She stayed in India until 1769, and died in Bath in 1809.
Writings
Kindersley wrote an account of her long voyage to India, including five months at the Cape of Good Hope, in the form of 68 letters. These were published in 1777 by John Nourse under the title of "Letters from the Island of Teneriffe, Brazil, the Cape of Good Hope and the East Indies by Mrs. Kindersley", at the price of 3s 6d.
These letters were republished as volume 5 of the 8-volume Women's Travel Writing, 1750-1850 edited by Caroline Franklin (Routledge, 2000: ) and included in Routledge's online resource History of Feminism.
In 1781 she published a translation of Antoine Léonard Thomas's work as Essay on the Character, Manners and Understanding of Women, including two of her own essays.
Response to writings
In 1778 the Reverend Henry Hodgson published Letters to Mrs. Kindersley, described as "animadverting upon portions of that lady's "Letters from the Island of Teneriffe," etc."

SB-269970 is a drug and research chemical developed by GlaxoSmithKline used in scientific studies. It is believed to act as a selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonist (EC50 = 1.25 nM) (or possibly inverse agonist). A subsequent study in guinea pig at a concentration of 10 μM showed that it also blocks the α2-adrenergic receptor. The large difference in test concentrations however confirms the selectivity of SB-269970 for the 5-HT7 receptor.
SB-269970 is used to study the 5-HT7 receptors which are thought to be involved in the function of several areas of the brain such as the hippocampus and thalamus, and regulation of dopamine release in the ventral tegmental area. Possible therapeutic uses for SB-269970 and other 5-HT7 antagonists include the treatment of anxiety and depression, and nootropic effects have also been noted in animal studies.

The Nokia 6110 was a GSM mobile phone from Nokia announced on 18 December 1997 and released in 1998. It is not to be confused with the newer Nokia 6110 Navigator. It was a hugely popular follower of the Nokia 2110, and the first of the many Nokia 6xxx series business-targeted phones. Main improvements over the 2110 were reduced size and improved talk time. It was the first GSM phone to use an ARM processor, as well as the first running on Nokia's Series 20 user interface.
The phone shared the same platform as the Nokia 5110 targeted at the consumer market; unlike the 5110, however, it had the advanced user interface with menu icons (it was the first phone with this new interface that would become the future standard), and featured an infra-red port (once again being Nokia's first phone with it). It was also the first phone from Nokia to have the popular Snake game pre-installed.
It was succeeded/complemented by the similar but enhanced 6150.
Variants
Nokia 6190 is a version of the phone for the North American market, although the infra-red port was removed. Several non-GSM variants were also released aimed at the North American market, including the 800 MHz D-AMPS 6120 (not to be confused with the Nokia 6120 classic), the 800/1900 MHz D-AMPS 6160, and the 800/1900 MHz CDMA 6185. This was also known as the NK702 on the Orange UK network with a slightly different fascia, however the inside was identical. The GSM 1800 MHz variant was labeled 6130 and had the same exterior design changes, as the dual band GSM 900/1800 MHz 6150 model.
In Brazil, it was licensed for Gradiente to manufacture a variant of Nokia 6120. Such devices, very similar to those manufactured by Nokia, were marketed under the brand Gradiente Concept.

Abraham Serfaty (‎; January 16, 1926 – 18 November 2010) was an internationally prominent Moroccan dissident, militant, and political activist, who was imprisoned for years by King Hassan II of Morocco, for his political actions in favor of democracy , during the Years of Lead. He paid a high price for such actions: fifteen months living underground, seventeen years of imprisonment and eight years of exile. He returned to Morocco in September 1999.
Life and politics
Abraham Serfaty was born in Casablanca, on January 16, 1926, to a middle-class humanistic Moroccan Jewish family originally from Tangier. He graduated in 1949 from École des Mines de Paris, one of the most prominent French engineering schools.
His political activities started very early. In February 1944, he joined the Moroccan Youth Communists, and, upon his arrival in France in 1945, the French Communist Party. When he returned to Morocco in 1949, he joined the Moroccan Communist Party. His anti-colonialist activities had him arrested and jailed by the French authorities, and in 1950 he was assigned a forced residence in France for six years.
Shortly after Morocco's independence in 1956, he encumbered several, more technical than political, posts and was part of the Ministry of Economy from 1957 to 1960. During that time, he has been one of the many promoters of the new mining policy of the newly independent Morocco. From 1960 to 1968, he was the director of the Research-Development of the Cherifian Office of Phosphates, but was revoked of his duties because of his solidarity with miners during a strike. From 1968 to 1972, he taught at the Engineers School of Mohammedia, and at the same time, collaborated at the "Souffles/Anfas" artistic journal, headed by Abdellatif Laabi.
Abraham Serfaty was a Moroccan Jew, and an anti-Zionist Jew who did not recognize the State of Israel and was outraged by what he saw as the mistreatment of the Palestinians.
In 1970, Serfaty left the Communist Party, which he considered to be too doctrinarian and became deeply involved in the establishment of a Marxist-Leninist left-wing organization called "Ila al-Amam" (En Avant in French, Forward in English). In January 1972, he was arrested for the first time and savagely tortured, but released after heavy popular pressure. As he was again targeted for his continuing fight, Serfaty went underground in March 1972, with one of his friends Abdellatif Zeroual, who was also wanted by the authorities. It was then that he met for the first time Christine Daure, a French teacher who then helped both men to hide.
After several months of hiding, Abraham Serfaty and Abdellatif Zeroual were arrested again in 1974. After their arrest, Abdellatif Zeroual died, a victim of torture. In October 1974, at the "Derb Moulay Chérif", center of interrogation in Casablanca, Abraham Serfaty was one of five prisoners sentenced to life in prison. He was officially charged with "plotting against the State's security", but the heavy sentence seemed to have been more a result for his attitude against the annexing of the Western Sahara, even if this motif did not appear in the official indictment, than his political activism. He then served seventeen years at the Kenitra prison, where, thanks to Danielle Mitterrand's help, he was able to marry his biggest supporter, Christine Daure.
Exile and return
International pressure was enough in Serfaty's favor that he was finally released from prison in September 1991, but immediately exiled from Morocco and deprived of his Moroccan nationality on grounds that his father was Brazilian. He found a haven in France, with his wife, Christine Daure-Serfaty. From 1992 to 1995, Serfaty taught at the University of Paris-VIII, in the department of political sciences, on the theme of "identities and democracy in the Arab world".
Eight years after his exile and two months after the death of King Hassan II, he was finally allowed by King Mohammed VI to return to Morocco in September 1999, and had his Moroccan citizenship restored. He then settled at Mohammedia with his wife Christine in a house made available to them, even receiving a monthly stipend. In the same year, he was appointed Advisor to the National Moroccan Office of Research and Oil Exploitation (Onarep). This nomination did not stop him for asking then Moroccan Prime Minister Abderrahmane Youssoufi to resign after attacks on the independent newspapers and magazines and restrictions of their rights and freedom of speech. Serfaty died in Marrakech, Morocco in November 2010.
Abraham Serfaty was the co-author, with his wife Christine, of the book The Other's Memory (La Mémoire de l'Autre), published in 1993.
Views on Zionism
Abraham Serfaty was a fervent anti-Zionist, to the extent that he declared that Zionism had nothing to do with Judaism. He moreover stated that the Jews had no right to Palestine, especially Jerusalem and the Western Wall. He led several demonstrations supporting the Palestinian people, especially during Israeli air raids on Gaza, stating that Jerusalem was the capital of Palestine and that Israelis had no right to it.
In "Prison Writings on Palestine", he writes:“Zionism is above all a racist ideology. She is the Jewish reverse of Hitlerism [...]It proclaims the State of Israel "a Jewish state above all," just as Hitler proclaimed an Aryan Germany."
Death
Abraham Serfaty died on November 18, 2010, at the age of 84 in a clinic in Marrakech.
Only two official representatives of the Moroccan Jewish community were present at his burial. His funeral at the Jewish cemetery in Rabat was solely attended by Moroccan Muslims, on account of his political stance regarding the Palestinian issue.

Descurainia sophia is a member of the family Brassicaceae. Common names include flixweed, herb-Sophia and tansy mustard. It reproduces by seeds. It is a dominant weed in dark brown prairie and black prairie soils of southern Alberta. Its stem is erect, branched, and high. It was once given to patients with dysentery and called by ancient herbalists Sophia Chirurgorum, "The Wisdom of Surgeons". It is the type species of the genus Descurainia (named for French botanist and herbalist François Descurain (1658–1749)) and of the rejected genus Sophia Adans.
Culinary use
In Iran, the seeds are called khak-e shir (khakshir), and khak-e shir drinks are traditionally favored as thirst quencher during hot summer days. Khakshir is also considered a medicinal substance in traditional Iranian medicine, consumed in varying combinations with other herbs and substances to gain effects ranging from antidiuretic to aphrodisiac.
China has a tradition of eating this plant, and its eating method is recorded in the Jiuhuang Bencao.
Cultural
In German, it is called the Sophienkraut and associated with Saint Sophia of Rome, who was invoked against late frosts.

Stacey Pullen is an American techno musician based in Detroit, Michigan, United States.
Pullen was raised in Detroit, where he became interested in electronic music early in his life. He began working on the Detroit techno scene in 1990, studying with Derrick May and working with him on business ventures. He used the aliases Bango, Kosmik Messenger, X-Stacy and Silent Phase. Pullen's incorporation of house and garage with techno has been cited as an influence on later electronic artists.
Musical style
Pullen's music direction was strongly inspired by Derrick May, Juan Atkins and Kevin Saunderson, collectively referred to as the Belleville Three. Derrick May directly mentored Pullen, helping refine his sound, production skills and overall work ethic. Other peers included the next generation of Detroit producers, including Carl Craig and Jeff Mills, though musically Pullen sought a medium between Craig's futurism and Mills' raw minimalism.
Pullen also obtained recording deals with labels such as R&S and Plink Plonk, run by former Shamen frontman Mr C.
His album Today Is the Tomorrow You Were Promised Yesterday, released on Virgin imprint Science, meanwhile, departed from the Detroit sound in favour of jazz/funk grooves, prompting comparisons to the work of Herbie Hancock.

Funeral biscuits were a type of biscuit traditionally served at funerals in England, Wales, Scotland, and North America.
The Gentleman's Magazine described funeral biscuits in 1790. The writer described them as "a kind of sugared biscuit, which are wrapped up, generally two of them together, in a sheet of wax paper, sealed with black wax." The biscuits were given to each person attending the funeral, and were a custom of the funerals of "lower and the middling class of people." In Lincolnshire, funeral biscuits were part of the tradition of telling the bees of their owner's death in the early 19th century.
In early North America, the biscuits were stamped with burial motifs or symbols, such as a winged head or cherub, or an hourglass or skull.
Throughout the 19th century, British newspapers carried advertisements for commercially-prepared biscuits. Prepared biscuits were common in the period; a story printed in an 1877 edition of the Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine noted, The world must go round as usual, and folks must eat and drink even when their nearest and best are lying low. The manufacture of funeral biscuits is, we are all aware, quite a flourishing concern.
By the late Victorian period, the phrase "lady fingers" was used in some places interchangeably with funeral biscuits. An 1897 article in the New York Times noted, "The American fashion of serving 'lady fingers' at afternoon tea is said to be a source of some surprise to English people, for the little cakes are generally known in England as 'funeral biscuits,' and are served in rural districts to the mourners after their drive to the cemetery. Similarly, an 1893 article in the New Orleans Daily Picayune noted, Ladyfingers are served in all parts of England, with light refreshments, at funerals, and usually go by the name of 'funeral biscuits.' In the Yorkshire Dales, if you are asked to a funeral and are unable to attend, they usually send you, with a memorial card, a piece of spongecake and several ladyfingers folded in a sheet of black-bordered paper and fastened with big, black seals.The tradition of funeral biscuits continued in Wales into the early 20th century:In some places it is the custom to send to the friends of a family, after a death, a bag of biscuits with the card of the deceased. These funeral biscuits - often small, round sponge cakes - were known as arvel bread - arvel meaning ale. When arvel bread is passed around at a funeral each guest is expected to put a shilling on the plate.

Harry Griffiths (1895 – 1987) was a Reverend who worked for the Methodist Inland Mission in Alice Springs; Northern Territory and is best remembered for establishing Griffiths House as well as designing and opening the ANZAC Hill memorial.
Early life
English born Griffiths married his wife, Dorothy, after he was 'invalided out' of the British Army for injuries received as a medical orderly; serving in France during World War I. Griffiths was advised to move to a warmer climate and, not qualifying for assistance, he and Dorothy saved for the fares and initially settled in Melbourne.
When in Melbourne Griffiths became a home missionary and started the process to become ordained: during this process he was appointed to Katherine, Northern Territory.
Life in the Northern Territory
In Katherine Griffiths went on patrols in the local area, often assisted by Dorothy who also helped isolated children with their correspondence lessons and taught Sunday School. The couple lived at the manse which they frugally furnished with beer cartons and tea crates.
Immediately following Griffiths ordination the couple were moved to Alice Springs where, in addition to his work as a Reverend, he offered medical and dental help; he went as far as to use his International work truck as an ambulance.
Shortly after their arrival Griffiths, as chairman of the trustees of the Returned and Services League of Australia, lobbied for the flat area around (what is now known as) ANZAC Hill to be set aside as a recreational reserve and also suggested a memorial be erected on top of ANZAC Hill. He designed the memorial and opened and dedicated it with a public address on ANZAC Day, 25 April 1934.
With the outbreak of World War II Griffiths was commissioned as an Army Chaplin and during the war worked in the Northern Territory, Victoria and Palestine. During the War Griffiths started work on the construction of Griffiths House, which was originally designed to be a hostel for young single people who had moved to Alice Springs for work, but by the time it was opened (on 5 July 1941), plans had already changed and it was immediately converted in to a social club for soldiers stationed in Alice Springs. After the war, and opening in 1945, the house was converted to provide hostel accommodation for children from remote areas of Central Australia so that they could attend school.
Griffiths was also chairman of the Alice Springs Progress Association.
Later life
Griffiths and Dorothy left Alice Springs in 1952 when they moved to Murray Bridge.
Griffiths ashes were buried at ANZAC Hill in 1987.

"Tom, Tom, the Piper's Son" is a popular English language nursery rhyme. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 19621.
Lyrics
Modern versions of the rhyme include:
Tom, Tom, the piper's son,
Stole a pig, and away did run;
The pig was eaten
And Tom was beat,
And Tom went [or "which sent him"] crying [or "roaring", or "howling", in some versions]
Down the street.
The 'pig' mentioned in the song is almost certainly not a live animal but rather a kind of pastry, often made with an apple filling, smaller than a pie. And the meaning of the rhyme involves a naughty boy named Tom whose father was a piper, and he steals the "pig", eats it, and after his father (or someone else) physically chastises him, Tom cries all the way down the street.
Another version of the rhyme is:
Tom, Tom, the piper's son,
Stole a pig, and away he run.
Tom run here,
Tom run there,
Tom run through the village square.
This rhyme is often conflated with a separate and longer rhyme:
Tom, he was a piper's son,
He learnt to play when he was young,
And all the tune that he could play
Was 'over the hills and far away';
Over the hills and a great way off,
The wind shall blow my top-knot off.
Tom with his pipe made such a noise,
That he pleased both the girls and boys,
They all stopped to hear him play,
'Over the hills and far away'.
Tom with his pipe did play with such skill
That those who heard him could never keep still;
As soon as he played they began for to dance,
Even the pigs on their hind legs would after him prance.
As Dolly was milking her cow one day,
Tom took his pipe and began to play;
So Dolly and the cow danced 'The Cheshire Round',
Till the pail was broken and the milk ran on the ground.
He met old Dame Trot with a basket of eggs,
He used his pipe and she used her legs;
She danced about till the eggs were all broke,
She began for to fret, but he laughed at the joke.
Tom saw a cross fellow was beating an ass,
Heavy laden with pots, pans, dishes, and glass;
He took out his pipe and he played them a tune,
And the poor donkey's load was lightened full soon.
Origins
Both rhymes were first printed separately in a Tom the Piper's Son, a chapbook produced around 1795 in London, England. The origins of the shorter and better known rhyme are unknown.
The second, longer rhyme was an adaptation of an existing verse which was current in England around the end of the seventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth centuries. The following verse, known as "The Distracted Jockey's Lamentations", may have been written for (but not included in) Thomas D'Urfey's play The Campaigners (1698):
Jockey was a Piper's Son,
And fell in love when he was young;
But all the Tunes that he could play,
Was, o'er the Hills, and far away,
And 'Tis o'er the Hills, and far away,
'Tis o'er the Hills, and far away,
'Tis o'er the Hills, and far away,
The Wind has blown my Plad away.
This verse seems to have been adapted for a recruiting song designed to gain volunteers for the Duke of Marlborough's campaigns about 1705, with the title "The Recruiting Officer; or The Merry Volunteers", better today known as "Over the Hills and Far Away", in which the hero is called Tom.

The 1934 Saskatchewan general election was held on June 19, 1934, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.
The Liberal Party of former Premier James Gardiner was returned to power with a large majority – 50 of the 55 seats in the legislature – after the four year Conservative minority government interlude.
After forming a coalition government to oust the Liberals from power after the 1929 election, James T.M. Anderson's Conservative government had tried to use anti-Catholic and anti-French Canadian feeling in the province to win support. The Conservatives also had the support of the Ku Klux Klan, which was a significant force in the province at the time. The Tories also had to contend with the effects of the Great Depression and the Prairie dust bowl, however; and although they won about a quarter of the popular vote, they won no seats in the legislature. The Conservatives remained a minor force in Saskatchewan politics for 40 years after this defeat.
The Tories' allies in the previous legislature – the Progressives – did not nominate candidates in this election, and were replaced by Farmer-Labour candidates as the voice of the Left in the province.

The National COVID-19 Commission Advisory Board (NCC) is the Australian Government strategic advisory board for the national economic recovery to the COVID-19 pandemic. Originally formed as the National COVID-19 Coordination Commission on 25 March 2020, Prime Minister Scott Morrison described the body as responsible for advising the government on public–private partnerships and coordination to mitigate the social and economic impacts of the pandemic in Australia. On 22 July 2020, the commission was renamed the National COVID-19 Commission Advisory Board to better reflect the advisory, not executive, nature of the body.
Executive Board membership
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that membership of the Executive Board of the National COVID-19 Coordination Commission would consist of leaders from the private and public sectors.
The roles and membership were changed on 22 July 2020, with the commission becoming an advisory board. Entering into advisory roles were: Jane Halton, Paul Little, Catherine Tanna, David Thodey, Laura Berry, Samantha Hogg, Su McCluskey, Bao Hoang, Mike Hirst, and Paul Howes. In addition, the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Philip Gaetjens, and Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs Mike Pezzullo, assist the board.
Greg Combet was an inaugural commissioner for the National COVID-19 Coordination Commission but departed the board in July 2020.

Herbert George Simms (30 November 189828 September 1948) was an English architect who worked as an architect for Dublin Corporation.
Early life and education
He was the eldest of six children of George William Simms, a train driver and former shepherd, originally of Fawley, Buckinghamshire and his wife Nellie (née Worster) originally of Hemel Hempstead. His father had four older children from a previous marriage.
He lived with the family on Prince of Wales Road, Kentish Town and was educated at the Haverstock Industrial and Commercial School. By 1911 the family had moved to 33 Victoria Road, with Herbert the oldest of the children still at home.
Military career
During the First World War he served in the Royal Field Artillery. He was awarded an ex-service scholarship of £150 and tuition fees which allowed him to study architecture at Liverpool University.
Architectural education
He began studies in October 1919 but had to abandon them for financial reasons when the three years ended. He had received the Certificate in Architecture in 1921 and passed the third and fourth years of the Diploma course. On grounds of previous office work and the standard of his studies he was permitted to sit the course for the Certificate in Civic Design which he was awarded in March 1923.
Architectural career
After university he moved to Dublin, where he worked for a while in the office of Aubrey Vincent O'Rourke. In February 1925 he was appointed temporary architect to Dublin Corporation , working under Horace Tennyson O'Rourke, a role that was gradually extended and lasted until December 1927. In 1926 he was authorised to visit London, Liverpool and Manchester to examine the latest developments in flats.
In 1932 or 1933 a separate housing architect's department was formed to focus on the building of new houses and Simms was appointed to the new role of Corporation housing architect. He immediately recruited staff to work in the department. In the sixteen years he was in the post he was responsible for the construction of 17,000 residences, including both flats and houses.
His work on flats showed influences by Michel de Klerk, Jacobus Oud and Johannes van Hardeveld.
Personal life
He married Eileen Clarke, daughter of Garda Superintendent Thomas Clarke on 30 September 1929.
Death
After Horace O'Rourke retired in 1945, the pressure on Simms increased.
He had already suffered one nervous breakdown fifteen years before and on 28 September 1948 he took his own life by throwing himself under a train at Dún Laoghaire. A suicide note said that he felt overwork was threatening his sanity. He was buried in Deans Grange Cemetery.

Zafer al-Masri (; 1940 2 March 1986) was the Israel-appointed Mayor of Nablus, for a brief period of two months (January to March 1986). He had taken office in January 1986 as mayor in Nablus, the largest Arab town in the West Bank to replace an Israeli army officer who had served as an Israeli-appointed administrator for Nablus for the previous four years (1982-1986) after the removal of Bassam Shakaa the former elected Arab mayor of Nablus in 1982 for the latter's pro-PLO positions.
Life
In 1982, most Palestinian-elected mayors including Shakaa had been removed by the Menachem Begin administration. With Shimon Peres as new Israeli premier, the Israeli authorities considered Nablus as a test and were said to be planning to install other Arab mayors in Ramallah, El Bireh and Hebron. Peres had said on many occasions that it would be advantageous to Israel and the Arab Palestinian populace in the administered territories to have Palestinians administer their municipal affairs.
Prior to his appointment as mayor, until December 1985, Zafer al-Masri headed the Nablus Chamber of Commerce. His appointment as Nablus mayor by Israel had been approved by Jordan and by the relatively moderate elements of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) after some 18 months of indirect contacts between Israel and Jordan. Al-Masri rejected the Israeli autonomy proposals and focused on improving conditions in Nablus. He reduced the price of electricity and begun work on extending the grid. All former employees, who had been on strike since Bassam Shakaa's removal, were re-instated and long delayed building permits were approved. His murder was viewed as a serious setback for moderate elements seeking to involve Palestinians along with Jordan in peace talks with Israel.
Al-Masri came from a prominent Palestinian family which has been active in Jordanian political life and in Arab states of the Persian Gulf. His brother, Hikmat al-Masri, was the Deputy Speaker of the Jordanian Parliament and his other brother Sabih al-Masri is a billionaire and chairman of the Jordan-based Arab Bank. His cousin, Taher al-Masri, was Jordan's Foreign Minister. Another cousin, the billionaire Munib al-Masri, is reportedly the wealthiest person in Palestine.
Death
Zafer al-Masri was assassinated on 2 March 1986 only two months after he took his office. A Palestinian moderate, he had close ties with Jordan. Al-Masri was shot to death by Mu'ayyad Abdul Samad as he stepped from his car near the Nablus City Hall. Al-Masri was shot several times in the heart. He was taken to Rashadiye Hospital and died on the operating table. Almost 50,000 Palestinians took part in his funeral on 3 March 1986.
It is widely believed he was killed by Abdul Samad by the orders of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). PFLP had accused him of "collaboration with Israel". Abdul Samad was arrested and indicted for the murder receiving life imprisonment for his act. Although another group, the Fatah Revolutionary Council, a Palestinian splinter group led by Abu Nidal, also claimed responsibility initially for the attack, this latter claim has been refuted with responsibility of PFLP clearly established.
Al-Masri was the third Palestinian mayor or ex-mayor to fall victim to an assassin in little more than two years. Fahed Kawasme, the former mayor of Hebron, had been gunned down in Amman, Jordan on 30 December 1984. He had lived there since being deported by Israel in 1980 for pro-PLO activities. On 4 September 1984, Mayor Abdul Mahmoud Kishta of Rafa, in the Gaza Strip, was fatally wounded by bullets from a passing car on a street in Rafa.

Eating Us is the fourth studio album by Pennsylvania based band Black Moth Super Rainbow released on May 26, 2009 on the CD format. With a running time of just under 36 minutes, it is the shortest full-length release by the band to date. The album was released in a limited-edition "hairy" version, in which the CD case is stored inside a bag made of synthetic hair. The "hairy" version was sold out before the album was even released due to pre-orders. After many delays, Eating Us was released in a 180 gram "Audiophile" edition on black vinyl on April 6, 2010. A Double LP version, limited to 1000 copies, was released April 17, 2010 on Record Store Day. The Double LP is on Amber 150 gram vinyl with foil prints on sides b and d. Both LP versions come in Stoughton gatefold packaging done with foil printing.
BMSR leader Tobacco has noted his dissatisfaction with the album, stating that the majority of the songs were "90% done" and that producer Dave Fridmann "totally polished a turd." However, he also listed "Twin of Myself" and "Tooth Decay" as two of his favorite BMSR songs.

The Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan (Bavarian State Brewery of Weihenstephan) is a German brewery located on the site of the former Weihenstephan Abbey in Freising, Bavaria. In 2014, the total output was . The brewery advertises itself as "The World's Oldest Brewery".
History
Establishment
Until the 1950s, the brewery described its date of foundation as the year 1146. At this time, a document allegedly dating to the year 1040 resurfaced. In it, Otto I, Bishop of Freising bestowed a brewing right upon the abbey. The document is generally dismissed as a forgery from the early 1600s. The first written record of the brewery dates to the year 1675. Another source, dating to 768, indicates the presence of a hops garden nearby.
State Brewery
In 1803, as part of a larger wave of German secularization, Weihenstephan Abbey was dissolved. The cloister passed into the ownership of the Bavarian government, where it was incorporated as the Königlich Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan (Royal Bavarian Brewery Weihenstephan). In 1921, the brewery adopted its current name. Today, although it is fully owned by the government of Bavaria, it is run as a modern enterprise in line with private sector practices. The grounds around the brewery were developed into a campus of the Hochschule Weihenstephan-Triesdorf.
Awards
2016: Gold medal at the World Beer Cup, in the category South German-Style Hefeweizen, for Weihenstephaner Hefeweißbier.
2016: Silver medal at the World Beer Cup, in the category German-Style Wheat Ale, for Weihenstephaner Kristallweißbier.

Brian Keith Davis (born June 21, 1970) is an American former college and professional basketball player. A 6'7" guard-forward, Davis played both football and basketball at Bladensburg High School. He then played four years of basketball at Duke University, appearing in 141 career games, and was a member of the back-to-back national championship teams of 1991 and 1992.
After graduation, Davis played in the French league with Élan Béarnais Pau-Orthez during the 1992–93 season alongside seven-foot-seven Gheorghe Muresan, and then returned to the NBA for the 1993–94 season with the Minnesota Timberwolves, where he played alongside Duke teammate Christian Laettner. Davis played in 68 NBA games, averaged 5.5 minutes per game, and scored a total of 131 career points (1.9 per game).
He maintains a close friendship with Laettner, and they partnered on a $2 million donation to Duke's men's basketball program to endow an athletic scholarship and support construction of an athletics center and practice facility. They have also pursued several business ventures together, including real estate development in Durham, a Major League Soccer team, and an unsuccessful attempt to purchase the Memphis Grizzlies. Some legal problems have also occurred.

Hofkapelle Stuttgart, historically the Württemberg Hofkapelle is a German orchestra based in Stuttgart which has existed since the 16th century. It was the band of the House of Württemberg. Since 2002, it is an orchestra founded by Frieder Bernius to play Baroque music in historically informed performance.
In 1617 it consisted of 50 "excellent singers" and was affiliated with the royal chamber music ensemble. In 1699, eleven "Kapellknaben" (chapel boys) performed. From 1736 to 1750, the chapel made singers and Kapellknaben available for opera performances, the chapel choir was transformed to the opera choir, while an orchestra took the name Hofkapelle.
In 1818, Johann Nepomuk Hummel introduced subscription concerts, promoting the development of the orchestra to a modern symphony orchestra.
History
The Hofkapelle (court chapel) of Württemberg was established in 1496 by Duke Eberhard II for the playing of religious music at court. At that time, it was made up by a boys' choir and vocal and musical instrumentalists.
In 1498, Eberhard II was deposed by Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor at the request of the Estates of Württemberg, and the Hofkapelle was suspended. He was replaced as Duke with his nephew, Ulrich. Ulrich reestablished the Hofkapelle, but also opened a school for the boys' choir and lavished money on benefices for the Hofkapelle's members. This and other extravagant expenditures and Ulrich's methods of supporting them made him extremely unpopular. He was expelled in 1519 by the military might of the Swabian League, who then sold the Duchy of Württemberg to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. The Hofkapelle continued to play at court while the Duchy was controlled by the House of Habsburg.

KPHE-LD (channel 44) is a low-power television station in Phoenix, Arizona, United States, affiliated with the Spanish-language LATV network. It is owned by Gray Television alongside CBS affiliate KPHO-TV (channel 5) and independent station KTVK (channel 3). KPHE-LD's transmitter is located atop South Mountain.
History
On March 17, 1992, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted an original construction permit to build low-power television station K19DD on UHF channel 19 to serve Phoenix and the East Valley. The station was owned by Scottsdale publisher Harlan L. Jacobsen, with transmitter location on Usery Mountain in east Mesa. K19DD was granted an initial license on July 13, 1995, as an affiliate of the Bloomberg Television network. In June 1998, Jacobsen was granted a construction permit to operate an experimental broadcast station using the facilities of K19DD to broadcast in digital format.
In September 1999, Jacobsen sold the station to US Interactive LLC, who soon afterward, changed its call letters to KPHE-LP. In December 2000, the station became part of a pilot program to study the feasibility of using low-power UHF television stations to deliver wireless data services to subscribers. The Digital Data Services Act pilot project was effective from December 2000 through June 2002, during which time, KPHE was unavailable as an over-the-air analog broadcast station.
After the pilot project was complete, KPHE programming consisted of a camera focused on a fish tank. Viewers could watch the fish while music played in the background. That changed in October 2003, when Valley residents Jeff Crawford and Jennifer Harris Crawford leased the station from US Interactive and took over its operations. The Crawfords had been operating a music video service called Bohemia AfterDark since 1982, and launched Bohemia Visual Music (BVM), a 24/7 music video channel.
In January 2004, Lotus Communications purchased KPHE from US Interactive. The sale was finalized in March, and the station continued to be operated by the Crawfords as Bohemia Visual Music. Lotus had intended to launch family-friendly Spanish-language programming, but the station continued to air Bohemia Visual Music. In March 2005, KPHE moved from channel 19 to channel 44, moved broadcast facilities from Usery Mountain to the South Mountain antenna farm, and upgraded its broadcast signal in preparation for future digital broadcasting.
In July 2006, more than a year after announcing its intention to launch a family-focused station, Lotus replaced Bohemia Visual Music programming, first with a mix of music videos, including recorded worship services, and later, with talk shows and other Bible-based instruction. The new programming was branded TV Inspiración. It was lacking in production values, and had an amateur, almost public-access television cable TV-quality presentation. KPHE affiliated with Multimedios in November 2006, while keeping TV Inspiración as secondary programming. In February 2007, KPHE announced that it would carry Spanish-language telecasts of Arizona Diamondbacks Major League Baseball home games, beginning with the 2007 season. Unlike most Spanish-language telecasts, the Diamondbacks games featured a full Spanish-language broadcast, with its own play-by-play, color commentary and on-field announcers. 50 games a season were aired in 2007 and in 2008; original plans called for 75 games in 2009, but the team dropped the deal because KPHE was unable to secure a slot on the local Cox Communications system. In June 2007, the channel started to broadcast half-hour religious programs produced by Zion TV from 11:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Monday-Sunday.
From March until June 2009, KPHE-LD aired Red ADVenir on 44.2, the Spanish-language broadcast arm of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
In August 2010, KPHE-LD started broadcasting programming from My Family TV on 44.4. In June 2012, LarsaVisión replaced Good News TV in Español on 44.2 as it moved KTVP-LD 22.4. Good News TV then followed moving from 44.3 to 22.1 in July. In April 2013, the station dropped Multimedios programming and became an affiliate of CNN Latino. KPHE also began broadcasting a secondary feed of Telemax and local programming on 44.2 when airing CNN Latino on its main channel.
On March 11, 2022, Gray Television (owner of CBS affiliate KPHO-TV and independent station KTVK) filed an application to acquire KPHE-LD for $1.75 million. The sale was completed on May 4. Gray did not disclose its future plans for the station.

Analog-to-digital conversion
In May 2006, the FCC opened up a brief application period in which low-power television licensees and permittees could apply for a digital companion channel by short form application. KPHE-LP applied for UHF channel 16, to broadcast from the same location as the analog station. In September, the FCC identified the station as a singleton applicant, meaning that there were no competing applications on the same or adjacent channels, and giving the station until October 31 to file a long form application. On October 26, 2006, KPHE-LP formally applied for a digital companion channel on UHF channel 16. The construction permit was granted December 26, 2007.
On March 26, 2009, they turned on their digital signal, KPHE-LD, simulcasting their analog programming through the use of PSIP on channel 44.1.

The 50th Battalion was an infantry battalion of the Australian Army. It was originally raised in Egypt in early 1916 for service during World War I, drawing a cadre of experienced personnel from the 10th Battalion. After the unit's formation, it was transferred to Europe where it took part in the fighting in the trenches of the Western Front in France and Belgium. Following the end of hostilities, the battalion was amalgamated with the 51st Battalion in early 1919 as demobilisation reduced the numbers in both battalions. In the inter war period, the battalion was briefly reformed in 1921 as a part-time unit based initially in South Australia and then later in Tasmania. At different periods it was amalgamated with both the 10th and 12th Battalions. The battalion did not see combat during World War II, being employed as garrison troops in Australia instead, and it was disbanded in mid-1945.
History
World War I
The 50th Battalion was originally raised in Egypt on 26 February 1916, as part of the reorganisation and expansion of the AIF following the Gallipoli campaign and prior to the transfer of the Australian infantry formations to the Western Front in Europe. This expansion was achieved by transferring cadres of experienced personnel predominately from the 1st Division to the newly formed battalions and combining them with recently recruited personnel who had been dispatched as reinforcements from Australia. With an authorised strength of just over 1,000, the unit's first intake of personnel were drawn from men originating from South Australia, many of whom had already served with the 10th Battalion. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Hurcombe, the battalion became part of the 13th Brigade attached to the 4th Australian Division.
After arriving in France on 11 June 1916, the battalion was committed to the fighting, moving up to front on 28 June. Its first major action came during the Battle of Mouquet Farm during August and September, during which the 50th suffered over 400 casualties. Following this, it saw service attacking the Hindenburg Line in 1917. During actions at Noreuil on 2 April of that year, Private Jørgen Jensen performed the deeds that led to him being awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). Later in the year the 50th Battalion participated in the battles at Messines and Polygon Wood. At Messines, the 50th were initially used to provide carrying parties for the assault, before launching an attack around Blauwepoortbeek late on 9 June. Lacking artillery support, the attack was held up when it came up against uncut wire entanglements and machine guns. A scheduled relief was cancelled and second effort was made the following morning, this time with artillery support, and this succeeded in gaining part of the Oosttaverne Line. The Australians were relieved on 11 June, but before this took place a patrol from the 50th helped soldiers from the British 11th Division occupy Delporte Farm. In late September, during the fighting around Polygon Wood, the battalion took part in the 13th Brigade's attack against the Tokio Spur. Advancing towards Molenaarelsthoek, the attack proved successful and subsequently held the line against a German counterattack that was broken up by defensive artillery and machine guns. The battalion's losses around Polygon Wood amounted to 221 killed or wounded.
In early 1918, it undertook a defensive role south of the Ancre, helping to repulse the German spring offensive, a major German offensive that was launched on the Western Front following the collapse of Russia. In early April, the battalion took part in the Second Battle of Dernancourt. Later that month, on the morning of 24/25 April 1918—Anzac Day—the battalion took part in an Allied counter-attack at Villers-Bretonneux, in Belgium. In August, the 50th joined the final Allied offensive of the war around Amiens, and continued fighting until 18 September when it fought its last battle of the war against the Hindenburg "Outpost Line", forming the divisional reserve. After the cessation of hostilities, the 50th Battalion was amalgamated with the 51st Battalion on 6 March 1919; together they were later also amalgamated with the 49th Battalion.
During the fighting, the battalion lost 720 men killed in action or died on active service and 1,557 wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: one VC, one Distinguished Service Order (DSO) with one Bar, one Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), 16 Military Crosses (MCs) with two Bars, 16 Distinguished Conduct Medals (DCMs), 122 Military Medals (MMs) with five Bars, eight Meritorious Service Medals (MSMs), 25 Mentions in Despatches (MIDs) and eight foreign awards.
Inter-war years and World War II
In 1921, the battalion was re-raised as part the re-organisation of the Australian military that took place at that time. Assigned to the 4th Military District, the battalion was raised as a part-time unit in South Australia, drawing personnel from the Citizen Forces' 50th Infantry Regiment. In 1927, the battalion adopted the territorial designation of the "Barrier Regiment". In 1930, amidst the austerity of the Great Depression and following the election of the Scullin Labor government and the subsequent suspension of the compulsory training scheme, the decision was made to amalgamate the battalion due to a decline in the numbers of volunteers. At this time it was merged with the 10th Battalion, with whom they had a shared history, to become the "10th/50th Battalion" assigned to the 3rd Brigade.
These battalions remained linked until 1936 when, in response to fears of a possible war in Europe following the reoccupation of the Rhineland, it was decided to expand the size of the Militia. As a result, on 1 October 1936 the 10th/50th Battalion was split. It was later transferred to the 6th Military District in Tasmania. It was then amalgamated with the 12th Battalion as the "12th/50th Battalion (The Launceston Regiment/The Tasmanian Rangers)" in December 1936. In 1939, the motto Quo fas et gloria ducunt was approved for the 12th/50th Battalion.
During World War II, the two battalions remained linked, undertaking garrison duties in Australia. The 12th/50th Battalion served as part of York Force and manned defences in the Northern Territory. On 2 May 1945, the 12th/50th Battalion was amalgamated with the 40th Battalion and became the 12th/40th Battalion with the 50th Battalion being disbanded. In 1966, following the reintroduction of national service, the Army authorised the re-raising of the 50th Battalion as part of the Royal Tasmania Regiment (50 RTR), as a remote area battalion within the Citizens Military Force, offering special conditions of service for national servicemen who could not meet their training requirements through normal attendance due to their occupation or place of residence. Ultimately, only a small number of special conditions soldiers were enlisted, and as a result 50 RTR was not re-raised, with the Tasmanian personnel instead being allocated to the 22nd Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment, which had also been raised as a remote area battalion.

The Volocopter VC2 is a German single-place experimental electric multirotor personal air vehicle that was built by Volocopter GmbH (formerly called E-Volo) of Bruchsal, Germany.
Design and development
The VC-2 is the second in a series of multirotor designs from the German company e-volo. The single-place, 16 motor, all-electric e-volo VC1 "Volocopter" was demonstrated on 21 October 2011. The VC2 is the next follow-on with 18 engines suspended around an aluminum truss frame that includes a center-mounted seat, battery, and Battery Management Unit. The proof-of-concept aircraft will be used to develop the E-volo VC Evolution 2P, a two-passenger enclosed volocopter with extended range and weight capabilities.
The VC200 was demonstrated unmanned in November 2013 at an enclosed arena in Karlsruhe, Germany. Two prototypes performed unmanned flight tests, with the first manned flight made on March 30, 2016 by Alexander Zosel.

A cryptocurrency exchange, or a digital currency exchange (DCE), is a business that allows customers to trade cryptocurrencies or digital currencies for other assets, such as conventional fiat money or other digital currencies. Exchanges may accept credit card payments, wire transfers or other forms of payment in exchange for digital currencies or cryptocurrencies. A cryptocurrency exchange can be a market maker that typically takes the bid–ask spreads as a transaction commission for is service or, as a matching platform, simply charges fees.
Some brokerages which also focus on other assets such as stocks, like Robinhood and eToro, let users purchase but not withdraw cryptocurrencies to cryptocurrency wallets. Dedicated cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase do allow cryptocurrency withdrawals, however.
Operation
The exchanges can send cryptocurrency to a user's personal cryptocurrency wallet. Some can convert digital currency balances into anonymous prepaid cards which can be used to withdraw funds from ATMs worldwide while other digital currencies are backed by real-world commodities such as gold.
The creators of digital currencies are often independent of the digital currency exchange that facilitate trading in the currency. In one type of system, digital currency providers (DCP) are businesses that keep and administer accounts for their customers, but generally do not issue digital currency to those customers directly. Customers buy or sell digital currency from digital currency exchanges, who transfer the digital currency into or out of the customer's DCP account. Some exchanges are subsidiaries of DCP, but many are legally independent businesses. The denomination of funds kept in DCP accounts may be of a real or fictitious currency.
A digital currency exchange can be a brick-and-mortar business or a strictly online business. As a brick-and-mortar business, it exchanges traditional payment methods and digital currencies. As an online business, it exchanges electronically transferred money and digital currencies.
Often, the digital currency exchanges operate outside the Western countries to avoid regulation and prosecution. However, they do handle Western fiat currencies and maintain bank accounts in several countries to facilitate deposits in various national currencies.
Decentralized exchanges such as Etherdelta, IDEX and HADAX do not store users' funds on the exchange, but instead facilitate peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading. Decentralized exchanges are resistant to security problems that affect other exchanges, but suffer from low trading volumes.
History
Early history
In 2004 three Australian-based digital currency exchange businesses voluntarily shut down following an investigation by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). The ASIC viewed the services offered as legally requiring an Australian Financial Services License, which the companies lacked.
In 2006, U.S.-based digital currency exchange business Gold Age Inc., a New York state business, was shut down by the U.S. Secret Service after operating since 2002. Business operators Arthur Budovsky and Vladimir Kats were indicted "on charges of operating an illegal digital currency exchange and money transmittal business" from their apartments, transmitting more than $30 million to digital currency accounts. Customers provided limited identity documentation, and could transfer funds to anyone worldwide, with fees sometimes exceeding $100,000. Budovsky and Kats were sentenced in 2007 to five years in prison "for engaging in the business of transmitting money without a license, a felony violation of state banking law", ultimately receiving sentences of five years' probation.
In April 2007, the U.S. government ordered E-Gold administration to lock/block approximately 58 E-Gold accounts owned and used by The Bullion Exchange, AnyGoldNow, IceGold, GitGold, The Denver Gold Exchange, GoldPouch Express, 1MDC (a Digital Gold Currency, based on e-gold) and others, forcing G&SR (owner of OmniPay) to liquidate the seized assets.
A few weeks later, E-Gold faced four indictments.
In July 2008, WebMoney changed its rules, affecting many exchanges. Since that time it became prohibited to exchange WebMoney to the most popular e-currencies like E-gold, Liberty Reserve and others.
Also in July 2008 E-gold's three directors accepted a bargain with the prosecutors and pleaded guilty to one count of "conspiracy to engage in money laundering" and one count of the "operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business". E-gold ceased operations in 2009.
In 2013, Jean-Loup Richet, a research fellow at ESSEC ISIS, surveyed new money laundering techniques that cybercriminals were using in a report written for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. A common approach to cyber money laundering was to use a digital currency exchanger service which converted dollars into Liberty Reserve and could be sent and received anonymously. The receiver could convert the Liberty Reserve currency back into cash for a small fee. In May 2013, digital currency exchanger Liberty Reserve was shut down after the alleged founder, Arthur Budovsky Belanchuk, and four others were arrested in Costa Rica, Spain, and New York "under charges for conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy and operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business." Budovsky, a former U.S. citizen and naturalized Costa Rican, was convicted in connection with the 2006 Gold Age raid. More than $40 million in assets were placed under restraint pending forfeiture, and more than 30 Liberty Reserve exchanger domain names were seized. The company was estimated to have laundered $6 billion in criminal proceeds.
2014 to present
Following the launch of a decentralized cryptocurrency bitcoin in 2008 and the subsequent introduction of other cryptocurrencies, many virtual platforms were created specifically for the exchange of decentralized cryptocurrencies. Their regulation differs from country to country.
In February 2014, Mt. Gox, the largest cryptocurrency exchange at the time, suspended trading, closed its website and exchange service, and filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan from creditors. In April 2014, the company began liquidation proceedings. This was the result of a large theft of bitcoins that were stolen straight out of the Mt. Gox hot wallet over time, beginning in late 2011.
In December 2021 the MyCryptoWallet exchange called in liquidators. In June 2022, the US Securities and Exchange Commission launched an enquiry into Binance as legal enquiry into the entity and not the crypto products it was dealing in.
Examples
In early 2018, Bloomberg News reported the largest cryptocurrency exchanges based on the volume and estimated revenues data collected by CoinMarketCap. Similar statistics was reported on Statista in a survey by Encrybit to understand cryptocurrency exchange problems. According to the survey, the top three cryptocurrency exchanges are Binance, Huobi, and OKEX. Other data points in the survey included the problems that cryptocurrency traders experience with cryptocurrency exchanges and the expectation of traders. Security and high trading fees are the top concerns. The exchanges are all fairly new and privately held. Several do not report basic information such as the names of the owners, financial data, or even the location of the business.

Legislation
By 2016, several cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the European Union obtained licenses under the EU Payment Services Directive and the EU Electronic Money Directive. The adequacy of such licenses for the operation of a cryptocurrency exchange has not been judicially tested. The European Council and the European Parliament announced that they will issue regulations to impose stricter rules targeting exchange platforms.
In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission maintained that "if a platform offers trading of digital assets that are securities and operates as an "exchange," as defined by the federal securities laws, then the platform must register with the SEC as a national securities exchange or be exempt from registration". The Commodity Futures Trading Commission now permits the trading of cryptocurrency derivatives publicly.
Among the Asian countries, Japan is more forthcoming and regulations mandate the need for a special license from the Financial Services Authority to operate a cryptocurrency exchange. China and Korea remain hostile, with China banning bitcoin miners and freezing bank accounts. While Australia is yet to announce its conclusive regulations on cryptocurrency, it does require its citizens to disclose their digital assets for capital gains tax.

Gemini Rising (also known as Alien Rising) is a 2013 American Action Sci-Fi Thriller produced by Tim Anderson and directed by Dana Schroeder. The film stars Lance Henriksen, Amy Hathaway, John Savage, Brian Krause and Dave Vescio.
Plot
In 2023, an unidentified spacecraft is found orbiting Neptune and an investigation is started. Meanwhile, Lisa (Amy Hathaway), a special agent for the DEA witnesses what she thinks is the death of her best friend, Manning (John Savage), during a drug raid. She quits her job to become a dance teacher, but is soon recruited again for a secret mission, and shipped off to a small remote island.
On the island she finds out the secret mission is an investigation into the alien spacecraft that was found orbiting Neptune. She discovers two aliens were found; one small, one larger and of a different species, with the smaller alien (which looks somewhat like an underdeveloped foetus with typical 'grey alien' large eyes) controlling the much larger and robust one through telepathy. The team has nicknamed the larger alien 'Spike' due to its spiky and ominous appearance. Later, in attempting to escape or explore her surroundings, Lisa has a surprise meeting with her old friend Manning whom she had thought was dead. After a discussion with Colonel Cencula (Lance Henriksen) it comes to light that Lisa's sister also worked on the alien investigation but was killed through unknown circumstances (later revealed to be due to a mistaken overdose of the serum they're trying to develop), and that Lisa was chosen because of the natural psychic/telepathic link she shared with her twin sister.
After seeing the smaller alien, which is imprisoned in a glass chamber, and forming a chance telepathic connection with it, Lisa is tested for a mental connection with her twin sister by Dr. Bainbridge (Dave Vescio). During the investigation Lisa meets Plummer (Brian Krause) and builds a friendship with him which soon blossoms into romance. Meanwhile, Colonel Cencula, Manning, and the doctor are working together to try and develop a serum to control people using the alien's telepathic technology. The Colonel sells this mind control technology to a North Korean billionaire for $4 billion. Lisa learns of the Colonel's plans, steals the access codes to the money/account, and attempts to flee the island.
Colonel Cencula starts a hunt for Lisa and sends Plummer after her, but with Manning controlling him through their telepathy technology. Manning finds Lisa and attacks her but Lisa soon discerns it is really Manning via his obnoxious behavior, and begs Plummer to fight the mind control. Ultimately Plummer regains enough control to kill himself rather than risking harming Lisa. Enraged, Cencula kills Manning with a shot to the head for failing him. He then calls for a full evacuation of the island and releases the large alien, forcing Doctor Bainbridge to control 'Spike' to pursue Lisa. Fleeing from the alien, Lisa runs into a mine field and the alien sets off the mines causing a landslide, burying them both. The Colonel presumes they're dead, but both Lisa and the large alien are still alive as the little alien had managed to wrest control from the doctor and used "Spike" to protect Lisa from being crushed. The small alien informs Lisa telepathically that it wants her to help free both aliens.
With help from the aliens Lisa defeats the military army on the island and they both confront the Colonel Cencula. Lisa begs him to stop the torture and release the aliens. When he emphatically refuses the large alien disarms him and rips him to shreds. Lisa frees both aliens and they escape as the island is set to self-destruct. The aliens thank and warn Lisa to quickly run, then take to their spaceship.
Lisa is rescued from the island via a helicopter, relaying to the superior officer therein that the corrupt colonel and the experiment have been destroyed, that the aliens are 'gone,' and that it's best they take off before the whole island blows up. Meanwhile, somewhere below, in a somewhat cryptic scene, Dr. Bainbridge is seen rowing down a river with a metal suitcase and what appears to be the comatose body of Lisa's twin sister.
As the entire island blows, a spaceship takes off back into space...

The Nauruan or Nauru language () is an Austronesian language, spoken natively in the island country of Nauru. Its relationship to the other Micronesian languages is not well understood.
Phonology
Consonants
Nauruan has 16–17 consonant phonemes. Nauruan makes phonemic contrasts between velarized and palatalized labial consonants. Velarization is not apparent before long back vowels and palatalization is not apparent before non-low front vowels.
Voiceless stops are geminated and nasals also contrast in length. Dental stops and become and respectively before high front vowels.
The approximants become fricatives in "emphatic pronunciation." transcribes them as and also remarks that they contrast with the non-syllabic allophones of the high vowels.
Depending on stress, may be a flap or a trill. The precise phonetic nature of is unknown. transcribes it as and speculates that it may pattern like palatalized consonants and be partially devoiced.
Between a vowel and word-final , an epenthetic appears.
Vowels
There are 12 phonemic vowels (six long, six short). In addition to the allophony in the following table from , a number of vowels reduce to :
Non-open vowels (that is, all but ) become non-syllabic when preceding another vowel, as in → ('hide').
Stress
Stress is on the penultimate syllable when the final syllable ends in a vowel, on the last syllable when it ends in a consonant, and initial with reduplications.
Writing system
In the Nauruan written language, 17 letters were originally used:
The five vowels: a, e, i, o, u
Twelve consonants: b, d, g, j, k, m, n, p, q, r, t, w
The letters c, f, h, l, s, v, x, y and z were not included. With the growing influence of foreign languages (most of all German, English and Gilbertese and some minority of Pama-Nyungan) more letters were incorporated into the Nauruan alphabet. In addition, phonetic differences of a few vowels arose, so that umlauts and other similar-sounding sounds were indicated with a tilde.
Attempt at language reform of 1938
In 1938 there was an attempt by the Nauruan language committee and Timothy Detudamo to make the language easier to read for Europeans and Americans. It was intended to introduce as many diacritical symbols as possible for the different vowel sounds to state the variety of the Nauruan language in writing. It was decided to introduce only a grave accent in the place of the former tilde, so that the umlauts "õ" and "ũ" were replaced by "ô" and "û". The "ã" was substituted with "e".
Also, "y" was introduced in order to differentiate words with the English "j" (). Thus, words like were changed to . In addition, "ñ" (which represented the velar nasal) was replaced with "ng", to differentiate the Spanish Ñ, "bu" and "qu" were replaced with "bw" and "kw" respectively, "ts" was replaced with "j" (since it represented a pronunciation similar to English "j"), and the "w" written at the end of words was removed.
These reforms were only partly carried out: the umlauts "õ" and "ũ" are still written with tildes. However, the letters "ã" and "ñ" are now only seldom used, being replaced with "e" and "ng", as prescribed by the reform. Likewise, the writing of the double consonants "bw" and "kw" has been implemented. Although the "j" took the place of "ts", certain spellings still use "ts." For example, the districts Baiti and Ijuw (according to the reform and ) are still written with the old writing style. The "y" has largely become generally accepted.
Today the following 29 Latin letters are used.
Vowels: a, â, e, i, o, ô, u, û
Semivowels: j
Consonants: b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, ñ, p, q, r, s, š, t, w, y, z
Dialects
According to a report published in 1937 in Sydney, there was a diversity of dialects until Nauru became a colony of Germany in 1888, and until the introduction of publication of the first texts written in Nauruan. The varieties were largely so different that people of various districts often had problems understanding each other completely. With the increasing influence of foreign languages and the increase of Nauruan texts, the dialects blended into a standardized language, which was promoted through dictionaries and translations by Alois Kayser and Philip Delaporte.
Today there is significantly less dialectal variation. In the district of Yaren and the surrounding area there is an eponymous dialect spoken, which is only slightly different.
Delaporte's Nauruan dictionary
In 1907, Philip Delaporte published his pocket German-Nauruan dictionary. The dictionary is small (10.5 × 14 cm), with 65 pages devoted to the glossary and an additional dozen to phrases, arranged alphabetically by the German. Approximately 1650 German words are glossed in Nauruan, often by phrases or synonymous forms. There are some 1300 'unique' Nauruan forms in the glosses, including all those occurring in phrases, ignoring diacritical marks. The accents used there are not common; just one accent (the tilde) is in use today.
Sample text
The following example of text is from the Bible (Genesis, 1.1–1.8):
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
This text demonstrates a few of the German loanwords (e.g. , "God"; and , "celestial sphere") in Nauruan, which is traced back to the strong influence of German missionaries.

Archibald Knox (born 1 May 1947) is a Scottish football player and coach. He was most recently the assistant manager of Aberdeen until leaving the club in March 2013.
Knox worked with Alex Ferguson as an assistant manager at Aberdeen and Manchester United, and with Walter Smith at Rangers and Everton.
Playing career
As a player, Knox played in his native Scotland, featuring for Forfar Athletic (twice), St Mirren, Dundee United and a short spell with Montrose. During his time with Dundee United, Knox was a runner-up in the 1974 Scottish Cup final, his only honour as a player.
Managerial career
Knox's first managerial role came in a player-manager capacity when he returned to first club Forfar in 1976, spending four years in the dual role. In 1980, Knox became assistant to Alex Ferguson at Aberdeen, helping the team to two Scottish Cups, the European Cup Winners' Cup and subsequent European Super Cup in his three years with the Dons. In 1983, Knox returned to management with Dundee, where he would spend two-and-a-half years, with the best finish of sixth place in 1984–85 and 1985–86, narrowly missing out on UEFA Cup qualification. A short spell back at Aberdeen followed, before following Ferguson to Manchester United in 1986, where he stayed until April 1991. At this point, Knox came back to Scotland, becoming assistant to Walter Smith at Rangers, where the pair would enjoy six titles over the next seven years together. In July 1998, both men moved south to Everton, although their time was ended by March 2002.
It was at this point that Knox's association with the national team began, with a three-year spell assisting then-manager Craig Brown. Short spells followed at Millwall and Coventry City (as assistant to Mark McGhee and Eric Black respectively) before returning to Scotland as Richard Gough's assistant at Livingston in November 2004. Knox again assisted the national team as a coach, helping at the Kirin Cup in May 2006. Knox was appointed Scotland under-21 manager in July 2006 following Rainer Bonhof's departure. In August 2007 he was appointed as Bolton's Assistant Manager by Wanderers manager Sammy Lee. When Lee left Knox was made caretaker manager for two games (against Arsenal and in the UEFA Cup against S.C. Braga) before Gary Megson took over. Knox remained at the club under Megson.
Two days after Bolton Wanderers secured their premiership status he was axed by Megson with six other members of the coaching staff at the club. The club denied it was due to cost-cutting measures and stated it was due to Megson wanting to bring in his own staff.
On 4 July 2008 Knox was appointed as the first-team coach of Blackburn Rovers by Paul Ince. They had previously worked together at Manchester United. He became the second member of the backroom staff to be appointed by Ince; his appointment followed that of Ray Mathias as assistant manager. On 18 December 2008, Knox was relieved of his duties along with Ray Mathias following the sacking of Paul Ince and the subsequent arrival of Sam Allardyce as the new Rovers manager.
On 29 December 2009, he was appointed as the assistant manager to Craig Brown at Motherwell. On 10 December 2010, after Brown moved to Aberdeen, Knox followed him back to his former club. After three years with Brown, it announced that he and Brown would leave the club at the end of the season. Though leaving the club, Knox reversed his decision to retire, insisting he "not retiring now. I still feel young and I've plenty to offer."
In October 2013, Knox returned to Scottish Championship side Dundee as a playing scout role. Knox will be reunited with manager John Brown, whom he signed whilst manager at Dundee.
In November 2017, he was one of four inductees into the Aberdeen Hall of Fame.

María Rostworowski Tovar de Diez Canseco (8 August 1915 – 6 March 2016) was a Peruvian historian known for her extensive and detailed publications on Peruvian Ancient Cultures and the Inca Empire.
Biography
Rostworowski was born in the Barranco district of Lima, Peru. Her father was Jan Jacek Rostworowski, a Polish aristocrat, and her mother, Rita Tovar del Valle, was from Puno. Her grandfather, Agustín Tovar Aguilar, was president of the Senate and her uncle, Karol Hubert Rostworowski, was a playwright. She studied at various boarding schools in Poland, Belgium, France and England, where she learned French, English, and Polish. She was a student of the Peruvian historian Raúl Porras Barrenechea at the National University of San Marcos. She participated in the Popular Action political party, a Peruvian political party, during the party's inception.
Rostworowski married her distant cousin, Count Zygmunt Broel-Plater, a member of the Polish nobility. His father was Count Edward Cezar Marian Broel-Plater and his mother was Countess Janina Tyszkiewicz-Łohojska. Rostworowski and Count Broel-Plater had one daughter, Cristina Broel-Plater Rostworowski, but later the couple divorced. She later remarried the businessman Alejandro Diez-Canseco Coronel-Zegarra, who was the son of Manuel Diez-Canseco, and relative of the Counts of Alastaya. Diez-Canseco, who would later become the General Departmental Secretary of the Popular Action political party, played a great role in fostering Rostworowski's historical interests. After the sudden death of her husband in March 1961, she moved to the leper colony of San Pablo, directed by the German Maxime Kuczynski-Godard, to work as a missionary. It took her one day to navigate through the Amazon River to arrive in the leper colony. The first government of Fernando Belaúnde Terry designated her as cultural assistant in the Peruvian embassy in Spain.
Rostworowski was a student of the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos. At the university, two of her teachers were Raúl Porras Barrenechea, who introduced her to historiographical proceedings and to the analysis of historical sources, and the North American anthropologist John Murra, who motivated her to begin studying ethnic history. She also had contact with other professors, such as Julio C. Tello, Luis Valcárcel, and Luis Jaime Cisneros during her time at the university. Accociated with the Institute of Peruvian Studies from its beginning, María Rostworowski edited numerous publications under the Institute's auspices. One of the publications that she edited is called Historia del Tahuantinsuyo, the highest-selling social science journal in all of Peruvian history.
Rostworowski's contributions to historiography, especially Peruvian history, are numerous. In her first book, Pachacútec inca Yupanqui (1953), she highlights the importance of the Inca government to the construction of the Tahuantinsuyo. She also made important and acclaimed investigations into the field of precolumbian societies on the Peruvian coast, a topic which had not been widely studied until then. Other works of hers come from diverse historical topics, ranging from historical gender studies (La mujer en la época prehispánica, 1986) to precolumbian cults and their eventual Christianization (Pachacamac y el Señor de los Milagros: una trayectoria milenaria, 1992).
In 1979 she became a member of the National Academy of History (Academia Nacional de Historia), and she later became the vice president. Additionally, she was a member of the Royal Spanish Academy of History (Real Academia de la Historia) and the National Argentine Academy of History (Academia Nacional de la Historia). She belonged to the Raúl Porras Barrenechea Institute in Lima and to the Institute of Andean Studies in Berkeley, California. The Geographic Society of Lima (La Sociedad Geográfica de Lima) accepted her as an honorary member. She presided over the Peruvian Association of Ethnic History (Asociación Peruana de Etnohistoria), which was founded in Lima in 1979 by Fernando Silva Santisteban. In order to continue her research projects, she received the support of the Wenner-Gren foundation, Ford, the Guggenheim foundation, Volkswagen, Fomciencias, and Concytec.
She was also the director of the National History Museum (Museo Nacional de Historia) from 1975 to 1980. In 1969, she worked for the newspaper Correo, which at that time was directed by Roberto Ramírez del Villar. From 1973 to 1974, she worked as a researcher in the Peruvian Culture Museum (Museo de la Cultura Peruana). In 1983, she wrote what she considered her most important work: Estructuras andinas del poder: ideología religiosa y política.
Rostworowski served as vice-president of The National Academy of History (Academia Nacional de Historia), as director of National Museum of History from 1975 to 1980, and was a principal resident scholar at the Institute of Peruvian Studies (IEP) in Lima. She turned 100 in August 2015.
Death
María Rostworowski died on Sunday 6 March 2016, aged 100, between 3:30 and 3:38 in the afternoon.

The 1961 U.S. Figure Skating Championships was held at the World Arena in Colorado Springs, Colorado, from January 25 to 29, 1961. Medals were awarded in three colors: gold (first), silver (second), and bronze (third) in four disciplines – men's singles, ladies' singles, pair skating, and ice dancing – across three levels: senior, junior, and novice.
The event determined the U.S. team for the 1961 World Championships.
The competition was dedicated to the memory of Howard D. Herbert, president of the United States Figure Skating Association, who had died suddenly just a few days before the competition opened.
The event is noted especially for its catastrophic aftermath, in which most of the U.S. team died in the crash of Sabena Flight 548 on their way to the World Championships in Prague. Because many of the top American figure skaters (including Carol Heiss and David Jenkins) had retired from the sport after the 1960 Winter Olympics, new champions were crowned in all four disciplines.
A notable feature of this event is that it was the first time the United States Figure Skating Championships were covered on national television, with a modest rights fee being paid by CBS. Sportscaster Bud Palmer provided the "play-by-play", and Dick Button provided the commentary for the event, a role Button continued to perform for decades after the Championships broadcasts were picked up by ABC Sports in subsequent years.
Senior results
Men
The men's competition was won by Bradley Lord, likewise in a come-from-behind victory in the free skating after having been second to Gregory Kelley in the compulsory figures.
Ladies
Stephanie Westerfeld had a narrow lead over Laurence Owen after the compulsory figures and performed well enough in the free skating that she might have won the competition. However, Owen followed with a superior effort in the free skating and won the title on a 4-1 split of the first-place ordinals.
Pairs
Maribel Owen / Dudley Richards, the silver medalists from the previous year, were the clear winners.
Ice dancing (Gold dance)
Diane Sherbloom / Larry Pierce—skating in their first season together—took the championship.

Aftermath
Following the U.S. Championships, all the top skaters with the exception of Brown (who was ill; his place was taken by fourth-place finisher Ramsay) took part in the North American Figure Skating Championships in Philadelphia, where Owen captured the ladies title. The team then immediately departed for the World Figure Skating Championships in Prague on February 14, 1961, on board Sabena Flight 548. However, they never arrived; their flight crashed near Brussels, Belgium the next morning, killing all on board (including coaches, officials, and family members). The few team members who had not made the trip included skater Brown, and coach Ronald Ludington (who was unable to afford the travel expenses).
The U.S. Figure Skating Memorial Fund was established eight days after the crash by F. Ritter Shumway, then-president of the USFSA, and the fund has continued to this day. Its purpose is to provide help to promising skaters who lack funding for equipment. Peggy Fleming and Scott Hamilton are among future champions who have credited the memorial fund with being vital to their careers. RISE, a documentary film about the 1961 team, was released on February 17, 2011, two days after the 50th anniversary of the crash.

La Hoyada is a volcanic complex in the Andes, directly southwest of Cerro Blanco and east of the San Buenaventura mountain range.
The volcanic complex reaches an altitude of approximately and consists of several eroded calderas. Breccia, ignimbrites, lava domes and lava flows have been described at La Hoyada. The ignimbrites cover a surface area of . The volcanic complex has been affected by faulting.
Ignimbrites erupted at La Hoyada have been described as moderately welded andesites, of green-grey colour. The intermediate composition of dykes at La Hoyada contrasts with that of other volcanic rocks associated with extensional tectonics in the Puna, which tend to be of mafic composition. Some of the rocks underwent supergene mineralization later. The La Hoyada mine has yielded copper and platinum.
Paleozoic rocks form the basement beneath Cerro Blanco, which also partly covers La Hoyada. Neoproterozoic and Ordovician sequences are also found at La Hoyada. Sometimes both volcanic centres are considered to be the same volcano. La Hoyada is usually considered a back-arc volcanic centre, and has been associated with extensional tectonics. The subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America Plate has given rise to several distinct volcanic belts in the Andes, including the Central Volcanic Zone of the Central Andes.
The volcanic complex was active in the Miocene and Pliocene during two stages. An age of 7.04 ± 0.03 million years ago has been determined for the ignimbrites. Another date for the complex is 9.8 ± 0.6 million years ago. Two distinct volcanic events have been dated 7.4-2.42 million years ago. Ore deposits linked with the volcanic rocks were the first aspect of La Hoyada studied.

Lim Soo-Hyeok (Korean: 임수혁, Hanja: 任秀赫, June 17, 1969 – February 7, 2010) was a baseball catcher to the Lotte Giants.
Career
In 1994, Lim began to start baseball and a promising player with a lot of potential. In his rookie season, Lim batted .250 in 29 games, and .247 with 15 home runs. In 1996, Lim produced .311 with 11 home runs and 76 RBI. During his seven-year career, he began to boost a career total of 345 hits, 47 home runs, and .257 RBI with a .266 RBI.
Personal life
On April, 2000, Lim suddenly collapsed at the second base against the LG Twins at the Jamsil Stadium in southern Seoul. Reports said that Lim collapsed due to a heart arrhythmia or irregular heartbeat and failed to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation on time. Although an emergency medical service vehicle arrived and transported Lim to a hospital, the brain damage he received from the incident was said to have resulted largely from the lack of first aid soon after Lim collapsed at the stadium. Poor first aid and the ensuing brain damage resulting from lack of oxygen to the brain meant there wasn't much the doctors at the hospital could do to help Lim once he was brought to the hospital. The former baseball player went on to spend the next decade in a vegetative state.
His family later sued the Lotte Giants and LG Twins in April, 2003 for 800 million.
Death
On February 7, 2010, Lim Soo-Hyeok died from a cardiac dysrhythmia when he was taken into Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital in eastern Seoul.

Muthuvelu's song is telecasted by the TV channel, and he becomes popular in no time; thus, he becomes a singer. Once again, Muthuvelu and Sundaram get into a fight. This time, Sundaram is suspended from his job by his superiors.
Thereafter, Muthuvelu and Kaveri fall in love with each other. At first, Kaveri's father Ramasamy (Shanmugasundaram) accepts for their marriage. Sundaram enters their home pretending to be Muthuvelu's father. Deivanai claims that he is not her husband when Ramasamy asks about her husband's identity and she refuses to tell. Ramasamy puts his foot down when she refuses to reveal any pieces of information about Muthuvelu's father. Ramasamy is now grateful to Sundaram and appoints him to work in his factory.
Later that night, Deivanai reveals to Muthuvelu that she was an orphan and lived alone in the past. She had a secret affair with the wealthy man Ratnasabapathy (Vijayakumar), who promised to marry her. Thereafter, Deivanai received death threats from Ratnasabapathy's relatives and had no other choice but to leave the village. A kindhearted person, now Muthuvelu's grandfather, helped Deivanai and took care of her like his own daughter.
Muthuvelu goes in search of his father Ratnasabapathy and finds that he is now married and has three sons. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.

Pennsylvania Route 125 (PA 125) is a state highway located in Schuylkill and Northumberland Counties in Pennsylvania. The southern terminus is at PA 443 in Pine Grove. The northern terminus is at PA 61 in Shamokin. The route follows a winding alignment through mountains and valleys in the western part of the Coal Region. PA 125 does not directly access Interstate 81 (I-81); however, north of Pine Grove, there is an interchange with SR 3013 (Molleystown Road) just yards from the highway in Ravine. The route has a concurrency with U.S. Route 209 (US 209) in Tremont and crosses PA 25 in Hegins. PA 125 was designated in 1928 between PA 25 in Hegins and US 209 in Newtown while the present alignment between Pine Grove and Hegins was a part of PA 25 and the section between Line Mountain and Shamokin was part of PA 225. PA 125 was realigned to its current alignment between PA 443 in Pine Grove and US 122 (now PA 61) in Shamokin in the 1930s, with the former section between Hegins and Newtown becoming a realigned PA 25.
Route description
PA 125 begins at an intersection with PA 443 in the borough of Pine Grove in Schuylkill County, heading northwest on two-lane undivided North Tulpehocken Street. The road passes homes and a few businesses before crossing into Pine Grove Township and becoming Tremont Road. Here, the route heads north into wooded areas with some development, following the Swatara Creek which is situated east of the road and passing through North Pine Grove. PA 125 begins to run a short distance to the east of I-81 as it passes through a forested gap of Second Mountain and crosses the creek. The road heads into Tremont Township and turns northeast as South Tremont Road, intersecting Molleystown Road, which continues northwest to interchange with I-81 a short distance to the west. In the vicinity of this intersection, the route is a divided highway. PA 125 becomes undivided again and runs through more forests parallel to the Swatara Creek, turning north-northwest as it passes through Echo Valley and crosses Sharp Mountain. The road curves to the northeast again before another turn to the north, crossing Swatara Creek. The route crosses a Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad line prior to entering the borough of Tremont and heading northeast on Branch Street, passing through wooded areas of homes. PA 125 heads back into Tremont Township and comes to an intersection with US 209, turning southwest to form a concurrency with that route. The two routes head back into Tremont and merge onto East Main Street, heading into business areas. PA 125 splits from US 209 by heading northwest on Spring Street. The route heads past homes, turning to the west and passing a mix of residences and industrial establishments.
The road curves north and heads into Frailey Township, becoming North Tremont Road and running through forests. PA 125 heads into the residential community of Donaldson and becomes South Maple Street, turning west onto East Center Street. The road continues through more of the community and becomes West Center Street before leaving Donaldson and heading into more forests, running a short distance to the north of the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad line. The route passes under I-81 prior to heading into Porter Township and becoming East Center Street. PA 125 reaches the community of Good Spring, where it turns north onto Main Street, heading into Hegins Township and becoming South Good Spring Road. The road curves northeast to ascend Broad Mountain before a turn to the northwest to descend the mountain. The route runs north through the wooded residential community of Lamberson and continues into agricultural areas with a few homes. PA 125 enters the residential community of Hegins, where it crosses PA 25 and becomes North Good Spring Road. The road heads through more farmland with some woods and homes before heading into forested areas and turning northwest to ascend Mahantango Mountain. The route enters Eldred Township and becomes Vista Road, descending the mountain. PA 125 turns to the north to head into an agricultural valley with some woods and residences, curving northwest before heading more to the north. The route continues farther north before turning west onto Main Road.
PA 125 crosses into Upper Mahanoy Township in Northumberland County and becomes an unnamed road, soon turning to the north in Line Mountain. The road winds through a mix of farmland and woodland before turning northwest to ascend forested Line Mountain. The route heads into East Cameron Township and turns northeast to descend the mountain. PA 125 crosses the Mahanoy Creek and winds northeast through a valley, passing through areas of farmland and woodland. The road passes through Gowen City and turns northwest to cross forested Mahanoy Mountain, crossing into Coal Township. The route passes a few fields and runs through Burnside, heading into more forested areas. PA 125 curves more to the north and becomes Bear Valley Road, curving northeast and heading into the city of Shamokin. At this point, the road becomes Bear Valley Avenue and heads into residential areas. PA 125 turns to the north and becomes South Market Street, gaining a wide median as it passes more homes. The route heads into the commercial downtown and becomes North Market Street, crossing the Shamokin Valley Railroad and passing more businesses. PA 125 becomes an undivided road again for a block before ending at PA 61.
History
When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, the current alignment of PA 125 was not given a number. PA 125 was designated in 1928 to run from PA 25 in Hegins east to US 209 in Newtown along an unpaved road. Meanwhile, the current alignment between Pine Grove and Hegins was designated as part of PA 25 while the section between Line Mountain and Shamokin was designated as part of PA 225, all of which was unpaved except for small sections of PA 25 north of Pine Grove and south of Hegins as well as a stretch of PA 225 south of Shamokin. In the 1930s, PA 125 was realigned to its current alignment running between PA 443 in Pine Grove and US 122 (now PA 61) in Shamokin, replacing the section of PA 25 between Pine Grove and Hegins and PA 225 between Line Mountain and Shamokin. Meanwhile, the former routing of PA 125 between Hegins and Newtown became a realigned PA 25. At this time, the entire length of PA 125 was paved. On October 6, 2017, a section of PA 125 in Porter Township was closed indefinitely after it collapsed due to a sinkhole that was wide and deep.

Cristina Donà (Rho, Italy, September 23, 1967) is an Italian singer and songwriter.
She developed a passion for music since she was a teenager, her favorite singers being, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Sinéad O'Connor, Joni Mitchell, Michelle Shocked, Tom Waits, Lucio Battisti, and The Beatles .
She studied at Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera in Milan, where, during a student protest in 1990, she met Manuel Agnelli, leader of the Italian indie rock band Afterhours. Later she started her own singing career opening Afterhours' concerts in their During Christine's Sleep tour.
Besides live performances in clubs in Milano and surroundings, Donà, encouraged by Manuel Agnelli, began working on her own songs, and released her first album, Tregua, in 1997. The album was an immediate success. Robert Wyatt included it among his favorites of the year in Mojo . The music critic Charlie Gillett broadcast some songs on BBC radio.
In the meanwhile Donà performed live on an Italian tour, and opened concerts for Ben Harper and David Byrne.
In 1999 she duetted with the songwriter Eric Wood in his album Illustrated night, and started working on the second album, Nido. Robert Wyatt contributed to this album with the arrangements in the song Goccia and with the participation in a videoclip, shot on the East Coast of England, and released on the Goccia EP.
In 2001 Donà was invited (the first and only Italian artist then) to the Meltdown Festival, where she performed the same night as Anja Garbarek and Mark Eitzel. Davey Ray Moor, attending the concert that night, was very much impressed by Donà's performance, and this was the starting point of a long-lasting collaboration between the two artists. While working with him on the third album, in January 2002 Donà was invited to participate in the Eurosonic Festival in Groningen (The Netherlands).
The third album, Dove sei tu, was released in 2003, and Davey Ray Moor performed as a special guest in some concerts during the promotional tour. Donà recorded a cover of Kate Bush's Wuthering Heights, which was included in the single Invisibile. She also worked, together with Davey Ray Moor, on the translation of the lyrics of Dove sei tu. The self-titled album was released in 2004 and distributed in 33 countries by Rykodisc International.
The English press welcomed the album with very good reviews. Mojo gives it four stars, Down Beat compared Donà to artists such as Marianne Faithfull and Ute Lemper, Sunday Times included a song in the monthly CD attached to the magazine.
At the end of 2004 she started an extensive tour of Europe, performing in Germany, France, UK, Belgium, The Netherlands, Sweden, and with a special performance at the Polar Spectacle Festival in Norway. The American musician Ken Stringfellow played with her in most of the European concerts.
In 2005 she played in Italy with Annie Whitehead's Soupsongs, and was in the UK for an acoustic tour, during which she was invited to Robert Elms' BBC London Live.
In 2006 she signed to the major label EMI that is re-distributing all her catalogue.
In 2014 she came back from her last album Torno A Casa A Piedi (2011) with a new work called Così Vicini.

Michèle Cournoyer (born November 14, 1943) is a Canadian animator who on 1 March 2017 received a Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts for her body of work.
Early life
Born in Saint-Joseph-de-Sorel, Quebec, Cournoyer began drawing at the age of five, and started painting at 12 when she was hospitalized, and her father bought her an oil paint set. At the age of 17, she had to halt her art education when her mother became ill, with Cournoyer caring for her ailing mother and the family. Her mother died when Cournoyer was 20 years of age. After two years studying in Quebec City, she moved to Montreal, then to London to study graphic arts. Studying in London during the 1960s, she was influenced by Pop Art, the Dada movement and surrealism. During the 1970s she worked as a set designer, art director, costume designer and screenwriter for several Quebec-based film companies.
Independent film and animation work
Her first animation film, Papa! Papa! Papa! (L'Homme et l'enfant), came about when a friend had a baby and Cournoyer, fascinated by the relationship between parent and child, created a photography flip book that would evolve into this film. Her 1973 short Alfredo was made during her time in Italy. Upon returning to Quebec, she worked in film as a set designer, art director, costume designer and screenwriter, with credits on such films as Mireille Dansereau's La vie rêvée (1972) and L'arrache-coeur (1979), as well as Gilles Carle's La Mort d'un bûcheron (1973). She also made her independent films Spaghettata, Toccata, Old Orchard Beach, P.Q. and Dolorosa.
Working with the NFB
In 1989, Cournoyer won the National Film Board of Canada's French Animation Studio's 9th Cinéaste recherché competition in 1989, leading to the completion of her first NFB animated short A Feather Tale. Her films with the NFB have explored powerful themes. The Hat is a film about incest that was part of the International Critics' Week during the Cannes Film Festival, and was ranked as one of the 100 Best Animated Films of All Time in Variety 2005 survey. Accordion deals with sexuality, while Robes of War looks at terrorism and religion through a female suicide bomber. Her 2014 film, Soif explores alcoholism.
Technique
While she has experimented with computerization in such works as An Artist (1994), Cournoyer usually uses traditional animation methods. The Hat, which started on a computer, was completed by her on paper. Soif, an ink-on-paper film, took her four years, with 10,000 drawings required to arrive at the final 1,800 used in the film. She traditionally makes her drawings in pen with black ink, on white pages in black note books.

Alexander Island is a 5.4 hectare island in the Collie River, Western Australia. It is located at , a few hundred metres east of the Collie Bridge in Australind, a suburb of Greater Bunbury.
The island was part of a 120 hectare land grant made to George Leake in 1839. Because it was located in the middle of the river, it was left in a relatively undisturbed state. In 2005, it was recognised as an important wildlife habitat, and purchased by the Government of Western Australia for $110,000. It is now reserved as open space under the Greater Bunbury Region Scheme.

The East German coffee crisis was a shortage of coffee in the late 1970s in East Germany caused by a poor harvest and unstable commodity prices, severely limiting the government's ability to buy coffee on the world markets. As a consequence, the East German government increased its engagement in Africa and Asia, exporting weapons and equipment to coffee-producing nations.
Situation
In 1977, East Germany experienced difficulties meeting domestic demand for coffee, a commodity that had to be purchased using , i.e. freely convertible Western currencies that were in short supply in Eastern Bloc countries. The coffee crisis indirectly led to changes in the world market for coffee. The coffee crisis led to a reorientation of East German foreign policy as well as considerable belt-tightening. In particular, the East German government engaged in barter with Third World countries, exporting weapons and trucks in exchange for coffee and energy.
Background
In the Soviet occupation zone, much like the rest of Europe after World War II, coffee was a scarce good. The first coffee imported into East Germany came from the Soviet Union. When these imports stopped in 1954, this led to the first mass shortages and intensified efforts to acquire foreign currency with which to purchase coffee. Beginning in 1957, roasted coffee was produced under the brand name . Beginning in the 1960s, East Germany was able to reliably provide basic necessities, but luxury and exotic products remained scarce. This led to increased demand for the available luxury goods, such as confections, tobacco, alcoholic beverages, and coffee ( annually per capita) in the 1970s. By the 1970s, coffee was one of the most important items in an East German household budget, although gifts from friends and relatives in the West met about 20 percent of the country's coffee needs. East German citizens spent an average of 3.3 billion East German marks for coffee per year, an amount comparable to expenditures on furniture and twice the amount spent on shoes.
Coffee crisis of 1977
The coffee crisis began in 1976. The price of coffee rose dramatically after a failed harvest in Brazil, forcing the East German government to spend approximately 700 million West German marks on coffee (approximately US$300 million, equivalent to $ billion today), nearly five times the expected DM 150 million per year. The Socialist Unity Party (SED) leadership restricted the importation of food and luxury goods, while trying to gather sufficient foreign currency reserves to import petroleum. This occurred against the backdrop of the 1970s energy crisis, as the effects of the 1973 oil shock only began to affect East Germany in the mid-1970s.
The suggestion to cease coffee production, put forward by Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, was able to be avoided after Central Committee member Werner Lamberz encouraged barter trades and armament sales with Third World countries, such as Ethiopia and Mozambique. The cheapest variety of coffee, "Kosta", was discontinued and only more expensive varieties were available. Other alternatives were made available, such as "Kaffee-Mix", a 50 percent mixture of genuine and ersatz coffee, and rationing was not required. The Kaffee-Mix was pejoratively referred to as "Erichs Krönung", a reference to Erich Honecker, leader of East Germany, and the West German Jacobs Krönung coffee brand. The East German government assumed that much of the population would acquire coffee from Westpakete sent by West German relatives. This increased the demand for the typical return gift, a Dresdner Stollen, which also caused difficulties in the East German economy, because many of the ingredients, such as almonds, raisins, and succade, were also only available as imported goods. Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski's suggestion of a ban on giving Stollen was unsuccessful.
The citizens of East Germany overwhelmingly rejected the Kaffee-Mix and saw the coffee shortage as an attack on a major consumer need that was a large part of everyday life. The coffee mix also damaged some coffee machines, as the mixture contained substitute ingredients such as pea flour, which contains proteins that swell under heat and pressure, clogging the filters. This led to numerous complaints and outraged reactions and protests. Even though the price of coffee on the international markets retreated and normalized in 1978, the problems faced by the East German government acquiring foreign currency continued into the 1980s, prolonging shortages that progressively damaged the image of the country's political leadership. It is estimated that 20–25 percent of the entire East German coffee consumption from 1975 to 1977 arrived from the West in care packages. Coffee attained a value as a symbol of inner-German unity, far above its role as a mere consumer good or commodity.
Effects on West Germany
In West Germany, the coffee price increases in 1977 did not lead to any shortages, but did lead to the adoption of cheaper varieties of coffee in the lower price segment. Coffee brands such as Tchibo and later Eduscho began to make forays into cross-selling, by offering coffee as well as non-food items. These changes can also be attributed to the effects of the coffee crisis on West Germany.
Influence on coffee production in Vietnam
The relationship between East Germany and Vietnam was exceptionally close. Coffee production began in Vietnam in 1926 during French colonial rule. Beginning in 1975, largely parallel with the coffee crisis in East Germany, the production of Robusta coffee began in Vietnam. Robusta plants grow faster, contain more caffeine, suit the climate of the Vietnamese Central Highlands, and lend themselves better to mechanized harvesting. However, Robusta coffee is cheaper and of lower quality than the gold standard Arabica.
In 1980 and 1986, two treaties were signed between East Germany and Vietnam, whereby East Germany provided the necessary equipment and machinery for production, increased the area of coffee plantations from , and trained the local population in cultivation techniques. In particular, East Germany provided trucks, machinery, and irrigation systems for the newly-founded Kombinat Việt-Đức, as well as spending approximately $20 million on a hydropower plant. East Germany also built housing, hospitals, and shops for the 10,000 people who were relocated to the area for coffee production. Against this investment, East Germany was scheduled to receive half of the coffee harvest for the next 20 years. However, coffee takes eight years from planting until the first usable harvest, which occurred in 1990; at which point the East German state had already ceased to exist.
Despite the loss of its original customer, Vietnam was able to quickly establish themselves after 1990 as the second-largest coffee producer in the world after Brazil, driving much of the traditional coffee production in Africa out of the market. Export production was particularly boosted by the re-establishment of trade relations between the U.S. and Vietnam. This overproduction led to a crash in worldwide coffee prices in 2001. In 2016, Germany remains the largest export destination for Vietnamese coffee.

Ormiston is a coastal residential locality in the City of Redland, Queensland, Australia. In the , Ormiston had a population of 5,793 people.
Geography
Ormiston is adjacent to the localities of Cleveland and Wellington Point. The southern half is bisected by the Cleveland railway line with the locality served by Ormiston railway station ().
Empire Point lies on the coast () adjacent to Tolston Terrace.
The border in the west roughly aligns with Hillards Creek ().
History
Pre settlement
The Koobenpul lived on the mainland coastal strip stretching from Talwarrapin (Redland Bay) to the mouth of the Mairwar (Brisbane River), including the area now known as Ormiston. Canoe trees and a bora ring from pre-settlement days still remain along Hilliards Creek.
Post settlement
Originally part of the township of Cleveland, early industry included a brickwork established by James Maskell on the eastern bank of Hilliards Creek in 1852 and fellmongery (wool scour) owned by a Thomas Blacket Stephens until the early 1860s. Joseph Clark raised cattle in the district from 1855 until he relinquished the lease in 1858.
Land around Ormiston was bought in 1853 by Captain Louis Hope, a Scottish aristocrat and a founder of the Queensland sugar industry. Hope built Ormiston House from 1858 and 1865 as the centre of a sugar estate. Ormiston House is one of the finest examples of colonial architecture in Queensland.
The property was originally called Woojanness, but was renamed Ormiston after the Hope's family ancestral village of Ormiston, Scotland. It has an ornamental garden that dates from the building of the house. Hope continued with his plantation until 1875, until he lost a dispute over access to his sugar mill and decided to dismantle it. Since the 1960s the house has been a museum. Although the house was called Ormiston, the area around it was still known as Cleveland for many years. When the railway came through the area in 1889, the new railway station and the area around it also became known as Ormiston.
Cleveland West State School opened on 13 April 1872. It was renamed Ormiston State School circa 1900.
Ormiston College opened on 27 January 1988.
In the , Ormiston recorded a population of 5,641 people, 52.4% female and 47.6% male. The median age of the Ormiston population was 44 years, 7 years above the national median of 37. 67.3% of people living in Ormiston were born in Australia. The other top responses for country of birth were England 9.9%, New Zealand 5.5%, South Africa 3.3%, Scotland 1.6%, Germany 0.8%. 90.8% of people spoke only English at home; the next most common languages were 0.7% German, 0.6% Afrikaans, 0.6% Mandarin, 0.5% Italian, 0.3% Greek.
In the , Ormiston had a population of 5,793 people.

Clark County is a county in the U.S. state of Indiana, located directly across the Ohio River from Louisville, Kentucky. At the 2020 census, the population was 121,093. The county seat is Jeffersonville. Clark County is part of the Louisville/Jefferson County, KY–IN Metropolitan Statistical Area.
History
Clark County lies on the north bank of the Ohio River. A significant gateway to the state of Indiana, Clark County's settlement began in 1783. The state of Virginia rewarded General George Rogers Clark and his regiment for their victorious capture of Forts Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and Vincennes from the British, by granting them of land. A small portion of this land, , became known as Clarksville, the first authorized American settlement in the Northwest Territory, founded the next year in 1784.
Clark County was formed on 3 February 1801, with territory annexed from Knox, the first county formed in the Territory in 1790. This original area in Clark County was subsequently altered and reduced with the formation of other counties: Harrison (1808), Franklin, Jefferson, and Wayne (1811), Switzerland and Washington (1814), Jackson and Ripley (1816), Jennings (1817), Crawford and Randolph (1818), Fayette and Floyd (1819), Scott (1820), Union (1821), Decatur and Rush (1822).
The first county seat was established in Springville, on April 7, 1801. Jeffersonville was platted in 1802, and on 9 June the Territorial Governor (William Henry Harrison) ordered that it be regarded as the county seat. However, on 14 December 1810, the seat designation was given to Charlestown, which retained the designation until 1873, when on 23 September the Jefforsonville mayor (Luther Warder) successfully campaigned for the county seat's return.
Clark County was a hotbed for antislavery sentiment during the territorial period. In 1807, citizens petitioned Congress to uphold the legal prohibition of slavery established in the Northwest Ordinance in response to efforts by Harrison and his supporters to have the prohibition repealed. Many settlers were Quakers who had migrated from North Carolina to escape the oppressive conditions of the slave states and did not want to see slavery be established in Indiana.
From its beginning Clark County's history, culture and growth have been linked to the development of the river. Early nineteenth-century steamboats transported goods to the upper Ohio, providing opportunities for commercial and industrial growth in the county. In 1832, James Howard founded the Howard shipyards making Clark County a leader in shipbuilding.
The railroad brought further economic growth. The Monon line spanned from New Albany to Chicago, and the Jeffersonville, Madison, and Indianapolis Railroad provided Clark County and southern Indiana with access to the northern trading centers of Indianapolis and Chicago.
Industries locating to Clark County during the nineteenth century included the Louisville Cement Company in Speed, Indiana and the Ford Plate Glass Company established in Jeffersonville in 1876.
During the 1920s, Clark County attracted the Colgate-Palmolive Company to the Clarksville Riverfront. Colgate purchased the former Indiana Reformatory building in 1923. The company rehabilitated and adapted the building for its dedication in 1924. It stayed in business until early 2008.
During World War II the county prospered. The federal government began the Indiana Arsenal near Charlestown in 1940. Producing smokeless powder for the war effort, the arsenal employed up to 20,000. Howard shipyards was commissioned by the Navy to produce landing craft. Later Howard shipyards reorganized as Jeffersonville Boat and Machine Company (Jeffboat) — a current major employer (1991).
When the war ended, the county experienced significant residential and commercial growth, aided by the 1956 Interstate Act. The improved access provided by Interstate 65 encouraged additional subdivisions and shopping centers.
Clark County history has been closely associated with the development of the Ohio River. From its beginnings, Clark County relied on the river for economic opportunities. Clark County has diversified its economic base, lessened its dependency on the river, and continues to develop in new directions. However, the county still looks to the river as one link to its significant pioneer heritage.
Geography
Clark County lies on the east edge of Indiana; its eastern border abuts the northern border of the state of Kentucky (across the Ohio River). The terrain is low rolling hills, with the area either devoted to agriculture or urban development. The west part of the county is carved with drainages. The highest point on the terrain is a ridge WNW of Henryville near the border with Scott County, at 1,030' (314m) ASL.
According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of , of which (or 99.05%) is land and (or 0.96%) is water.

Government
For most of its history, Clark County was a Democratic-leaning county, its politics more in line with neighboring Kentucky than Indiana. However, the county voted for the national winner in all but 2 elections from 1924 to 2004 (1952, 1968). Since the start of the second millennium, the county has trended strongly Republican, moving away from its previous near-bellwether status.
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the Constitution of Indiana, and by the Indiana Code.
County Council: The seven-member county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Four representatives are elected from county districts, and three are elected at large. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.
Board of Commissioners: The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.
Courts: The Clark County Judicial System consists of 8 Courts:
Clark Circuit Court (Judge Daniel Moore)
Clark Superior Court #1 (Judge Vicki Carmichael)
Clark Superior Court #2 (Judge Jerome Jacobi)
Clark Superior Court #3 (Judge Joe P. Weber)
Jeffersonville City Court - Office Expired December 31, 2015
Charlestown City Court (Judge George Waters)
Clarksville Town Court (Judge Samuel Gwin)
Sellersburg Town Court (Judge Thomas Lowe)
By statute, the Circuit and Superior Courts have unlimited jurisdiction with the power to hear civil and criminal cases. City and Town Courts have jurisdiction to hear Ordinance violations and misdemeanor prosecutions, as well as civil actions where the amount in controversy does not exceed five hundred dollars ($500). Judgments in the City and Town Courts may be appealed de novo to the Clark Circuit Court. In addition, Clark Superior Court #3 maintains a Small Claims Docket. Local Rules of Practice may also limit the ability of a Court to hear certain cases. Judgments in other Courts may be appealed to the Indiana Court of appeals or the Indiana Supreme Court.
The Circuit and Superior Court Judges are assisted by 3 Magistrates, who are appointed and serve at the direction of the elected Judges.
The Circuit and Superior Court Judges are elected on a partisan basis, must reside within the county, and serve six-year terms. The City and Town Court Judges are elected to four-year terms on a partisan basis, and must reside within the City/Town.
Felony and Misdemeanor prosecutions are filed by the Prosecuting Attorney, who is elected on a partisan basis, must reside within the county, and serves a term of four years. The current Prosecuting Attorney, Steven D. Stewart, has been in Office since 1989.
County Officials: The county has several other elected offices, including prosecuting attorney, sheriff, coroner, auditor, treasurer, recorder, surveyor, and circuit court clerk. These officers are elected to four-year terms. Members elected to county government positions must declare a party affiliation and be residents of the county.

The 1948 Saskatchewan general election was held on June 24, 1948, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.
The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation government of Premier Tommy Douglas was re-elected with a reduced majority in the legislature.
Although the share of the popular vote won by the Liberal Party of Walter Tucker fell by almost five percentage points, the party increased its representation in the legislature from 5 seats to 19.
The Social Credit Party of Saskatchewan, which had won 2 seats and 16% of the popular vote in the 1938 election – only to disappear in the 1944 election – returned to win over 8% of the vote, but no seats.
The Progressive Conservative Party – now led by Rupert Ramsay – continued to decline, and was also shut out of the legislature.
In some ridings, the Progressive Conservatives appear to have run joint candidates with the Liberals in failed attempts to defeat the CCF. These candidates ran as Liberal-PC candidates. The successful Conservative Liberal candidate – Alex "Hammy" McDonald – immediately joined the Liberal caucus upon being sworn in as an MLA.

The 2015–16 Saudi Professional League (known as the Abdul Latif Jameel Professional League for sponsorship reasons) was the 40th season of the Saudi Professional League, the top Saudi professional league for association football clubs, since its establishment in 1976. The season began on 19 August 2015 and ended on 14 May 2016. Al-Nassr were the two time defending champions having won their seventh title last season. The league was contested by the 12 teams from the 2014–15 season as well as Al-Qadisiyah and Al-Wehda, who joined as the promoted clubs from the 2014–15 First Division. They replace Al-Orobah and Al-Shoulla who were relegated to the 2015–16 First Division.
On 24 April, Al-Ahli secured their third league title and first since 1984 with two games to spare after defeating second-placed Al-Hilal 3–1 at home.
Hajer were the first team to be relegated following a 1–0 home defeat to Al-Ahli Al-Orobah on 17 April. Najran became the second and final team to be relegated following a 3–3 draw with Al-Raed on the final matchday.
Teams
Fourteen teams competed in the league – the twelve teams from the previous season and the two teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Al-Qadisiyah (returning to the top flight after three years) and Al-Wehda (returning to the top flight after two years). They replaced Al-Orobah (ending their two-year top-flight spell) and Al-Shoulla (ending their three-year top-flight spell).

Vampire: The Masquerade – Coteries of New York is a visual novel developed and published by Draw Distance. It is based on the tabletop role-playing game Vampire: The Masquerade, and part of the larger World of Darkness series. It was released in 2019 for Microsoft Windows, and in 2020 for Linux, macOS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The stand-alone expansion Shadows of New York followed in 2020.
The player takes the role of one of three fledgling vampires of different vampire clans with different vampiric abilities, and interacts with the members of their coteries. The story depicts the struggle between two vampiric factions, and diverges based on player choices.
The game was designed by Krzysztof Zięba, who also was one of the writers, and used the tabletop game's sourcebook New York by Night as its main inspiration and reference for the characters and setting, while also taking influence from the use of moral dilemmas in the video games developed by Telltale Games. In adapting the tabletop game, the developers chose not to incorporate many of its game mechanics, and focused on what they considered essential for storytelling.
Gameplay
Vampire: The Masquerade – Coteries of New York is a single-player visual novel with mainly text-based gameplay, and involves the player making dialogue and story choices. As a vampire, the player character needs to balance their blood thirst with their humanity, while also ensuring that they do not reveal themselves as vampiric, breaking the Masquerade. Based on the choices the player makes, the narrative branches. In addition to the game's main quest, the player has access to side quests and loyalty quests; the latter involves creating bonds to the characters in their party ("coterie").
The player character can belong to one of three vampire clans, which affects their character's ethics and dialogue, and how the members of the player's coterie react to them. The choice of clan also determines what vampiric abilities ("disciplines") the player can use: a Brujah character can use Celerity (increased speed) and Potence (increased strength); a Toreador can also use Celerity, and Auspex (supernatural senses); and a Ventrue can use Fortitude (increased resilience) and Dominate (mind control); and all three can use Presence (attracting or scaring humans). These abilities can be used for problem-solving, as well as in combat situations and when interacting with characters.
Synopsis
Setting
Coteries of New York is set in New York City, in the World of Darkness. The story focuses on the struggles between two vampire factions – the traditionalist Camarilla and the rebellious Anarchs – and lets the player take the role of one of three fledgling vampires belonging to Camarilla clans: a passionate man of clan Brujah, an artistic man of clan Toreador, and a controlling businesswoman of clan Ventrue.
Plot
The unsuspecting player character is Embraced and transformed into a fledgling vampire by a mysterious stranger. They are picked up by Sheriff Qadir al-Asmai and taken before the court of Prince Hellene Panhard. Panhard sentences the fledgling to death in accordance with the vampire Traditions, but Sophie Langley, a patron at the court, intervenes and offers to take them under her protection. Langley provides lodging for the fledgling, teaches them how to hunt as well as other vampire-related knowledge, and introduces them to prominent members of the court, including Thomas Arturo and Robert Larson.
On Langley's advice, the fledgling begins to build their own coterie, reaching out to four recommended candidates: Agathon, D'Angelo, Hope and Tamika. The fledgling is also frequently sent to do Langley's biddings, which include obtaining information from the powerful broker Kaiser and setting up a secret meeting with Torque, an influential Anarch Baron. Langley reveals that the Anarch leader Boss Callihan is in fact the lover of Prince Panhard and blood bound to her, and the two are allied to maintain the status quo for their personal gain. She proposes that they head to Ellis Island to catch Panhard and Callihan in the act, using the knowledge to overthrow them, with Langley and Torque taking their places as leaders of the Camarilla and the Anarchs.
The fledgling, Langley and Torque confront Panhard and Callihan on Ellis Island. Torque is forced to escape during the ensuing brawl, which is then interrupted by the arrival of Arturo. Arturo reveals that he orchestrated all the events up to this point, including the fledgling's Embrace, and used them as a pawn to manipulate Langley into making a power play. He explains that he intended to destabilize the city, before returning it to a stable status quo, simply for his amusement. Arturo then has Langley executed and, declaring himself impressed with the fledgling's resourcefulness, offers to bind them to his blood and by extension his will.
Development
Coteries of New York was developed and published by the Polish studio Draw Distance, and was designed by Krzysztof Zięba, who also was one of the game's writers. The game was based on the fifth edition of the tabletop role-playing game Vampire: The Masquerade, and was produced in cooperation with Modiphius Entertainment, the developer at the time of the tabletop game, to ensure that it adhered to the Vampire: The Masquerade canon and lore; the story from Coteries of New York was in turn incorporated into the series' lore. It was however also designed with players who are new to the series in mind, and was written to work as an introduction to the series and setting, with a focus on introducing basic concepts and different vampire clans. Negotiating the licensing agreement for Vampire: The Masquerade, and the structure and content of the game, was a long process, starting at the Nordic Game conference in 2018.
The developers used the sourcebook New York by Night as their main source of inspiration and reference for the cast and setting. As New York by Night was published in 2001 for the tabletop game's Revised Edition, it was considered a jump-off point, with characters originating from it being developed to account for the passage of time in the setting since the book's publication, certain conflicts and events being resolved or progressing, and new characters being added. In rare cases where the sourcebook indicates how a certain character speaks, this was taken into consideration in the scriptwriting. In addition to New York by Night, the developers made use of information from Camarilla and Anarch, the sourcebooks that were available for the fifth edition of the tabletop game at the time. Another big influence on the game was the works of the game studio Telltale Games, and their use of moral dilemmas. Early on in the development, Choose Your Own Adventure gamebooks were also an influence.
In adapting the tabletop game to a narrative-driven video game format, the developers focused on what they considered what the tabletop game values – personal stories, and characters and their conflicting motivations – rather than gameplay mechanics. In doing so, they removed tabletop game mechanics such as leveling up and weapon stats, that were not crucial to telling the story, resulting in what they described as essentially a role-playing game without the things commonly associated with role-playing in video games. Although Coteries of New York was not initially designed as a visual novel-like game, it ended up moving towards that as the best format for a dialogue-driven game given the available development time.
Release
The game was announced in June 2019 with a teaser trailer, and was released on December 11, 2019 for Microsoft Windows, following a one-week delay to allow for bug-fixing. Ports followed for Linux and macOS on January 23, 2020, Nintendo Switch on March 24, 2020, PlayStation 4 on March 25, and Xbox One on April 15, 2020. The console versions launched with additional character and environment art and improved audio design, which was added to the Windows version through an update. An artbook and a soundtrack album were released digitally on March 24, 2020. A Japanese localization of the game was released on November 12, 2020 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch by DMM Games.
A stand-alone expansion with an independent story, Vampire: The Masquerade – Shadows of New York, was released on September 10, 2020, and has the player take the role of a vampire from clan Lasombra while investigating the death of the local Anarch Movement leader. A physical "collector's edition" that includes Coteries of New York, Shadows of New York, an artbook, and a vinyl soundtrack, is planned for release in Q1/Q2 2021 for Nintendo Switch, PC, and PlayStation 4.
Reception
The game saw a "mixed or average" critical response according to the review aggregator Metacritic, but won the 2020 Central & Eastern European Game Awards for best narrative and was featured by Dengeki Online in their serial about recommended downloadable games.
The PC version was among the best-selling new releases of the month on Steam, and recouped development and marketing costs within a week; on the other hand, the Japanese PlayStation 4 release did not appear on Famitsu weekly top 30 charts of physical video game sales during its debut week, indicating that it sold less than 2,900 retail copies during the period.

RV Platessa (LT205) was a fisheries research vessel that was operated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom) - Directorate of Fisheries, now known as the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) between 1946 and 1967.
RV Platessa was based at the port of Lowestoft and was originally ordered by the Admiralty as one of 81 Motor Fishing Vessels (MFVs) in the ‘1501-Class' during World War II. Motor fishing vessels were small wooden craft, built-in large numbers during the war for use as Ship's tenders.
Constructed as MFV 1576 by East Anglian Constructors at Oulton Broad, she was ordered on 26 February 1944, but not completed by the end of the wartime. Trials began in April 1946, and she was taken into service (but not ownership) as an unfinished hull by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (United Kingdom) and converted to a fishing research vessel. She was adapted to carry a trawl on her starboard side. The Platessa's work was almost equally divided between co-operation with the RV Sir Lancelot in the East Anglian herring fishery survey, plaice population surveys, plaice marking, mesh experiments and comparative fishing tests.
In 1967 the RV Platessa was handed back to the Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom) after 20 years in service, she was replaced by the RV Corella. In 1968 the RV Platessa was sold to private owners (H.J. Lamprell Ltd) and after sinking in Hamilton Dock, Lowestoft in 1975 she was eventually hulked at Lake Lothing where her remains lay for many years. She was recorded as still extant in Lake Lothing on 19 August 2015, and from examination of Google Earth images it seems that she continues to exist as one of two wooden wrecks (the other being the MFV Yellowtail) in the central basin.
Service as a fisheries research vessel
The RV Platessa (LT205) was in service with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom) from April 1946 until June 1967, during which time she participated in more than 473 separate research campaigns. She was primarily confined to the southern North Sea, but with occasional forays into the Irish Sea and English Channel, especially in the 1960s.
The RV Platessa (LT205) was overwhelmingly dedicated to research on North Sea herring and North Sea Plaice. This work included the tagging of more than 12,000 plaice during the 1950s, 7000 during the 1960s. In addition, large numbers of tagged plaice were released off the Cumberland coast, using the RV Platessa during 1949 and 1950.
In August 1951 echo-sounder traces were obtained over a wide area off Whitby by the RV 'Platessa', using a Marconi sounder. They were found to occur at a depth corresponding to that of a sharp thermocline, and small whiting about 3 in. in length, large Medusae, herring and sandeel larvæ were caught with a pelagic trawl at the depth of the trace. This work was reported in a ‘letter' to the journal Nature in 1952.
In 1950 the RV Platessa was involved in comparative herring surveys alongside the RV Clupea. The RV Clupea (a 75 ft motor drifter) had been taken into service in August 1948 and shared with the Scottish Home Department's Aberdeen Laboratory, working half of the year from Aberdeen and the other half from Lowestoft. This arrangement lasted until 1952 when the RV Clupea was allocated full-time for the use of the Aberdeen scientists.
During many of the earliest research cruises aboard RV Platessa (in the 1940s) scientists used a Secchi disk to assess light penetration (turbidity) in the southern North Sea. Recently, Cefas scientists re-discovered 469 historical Secchi depth measurements in survey logbooks, collected in 1931, 1937, 1946–50, and 1968. These historical measurements have revealed that the ‘sechhi depth' was much deeper (and therefore water more transparent) in the past compared to today, and thus that the North Sea has become much more turbid.
The Suffolk Record Office holds a photograph captioned "survey ship Platessa LT 205 in Lowestoft harbour after being escorted back by the Gorleston lifeboat Khami having sprung a leak whilst working in the Smiths Knoll area", dated 5 October 1968 (after leaving MAFF service).

Paseo de los Estudiantes ("Students Walkway" in English) is an urban area in San José, Costa Rica, the capital of Costa Rica. The area began to develop as a commercial center during the last decades of the twentieth century, basically with the advent of supermarkets, shops and some restaurants whose owners are Chinese.
Description
The Paseo de los Estudiantes area is located in the southern part of the city on 9th Street between 2nd Avenue and 18th Avenue, beginning at the Iglesias de La Soledad and culminating in the facilities of Liceo de Costa Rica. It is named in honor of high school students from Liceo de Costa Rica, the Colegio Superior de Señoritas and Colegio Seminario de San José who opposed the dictatorship of Federico Tinoco Granados (1917-1919), who made the square located in front of the church the center of their protests. In 2012, the Municipality of San Jose built a Barrio Chino (Chinatown) on the same site, the first of its kind in Central America, with the aim of reviving the capital's trade, although the name Paseo de los Estudiantes is still used interchangeably. On April 28, 2016, a monument to student civic movement of 1919, the work of Costa Rican sculptor Edgar Zuniga opened.
Culture
Barrio Chino de San José
The Chinatown was officially opened on Wednesday 5 December 2012, after nearly ten months of work, with funding from the government of China to promote friendship between the two countries. It is expected to become a new area of touristic interest in the city.
Works began in February 2012, but the planning and design began in 2009 as a result of political negotiations between the governments of Costa Rica and the People's Republic of China, to create a neighborhood in San Jose to represent Chinese culture.
After a little discussion about the most appropriate location and that have the least impact on traffic flow, they chose the central 9th street, popularly known as "Paseo de los Estudiantes" ("Students Walkway"). The area includes the square of the Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de La Soledad (Church of Solitude) and a little music amphitheater.
The neighborhood is an area of about 550 meters long and 8200 meters² building, in an area of twelve city blocks between 2nd Avenue and 14th Avenue (north to south) and between 7th and 11th Street (in west to east direction). The central axis constitutes a boulevard or stamped concrete walkway in red and yellow colors (symbolizing good luck and prosperity respectively in Chinese culture), along 9th Street.
Undoubtedly, its most notable architectural work is the arched entrance, similar to others located in other cities around the world. The work was performed by employees of a Chinese company, linked to the Beijing Bureau of Antiquities and is estimated to cost approximately $500,000.
The bow is made of reinforced concrete, is 10 meters high and 15 wide, with enough internal space for a firetruck to pass, in case of emergency. Although inspired by the Tang Dynasty, is also integrated eight areas of concrete spheres symbolize existing Pre-Columbian art of Costa Rica, as a way to symbolize the union of cultures.
The boulevard ends at 14th Avenue with a statue of Confucius in human size, located on a small pedestal. Although it was initially announced that it would build a second arc at the end of the boulevard (with the support of the Chinese community in Costa Rica), this was finally dismissed for reasons that were disclosed.
The works also involved a new sewer and installation of underground electrical wiring.
Initially, the work was estimated at a cost of around CRC 600 million colones (just over a million US dollars). He said that this work was done with the donation of $1 million provided by the government of China, and ¢200 million from the Municipality of San José.
Finally, although precise figures were not provided, the total cost of the buildings is estimated between $1.5 and $2 million, contributed mainly by the Chinese government.
The creation of this area was controversial from the very beginning. One common criticism was the comparatively low presence of Asian property owners in that area of the city, despite the fairly significant concentration of local citizens of Asian origin. However, the Asian population remains mixed with Costa Ricans, who are the majority. This trend is expected to change over time.
Another point of contention was the creation of the neighborhood on a street popularly known as "Paseo de los Estudiantes" (Students' Walk), which begins at the emblematic Church of Our Lady of Solitude. Some conservatives questioned whether the project promoted disrespect for the character and religious traditions that have been rooted in the church for more than a century.
Furthermore, the original street name has historical significance to Costa Ricans, because it refers to students of Liceo de Costa Rica who fought against dictatorship and corruption. The name also refers to the daily transit of thousands of young people on their way to their schools for over a hundred years.
A final point of contention was the impact on the road network of the city, which was already swamped with traffic. 9th Street was an important artery of transportation to the southern end of the capital, and its absence has caused an increased traffic in the surrounding streets, especially during rush hour.

Cheryl Chin is a Singaporean television and film actress. She was formerly known as a Singapore television actress and fashion model who competed in and won the Star Search Singapore finals in 2003. She also received the best actress award.
She has appeared mostly on Singapore's television drama and comedy series. In 2010, she appeared in Mongolian Death Worm, directed by Steven R. Monroe, starring Sean Patrick Flanery, and Machete, directed by Robert Rodriguez, starring Danny Trejo, Steven Seagal, Jessica Alba, and Robert De Niro.
Early life
Chin was born in Singapore to Irene and Albert Chin. Both her mother and father are of Chinese descent, though her father was born in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Chin has a younger brother, Sean. Because of her father's roots, she was raised in Malaysia for 3 years and then settled in Singapore until the age of 11. Chin grew up without both grandparents. Her grandmother died in the first plane crash of Singapore Airline's history, and she was told her grandfather died of a broken heart.
Chin attended Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus, an all-girls Catholic school, from first through eighth grade. In 2001, her mother remarried an American and the family migrated to Virginia in 1993. In 2001, in an attempt to pursue an acting career, Chin made a bargain with her mother that allowed her to return to Singapore for six months with all expenses paid to audition for roles. If she could not make a living from acting within the six months, she would have to attend an American business university. On the last day of her 6-month period, she won her first acting role in a theatre production for a cruise ship.
Career
Shortly after, Chin received starring roles in Singapore's prime-time television series such as: Singapore's longest running comedy TV series, Under One Roof, the hit TV movie Blueprint anthology series – Scars, School Days hit comedy TV series, and The Outsiders, an independent slasher film.
She was listed by FHM Magazine as one of the 100 Sexiest Women in the World in 2003 and 2004. She entered the Singaporean version of the TV talent show Star Search in 2003 and won the Best Acting Potential Award together with the Female Champion Award, becoming Singapore's representative for Star Search Asia Grand Finals. Chin won the first runner-up title and an artist contract with Mediacorp, Singapore's national television studios, to be part of their stable of performers. Under Mediacorp's management, she received her first dramatic role in An Ode To Life as Weng Xiaoyun, a muddle-headed nurse who unexpectedly falls into a love triangle. An Ode To Life was shown in 2004 on Mediacorp Television and later won the best dramatic television series award.
She went on to star in the 13-episode comedy series The Cheer Team, broadcast in 2004, as Miss Bai, a cheerleading teacher who was inappropriate for the job. While shooting The Cheer Team, she was offered a role in The Best Bet, a 14-episode Singaporean television series, as Lina Zhang, the love interest of both Christopher Lee's and Mark Lee's characters.
As her contract with Mediacorp came to an end in 2004, she completed filming of The Best Bet and returned to America. During her four years in Singapore, Chin appeared in four films, six television series, and four variety shows.
After taking a break for three years, she worked on two films in 2009: Mongolian Death Worm, a TV movie ordered by the Syfy Channel, and Machete, which was released in August 2010. Machete marked Chin's first villainous role.
She was the female champion of Star Search Singapore Finals 2003, was ranked No. 93 on FHM Singapore's 100 Sexiest Woman of the World 2003, and No. 90 in FHM Singapore's 100 Sexiest Woman of the World 2004.
Since moving to the U.S., Chin started a food truck called DFG Noodles, based in Austin, Texas. The truck serves noodle and rice dished inspired by Singaporean, Malaysian, and Indonesian cuisine.
Personal life
While in Singapore, Chin began a 2-year relationship with Brandon Fernandez, a veteran stage actor. Chin then met Lee Smith, a British businessman, in 2003, soon after winning Star Search Singapore. Their relationship ended shortly before Chin returned to the US in 2005.
Chin met Wes Thompson when she hired him as her Director of Photography on a pilot production.
Chin was raised as a Buddhist, Christian, and Catholic. Her great grandmother was Buddhist, her mother is Catholic, and her father is Christian. During childhood, Chin was close friends with her neighbour, Samantha, who is an Indonesian Christian. Chin would follow her to an Indonesian church where an interpreter's services were employed every weekend in order for her to understand the pastor. At the age of 11, Chin asked to be baptised as a Christian.

Kurt Niklas Lindgren (born June 26, 1972, in Sörmjöle, Umeå Municipality), known in the media prior to his arrest as Hagamannen ("The Haga Man"), is a convicted Swedish serial rapist. Lindgren was convicted of nine counts of sexual assault in 2006, two of which were labeled attempted murder, in relation to attacks in the city of Umeå from 1998 to 2005. The attacks were all made outdoors, involved physical violence and in some cases attempts to kill his victims. The nickname "Hagamannen" refers to the area in Umeå named Haga where Lindgren made his first assault.
Lindgren was identified and arrested by the Swedish police after they received a tip from the public on March 29, 2006. His DNA matched the DNA previously secured from the victims. On April 22 Lindgren confessed to six of the assaults. On July 19 he was convicted of eight assaults by the Umeå District Court and sentenced to 14 years in prison. Lindgren appealed to the Upper Norrland Court of Appeal, which on October 2 upheld the district court's sentence plus one case of rape in 2000. Lindgren's appeal to the Supreme Court was not granted.
Lindgren was released on July 28, 2015 and is now on probation after nine years served.
On August 22, 2015 he was hit in the head with a golf club. On 13 November 2015, the three suspected attackers were found not guilty of Lindgren's assault.
Partial list of attacks
August 1998: a 14-year-old girl is assaulted.
1:20 a.m, 9 May 1999: a 26-year-old woman is assaulted and raped in a park in Haga.
6 November 1999: three women are assaulted in three different locations in Haga. One of the women is raped.
19 March 2000: a 22-year-old woman is assaulted on Brandmannagatan.
19 March 2000: a 22-year-old woman is assaulted and raped in the university area. The woman almost died from her injuries and hypothermia.
1 December 2000: a 15-year-old girl is assaulted and raped in Ersboda.
Between 1 and 2 a.m, 10 December 2005: A 51-year-old woman is brutally assaulted and raped at Tegsbron. The woman was seriously injured and fought for her life while her assailant attempted to drag her to the edge of the ice covering the banks of the Ume river and throw her into the icy waters. The perpetrator bit her ear off during the assault, but police were able to locate it by using police dogs, and it was reattached at the university hospital.
13–15 December 2005: Two more women are assaulted, one at Tegsbron and another at the Mimerskolan. It is still not certain that the perpetrator in these cases was Hagamannen.
Police investigation
The investigation to find Hagamannen was one of the largest ever in Sweden. More than 30 policemen worked full-time to catch the serial rapist, but the investigation met some setbacks. For example:
The police received a tip from a woman at the university hospital in the year 2000 that a father of a newborn child bore a striking resemblance to the facial composite, but the police dismissed this tip. According to the woman she was told that it was unlikely that the father of a newborn child would be the perpetrator of such crimes. The suspect now in custody was at the university hospital at the time with a newborn child, and several assaults took place within the vicinity of the hospital at the time. The police are holding an internal investigation into why the tip was not taken more seriously.
With the knowledge that the perpetrator had unusually small feet, the Swedish police attempted to access armed forces records. All Swedish men are required to register with the armed forces, who in turn determine their suitability for military service. During this selection a physical examination is performed and records are kept in case the need arises for further conscripts. The armed forces refused to hand over their records or allow access.
DNA samples are taken from all children in Sweden in order to be used for medical research into hereditary illnesses at the PKU lab (the lab gets its name from Phenylketonuria). The police wanted to access this database in order to yield a suspect, but the lab refused. Some individuals have requested that their samples be destroyed; the police requested records of destroyed samples, but the lab refused.
The suspect was found by forcefully mass DNA testing males in the area. A matching profile was found after 777 tests.
The police then considered using a plainclothes female police officer in order to draw the perpetrator out, but this idea was discarded since such behaviour on the part of the police would constitute entrapment ("brottsprovokation") which is not allowed under Swedish law, according to JO (Ombudsmen of Justice, elected by the Swedish Government to ensure that the Swedish Government and its employees are following Swedish law.)
Before taking him into custody the police spent some time observing the suspect's daily routine. The suspect apparently liked to spend a lot of time alone in the garage that he built adjacent to his house. The locations that the police mapped out served as a basis for the police interrogation and are therefore likely to be thoroughly examined by police forensic technicians.
The facial composite has been a central point of the investigation, and its release to the media and general public ultimately proved to be what would yield the first suspect in the case. The police are also examining one unsolved murder and one death which took place under mysterious circumstances during the time that the Hagamannen was active. The DNA match will likely be the key evidence in tying the suspect to the crimes at trial.
Evidence
According to media reports, there are several facts in the case which indicate that the man which the police had in custody was the perpetrator:
DNA: The Swedish Police and Swedish State Criminalistics Lab secured DNA samples from at least three of the crime scenes. The DNA from the crime scene near the Ume River (where the 51 year old victim was assaulted) matched the suspect's DNA. According to the criminalistics lab the probability of error is one in one million samples, which they characterize as a nine on a scale from one to nine.
Facial composite: The suspect bears a striking resemblance to the facial composite- indeed he even jokingly referred to himself as Hagamannen when talking to his co-workers .
Height: The perpetrator is unusually short for a man. The suspect is also unusually short for a man.
Shoe size: The perpetrator has unusually small feet for a man, which the police have been able to determine by analyzing footprints left by the perpetrator. The suspect also has small feet, his co-workers even joked that he could be the perpetrator because of his unusually small feet.
Proximity: The suspect works in a car-repair shop in the Haga part of Umeå, which is within the vicinity of many of the attacks. He had 24-hour access to his place of employment. The police theorize that the suspect may have used his place of employment as a base to look for potential victims.
"Trophies": The police state that the perpetrator took "trophies" from at least three of his victims, such as identification documents. The police are searching premises that the perpetrator had access to in order to secure such trophies if they are in the possession of the perpetrator or in a location to which he had access. On 9 April 2006 the Police discovered a property located far from the suspect's residence and place of employment to which the suspect also had 24-hour access. The newly discovered property lies close to where some of the attacks took place.
Line-up: In cases where the perpetrator did not leave any DNA evidence, or where the victim was able to escape, a police lineup can be used to identify the perpetrator.
Knife: The police are also looking for a knife or knives used by the perpetrator in the property of the suspect, or in places to which he had access.
Alibi and other circumstantial evidence.
Arrest
In response to a tip from the public regarding Lindgren's resemblance to the facial composite, the police approached him for a voluntary DNA sample. Lindgren refused, but was compelled to provide the sample in accordance with a new law after being interviewed by police.
On 29 March 2006, police learned that the DNA sample matched those taken from the crime scenes. Two plainclothes officers were sent to Lindgren's place of employment. They arrived during his lunch break; Lindgren failed to return to work after lunch. Later that afternoon police released a media report indicating that they had arrested a suspect in relation to the attacks.
Suspect in custody
Lingren was described in media reports as a 33-year-old man living just outside Umeå, a Swedish citizen with no criminal record who was now suspected by the police as the alleged perpetrator until January 2006. He worked at a VAG car sales and repair shop as a sheet-metal worker, and was described as a normal family father with a common-law marriage and two children. He lived in Nyland, a small tight-knit community outside of Umeå.
Court proceedings
Under Swedish law a suspect can only be held for a short period of time by the police before they have to be arraigned. On 31 March 2006 at 3 p.m. the suspect was arraigned before the Umeå Court. For security reasons the hearing took place in the secure courtroom.
Much of the hearing took place behind closed doors, due to the nature of the crimes. A suspect can be held for an indefinite period of time prior to a trial, but the police and prosecutor have to show cause for this at arraignment hearings which have to be held at regular intervals. A suspect is allowed to request a defense attorney, Lindgren in this case requested Leif Silbersky, who was appointed as his public defender by the Umeå District Court.
Niklas Lingren was charged with four counts of assault, four counts of rape and two counts of attempted murder. At first he pleaded innocent to all charges against him.
On April 22 he confessed that he attacked six women.
Prison
A person suspected of a serious offence and who is awaiting trial is normally held by the Swedish Prison and Probation Service. The suspect is normally not allowed any visitors or to communicate with the outside world, with the exception of his attorney, until the trial is concluded. The suspect is allowed to read books and magazines with the exception of material covering the case against the suspect. The reasoning for incarceration and isolation is that the suspect might resort to further crime, try to influence witnesses, alter his or her own statements or glean information useful for when he or she goes through a psychiatric evaluation.
Media coverage
The case received extensive coverage in Swedish newspapers and on Swedish television. During the years 1998-2006 many people, mainly women in the city of Umeå, were afraid to walk alone at night.
Publication of name and picture
The Swedish newspaper Expressen published the name of the suspect together with his photograph shortly after his arrest by the police. A photograph of Lindgren was featured side-by-side with a composite sketch released by the police on the cover of the newspaper the day after his arrest.
The publication of the name and photograph of the suspect has been criticized by some since it can hamper the police investigation, reduce the evidentiary value of a police lineup for the cases where there is no other physical evidence and since it causes emotional suffering for the victims, the suspect's family and friends, and the suspect himself if he is later acquitted.
The editor of the newspaper defended the publication, stating that it could prompt other victims to report assaults, that the suspect was in custody, that there was a strong interest from the public who have a right to know (the purpose of the journalist), and that the evidence against the suspect in this case is especially damning.
When he became aware of the publication through his lawyer Leif Silbersky, Lindgren reported the publication to the Press Ombudsman, who can decide to bring the matter before the Swedish Press Council. The Swedish Press Countil will then offer an opinion on whether the publication was in line with good journalistic practice.
The publication of the name and photograph of the suspect in this case can be compared to the murder of Foreign Minister Anna Lindh in 2003 where the daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter choose to publish the name of the suspect (who was later convicted) while he was still at large. The publication at that time was justified by the newspaper since the killer was at large and that the police had already released a photograph to aid in his capture, a practice which was also done with the Malexander police killers Tony Olsson, Andreas Axelsson and Jackie Arklöv.
There is a difference in tradition between Sweden and other countries when it comes to the publication of a name and footage or photograph of a suspect. For instance, in the U.S. it is customary for the media to use the real name of a suspect, while in Sweden a suspect is usually referred to by their age (i.e. the 33-year-old in the present case) until a conviction has been secured.

Flux Information Sciences were a three-piece noise rock band based in Brooklyn, New York. The band was formed in 1996 by vocalist/guitarist Tristan Bechet (born in Portugal in 1973, raised in Brazil) and keyboardist Sebastian Brault (born in Madagascar, raised in France) who met in art school in Marseilles. A revolving drummer policy saw Derek Ethridge replace Phil Hernandez in 1999, who was in turn replaced by Siobhan Duffy. Eventually the band settled on the line-up of Bechet and Brault, with Christopher Pravdica on electronics.
Flux Information Sciences were influenced by the 1980s New York No Wave scene, by bands such as The Contortions, James White & the Blacks, Suicide and Foetus. In 2004, Flux were featured on S.A. Crary's documentary on No Wave Kill Your Idols. Private/Public was recorded before a live audience who were required to stand naked and blindfolded before the band.
The band's debut album A Dedication to Volt was released in 1997, followed by Services in 1999. Their third album, Summer, was released in 2000, and described by Joe Silva of AllMusic as seeing Flux "retain...[their] ability to playfully challenge listeners to find entry points to their material, while maintaining their levels of chaos and invention". In 2001, Flux signed to Young God Records and released "Private/Public". Young God label boss and Swans vocalist Michael Gira described the band as "life-threatening".
The New York Times described their sound as "a clattering, dissonant, choppy, propulsive racket, punctuated every so often by a vocal chant; it's ominous and mockingly jubilant, somewhere between the Gang of Four and Ministry." In "Kill Your Idols", Bechet provides insight to the band's approach to rhythm when he described living across the road to "a metal stamping factory, and the rhythms and sounds that they make, are truly fucking phenomenal, just fucking...pff...amazing and groovy as shit; those are the kind of rhythms I enjoy, It's almost as if New York City is the script and we interpret that.
Since the break-up of the band, Bechet has formed the Pinksock Records label, and worked with a number of artists, such as F. M. Einheit of Einstürzende Neubauten and Khan. He has released albums by several experimental projects including his heavy metal mash up vinyl "Please Forgive Me" and "Waiting for the Sun" CD by "Sauna KIngs". After the Label faded, Bechet founded "SERVICES" with Christopher Pravdica; a former member of Flux.

Ersari baba (Turkmen : Ärsary baba) is the legendary leader of the Ersari tribe (one of the major Turkmen tribes), who, or most probably whose historical prototype, lived in 13th or 14th century in Mangyshlak (Mangystau Province) or in the vicinity of Balkan mountains (Balkan velayat of Turkmenistan). He was the founder of the loose Sayin Khan Turkmen confederation and is considered to be a common ancestor of all Ersari people, who today live predominantly on the banks of the Amudarya River in Lebap velayat of Turkmenistan and northern provinces of Afghanistan. "Ersari" literally means "yellow brave man" from Turkic (Turkmen) "er" or "är" - brave man, and "sari" or "sary" - yellow.
Origin
Not much is known about the life or activities of Ersari baba or his historical prototype, information is acquired mostly through the historical work and literary masterpiece of the Khan of Khiva and famous historian, Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur, called Shajara-i Tarākima. In his work, Abu al-Ghazi claims that Ersari baba was from the Salur tribe, which in turn is one of the Oghuz tribes and whose people descended from the son of Oghuz Khan - Dag Khan.
It is also mentioned that Ersari baba had 3 sons: Eynel Ghazi, Zeynel Ghazi, Mustafa Ghazi and 1 daughter: Mamabiqah (Mamabike).
He had grandchildren through Eynel Ghazi: To're, Sokman, Layna and Charshangi; through Zeynel Ghazi: Bekevul and Gara, through Mustafa: Uludepe and Gunesh.
Nowadays, descendants of Charshangi live in the vicinity which carries the same toponym. Gara and Bekevul live in Garabekewul etrap of Lebap velayat (Turkmenistan), Gunesh and Uludepe are found in the northern provinces of Afghanistan.
Sayin Khan confederation
Ersari baba is widely considered to be the founder of the Sayin Khan confederation, a loose confederation of Turkmen tribes living in Mangyshlak in XIII or XIV century, a period just after a catastrophic Mongol invasion of Khwarazmian Empire. It is believed that he managed to assemble warring Turkmen tribes who stayed in Central Asia (others left for Anatolia and territories that today are part of Azerbaijan) and put their differences aside to create a new yurt. He is celebrated among the Ersari people as a hero who played a prominent role in consolidation of Turkmen tribes at that arduous period in Central Asia.
The label Sayin Khan confederation was given by the Safavids, who most probably referred to their emergence from the breakup of the Golden Horde.

The building has six stories, built of brick supported by steel girders over a concrete basement. The Bowery and Spring Street facades are both clad in Maine granite, with the original public spaces contained in a rusticated base with large, deep-set windows surmounted by rounded arches. Above this, the facades consist of banded stonework with three identical bays of paired windows facing the Bowery and six facing Spring Street. The third, fourth, and fifth floors have projecting piers and paneled spandrels between the windows; the sixth-floor windows have round arches. A cornice with modillions runs above the first story, and a heavier cornice decorated with fillets, ovolos, and cyma moldings above the fifth. At the roofline is a copper parapet, in the style of a classical sima, which features anthemia, rosettes, and waves and would have been noticeable including from elevated trains.
The main entrance is in an angled corner bay and consists of a projecting portico with bluestone steps, while a second entrance in a portico facing the Bowery is at street level. Both porticos have free-standing Tuscan columns and elaborate wrought-iron gates; the main doorway also has paneled pilasters on either side and is topped by an arched transom.
The other two facades are of brick, as are the roof parapets. The north side has windows protected by steel shutters. The original sash windows were in place , but transoms over the main entrance and ground-floor windows were blocked with acrylic panels. Interior changes include modification of the banking hall in 1922, the addition of more stairs in 1924, additional fireproofing by the 1960s to accommodate storage of records on the upper floors, and later alterations for residential use, including the creation of a basketball court in the former banking hall.
History
During the middle decades of the 19th century, rising numbers of German immigrants in New York led to the development of a neighborhood called Kleindeutschland or Little Germany, which became the most important German-American center in the United States. It had a commercial center on the Bowery north of Division Street. The Germania Bank of the City of New York was established by local businessmen in 1869 in leased premises at 185 Bowery; its first president was Christian Schwarzwaelder, owner of a furniture store on East Broadway, and the vice-president, Joseph Kuntz, owned a brewery on Houston Street and lived on the Bowery.
In 1878 the Germania Bank moved to a purchased loft building at 215 Bowery; in the early 1890s it expanded into 217 Bowery next door. To accommodate continued growth, in December 1896 the bank bought three lots at the northwest corner of the Bowery and Spring Street. Plans for a new freestanding, fireproof building were filed on January 3, 1898; it was designed by the German-born architect Robert Maynicke and is considered one of his major works. The construction firm of Marc Eidlitz, an American of German descent, built it at a cost of around $200,000. Construction began on February 4, 1898 and was certified complete on January 21, 1899. The bank had already opened for public inspection on December 28, 1898 and for business on January 3, 1899, the one-year anniversary of the plans being filed.
The president of the Germania Bank at the time was Edward C. Schaefer. The building originally contained a public banking hall on the first floor, safe deposit vaults in the basement, and office spaces including the president's office and the meeting room for the Board of Directors. In 1900 the bank published a promotional pamphlet emphasizing the security of the vaults.
The Germania Bank changed its name to the Commonwealth Bank in early 1918, probably as a result of rising anti-German sentiment during World War I. In the mid-1920s, the Bowery was the location of several banks, the Commonwealth Bank being one of five between Division and Houston Streets. Starting in 1923 with the opening of a branch on Lexington Avenue, Commonwealth expanded to other parts of Manhattan and to the Bronx and Brooklyn. It was then acquired in 1927 by the Manufacturers Trust Company, which became the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company following a 1961 merger.
Manufacturers Hanover operated 190 Bowery as a branch bank up to the mid-1960s. In 1966, it sold the building to Jay Maisel, a commercial photographer, who purchased it under the name Archival, Inc. Maisel maintained his residence, studio, and gallery there, was married there in 1989, and between 1966 and 1968 rented the second and fourth floors to artists Adolph Gottlieb and Roy Lichtenstein, respectively. The building, known locally as "The Bank", was widely thought to be abandoned. The building cost $300,000 annually to maintain, including heat and taxes. In August 2014, it was quietly put up for sale; on February 5, 2015, it was sold to Aby Rosen.
A 2019 film by Stephen Wilkes, Jay Myself, documents Maisel's move from the building after 49 years. The same year, clothing brand Supreme opened a store within 190 Bowery. By 2022, the Germania Bank Building was home to EmpireDAO, a co-working space for cryptocurrency and blockchain ventures.

Josef Schretter (18 March 1856, Inzing - 18 March 1909, Innsbruck) was an Austrian painter; specializing in portraits and genre scenes.
Biography
His father, Peter Paul Schretter, was a teacher and organist. In 1867, he began an apprenticeship with a carver in Thaur, but quit after only a year, to attend an arts and crafts school associated with the . After graduating, he became an assistant to the church painter, in Zirl. From 1874 to 1878, he was enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna, where his primary instructors were Christian Griepenkerl, August Eisenmenger and Karl von Blaas. After 1878, he studied history painting at a private school operated by Leopold Carl Müller.
He passed the teachers' examination for freehand drawing, returned to Innsbruck in 1879, and spent two years teaching at the Bundesrealgymnasium. Between 1881 and 1885, he made study trips to several locations in Italy, and to Tunis, where he devoted himself to painting Orientalist scenes.
From 1886 to 1891, he worked as a portrait painter in Munich. He then settled permanently in Innsbruck, but travelled extensively throughout Northern Europe, to execute works on commission; portraying numerous members of the German, Danish, Dutch and Russian nobilities. In recognition of these achievements he was named a Professor by the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.
In 1899, he married Anna Gaisberger, the daughter of a hotelier, and they had two children. In 1907, he acquired the studios belonging to the late landscape painter, Edmund von Wörndle. He died two years later, aged only fifty-three, shortly after being diagnosed with cancer.
Streets in Innsbruck and Inzing have been named after him.
While most of his works are in private collections, some may be seen at the Tyrolean State Museum, the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere and the Staatliches Museum Schwerin.

Kicker magnets are dipole magnets used to rapidly switch a particle beam between two paths. Conceptually similar to a railroad switch in function, a kicker magnet must switch on very rapidly, then maintain a stable magnetic field for some minimum time. Switch-off time is also important, but less critical.
An injection kicker magnet merges two beams incoming from different directions. Most commonly, there is a beam circulating in a synchrotron, in the form of a particle train which only partially fills the arc. As soon as the circulating particle train has passed the kicker, it is switched on so that an additional batch of particles may be appended to the train. The magnet must then be switched off in time to not affect the head of the train when it next rounds the synchrotron.
An ejection kicker magnet does the opposite, diverting a circulating beam so it leaves the synchrotron. Almost always, an ejection kicker is used to eject the entire particle train, emptying the synchrotron. This means that it has the entire tail-to-head gap in the synchrotron to function, and the switch-off time is essentially irrelevant. However, it must hold a stable field for longer (one full rotation of the synchrotron), and must generate a stronger magnetic field, as it is used to eject a higher energy beam that has been accelerated in the synchrotron.
The magnets are powered by a high voltage (usually in the range of tens of thousands of volts) source called a power modulator which uses a pulse forming network to produce a short pulse of current (usually in the range of a few nanoseconds to a microsecond and thousands of amperes in amplitude). The current produces a magnetic field in the magnet, which in turn imparts a Lorentz force on the particles as they traverse the magnet's length, causing the beam to deflect into the proper trajectory.
Because a kicker magnet applies a particular lateral impulse to the beam, to achieve a fixed deflection angle the strength of the kick must be accurately matched to the momentum of the particles. This is part of the power modulator's job.

History
The company was founded by university professors Péter Horváth and Erich Zahn, as well as entrepreneur Hans-Georg Winderlich as IFUA Institut für Unternehmensanalysen in October 1981. In the following years, former PhD students of Horváth entered the young company who significantly helped to shape the structure of the advisory group and who later held or still hold important management positions: Bernd Gaiser, Michael Kieninger, Reinhold Mayer, Andreas Renner and Christof Schimank. After the death of Hans-Georg Winderlich and the separation of Erich Zahn in 1989, the company was continued as IFUA Horváth & Partner GmbH. Together with his partners, Péter Horváth encouraged the development of new controlling methods (for example activity-based costing or the target costing approach) in his company. In the mid-1990s, he was involved in introducing the concept of the balanced scorecard in Europe.
In 2000, the company re-organized itself: Horváth AG was founded as a holding company of the Horváth & Partners group and issue-areas, as well as industry expertise were bundled into competence centers. Péter Horváth took over the Chairmanship of the Board. The Board and the Partners are responsible for the management of the holding and its subsidiaries.

Bodyguard is a British political thriller television series created and written by Jed Mercurio and produced by World Productions as part of ITV Studios for the BBC. The six-part series centres around the fictional character of Police Sergeant David Budd (Richard Madden), a British Army war veteran suffering from PTSD, who is now working for the Royalty and Specialist Protection Branch of London's Metropolitan Police Service. He is assigned as the principal protection officer (PPO) for the ambitious Home Secretary Julia Montague (Keeley Hawes), whose politics he despises. The series comments on many issues regarding the controversy around government monitoring of private information and its regulation, and also on PTSD.
The series began broadcasting on BBC One on 26 August 2018, achieving the highest viewing figures for a new BBC drama in the multichannel era and the highest BBC viewing figures since 2008. The BBC commissioned the series from the then-independent World Productions in 2016. Since ITV Studios Global Entertainment acquired the company in 2017, they have handled international distribution for the series. Netflix agreed to a distribution deal to broadcast the show outside the United Kingdom and Ireland.
The series was met with critical acclaim, particularly for Madden's performance. The series received numerous award nominations including the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama, with Madden winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama. At the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards, the series was nominated for Outstanding Drama Series.
A second series is in development.

Reception
Audience
Viewing figures for the series were high, with 10.4 million (peaking at 11 million) viewers watching the overnight broadcast of the finale live on BBC One alone. As significant numbers of viewers watched the show on catchup service iPlayer after transmission, the series sparked a debate on how the media should handle spoilers. Radio Times revealed the fate of Montague in a cover story during the series's original transmission.
Critical response
The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the series a 93% approval rating, with an average rating of 8.2/10, based on 70 reviews. The critical consensus reads, "Bodyguard maintains a palpable tension throughout its pulpy proceedings to create an absorbing and addicting psychological thriller." On Metacritic, the series has a weighted average score of 79 out of 100 based on 12 reviews, indicating "generally favourable reviews".
In a positive review, Varietys Daniel D'Addario describes the series as "Both juicy in its delving into character psychology and rippingly ready to tear up its playbook as it goes, it's a six-episode ride that demands, and rewards, a quick binge." D'Addario further states that the series "excels at both the daring, gasp-inducing twist and the methodical construction of slower-burning thrills", and that Madden's performance "by turns tripping on his own empathy, and angrily operating beyond rationality, makes us believe anything is possible — a wonderful asset for a show that seeks above all else to keep us watching". Allison Keene, writing for Collider, lauds the performances of the cast, describing Madden's as "enthralling" and "absolutely heartbreaking", and depicts the series as "an exhilarating ride that truly showcases Madden as a major talent". Writing for Time, Judy Berman states that the series "subverts thriller tropes just often enough to earn its reliance on them", and in a five-star review Guardian critic Lucy Mangan expresses that "[Mercurio] has created something as dark and moreish as ever". Hanh Nguyen of IndieWire describes the series as "relentless", and the performances of Madden and Hawes as "mesmerizing". Robert Rorke of the New York Post writes that the series is "gripping" and that Madden "gives a magnetic performance".
In a more mixed assessment, Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times wrote that "Some elements of the series struck me as odd...and certain climactic revelations had me talking to the screen. But the action is well mounted and the tension tightly wound; it uncoils, when it does, with a satisfying snap". In a similarly mixed review, The Atlantics Sophie Gilbert acknowledged that "Hawes is elegantly unknowable as Julia...she gives just enough nuance in her performance to make you question whether she has a heart or is extremely deft at emotional manipulation", however she laments that "To watch Bodyguard's six episodes is to suspend disbelief and submit to its surprises. It helps not to expect too much more than that, particularly when it comes to the show's lavish employment of archetypes, which inevitably leads to its more questionable elements."
Intelligent Protection International Limited's CEO Alex Bomberg on BBC Radio 5 Live said that the plot, in particular the personal relationship that Budd developed with his charge, would be frowned upon as both unprofessional and putting the charge at risk. Detective Chief Inspector Steve Ray, of the Royal and Specialist Protection Command (RaSP) told the BBC that “the relationship that we have with our principals is purely professional”, adding that anyone who crossed the line would quickly be identified and would not last very long in Protection Command or even in the police service”.
Accolades

United Nations Security Council resolution 1621, adopted unanimously on 6 September 2005, after recalling all previous resolutions on the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including resolutions 1565 (2004) and 1592 (2005), the Council authorised the temporary increase in the strength of the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) to assist with upcoming elections.
The additional personnel joined the then-largest United Nations peacekeeping operation, totalling 19,000 personnel.
Resolution
Observations
The Council reiterated the importance of holding elections in the process of national reconciliation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and called upon all transitional institutions to ensure that they were free and fair. It welcomed efforts by the Congolese authorities to promote good governance and economic management, and praised the donor community for their contributions towards this process.
There was also concern at hostilities in the east of the country, including violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.
Acts
Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council approved of the Secretary-General Kofi Annan's recommendations to increase the size of MONUC by 841 personnel, including police units. The resolution emphasised the temporary nature of the increase, with a view to its reduction from 1 July 2006. The additional units would provide support to the electoral commission, as well as assistance to the transitional government and international financial institutions to help promote good governance and economic management.

Bermuda first participated at the Olympic Games in 1936, and has sent athletes to compete in every Summer Olympic Games since then, except when they participated in the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott. Bermuda has also participated in every Winter Olympic Games since 1992.
With Flora Duffy's gold medal in the women's triathlon in 2021, Bermuda is the smallest country in the world by population to have won a gold medal at the Summer Olympics. Since 1976, they had been the smallest country, by population, to win a medal overall, however that record ended when Alessandra Perilli won bronze for San Marino in trap shooting in 2021.
The National Olympic Committee for Bermuda was created in 1935 and recognised by the International Olympic Committee in 1936.

Gregory Rousseau (born April 5, 2000) is an American football defensive end for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at the University of Miami. As a redshirt freshman there in 2019, he recorded 15.5 sacks and won all-conference honors and was named ACC Defensive Rookie of the Year. Rousseau was drafted by the Bills in the first round of the 2021 NFL Draft.
Early life and college
Rousseau attended Champagnat Catholic School in Hialeah, Florida. He played defensive end, safety and wide receiver in high school. He committed to the University of Miami to play college football.
Rousseau played in the first two games of his true freshman year in 2018 before suffering a season-ending ankle injury and redshirted. He entered his redshirt freshman year in 2019 as a backup but eventually took over as starter later in the season. He was named ACC Defensive Rookie of the Year after recording 15.5 sacks that season, second in the nation behind only Chase Young's 16.5. He opted out of the 2020 season due to concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.

Irsina Cathedral (, Duomo di Irsina), formerly Montepeloso Cathedral, is a Roman Catholic cathedral dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, located in Irsina in the region of Basilicata, Italy. Since 1977 it has been a co-cathedral of the Archdiocese of Matera-Irsina, and was previously, from 1818, a co-cathedral of the Diocese of Gravina-Irsina. Before that it was the seat of the Diocese of Montepeloso.
The present building was constructed in the 13th century and remodelled in 1777. It has a Baroque façade and a Gothic campanile. It contains a baptismal font of red marble and a number of 18th-century paintings of the Neapolitan School.
The cathedral also contains a well-known marble statue of Saint Euphemia. This has been attributed by some critics to Mantegna, and was exhibited as his at Mantua in 2009. Others however, including Giovanni Agosti, curator of the Mantegna exhibition at the Louvre, attribute it to Pietro Lombardo. The discussion continues.
The festival of Saint Euphemia, patron of Irsina, takes place on 14–17 September. On 16 September the keys of the city are offered to the archbishop on the altar of the cathedral, and by him to Saint Euphemia. A long procession then takes place through the streets of the town carrying the statue of the saint, the reliquary containing her arm and the icon of Our Lady of Divine Providence.

Red flag laws were laws in the United Kingdom and the United States enacted in the late 19th century, requiring drivers of early automobiles to take certain safety precautions, including waving a red flag in front of the vehicle as a warning.
Red flag law in the United Kingdom
In the United Kingdom, the Locomotive Acts was a policy requiring self-propelled vehicles to be led by a pedestrian waving a red flag or carrying a lantern to warn bystanders of the vehicle's approach.
In particular The Locomotive Act 1865, also known as Red Flag Act, stated:
The Red Flag Law was repealed in 1896, by which time the internal combustion engine was well into its infancy.
Red flag law in the United States
In the United States, the state of Vermont passed a similar Red Flag Law in 1894, only to repeal it two years later. This law stated that "[t]he owner or person in charge of a carriage, vehicle or engine propelled by steam, except road rollers" must have a "person of mature age [...] at least one-eight of a mile in advance of" the vehicle, to warn those with livestock of its impending arrival. If at night, it also required the aforementioned person to carry a red light. The law did not apply to rail vehicles.

Sheridan County (standard abbreviation: SD) is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 2,447. Its county seat is Hoxie. The county was named in honor of Phillip H. Sheridan, a general of the American Civil War era.
History
Early history
For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.
19th century
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France while keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square miles Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.
In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1873, the remaining unorganized western part of the state was divided into 22 new counties, including Sheridan County. Sheridan County was then organized in 1880, with the county seat at Kenneth. After it became apparent in 1886, that the railroad line coming to the area would run south of Kenneth to the new town of Hoxie, the residents of Kenneth accepted an offer to get new lots in Hoxie (and move their buildings at no expense), and the county seat transferred to Hoxie. The Lincoln-Colorado railroad line opened through the county in 1888, and formally became part of the Union Pacific Railroad in the late 1890s.
20th century
The population of Sheridan County grew in the early 20th century and peaked in 1930 at 6,038 residents. Since then the population has steadily declined, as part of the general depopulation of the Great Plains.
The rail line stayed in operation in Sheridan County until 1998. After flooding east of Plainville in the 1993 floods damaged the line, the railroad concluded it would not be cost effective to rebuild, and the entire line from Plainville to Colby was abandoned by 1998.
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.03%) is water.

Demographics
As of the census of 2000, there were 2,813 people, 1,124 households, and 795 families residing in the county. The population density was 3 people per square mile (1/km2). There were 1,263 housing units at an average density of 1 per square mile (1/km2). The racial makeup of the county was 98.65% White, 0.14% Black or African American, 0.07% Native American, 0.07% Asian, 0.14% Pacific Islander, 0.36% from other races, and 0.57% from two or more races. 1.46% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.
There were 1,124 households, out of which 30.40% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 63.80% were married couples living together, 4.50% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.20% were non-families. 27.60% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.80% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.46 and the average family size was 3.01.
In the county, the population was spread out, with 26.30% under the age of 18, 5.80% from 18 to 24, 23.70% from 25 to 44, 23.90% from 45 to 64, and 20.30% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 42 years. For every 100 females there were 100.10 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 95.80 males.
The median income for a household in the county was $33,547, and the median income for a family was $38,292. Males had a median income of $26,351 versus $16,250 for females. The per capita income for the county was $16,299. About 12.00% of families and 15.70% of the population were below the poverty line, including 27.30% of those under age 18 and 5.50% of those age 65 or over.
Government
Presidential elections
Sheridan County is overwhelmingly Republican. Since Michael Dukakis in the heavily drought-influenced 1988 election won almost 39 percent of the county's vote, no Democratic presidential candidate has topped 22 percent, and in 2016 Hillary Clinton's share plummeted into single figures.
Laws
Although the Kansas Constitution was amended in 1986 to allow the sale of alcoholic liquor by the individual drink with the approval of voters, Sheridan County has remained a prohibition, or "dry", county.

In artillery, caliber or calibre is the internal diameter of a gun barrel, or - by extension - a relative measure of the barrel length.
Rifled barrels
Rifled barrels introduce ambiguity to measurement of caliber. A rifled bore consists of alternating grooves and lands. The distance across the bore from groove to groove is greater than the distance from land to land. Projectiles fired from rifled barrels must be of the full groove to groove diameter to be effectively rotated by the rifling, but the caliber has sometimes been specified as the land to land diameter before rifling grooves were cut. The depth of rifling grooves (and the consequent ambiguity) increases in larger calibers.
Steel artillery projectiles may have a forward bourrelet section machined to a diameter slightly smaller than the original land to land dimension of the barrel and a copper driving band somewhat larger than the groove to groove diameter to effectively seal the bore as it becomes enlarged by erosion during prolonged firing.
United States Navy guns typically used rifling depth between one-half and one percent of caliber. Projectile bourrelet diameter specification was less than land to land diameter with a minus manufacturing tolerance so average clearance was about . Driving band diameter was groove to groove diameter plus .
Barrel length
The length of the barrel (especially for larger guns) is often quoted in calibers, used, for example, in US Naval Rifles or larger. The effective length of the barrel (from breech to muzzle) is divided by the barrel diameter to give a dimensionless quantity. As an example, the main guns of the s can be referred to as 16"/50 caliber. They are 16inches in diameter and the barrel is 800inches long (16 × 50 = 800). This is also sometimes indicated using the prefix L/; so for example, the most common gun for the Panzer V tank is described as a "75 mm L/70," meaning a barrel with an internal bore of 75mm, and 5,250mm long (17ft 2.69 in).
The bore to barrel length ratio is called caliber in naval gunnery, but is called length in army artillery. Before World War II, the US Navy used 5"/51 caliber (5" L/51) as surface-to-surface guns and 5"/25 caliber (5" L/25) as surface to air guns. By the end of World War II, the dual purpose 5"/38 caliber (5" L/38) was standard naval armament against surface and air targets. All three had a bore diameter of 5inches (not 5.51 or 5.25 or 5.38 as often misread).
Naval rifles, although constructed and manufactured in roughly the same manners as land based artillery, were built to much more stringent and studious standards than land based weapons, and for good reason. At sea, a weapon had to perform, without fail. There was no ready replacement, nor one that could be readily supplied. Over time, the terms of pound (weight of shell) and bore (the actual bore of the weapon) became confused and blurred. Eventually, when the technology existed, the bore (in inches or millimetres) came to be the standard measure. For naval rifles, the initial change was to actual bore, thus facilitating the manufacture of standard projectiles. They then began to measure the effective length (and therefore range) of the weapon in calibers. These are a measure of the standardized bore of the barrel versus the rifled bore of the barrel. In other words, a 12/45 is 12"×45= the length of the rifled bore of that gun in inches. This explains the differences in both penetration and long range performance of various naval rifles over the years. In addition to the possible improvements in overall performance (i.e. muzzle velocity and striking force), the increase in barrel length also allowed, in some circumstances, an increase in projectile size as well. For example, the American 14/45, as introduced in the s, fired a 1250lb. projectile. Later improvements to the design, lengthening the rifle itself and also altering the breech, allowed a 1400lb. projectile and, overall, a greater barrel life. Again we see this pattern with the US 16" guns. The initial design was 45 calibers in length and fired a 2200lb. shell. The later re-design to 50 calibre not only allowed a higher velocity but also a heavier 2700lb. shell, which ultimately came to be accepted as the greatest naval shell ever deployed in combat.
Early gun barrels were short and thick, typically no more than 26 calibers, as the gunpowder propellant they used burned very quickly and violently, and hence its acceleration time was short. Slower-burning "brown powder" formulations of gunpowder allowed gun barrel length to increase slightly in the 1880s but enormous quantities of brown powder were required. New slower-burning "smokeless powder" propellants available from the 1880s onwards such as Poudre B, cordite and nitrocellulose allowed a gentler prolonged acceleration, hence gun barrels were made progressively longer and thinner. The new formulations were far more powerful propellants than gunpowder and far less was needed by weight as they transformed almost entirely to gases when burned. Muzzle velocity became limited only by the length of barrel that was feasible, both in terms of the construction methods of the day and in terms of any practical constraints imposed by the gun's manner of use.
The practical effect of long barrels for modern guns is that the projectile spends more time in the barrel before it exits, and hence more time is available for expanding gas from the controlled burning of the propellant charge to smoothly accelerate the projectile, bringing about a higher velocity without placing undue strain on the gun. In internal ballistics terms, if the base of a projectile is thought of as a piston propelled by the expanding gas, then as barrel length increases the volume swept by the piston also increases, and hence the amount of energy that can be extracted from the gas's burning increases. A longer barrel allows more propellant to be used: the propellant is all burned fairly early in the projectile's journey along the barrel, except in the very common instance where combustion is still occurring as the projectile leaves the muzzle and a visible muzzle "flash" is produced.
The projectile continues to accelerate as long as the pressure behind it is sufficient to overcome bore friction. The excess energy will continue to accelerate the projectile until it exits the muzzle. If the pressure behind the projectile drops sufficiently before the projectile leaves the bore, the projectile can and will slow while still within the barrel, despite residual bore pressure behind the projectile. A light charge with insufficient pressure to expel the projectile will result in a "squib", or projectile lodged in the bore. This pressure is reduced by the increasing barrel volume the gas has to fill, and in order to achieve maximum muzzle velocity with the shortest barrel length, the projectile should exit the barrel as the gas pressure reduces to a small fraction of the maximum, although unlike chamber maximum chamber pressure, the small fraction desired is impossible to measure. In modern guns, increased muzzle velocities can be produced by altering powder composition and/or using duplex charges containing two different powders in order to extend the "pressure curve" farther down the bore. By exposing the projectile base to a given pressure for a longer length of time, velocity can be increased without elevating the pressure level generated.
Technological improvements had made it possible to introduce into use long gun barrels that are strong enough to withstand the forces involved in accelerating the shell to a high velocity, while remaining light enough to be reasonably mobile, rigid enough to maintain accuracy, and having a bore able to withstand many firings before needing refurbishment. In World War I 45-caliber naval gun barrels were typical, in World War II 50- to 55-caliber barrels were common, with Germany already manufacturing tank guns of 70 calibers by 1943.
Today, 60- to 70-caliber barrels are not uncommon, but the latest technology has allowed shorter barrels of 55 calibers to attain muzzle velocities of , as with the Rheinmetall 120 mm tank gun. However, by using discarding sabots, many such guns fire projectiles which are much smaller than the gun bore, so the relationship of projectile size to barrel length is not as straightforward as with older ordnance.

Trumpler 10 (also known as C 0846-423) is an open cluster located in the constellation Vela. It was possibly discovered by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1751-52, as the cluster's location data matches well with No. II.6 in his catalog. The cluster was also officially discovered by James Dunlop in 1826 and rediscovered independently by R.J. Trumpler in 1903.
A photometric investigation was performed in 1962 which studied 29 stars within the cluster and determined 19 additional possible members. In the study, a minimum age of 3*107 (30 million) years and a distance of 420 parsecs were derived.

The Mexican Federal Army (), also known as the Federales in popular culture, was the military of Mexico from 1876 to 1914 during the Porfiriato, the long rule of President Porfirio Díaz, and during the presidencies of Francisco I. Madero and Victoriano Huerta. Under President Díaz, a military hero against the French Intervention in Mexico, the Federal Army was composed of senior officers who had served in long ago conflicts. At the time of the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution most were old men and incapable of leading men on the battlefield. When the rebellions broke out against Díaz following fraudulent elections of 1910, the Federal Army was incapable of responding. Although revolutionary fighters helped bring Francisco I. Madero to power, Madero retained the Federal Army rather than the revolutionaries. Madero used the Federal Army to suppress rebellions against his government by Pascual Orozco and Emiliano Zapata. Madero placed General Victoriano Huerta as interim commander of the military during the Ten Tragic Days of February 1913 to defend his government. Huerta changed sides and ousted Madero's government. Rebellions broke out against Huerta's regime. When revolutionary armies succeeded in ousting Huerta in July 1914, the Federal Army ceased to exist as an entity, with the signing of the Teoloyucan Treaties.
Under Díaz, 1876-1911
The Federal Army in Mexico had long been an interventionist force in Mexican politics, with notable generals becoming Presidents of Mexico. After the War of the Reform and the successful ouster of the French empire in Mexico in 1867, the soldiers who defeated them were adherents of the liberalism. General Porfirio Díaz rose through the ranks without formal military training, and was a hero of the Battle of Puebla on 5 May 1862. He came to power by coup in 1876, ousting the civilian President Sebastián Lerdo. Díaz knew the power and the danger of a strong military and once he became President of Mexico, he sought to curtail the power of the generals, who held provincial power and were not under control of the central government. It took him "nearly fifteen years to achieve full military control." He did so by a combination of bribes and other economic lures for those he could not confront militarily. He divided Mexico into eleven military zones, whose boundaries did not correspond to state boundaries. To prevent collusion between the state governors, whom he appointed, and military commanders, he rotated commanders on a regular basis so that they could not build a local power base. By a variety of means, he reduced the officer corps by 500, including 25 generals.
Díaz also sought to professionalize the army. He moved the Mexican Military Academy back to Chapultepec Castle, the Presidential residence. In 1847, cadets at the academy resisted the invading U.S. forces, in their deaths called the Niños Héroes, but the academy was relocated and lost prestige. Díaz revived it, with cadets to be sons of "good families" (code for "white"). They were taught the arts of modern warfare. By 1900, some 9,000 graduates were officers in the Federal Army. Military training prepared cadets for war with foreign invaders, when the reality was the army dealt with internal order, along with the rural police force.
By early 1900, the majority of generals in the military were not trained at the military academy, but had participated in the war against the French, that had ended some 35 years previously. The generals were old. The Federal Army was overstaffed, with far more officers commanding too few recruits, with 9,000 officers and ostensibly 25,000 enlisted men. Many who were counted as enlisted men did not exist, but were on the muster rolls because the officers received a stipend to provide food for their men. Officers pocketed the difference between the 25,000 enrolled and the 18,000 or so who actually served.
Díaz had initially said that he would not run in the 1910 presidential elections. A rich hacienda owner from Coahuila, Francisco I. Madero, published a book entitled The Presidential Succession of 1910, excoriating militarism in Mexico and calling for democracy. Madero's ideal was civilian rule. Only when it became more than clear that Díaz would remain in power by any means did Madero call for an armed rebellion against him in the 1910 Plan of San Luis Potosí. Minor rebellions broke out on the 20 November 1910 date he set, which the Federal Army suppressed. But more a more serious rebellion in Chihuahua led by Pascual Orozco and Pancho Villa demonstrated the weakness of the Federal forces, surprising the rebels. More rebellions in various parts of Mexico broke out, forcing Díaz to resign in May 1911. "Considering the small number of battles actually fought, [the rebel] triumph was more directly attributable to the weakness of the federales than to the strength of the Ejército Libertador."
Under Madero, 1911-1913
Although the revolutionaries supporting Francisco I. Madero had shown the weakness of the Federal Army and forced Díaz to resign and go into exile, by the Treaty of Ciudad Juárez in May 1911, Madero retained the Federal Army and called for the demobilization of the revolutionaries who had enabled the victory of his cause. Revolutionary Pascual Orozco rebelled against Madero in 1912, and Madero sent the Federal Army to quash his burgeoning rebellion. Madero also sent troops to fight Emiliano Zapata, whose revolutionary forces had never demobilized and remained in rebellion until 1920. Shortly after Madero was elected president, Zapata and others issued the Plan of Ayala, declaring themselves in rebellion against Madero, since he had not moved on land reform. Madero sent the Federal Army to Morelos.
In February 1912, the Federal army consisted of 32,594 regulars and 15,550 irregulars. This was far below the official number of 80,000 as stated by the army executive. By September of the same year the official strength of the army was 85,000 men. In addition there were 16,000 Rurales, 4,000 Urban Police and 16,200 Militias, rural guards and other pro-government men under arms.
Under Huerta, 1913-14
In April 1914 Huerta claimed his army had reached the size of 250,000 men, with 31 regiments of Rurales and 31,000 Militias. A more realistic assessment of his men by that July was 71,000, while U.S. observers said it was closer to 40,000. Specific numbers aside, the rapid expansion of the army had led to a deterioration in the quality of the average recruit, or more accurately, conscript. Huerta made an attempt to increase the size of the army by ordering a mass conscription (leva), of men on the streets by his press-gangs. Press-gangs would capture men as they left church or pull them from cinemas. Very few of the men under his command were volunteers and many deserted the army. Huerta tried improving morale by increasing pay in May 1913 by 50%. At the same time 382 military cadets were given commissions and attempts were made to increase the number of cadets in training.
Federal army generals were often corrupt and guilty of undermining morale with poor leadership. Some were so corrupt their dealings extended as far as selling ammunition, food and uniforms to the enemy. Also guilty of this corruption were Huerta's two sons, Victoriano Jr. and Jorge, both of whom had been placed in important positions overseeing the procurement of arms, supplies, uniforms and ammunition.
Despite these problems Huerta worked at creating an army capable of keeping him in power. He tried to expand the army by creating new units to distance them from the defeatism of the former Porfirista army. To bolster the resolve of the population he militarized society in the Prussian style, including military-style uniforms for all government employees and schoolboys and military drills on Sundays. Huerta and his general also sent 31 cadets to Europe to study military aviation in order to increase Mexico's air power.
Huerta's greatest success was attracting the support of many former rebels, such as Benjamin Argumedo, "Cheche" Campos and, most notably, Pascual Orozco, whom Huerta had fought against when serving Madero's government. Orozco offered Huerta the services of his 3,000–4,000 seasoned men, who proved essential in the fight against the Constitutionalist armies. When not helping the defense of Federal garrisons and towns, Orozco's men acted as very effective guerrillas.
Defeat and dissolution, August 1914
The Federal Army was disbanded on August 13, 1914, a month after Huerta's exile in the Teoloyucan Treaties. "Totally discredited, the old Federal army had come to the end of its run. Unable to control the Zapatistas, the Villistas, and other rebels, following the expulsion of Huerta, the Federist force disbanded and disappeared." At the time the full strength of the Federal army was 10 Generals of Division, 61 Generals of Brigade, 1,006 Jefes, 2,446 Officers, 24,800 other ranks and 7,058 horses. In addition there were 21 regiments of Rurales with 500 men in each, a total of 10,500 men.
The Federal army was replaced by the Constitutionalist Army of Venustiano Carranza under the terms of the Teoloyucan Treaties, signed by Constitutionalist general Alvaro Obregón with the commander of the Federal Army.

The Atari Video Music (Model C240) is the earliest commercial electronic music visualizer released. It was manufactured by Atari, Inc., and released in 1977 for $169.95. The system creates an animated visual display that responds to musical input from a Hi-Fi stereo system for the visual entertainment of consumers.
Overview
By interpreting an input musical waveform, the Video Music translates the levels of musical intensity and mellowness into colors and shapes that are output to a graphical display. The console is attached to an audio source and then operated by an adhesive-backed switch box that is glued to the back of a television display. Audio signal visualizations take the basic form of a two-part diamond. The outer part represents the left audio channel while the right channel is represented by the inner part. Varying colors and shapes provide a wide variety of patterns, designs, and images depending on the audio sample played.
After the unit is powered on, a toggle switch may be used to select between "TV" (music visualization inactive), and "Game" (music visualization active). When in the "Game" position, visual data is broadcast on VHF channel 3 by default, but may be set to channel 4. Unlike Atari's previous video game systems, the Video Music system's switch box featured a 75 Ohm pass-through F connector allowing the television antenna or cable to remain attached and thereby eliminating the tiresome process of detaching and reattaching the cable every time the user switched from watching normal television broadcasts to using the visualizer. Any audio source may be used for visualization including Atari's video game system audio, and visualizations can either be watched "live" on a television screen or recorded on a VCR by using a balun converter.
Technical details
The Video Music hooks up to a TV through an RF switchbox. The other hook ups are left and right RCA jack inputs that hook up to an audio amplifier's RCA outputs. The face is a brushed metal plate and the sides are particle board with walnut veneer. The unit is turned on by pushing a power button, and visualization is controlled by five potentiometer knobs and 12 additional push-buttons.
The knob controls are as follows:
Gain: Two knobs controlling the left and right audio input signals strength. These increase the size of the visual pattern.
Color: One knob controlling color. This increases the number of available colors from a solid color to a rainbow of colors.
Contour: Two knobs controlling the left and right audio input signals visual representations shapes from soft to geometric. These act to soften shapes or increase geometric complexity of the design.
The push button controls are as follows:
Power: Turns unit on and off.
Shape (solid): Any Shape or Image that is displayed will be solid
Shape (hole): One stereo channel controls the outside with a hole in the center controlled by the other stereo channel.
Shape (ring): Both stereo channels will represent two outline shapes that retain their thickness with the pulse of the music
Shape (auto): The system automatically cycles at random between the different Shape settings as well as the next eight buttons:
Horizontal 1: Displays one generated image.
Horizontal 2: Displays two horizontal generated images
Horizontal 4: Displays four horizontal generated images
Horizontal 5: Displays five horizontal generated images
Vertical 1: Displays one generated image
Vertical 2: Displays two vertical generated images
Vertical 4: Displays four vertical generated images
Vertical 8: Displays eight vertical generated images
The last four buttons have an auxiliary function when the "Auto" button is pushed. In this mode, three of these buttons represent Solid, Hole and Ring. When the unit is in auto, it will retain the shape of one of those three shapes. The fourth button is "Auto All". This sends the unit into semi-automatic mode, cycling through shape, horizontal and vertical options but not affecting the user-set gain, color or contour settings.
Development history
Developed under the codename Project Mood, the Video Music unit was designed by Robert Brown, a developer of the home version of Pong. According to Atari design engineer, Al Alcorn, when Atari was on tour promoting the device, a Sears representative asked what the developers were smoking when they invented it. With that, a technician stepped forward holding up a lit joint.
In March 1978, the unit was described in a patent under the name "Audio activated video display".<ref name=patent>, Abstract:An interface unit for providing visual color display of objects on an unaltered TV receiver which are directly associated with the music on an audio source. Audio energy is derived from separate channels of a stereo system. This audio information is presented on the screen in the form of objects in various arrangements. Color is derived based on the zero crossing rate of each channel. Each channel has its own color associated with it. Objects may be solid, or rings, or one may be "subtracted" one from the other. If desired, the different arrays may be selected automatically in a random manner. A spectral color modulator using phase shifted techniques is incorporated.</ref> It is considered to have been commercially unsuccessful and production was discontinued after only one year on the market.
Reception
The Video Music system was reviewed in Video magazine as part of a special "VideoTest Report" in 1978. The reviewers gave it mild but positive coverage, describing it as "a well-constructed machine and an interesting component to be used as an adjunct to stereo sound," but warning that "once the novelty wears off the display can become somewhat monotonous." The same report recommended it for "those who find it relaxing, stimulating, or therapeutic to watch psychedelic displays."
Appearance in popular culture
Devo used a Video Music screen as a background in the video for "The Day My Baby Gave Me a Surprise". It appears again, connected to a vocoder, in the music video for "Beautiful World".
Daft Punk used a screen in their video "Robot Rock".
The diamond pattern visuals from Video Music can be seen in several scenes from the 1979 movie Over the Edge where the mute character Johnny watches the visuals in his bedroom.
The diamond pattern visuals from Video Music appeared in an episode of The X-Files'' (Season 1 Episode 7, "Ghost in the Machine") as part of a video surveillance system.

History
The current site of the Willow Grove Park Mall was originally Willow Grove Park, a popular amusement park that existed from 1896 to 1975. In 1978, Federated Department Stores and The Rubin Organization announced plans to build a mall on the site of the former amusement park. The plans for the mall were approved by Abington Township in 1979, which included a downsizing to three anchor stores from four among concerns from residents about the size of the future mall. The Willow Grove Park Mall opened on August 11, 1982. The mall was designed with a Victorian theme honoring the former amusement park. The developers of the Willow Grove Park Mall were Federated Department Stores and The Rubin Organization and the architect was RTKL. When the mall opened, the original anchor stores were Bloomingdale's, Abraham & Straus, and B. Altman and Company. Bloomingdale's had relocated to the mall from a freestanding store in Jenkintown. When it opened, the Willow Grove Park Mall was intended to be an upscale mall. In 1984, Federated Department Stores sold its share of the mall to the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States for . In 1986, B. Altman and Company closed its store, which reopened as Sears in 1987. Sears relocated to the mall from a store in Abington. Around this time, the store selection at the mall broadened to also target the middle class. In 1988 Abraham & Straus closed and became Strawbridge & Clothier, which had relocated to the mall from a store in Jenkintown.
The mall was acquired by PREIT and the Pennsylvania State Employees' Retirement System in 2000 for from a group of pension fund clients managed by Lend Lease Real Estate Investments. In 2001, the mall underwent a major renovation which included the addition of Macy's as an anchor, the construction of a parking garage with 800 parking spaces adjacent to Sears and the food court, and the addition of a carousel at the third-floor entrance opposite the food court. The renovation of the mall cost . PREIT assumed full ownership of the Willow Grove Park Mall in 2003 by acquiring the Pennsylvania State Employees' Retirement System's 70% share of ownership for . In 2005, a mosaic wall with images from the former Willow Grove Park was installed in the mall. The mosaics were created by the Abington Art Center's Youth Empowerment Program and the Abington Township Balanced and Restorative Justice Program from designs made by Carol Strinton-Broad. In 2006, Strawbridge's closed due to the acquisition of its parent company May Department Stores by Federated Department Stores; a small portion of the former store on the upper floor became home to The Cheesecake Factory in September 2007. The lower two floors were planned to open as Boscov's; however, it never opened due to the chain filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2008.
On November 25, 2006, during one of the busiest shopping weekends of the year after Thanksgiving, a small fire broke out in the Forever 21 store that forced the evacuation of 6,000 shoppers; no injuries were reported. On the evening of June 15, 2011, a 16-year-old boy from Upper Moreland Township who was smoking synthetic cannabis jumped from the third level of the parking garage, suffering injuries.
On July 28, 2011, it was announced that JCPenney would open a store on the lower two floors of the vacant Strawbridge's. In addition, it was announced that Bravo! Cucina Italiana and Nordstrom Rack would open locations on the third floor of the former Strawbridge's. Bravo! Cucina Italiana opened in November 2011 while Nordstrom Rack opened in May 2012. Forever 21 also relocated to a larger store at the former Strawbridge's site in December 2011. The JCPenney store opened in October 2012. On January 30, 2015, it was announced that Sears would lease some of its space to Irish retailer Primark. Sears would remain in its space on the first level while Primark will operate in the remainder of the space, mainly on the second level. Primark opened on July 19, 2016. On March 17, 2017, it was announced that the JCPenney store would be closing as part of a plan to close 138 stores nationwide. The JCPenney store closed on July 31, 2017.
A Macy's Backstage outlet store concept opened within the Macy's store on June 2, 2018. On January 24, 2018, the Abington Township Board of Commissioners approved plans for a Studio Movie Grill in the former JCPenney space. The Studio Movie Grill was to be an 11-screen dine-in movie theater with a bar. Studio Movie Grill was planned to open in early 2020 before plans were cancelled. In 2022, a Tilted 10 entertainment center will open in the former JCPenney space. On December 2, 2019, a Yard House restaurant opened at the mall in the space formerly occupied by Bravo! Cucina Italiana.
On January 18, 2022, it was announced that Sears will be closing in 2022. This was the last full-service Sears location in Pennsylvania.
Economic impact
The Willow Grove Park Mall serves as a major regional attraction for Abington Township and is the third most profitable mall in the Philadelphia area. In the Pennsylvania part of the Philadelphia area, the Willow Grove Park Mall is the second most profitable mall after the King of Prussia mall. The mall is regarded as one of three most successful locations for retailers entering the Philadelphia market due to its location and store selection. In 2019, the Willow Grove Park Mall saw sales per square foot of $763, which is the highest among all malls owned by PREIT. The mall employed 2,065 people in 2018, making it the third largest employer in Abington Township with 7.86% of the jobs in the township.
The opening of the Willow Grove Park Mall led to the decline of retail along Old York Road in Abington and Jenkintown, with department stores such as Bloomingdale's, Sears, and Strawbridge & Clothier relocating from this area to the mall during the 1980s. A Lord & Taylor store in the same area closed in 1989, but was eventually replaced by the King of Prussia mall location in 1995.

Lost Islamic History: Reclaiming Muslim Civilisation from the Past is a book on Islamic history, written by American researcher and historian Firas Alkhateeb. It was first published in 2014 via Hurst Publishers in the United Kingdom.
Per the author, the book is intended to serve as a primer for readers unfamiliar with the subject of Islamic history.
Synopsis
The book covers a brief overview of the history of Muslim Civilization, from the early days of Islamic Civilization to modern day.
Release
Lost Islamic History: Reclaiming Muslim Civilisation from the Past was first published in the United Kingdom on 1 August 2014 through Hurst Publishers. A revised and expanded second edition was released on 15 November 2017, also via Hurst Publishers. This newer edition contained an additional chapter entitled "The Islamic Sciences", which covers aspects of Islamic sciences not covered in the 2014 release.
Reception
The Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, recommended the book via Twitter as a read for young people during the COVID-19 lockdowns, as he felt that it was "An excellent brief history of the driving force that made Islamic civilisation the greatest of its time and then the factors behind its decline." After this tweet Alkhateeb discovered that a fake version of his book containing inaccuracies and other misinformation was being digitally distributed on the Internet, prompting him to warn people readers that the false version was "entirely inaccurate & Islamophobic".

Superior Credit Union is a credit union serving Cincinnati, Toledo, and Lima, Ohio, and surrounding regions. It originally served employees of the Superior Coach Company, and after the latter closed in 1981 it expanded by absorbing other credit unions and extending its geographic footprint from Lima to a wide area of western Ohio.
As of September 2021, it is the fourth-largest credit union in Ohio by assets.
History
It was founded as Superior Coach Employees Federal Credit Union in 1954 to serve employees of the Superior Coach Company, based in Lima, Ohio. When Superior Coach Corporation closed in 1981, the credit union obtained a community charter expanding its membership eligibility to residents of the City of Lima, changing its name to Lima Superior Community Federal Credit Union. During the 1980s it absorbed five other credit unions, and expanded its membership to employees of several other companies.
During 1990–1994 its field of membership expanded to encompass all of Allen County, and in 1999 to neighboring Auglaize County. In 2004, it expanded into four more counties and renamed itself Superior Federal Credit Union. During 1995–2014 it absorbed four more credit unions. It increased from one to five locations during the 1990s, and had ten locations in 2012. It expanded into mortgage services in 1999 and small business services in 2005.
In 2015, it changed from a federal charter to a state charter, renaming itself Superior Credit Union. This change made it easier for the credit union to expand its geographic scope, as federal rules were directed towards metropolitan areas rather than rural areas. Its scope expanded to 22 counties in western Ohio, and during 2015–2019 it absorbed six credit unions, allowing it to expand into the Cincinnati and Toledo metropolitan areas. It tied for fourth in the number of mergers nationwide among credit unions during June 2016 to June 2021. Many of these credit unions had not previously offered mortgage services, but provided means for growth in Superior's mortgage program. It also purchased a bank branch in Clifton, Cincinnati, along with its accounts and deposits, a move which is unusual for a credit union but was possible due to its high capitalization. It also expanded its real estate services by acquisition.
In 2019, it opened an educational branch in Bath High School staffed by students who had taken a personal finance or economics class, to promote good financial habits and careers in banking. As of 2020, it donated half a million dollars to local charities each year. Also in 2020, executive Kurt Neeper said that the credit union contacts members if they can refinance their mortgage to a lower rate, as a means of keeping their business. In 2021, Cincinnati Bengals player Sam Hubbard became the credit union's brand ambassador.

Michael Christopher Woodford, MBE (born ) is a British businessman who was formerly president and COO (April 2011) and CEO (October 2011) of Olympus Corporation, a Japan-based manufacturer of optics and reprography products.
Joining Olympus in 1981 and rising to manage its European operations, Woodford was the first non-Japanese person to be appointed as the company's CEO in October 2011, having "exceeded expectations" as president and chief operating officer for the previous six months. Within two months, he became a central figure in exposing the Olympus scandal, having been removed from his position after serving two weeks, when he persisted in questioning fees in excess of US$1 billion that Olympus had paid to obscure companies, which appear to have been used to hide old losses and appeared to have organised crime connections. The scandal rocked Japanese corporate governance, led to the resignation of the entire Olympus board and several arrests of senior executives, including the previous CEO and chairman, and the company's former auditor and bankers among others, and made Woodford one of the most highly placed executives to turn whistleblower. By 2012 the scandal he exposed had developed into one of the biggest and longest-lived loss-concealing financial scandals in the history of corporate Japan.
His bravery and stance in the scandal, in which he understood his life was at risk due to the criminal organisation connections of some of the suspect monies he had questioned, earned him several prestigious awards for "Businessperson of the Year".
Following a settlement for defamation and wrongful dismissal by Olympus, Woodford now consults on corporate governance worldwide, speaks on human rights, whistleblower laws and road safety. He also undertakes philanthropy, and has stated he has given several millions of pounds to charities. In November 2012 Woodford published a book about the Olympus scandal, and a film was also underway.
Biography
Woodford was born in Staffordshire, but moved to Liverpool with his mother when he was seven after his parents divorced. Woodford attended the King David High School, Liverpool.
According to the Olympus website, Woodford, a graduate of Millbank College of Commerce, joined KeyMed, a UK medical-equipment unit of Olympus, in 1981.
In 2008 he became executive managing director of Olympus Europa Holding GmbH. Woodford had originally flown to Tokyo to submit his resignation after Olympus purchased Gyrus, a move that would have normally been under Woodford's direct authority but instead had been arranged directly by Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, the then-chairman, president, and CEO of Olympus. Kikukawa instead made Woodford head of all of Olympus's Europe operations and gave him a seat on the board of directors.
In February 2011, due to substantial growth in the European businesses, Woodford was promoted to company president, while Kikukawa stayed on as chairman and CEO. It was reported that Woodford clashed with Kikukawa after outside media sources began investigating some of Olympus's questionable acquisitions, which eventually compelled Kikukawa to give up his title as CEO.
On 30 September 2011 Woodford was appointed chief executive officer of Olympus Corporation, after 30 years of working for the group, while Kikukawa remained as chairman of the board. He was the first non-Japanese person to be appointed as the company's CEO, making Olympus one of the few Japanese companies to be headed by a foreign businessman (others include Sony, Nissan Motors and Mazda). As the top executive officer in the company, Woodford would have been responsible for selecting his management team. At the time of Woodford's appointment, he was regarded as an unlikely choice. Reuters reports there were rumours that he only got the job because he would be "easy to control"; some Japanese observers saw Woodford, who speaks no Japanese, as the chairman Kikukawa's new pet. An article in FACTA underlined the sceptics' views, saying "The fact that the company picked a bottom-ranking foreign executive director with virtually no significant responsibilities from amongst a total pool of 25 potential candidates, including the vice-president who was responsible for medical instruments ... set tongues a-wagging."
Upon becoming CEO, Woodford discovered that hundreds of millions of dollars had been transferred from Olympus to advisers and companies located in places such as the Cayman Islands. After attempting to seek answers as to why the questionable transactions took place, he was dismissed from his position as President and CEO on 14 October 2011, although he retained his seat on the board of directors. As a result of Woodford's ousting, board chairman Kikukawa reassumed the titles of president and CEO but resigned these positions on 26 October 2011 and was succeeded by Shuichi Takayama. 19 top current and former executives, including six present board members (including Takayama who resigned all his positions and left the company at an extraordinary general meeting in April 2012) are defendants to a lawsuit.
Fearing for his safety after his dismissal, Woodford immediately left Japan and flew to England. After arrival in London he offered to speak to investigators.
He returned to Tokyo on 23 November and later met with investigators and, under police escort, Olympus personnel.
On 30 November 2011, Woodford resigned from the Olympus board but said that he had an "alternative plan" to manage the company by staging a proxy fight. However it has been reported that Woodford was rejected by Olympus's institutional investors because they were "uncomfortable with the Englishman's combative style and also his plans to recapitalise the company through private equity or a rights issue". On 6 January 2012, on failing to secure support from Japanese institutional shareholders, Woodford announced that he would abandon his proxy fight to take control of the Olympus board. Instead, his lawyers had initiated legal proceedings in London seeking unspecified damages for dismissal from his four-year contract. Woodford said that the 12-week public scandal had taken an enormous emotional toll on him and his family: "I'm not superman. I can't change opinion in Japan in such a profound way. That has to come from within."
In June 2012, Woodford was awarded £10 million in an out-of-court settlement with Olympus over his dismissal.
After Olympus
Since 2012, Woodford consults on corporate governance worldwide, speaks on human rights, whistleblower laws and road safety. In November 2012 Woodford published a book about the Olympus scandal, and a film was also underway.
Woodford stated in 2014 his concerns that far from learning from the scandal, Japan's response was to become even more secretive and unsupportive of change in areas highlighted by the scandal.

Canada's Sweetheart: The Saga of Hal C. Banks is a Canadian docudrama, written and produced by Donald Brittain. It aired in 1985 on CBC Television.
The film was about Hal C. Banks, a controversial American labour union leader who came to Canada in 1949 to lead a sectarian fight between rival shipping unions. Banks left Canada in 1962 after being brought up on criminal charges.
Banks appeared before the Norris Commission, which was set up to investigate his strongarm tactics and links to beatings of opposition unions, and non signed shipping companies. In particular was the ULS and the Maritime Union run by his former lieutenant Michael Sheehan, who had testified before the Norris Commission against Banks, and led the push to loosen the SIU grip on the Great Lakes.
Maury Chaykin played the role of Banks in dramatic reenactments.

Winner of five awards, including Gemini Awards for best screenplay and best direction.

John Steiner (7 January 1941 – 31 July 2022) was an English actor. Tall, thin and gaunt, he attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and performed on-stage for the Royal Shakespeare Company, but was best known to audiences for his roles in Italian films, several of which became cult classics.
Early life and acting career
Steiner was born in Chester, Cheshire on January 7, 1941. He attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and joined the Royal Shakespeare Company. He acted in the role of Monsieur Dupere in Peter Brook's production of Marat/Sade. He reprised the role when the play was transferred to Broadway, and again for the 1967 film adaptation.
He found work primarily in films including and the original Bedazzled (1967) with Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. In 1969, Steiner was hired to play a part in the Spaghetti Western Tepepa, and also appeared opposite Franco Nero in White Fang, directed by Lucio Fulci. In 1971 he starred in the television series Hine. In 1979 he featured in the leading role of Leo in a television production of Design for Living by Noël Coward.
He found himself in demand in Italy and moved there, appearing in a great number of Italian exploitation and B-films including police actioners (Violent Rome), westerns (Mannaja), war films (The Last Hunter), nazisploitation (Deported Women of the SS Special Section), sci-fi adventure films (Yor, the Hunter from the Future), and horror films, such as Mario Bava's Shock, Dario Argento's Tenebrae, and Ruggero Deodato's Body Count. He also became a favourite of famed Italian filmmaker Tinto Brass, featuring in Salon Kitty, the infamous Caligula, Action, and Paprika. He remained in steady demand until the late 1980s.
Retirement and later life
As the Italian film industry dwindled, Steiner retired from acting in 1991 and moved to California, where he became a successful real estate agent. Steiner later contributed to DVD extras on some of his films and gave interviews about his Italian work.
Personal life
Steiner was bisexual. During the 1960s he was in a long-term relationship with director John Schlesinger and became the basis for the character Bob Elkin (played by Murray Head) in Schlesinger's semi-autobiographical film Sunday Bloody Sunday.
He later married, and is survived by his wife of over 30 years
In addition to English, Steiner spoke French, Italian, and German.
Death
Steiner died in a car crash in La Quinta, California on 31 July 2022, at the age of 81.

'A' Field Battery is an artillery battery of the Australian Army. The unit has been in existence since 1871, having originally been raised as part of the New South Wales colonial defence force. As part of several different larger formations, the battery has served in many conflicts including the Sudan Campaign, the Second Boer War, the First World War, the Second World War, the Malayan Emergency, Confrontation, and the Vietnam War. Today it is part of the 1st Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery, attached to the 7th Brigade based at Enoggera, Queensland. It was previously an airborne unit, but no longer maintains that role. It is currently equipped with M777 howitzers.
History
Formation and early history
'A' Field Battery was originally formed as a permanent unit on 1 August 1871 following the withdrawal of British artillery units from Australia. This unit was equipped with four 9-pounder guns and two 24-pounder howitzers and had a strength of 100 personnel. The battery was deployed in 1885 to support the British during the Sudan Campaign. Consisting of seven officers and 168 enlisted personnel, under the command of Colonel John Richardson, the battery was re-equipped by the British with six 9-pounder guns and embarked from Sydney in early March. Most of the major fighting had concluded by the time the battery arrived and, after training, it undertook defensive duties to protect the railway around Handoub, remaining until May when it was withdrawn back to Australia. The battery lost three men from disease during the expedition. One officer was detached and served with the British Army in Burma at this time.
The battery's next involvement in conflict came during the Second Boer War, deploying aboard the transport Warrigal on 30 December 1899. Consisting of 179 personnel, including five officers, the battery was equipped with six 15-pounder field guns, and throughout the war deployed mainly in detached sections, each consisting of two guns. During the war, the battery was involved in several important actions, such as playing an important role in the capture of the Boer commander Christiaan de Wet's artillery pieces.
'A' Battery returned to Australia in August – September 1901. During its deployment, it lost one man killed in action, two died of disease; 45 others were returned to Australia due to illness. For its service in South Africa, the Royal Australian Artillery, represented primarily by A Battery NSW Regiment RAA, but also including the Machine Gun Section, Queensland Regiment RAA, and many individuals of the Queensland, NSW and Victoria Regiments RAA, was presented a Kings Banner. It was not the only Commonwealth artillery unit to have been honoured in this way, and Kings Banners were also awarded to the Royal Canadian Field Artillery, the Royal Canadian Garrison Artillery, the Cape Field Artillery, the Cape Garrison Artillery, and the Natal Field Artillery.
Following Federation, the battery became part of the Royal Australian Artillery Regiment, and consisted of four guns, based in Sydney. The battery was later used to raise the horsed 'A' Instructional Cadre. When the instructional cadres were disbanded in 1910, No. 1 Field Battery was formed as part of the permanent field artillery.
First World War
Following the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, the 1st Battery Royal Australian Field Artillery (RAFA) was used to raise the 1st Australian Imperial Force (AIF) Battery, along with other volunteers from the permanent batteries in Victoria and Queensland. Forming part of the 1st Australian Field Artillery Brigade, the battery was among the first units of the AIF to leave Australia. Following a period of training and preparation in Egypt with the rest of the AIF, the unit served at Gallipoli, where the brigade supported the British 29th Division around Cape Helles from early May. By October 1915, the brigade was transferred to Anzac Cove to support the Australian 2nd Division. After the evacuation of Allied troops from the peninsula in December, the brigade returned to Egypt for reorganisation before deploying to France and Belgium for service on the Western Front commencing in mid-1916. Consisting of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 101st Batteries, the 1st Field Brigade supported the 1st Division.
Second World War
Following the war, the battery was reconstituted and provided a mounted escort in Sydney during the Prince of Wales visit to Australia in 1920. During the period between the wars, the battery undertook several changes in name, eventually being designated A Field Battery, Royal Australian Artillery Regiment. In the final years before the war, it was expanded to two sections. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the battery changed its designation several times.
At the outbreak of the Second World War, A Field Battery came under the command of the School of Artillery, Holsworthy, in their mobilization role as Depot Battery. However, in August 1943, A Field Battery was reorganized to form the 2nd Australian Mountain Battery, following the successful involvement of the 1st Mountain Battery during operations around Buna and Wau. Equipped with 75 mm pack howitzers, under the command of Major William Stevenson the 2nd Mountain Battery arrived in New Guinea in September of that year, initially based around Port Moresby with the 3rd Division. In November, the battery was transferred to the 9th Division to provide support around Finschhafen. In early 1944, the battery moved to Lae and was re-assigned to support the 7th Division in the Finisterre Ranges, where its operations were hampered due to limited transport in the difficult terrain. The battery was moved to Dumpu in April 1944, where it came under the command of the 11th Division, before moving to Lae in May.
In November 1944, it subsequently moved to Bougainville for operations as part II Corps, initially based around Torokina, until moving forward to Pearl Ridge after its capture in late 1944, to support the Australians across the centre of the island towards the coast, operating under the command of first the 23rd Brigade and then later the 11th Brigade. In January 1945, the battery supported a landing around Amun, followed by an attack on a strong Japanese position. Further actions continued through March and April, during which the battery came under strong Japanese counter-battery fire. In June, the battery supported the failed amphibious landing at Porton Plantation. The battery remained deployed until the end of the war in August 1945.
Service since 1945
Following the end of the war, and returning to its original name, the battery was part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan; drawing personnel from the Royal Australian Artillery Headquarters and the 2nd Mountain Battery, the battery formed at Balikpapan on 7 October 1945 the 6th Independent Field Battery. Under the command of Major Thomas Rodriguez, the battery operated 25-pounder field guns over this period. On 21 February 1946, 2nd Mountain Battery was re-designated as 'A' Field Battery. On 22 December 1948, the battery returned to Australia based at North Head. On 25 May 1949, the battery became part of the 1st Field Regiment. In 1951, the battery moved to Georges Heights. In January 1955, the battery was re-designated as 100th (A) Battery. On 1 September 1957, the battery detached from the 1st Field Regiment for the Malayan Emergency arriving at Penang in October remaining overseas for two years. In 1958, the battery returned to the A Battery designation. The battery supported several Commonwealth Infantry Battalions and was closely associated with 2nd and 48th Field Regiments, Royal Artillery. On return to Australia, the battery rejoined 1st Field Regiment at Holsworthy. It also later served during the Indonesian Confrontation detaching again to join the 28th Commonwealth Infantry Brigade Group at Terendak Garrison on 21 October 1965. On 12 September 1967, the battery returned to Australia and became 'A' Field Battery, 19th Composite Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery at Holsworthy.
In October 1969, the battery became 'A' Field Battery, 12th Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery. The battery served in the Vietnam War arriving on 4 July 1971 at the 1st Australian Task Force base at Nui Dat deploying individual forward observers and guns at Nui Dat and several fire support bases to support the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) until November 1971. In 1974, following the amalgamation of regiments the battery became 'A' Field Battery, 8th/12th Medium Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery.
In 1984, the battery assumed the role of parachute deployable artillery for 3 RAR as part of the Parachute Battalion Group. In 1995, 105mm L119 Hamel guns were air dropped for the first time by the battery. In 1999, the battery deployed personnel to serve in East Timor as part of INTERFET. The same year the battery was made an independent battery after 8th/12th Medium Regiment moved to Darwin. In 2002, the battery became part of 4th Field Regiment. The battery adopted 3 RAR's parachute wings and dull cherry beret. In April 2002, the battery deployed to East Timor as part of UNTAET and later UNMISET in non-artillery roles with 3 RAR returning in October 2002.
The battery has since deployed personnel in artillery roles to Iraq and Afghanistan with the Reconstruction Taskforce and on secondment to 29th Commando Regiment Royal Artillery. The battery has also deployed personnel to East Timor for Operation Astute in non-artillery roles. In the late 2000s, the Parachute Battalion Group changed to a Airborne Combat Team reducing the battery's role supporting 3 RAR to maintaining the parachute qualifications of observers. On 30 September 2010, the battery became part of 1st Field Regiment and moved to Enoggera Barracks in Queensland in January 2011. An artillery parachute capability was to be maintained by a battery within 4th Field Regiment. In January 2011, the battery was re-roled into a gun battery and re-designated as 'A' (Gun) Battery, 1st Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery with the word "field" dropped from the battery's and regiment's title. Reorganising into a gun battery meant the loss of the battery's forward observers and joint-fire teams. The same year the battery equipped with the new M777A2 155mm Lightweight Towed Howitzer (LWTH). In 2012, the battery was to reorganise back to a traditional battery role by the end 2013 with the designation 'A' Battery.

Guyparkeria is a genus in the Gammaproteobacteria. Both species are obligate aerobic bacteria; they require oxygen to grow. They are also halophilic and have varying degrees of thermophilicity. They live in environments with high concentrations of salt or other solutes, such as in hydrothermal vent plumes or in hypersaline playas, and do require high sodium ion concentrations in order to grow, as is also the case in the other genus of the same family, Thioalkalibacter
Both species of this genus were originally published as members of the genus Thiobacillus, before they were reclassified in 2000 to Halothiobacillus, as Halothiobacillus halophilus and Halothiobacillus hydrothermalis, both of which reclassified on the grounds or morphological, genomic and physiological differences to the newly designated genus Guyparkeria in 2017, as Guyparkeria halophila and Guyparkeria hydrothermalis.

Aras Iskanderovich Agalarov (; ; born 8 November 1955) is an Azerbaijani-Russian billionaire real estate developer. Several sources have described him as a Russian oligarch.
Early life
Born in Baku, Agalarov was educated at the Azerbaijan Polytechnical Institute. There, he studied computer engineering and was a member of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan and Baku City Committee.
Career
Agalarov then opened the first Crocus Inter store, which became a retail business that includes malls offering housewares. This moved him into property development, where he built the Crocus City Mall, the largest shopping centre in Moscow. Adjacent to this he then built the largest trade center in Russia on the outskirts of Moscow, Crocus Expo, and has since developed a luxury housing development. He has partnered with Robert De Niro in Nobu Matsuhisa's two Moscow restaurants.
In 2012, the built a new campus for the Far Eastern Federal University outside Vladivostok. Agalarov says he had to buy a larger Gulfstream jet to visit the site, where he spent $100 million of his own money on cost overruns on the $1.2 billion campus of 70 new building on Russky Island overlooking the Pacific Ocean. He then won projects for a Moscow superhighway and two stadiums for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
In January 2013, Agalarov and his son visited Las Vegas, Nevada, after Donald Trump, the beauty pageant's owner, announced at Miss Universe 2012 that the next competition would be hosted by Agalarov in Moscow. He paid Trump $20 million to host the pageant. In November 2013, President Vladimir Putin awarded Agalarov the Russian Order of Honor. That month, Agalarov hosted Miss Universe 2013 at his Crocus City Hall. Moreover, Agalarov's wife acted as a judge on the panel while his son was one of the performers.
Herman Gref, who runs Sberbank of Russia, Agalarov and his son hosted a dinner for Trump on the night of the pageant. While in Moscow, Phil Ruffin, who is a partner in Trump International Hotel Las Vegas, and Trump met with the Agalarov and his son at the Ritz-Carlton. Trump then appeared in a music video with Agalarov's son alongside many of the contestants. Trump and Agalarov planned on a $3 billion project, with state-owned Sberbank agreeing to provide 70% of the financing.
Agalarov has served as a liaison between Trump and Putin. According to an interview, they once discussed the construction of a Trump Tower in Russia. Agalarov had also reportedly tried to set up a meeting between the two, but this was canceled due to Putin having to meet the Dutch royal couple at the time. Putin instead sent Trump a fedoskino miniature.
In 2014, Kyrgyzstan signed a treaty with Russia that named Crocus Group as the single supplier of services to integrate into the Eurasian Economic Union, avoiding competitive bidding on the $127 million deal.
Agalarov's son, Emin, helped arrange Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya's June 9, 2016 meeting with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort in Trump Tower. Following the meeting, Agalarov wired $1.2 million to a bank in New Jersey controlled by Emin, a transfer which is being investigated by American law enforcement.
Emin said that after Trump won the United States presidential election in 2016, Trump sent them a handwritten note, saying he does not forget his friends.
As of June 2017, he had an estimated net worth of US$1.91 billion, most of which is derived from his real estate ventures. In January 2017, Forbes listed him as the 51st richest Russian.
Personal life
Agalarov is married and has two children. His son Emin Agalarov is a businessman and singer-songwriter. Emin was married to Leyla Aliyeva, the daughter of the current President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, until they divorced in May 2015. Agalarov has twin grandsons from his son's marriage. In July 2017, Agalarov put his mansion in Alpine, New Jersey up for sale for $7 million. The mansion eventually sold in November 2017 for $5.8 million.

Sarah L. Sheppard "Sally" Young (January 1905 – February 27, 1970) was an American bridge player from Philadelphia who won many important tournaments in the 1930s and 1940s. She was the first woman and 17th player to achieve the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) rank of (ACBL Life Master).
Biography
Young was born in Pennsylvania, one of eight children born to George and Marcella Sheppard (née Stehr). Her paternal grandparents were born in Ireland, and her mother's grandparents were born in England. Young began playing bridge at 15 and was self taught until Charles Goren took her under his tutelage. Young was one of several strong players from the Philadelphia area who contended for "national championships" (ACBL) during the 1930s–40s— including her four 1939 Reisinger teammates, below.
With John R. Crawford, Goren, and Charles J. Solomon, Young won the Chicago Trophy (now Reisinger) championship in 1937, 1938, and 1939. (They played as a fivesome with B. Jay Becker in 1939.) In 1947 she teamed with three other women—Jane Jaeger, Kay Rhodes and Paula Ribner—and they shared the title with two other teams. (The Reisinger does not break ties. It was the first of 6 ties in 85 renditions to 2013.) It remains the only win, albeit shared, for an all-women team—the only win in North America in any major open teams competition.
Young and Helen Sobel won the annual North American women championship (now Whitehead Women's Pairs) in 1938 and again in 1939. That year she became the first woman to achieve the rank of ACBL Life Master; Sobel became the second in 1941. (They were 17th and 25th overall, of whom the first twelve preceded ACBL.)
From 1943 to 1946, Young teamed with Emily Folline, Helen Sobel, and Margaret Wagar to win the women teams (Sternberg Women's Board-a-Match Teams, now a knockout format named for Wagar) four years in a row.
She married Ralph C. Young in 1926. They had one son, Ralph Jr. She was living in Narberth, Pennsylvania at the time of her death in 1970 at Lankenau Medical Center, age 65.
Young was inducted into the American Contract Bridge League's Hall of Fame in 2001.
One of about 20 ACBL permanent trophies is named for Young. It is awarded annually to the winner of the Young LM–1500 Pairs tournament.

Wonderland was an amusement park that operated in the Longfellow neighborhood of Minneapolis from 1905 through 1911. The ten-acre site was located between Lake Street and 32nd Street and 31st and 33rd Avenues.
Attractions
A 120-foot tower, lit by thousands of electric lights, was Wonderland's focal point and could be seen from a distance of five miles. Among the other attractions were a scenic railway (roller coaster), old mill, carousel and house of nonsense. After the park's demise, some of its rides ended up at Excelsior Amusement Park on Lake Minnetonka. The aerial swing, however, was purchased by Marion Savage for use at Antlers Park in Lakeville.
One of the park's most popular features was the "Infant Incubator Institute", whose owner, Dr. Martin A. Couney, had similar exhibits at amusement parks and expositions throughout the country and in Europe. The hospital, the only remaining structure from Wonderland, is now an apartment building at the intersection of 31st Avenue and 31st Street.
Lawsuit
In 1905 Elim Presbyterian Church sued Wonderland in an effort to close the park down. Elim, on the northwest corner of 32nd Avenue and Lake Street, was opposite Wonderland's main entrance. It argued that the park's crowds and noise interfered with worship services. The case was settled out of court, and the owners of Wonderland had the church moved to land they had purchased at 33rd Street and 30th Avenue. The congregation, later known as Vanderburgh Presbyterian Church, continued at that location for decades, and a house of worship is found there still.

Robert Joseph “Rob” Coombes (born 27 April 1972) is an English musician and keyboard player for Supergrass.
He is the older brother of the band's lead singer, Gaz Coombes, and the most recent member to join Supergrass, officially joining in 2002, though he had been an unofficial member for the majority of the band's career to that point. He has played keyboards on all of the band's albums and tours as well as helping with the writing and arranging.
He favours the Hammond Organ, for which his playing has been described as “the perfect foil to Gaz's guitar bombast”. He lives in Oxford with his three children, Louis, Lila and Ailla. He has a second, younger, brother, Charly, who was keyboard player in the band 22–20s.

Enella Benedict (December 21, 1858 – April 6, 1942) was an American realism and landscape painter. She taught at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and was a founder and director for nearly 50 years for the Art School at the Hull House.
Early life and education
Enella Benedict was born in Lake Forest, Illinois, the daughter of cloth merchant Amzi and Catherine Walmath Benedict. Amzi Benedict was with the Field, Benedict & Company firm and was a city council member and mayor of Lake Forest. Her younger siblings included Caroline, Albert, Sydney and Kate.
Benedict attended Lake Forest University, where she studied painting and drawing and was a junior in 1876.
She studied art at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Art Students League of New York. She then traveled to Paris, France to study at the Académie Julian. Despite being at a prestigious academy, as a female student, she received less rigorous training and was charged more for tuition compared to male students. As a woman, she was often isolated from other students.
Career
Benedict made oil and watercolor portrait, figure, landscapes and urban scene paintings. Benedict's drawing and painting style was influenced by Realism and Impressionism in which she painted and drew individuals she encountered around her, such as residents of Hull House and local peasants, along with seascapes and rural landscapes.
In 1892, she became the founder and director of the Art School at Hull House.
In the 19th century a women's movement began to promote education, autonomy, and break into traditionally male dominated occupations. Organizations led by women, bonded by sisterhood, were formed for social reform, including settlement houses in working class and poor neighborhoods, like Hull House. To develop "new roles for women, the first generation of New Women wove the traditional ways of their mothers into the heart of their brave new world. The social activists, often single, were led by educated, often single New Women.
Benedict lived at Hull House, as did Jane Addams, and supported the Art School program for almost 50 years, teaching clay modeling, drawing, painting and lithography. She managed the artist-in-residence program and other teachers. The art program, led by social reformer Benedict, was intended to offer education and cultural opportunities to disadvantaged neighborhood residents, having promoting some labor professions as art forms, such as textile fields. Benedict created opportunities for artists to exhibit their works, including the Art Institute of Chicago. Reported in Pots of Promise: Mexicans and Pottery at Hull-House, 1920-40: "In proportion to enrollment, there probably have been more exhibiting artists who started in its classes than in most other schools in the country."
While at Hull House, she also taught at the School of The Art Institute of Chicago, Benedict published a column entitled Ms. Benedict Knows about stories about Hull House. where she worked in the mornings which provided income so that she could work afternoons at Hull House without taking payment. She often traveled to Europe during the summers.
Benedict exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts, the Illinois Building, and The Woman's Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Her work was exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago given by the Art Students League of Chicago and other exhibitions. An art gallery at Hull House was dedicated in her name to promote the work of its artists In 1938 an retrospective was held of her work was held at Benedict Gallery.
She was a member of the Palette Club in Chicago. Her works are in the collections at Hull House, Rockford Art Museum in Illinois, National Museum of Women in the Arts and the Smithsonian Institution.
Death
Benedict died on April 6, 1942 in Richmond Virginia.

Canton House is a historic office building located on the northeast corner of Water Street and South Street in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It is a -story Colonial Revival-style building, with seven bays across the front façade of Water Street to the south and three bays across the side facing South Street to the west. The first story level is in marble and brick is laid in Flemish bond from the second story up. It has a sloped peaked roof with two dormer windows facing west to the side. The main entrance features two fluted Corinthian stone columns.
It was constructed in 1923 as the headquarters of one of Baltimore's oldest, largest and most colorful businesses, The Canton Company, a business established in 1828 by Peter Cooper (1791-1883), noted engineer and industrialist most remembered for inventing and manufacturing the Tom Thumb steam locomotive for the recently established Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the first passenger railway line in America in 1827 as it made its transition from using horse power to steam power to pull its railroad cars on the first segment of the line from Baltimore southwest to Ellicott Mills, Maryland on the upper Patapsco River from Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore. Columbus O'Donnell, the son of John O'Donnell, a sea captain who brought in the first trade cargos from Canton, China to Baltimore and America in 1784, along with William Patterson (1752-1835), a noted city merchant, civic leader, co-founder of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the father of the infamous Elizabeth ("Betsy") Patterson Bonaparte, the "Belle of Baltimore", who married Jerome Bonaparte on Christmas Eve, December 24, 1803, the younger brother of the French Emperor Napoleon I and the donater of land for nearby Patterson Park in 1827.
The company was established to develop the industrial, commercial and residential potential of the large tract of land along the north shore of the Patapsco's Northwest Branch, east of the Inner Harbor (then called "The Basin") and southeast of old Baltimore Town and neighboring Fells Point, Baltimore
The Canton House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

In metric geometry, an injective metric space, or equivalently a hyperconvex metric space, is a metric space with certain properties generalizing those of the real line and of L∞ distances in higher-dimensional vector spaces. These properties can be defined in two seemingly different ways: hyperconvexity involves the intersection properties of closed balls in the space, while injectivity involves the isometric embeddings of the space into larger spaces. However it is a theorem of that these two different types of definitions are equivalent.
Hyperconvexity
A metric space is said to be hyperconvex if it is convex and its closed balls have the binary Helly property. That is:
Any two points and can be connected by the isometric image of a line segment of length equal to the distance between the points (i.e. is a path space).
If is any family of closed balls such that each pair of balls in meets, then there exists a point common to all the balls in . Equivalently, if a set of points and radii satisfies for each and , then there is a point of the metric space that is within distance of each .
Injectivity
A retraction of a metric space is a function mapping to a subspace of itself, such that
for all , ; that is, is the identity function on its image (i.e. it is idempotent), and
for all and , ; that is, is nonexpansive.
A retract of a space is a subspace of that is an image of a retraction.
A metric space is said to be injective if, whenever is isometric to a subspace of a space , that subspace is a retract of .
Examples
Examples of hyperconvex metric spaces include
The real line
Any vector space with the L∞ distance
Manhattan distance (L1) in the plane (which is equivalent up to rotation and scaling to the L∞), but not in higher dimensions
The tight span of a metric space
Any real tree
– see Metric space aimed at its subspace
Due to the equivalence between hyperconvexity and injectivity, these spaces are all also injective.
Properties
In an injective space, the radius of the minimum ball that contains any set is equal to half the diameter of . This follows since the balls of radius half the diameter, centered at the points of , intersect pairwise and therefore by hyperconvexity have a common intersection; a ball of radius half the diameter centered at a point of this common intersection contains all of . Thus, injective spaces satisfy a particularly strong form of Jung's theorem.
Every injective space is a complete space, and every metric map (or, equivalently, nonexpansive mapping, or short map) on a bounded injective space has a fixed point. A metric space is injective if and only if it is an injective object in the category of metric spaces and metric maps.

Shmuel Zytomirski (, ; 16 September 1900 – 1944) was a well-known figure of the Jewish community of Lublin before and during World War II and the father of Henio Zytomirski. He was murdered in the Holocaust at the end of the war, after almost all his family were killed by the Nazis. The letters Zytomirski had sent and received during the war document a lost struggle of a brave man who died shortly before the war ended. The information regarding the short life of his son Henio, who became an icon of the Holocaust in Poland, became known to the public from his father's letters. The circumstances of Shmuel Zytomirski's death remain mysterious and are unknown to this day.
Biography
Youth
Shmuel Zytomirski was born in Warsaw (now in Poland, but then in Imperial Russia) on 16 September 1900. His father, Ephraim (1880–1941), who was born in the little town of Medzhybizh () in Podolia (now in Ukraine) was a member of Hovevei Zion, a follower of the Mizrachi movement, one of the Yavne School founders in Lublin and an active member in a "benefit society" charity fund in Lublin. Shmuel's mother, Chaya Devora (née Melamed) (1882–1942), was born in Riga (now the capital of Latvia, but then in Imperial Russia). At the age of 16, Shmuel graduated cum laude from Krinsky Jewish Gymnasium in Warsaw. During World War I the economic conditions in Warsaw became worse. In 1917, the Zytomirski family moved to Lublin, hoping to improve their economic status.
Teacher and educator
Young Shmuel Zytomirski was a teacher in the Tarbut school in the town of Bychawa. His attempts to emigrate from Poland to Mandatory Palestine had failed. After completing a year of study at the University of Vienna, he came back to Lublin in 1922 and continued to teach. He was an idealistic devoted teacher. Zytomirski had taught his students the best works of art of the modern Hebrew poets and writers (Constitution Generation): Bialik, Tchernichovsky, Peretz and Frug. In his students' hearts he implanted the Zionist vision and the desire for leaving diaspora and aiding the national renewal of the Jews in the Land of Israel. While teaching he used various advanced pedagogical methods: plays, poetry, public declamation of pieces, and trips out-of-town.
Zionist leader
Zytomirski's best efforts were dedicated to Zionist activity, which had national and social orientation. He was the chairman of Poale Zion (Z.S.) party in Lublin. Zytomirski and his party took actions in the community council and in the community committee for the poor and for Zionist enterprises and institutions. Thanks to the efforts of the Poale Zion (Z.S.) party, the community council allocated substantial funds for several important organizations - CYSZO (The Central Organization of Yiddish Schools), the Tarbut Hebrew school, the National Funds (JNF and Keren Hayesod), HeHalutz movement and Hapoel sport association (the first Hapoel club in Poland was founded in Lublin) - as well as for evening classes organized by the Poale Zion (Z.S.) party. Thanks to the efforts of the Zionist parties, several rooms at the community house on 41 Krawiecka street were renovated and given to the Hakhshara Kibbutzim. These kibbutzim were the cores of Yad Mordechai and Negba kibbutzim in the land of Israel.
Often Zytomirski and his party members participated in lectures and meetings which were held in towns near Lublin: Piaski (Lublin Province), Lubartow, Łęczna, Krasnik, Bychawa and Bilgoraj. Frequently there were district conferences of the Poale Zion (Z.S.) party, in which representatives from the central committee in Warsaw were present.
Zytomirski was a member of the Central Committee of the League for Working Eretz Israel. The league carried out an extensive explanatory and cultural activities agenda. Famous people came to Lublin and lectured in the league's meetings: Zalman Shazar (Rubashov), the author Nathan Bistritzky (Agmon) and Eliyahu Dobkin.
Zytomirski was a committee member of the HeHalutz organization in Lublin. He was also a member of the youth movement 'Dror' and its culture committee, and attended the Executive Committee of the Tarbut Hebrew school in Lublin. In the 1930s Zytomirski was the organizer of the Lublin branch of the HIAS welfare organization.
Zytomirski and his son Henio
In the early 1930s Shmuel Zytomirski was married to Sara Oksman, who ran a retail store selling stationery. In 1933 their son Henio (in Hebrew: חיים) was born.
During Henio's childhood, the situation of Jews in Poland became worse. In the neighbouring country of Germany, the Nazi regime was established, and in post-Pilsudski Poland, anti-Semitism increased. Over the window of the Zytomirski family store, Anti-Semitic Poles had engraved the word ZYD (in Polish: "Żyd"). In 1937, Shmuel Zytomirski wrote in a letter to his young brother Yehuda, who had immigrated to Mandatory Palestine in that year: In accordance with his perception, he registered his son to learn in Tarbut school, a Jewish and Zionist school in which the lessons were in the Hebrew language. Henio was not fortunate enough to enter the school gates. On 1 September 1939, the opening day of school, Nazi Germany invaded Poland and World War II began.
World War II period
Lublin Ghetto
With the establishment of the Nazi regime in Poland, a Judenrat of twenty-four members was set up in Lublin. Zytomirski, a teacher by profession and Chairman of the Poale Zion movement in Lublin, was appointed by the Judenrat to be the manager of the post office at 2nd Kowalska Street. This role allowed him, apparently, to make contact with the Polish underground (which delivered him forbidden information and news); to correspond with his young brother, Yehuda (Leon) Zytomirski, who had already immigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1937; to be in contact with Yitzhak Zuckerman and Zivia Lubetkin from the Jewish resistance in the Warsaw Ghetto and with Hashomer Hatzair members in Vilnius; and to correspond with Nathan Schwalb, Director of the Jewish Agency offices and the HeHalutz movement in Geneva, who was providing assistance to hundreds of youth movement activists in the Nazi-occupied territories.
By order of the Nazi governor of Lublin district, all 34,149 Jews who lived then in the city were forced on 24 March 1941 to move to the ghetto that was established in Lublin. In March 1941, the Zytomirski family moved to 11th Kowalska Street in the Lublin Ghetto. Shmuel Zytomirski's father, Ephraim, died from typhus on 10 November 1941. Before his death he asked to be buried near the cemetery gates in order to be the first to witness the liberation of Lublin. The tombstone on his grave was smashed and destroyed in 1943 when the Nazis liquidated the new Jewish graveyard in Lublin.
Zytomirski didn't surrender to the harsh conditions in Lublin Ghetto and was a source of encouragement to his friends. For example, in December 1941 the Nazi Security Police (in Germany: Sicherheitspolizei SiPo) ordered the Judenrat in Lublin to collect from Lublin Jews all the woolen clothes they had in their possession and give it to the Germans. The Judenrat called to one hundred people and sent them to collect woolen clothes. Professor Nachman Korn and Shmuel Zytomirski went from house to collect woolen clothes for the Wehrmacht soldiers who fought in the Russian front. Zytomirski had tried to reassure the people and told them:
Being a person who had seen matters from a historical perspective, Zytomirski wrote a diary since the beginning of the Nazi occupation. In his diary he recorded everything he had seen and heard. He kept the diary like the apple of his eye. His hope was that the diary would get to trustful hands and would serve as evidence of Nazi atrocities. With the death of Shmuel Zytomirski also his diary was lost. His letters and those of his father which remained after their death are poor substitutes for the lost diary. Reading the letters leads the reader through the loss of the family and loss of the Lublin Jewish community.
Sending Lublin Jews to extermination in Belzec
On 16 March 1942, the transports in freight trains from Lublin District to extermination camps began as part of "Operation Reinhard". Every day about 1,400 people were sent to the camps. The German police and SS people supervised the transports. The Selection of the Jews took place in the square adjacent to the municipal slaughterhouse. The deportees were led on foot from the Great Synagogue (named after the Maharshal), which served as a gathering place for the deportees. Elderly and sick people were shot on the spot. The rest were sent to the extermination camps, mainly to Belzec. Hundreds of Jews were shot dead in the woods on the outskirts of Lublin. A total of about 29,000 Lublin Jews were exterminated during March and April 1942. Apparently, among them were Shmuel Zytomirski's wife, mother and two of his sisters – Esther and Rachel – who were murdered then.
Majdan Tatarski Ghetto
On 14 April 1942 the transports ended. Zytomirski and his son Henio survived the selections of spring 1942, apparently thanks to a work permit (in German: J-Ausweiss) that Shmuel had. Along with the rest of the Jews who stayed alive in Lublin, they were transferred to another smaller ghetto that was established in Majdan Tatarski (a suburb of Lublin). Between 7,000 and 8,000 people entered this ghetto, although many of them did not have work permits. On 22 April, the SS held another selection: about 2,500 to 3,000 people without work permits were taken initially to Majdanek and from there to Krepiec (Krępiec) forest which is about 15 km from Lublin. There they were shot to death.
From the Majdan Tatarski ghetto Zytomirski sent (via the Red Cross organization) a message to his brother Yehuda in Mandatory Palestine: On 23 July 1942 Zytomirski sent a letter from the Majdan Tatarski ghetto to Nathan Schwalb in Geneva: These words of Zytomirski, "in my solitude I hang all my hopes in you", were used by the Holocaust researcher, Prof. Avraham Milgram, as the title of his article about sending the food packages from Portugal to Jews who were in territories under Nazi occupation.
End of Lublin Jews
On 9 November 1942, the final liquidation of the Jewish Ghetto in Majdan Tatarski occurred. About 3,000 people were sent to the extermination camp Majdanek, including Zytomirski and his son Henio. Old people and children were sent immediately to the gas chamber. Nine year old Henio Zytomirski was also in this group.
Men and women who were capable to work were sent to forced labor camps in Lublin, such as Flugplatz camp (where the property of the murdered Jews was sorted and sent to Germany) and Sportplatz (where the forced labor prisoners built a sports stadium for the SS people). Apparently, Zytomirski was transferred to the Sportplatz camp. From the camp he managed to send two last letters to the Zionist delegation in Constantinople. On 3 November 1943, the massive extermination of all remaining Jewish captives and prisoners in Majdanek and the other camps in Lublin District took place. This liquidation is known as "Aktion Erntefest", which in German means "Harvest Festival". On that day at Majadanek 18,400 Jews were shot to death in specially dug open pits. That murderous "operation" was the largest single execution in the history of the Nazi death camps. At the end of this killing operation, Lublin District was declared Judenrein, i.e., "free of Jews".
Mystery of his death
Surprisingly, Shmuel Zytomirski survived also this mass extermination.
This is known according to a letter he had sent by courier from Lublin to the Zionist delegation in Constantinople on 6 January 1944. It is not clear from where exactly this letter was sent. The address on the letter was "7 Drobna Street". In that letter Zytomirski stated preliminary information about the mass killing at Majdanek in November 1943. That was his last letter. Only half a year later, on 24 July 1944, the city of Lublin was liberated by the Soviet Red Army. Shmuel Zytomirski did not survive the Holocaust; the circumstances of his death remain unknown. It is not known where he was hiding in the last days of his life, and whether he was betrayed or got sick and died.

KTUB (1600 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a Spanish Oldies format. Licensed to Centerville, Utah, United States, it serves the Salt Lake City area. The station is owned by Alpha Media. KTUB provides Spanish language broadcasts for Real Salt Lake of Major League Soccer.
History
KBBC were the original call letters for this station. The station went on the air December 1, 1957. The original owner was Howard Pingree. The station operated with 1,000 watts daytime only. In the early mid-1970s, the station's transmitter site was displaced by the construction of the I-15 freeway, and the transmitter and studios were relocated to the present location. After the relocation, the station came back on the air with the call letters KLAT (talk spelled backwards) with an all talk format. The all talk format featured several personalities who had been on KSXX, such as Joe Redburn, Tom Carlin, Jim Kirkwood, and others. After the financial failure of that operation, the station was brokered for a short time to Southern Nevada Communications Corporation, who are now known as Faith Communications Corporation, which organization afterward purchased KANN in Ogden, Utah, and still operate that station. As several of the owners of the station at that time were officers of a Savings and Loan, and had improperly made loans to the radio station, the Utah State Department of Financial Institutions seized the S&L and the station, shut it off, and in July 1977 auctioned the license and facilities to the highest bidder, which was Harold S. Schwartz and Associates. The Schwartz organization operated the station as a commercial Christian-religion format station, even though Mr. Schwartz and other principals in the organization were Jewish. The call letters were changed to KBBX as the original KBBC call was no longer available, and it was desired to get some name recognition from the original call. Schwartz increased the daytime power to 5,000 watts and built a sister FM station on 105.5 MHz which was later moved to 105.7 MHz. The FM station's original call letters were KSTU, but had been changed to KCGL by the time that the FM station went on the air December 24, 1979. (After the call letters KSTU were released, they were taken by a new TV station that is now the Fox affiliate in Salt Lake City.) Schwartz sold the station to Mid-America Gospel Network, the principals of which included several persons who had been key employees of Schwartz. Mid-America Gospel Network later sold the stations, and the AM and FM stations are no longer under common ownership. The station changed call letters to KCPX on August 13, 1993 (the call KCPX had been released by the 1320 Salt Lake City station). On March 12, 1999, the station changed its call sign to KSGO, on September 20, 2004 to KRRD, and on September 13, 2005 to KXTA. On November 2, 2007, the station became the current KTUB.
Bustos Media used to own the station. In September 2010, Bustos transferred most of its licenses to Adelante Media Group as part of a settlement with its lenders. Alpha Media bought Adelante's Salt Lake City stations for $3.15 million on July 16, 2015.

Fractal Spectrum is a magazine about role-playing games that was published by Fractal Dimensions Publishing.
Contents
Fractal Spectrum, edited by Donald Redick and Kathleen Seymour, included interviews with game designers, reviews, industry news, and variants of rules for various role-playing games.
Reception
In the October 1997 edition of Dragon (Issue #240), Rick Swan admitted the artwork was "so-so", and the articles were "too-specialized-for-their-own-good". But Swan thought "what puts this periodical on the must-read list is the comprehensive news section. The latest issue (#13) offers close to 125 (!) reports covering every aspect of game-related publishing."

The Parsons table is a modernist square or rectangular table whose four legs are square in cross-section, flush with the edges of the top, and equal to it in thickness.
The Parsons table was designed by Jean-Michel Frank while he was working at Parsons Paris, then known as the Paris Atelier. While the form is generally credited to Parsons School of Design in New York City, according to an article in The New York Times that referred to Parson's archives, the table was developed out of a course taught at Parsons Paris by the French designer Jean-Michel Frank in the 1930s.
As the article states, "Frank challenged students to design a table so basic that it would retain its integrity whether sheathed in gold leaf, mica, parchment, split straw or painted burlap, or even left robustly unvarnished. What grew out of Frank's sketches and the students' participation was initially called the T-square table ... " The first example, as recalled by Parsons instructor Stanley Barrows, was constructed by the school's janitor and displayed at a student show.
The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) exhibition in 2009-2010 presented the "Bauhaus 1919 to 1933", the entire course of the Bauhaus. A "Parson's" table, noted as a Children's table and chairs by Marcel Breuer, is documented in a photograph dating the table to 1923.
Parsons tables are often intended for use as modern or contemporary furniture, and their striking design has made them popular as coffee tables, dining tables, side tables, and occasional tables. Less-expensive versions are also available that can be easily stacked or disassembled and reassembled. Most are typically made of wood, metal, or plastic, and they are frequently employed in interior furnishings as well as patio or even lawn furniture.

Gerald Walpin (September 1, 1931 – June 24, 2016) was an American lawyer and author. He served as the Inspector General of the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) from January 2007 until June 2009, when he was removed by U.S. President Barack Obama.
Personal life
Walpin was born September 1, 1931, in New York City, and graduated from the City College of New York in 1952. He attended Yale Law School, where he was managing editor of the Yale Law Journal, graduating cum laude in 1955. Walpin was married, with three children and six grandchildren.
Career
From 1957 to 1960, he served in the United States Air Force Judge Advocate General, with a rank of lieutenant.
Walpin was an Assistant U.S. Attorney and Chief of Special Prosecutions for the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York for five years, after which he went on to become a senior partner at the New York-based law firm Rosenman & Colin LLP—and then of counsel at its successor Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP—for a combined total of over 40 years.
From 2002 to 2004, Walpin was president of the Federal Bar Council, an association of attorneys that practice in the courts within the Second Circuit. He received the American Inns of Court Professionalism Award in 2003 for outstanding professionalism as an attorney and for mentoring younger lawyers.
Inspector General of CNCS
Appointment by George W. Bush
On August 3, 2006, President George W. Bush nominated Walpin as Inspector General (IG) of Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), an office in the CNCS charged with conducting independent and object audits, investigations and inspections of the CNCS and its service programs, which include AmeriCorps, Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) and Senior Corps. After he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on December 9, 2006, Walpin was sworn in on January 8, 2007.
Americorps investigations
After its May 20, 2009 meeting that discussed Walpin's report criticizing the St. HOPE Academy settlement agreement and Walpin's forthcoming report questioning the validity of the largest AmeriCorps program—the Research Foundation of City University of New York (RFCUNY) New York City Teaching Fellows program, the bipartisan CNCS Board of Directors unanimously requested that the White House review Walpin's conduct as Inspector General.
Removal and lawsuit
Walpin was suspended with pay on June 11, 2009, by President Barack Obama, who on the same day advised the U.S. Congress that he would remove Walpin from office, effective 30 days from then, because Obama no longer had "the fullest confidence in" him as Inspector General. and on June 16, 2009, the White House submitted a letter with additional information on the reasons Walpin was removed. However Republicans Chuck Grassley and Darrell Issa have asserted that Walpins firing was politically motivated due to the fact that Walpin was investigating Kevin Johnson, a friend and supporter of Barack Obama for sexual assault and other allegations during the time he was fired by Obama.
On July 17, 2009, Walpin filed a civil lawsuit in federal court seeking his reinstatement, arguing that his removal violated the 2008 Inspector General Act. On July 20, 2009, Walpin issued a statement saying the primary reason for his lawsuit was to protect future Inspectors General.
On October 19, 2009, the chairman of the Integrity Committee of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) notified Walpin that his May 20, 2009, response to an April 29, 2009 complaint about him by acting U.S. Attorney Lawrence G. Brown had sufficiently and satisfactorily addressed the matter and closed the complaint.
On June 17, 2010, U.S. District Court Judge Richard W. Roberts dismissed Walpin's suit.
Death
Gerald Walpin died on June 24, 2016, in a hospital after being hit by a sport utility vehicle in Manhattan while crossing at Lexington Avenue and East 79th Street.

Jože Melaher - Zmagoslav (1913-1991) was Yugoslav military officer, most notable for being commander of Chetnik Štajerska detachment during the World War II.
Early life
Melaher was born in Zrkovcih na Pobrežju, on 26 February 1913 from father Leopold and mother Apolonija, née name Klemenčič. Melaher's older brother Anton remained after the war on the farm. Joze finished gymnasium, then worked as a teacher and a staff member. In 1937 he married Marija Vrecl, a teacher with whom he had three daughters later in the emigration. After serving a military service in the army of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, he held the rank of reserve sergeant. Before the World War II Melaher was active member of Slovenian Catholic youth organizations and Slovene People's Party.
During World War II
All Chetniks were considered as enemies by Axis occupiers Yugoslavia who managed to reach quid pro quo arrangements with Chetniks, that allowed them to fight against communist revolutionary irregular forces. In Slovenia, Mehaler and his detachment were exemption from that kind of arrangement. According to some estimates, Štajerska Chetnik detachment was the only anti-Communist military unit that consistently attacked Axis occupiers throughout the war. The detachment under Melaher's command had 200 men. In October 1942 Gestapo arrested Melaher, but he managed to escape and continued his struggle. Melaher successfully recruited many of his men among Slovenian deserters from German units.
This Chetnik unit led by Melaher operated against German troops in the region of Haloze and Ptuj. According to one report of Yugoslav communist forces, Melaher's Chetnik detachment and operated in the region of Lenart v Slovenskih Goricah. Melaher's Chetnik detachment received British supplies as airdrops until 1944 and published resistance newspaper Blood and Land (). Melaher was author of most of its texts.
In April 1945 Chetniks from Melahers Štajerska detachment were put under command of Ivan Prezelj and enlisted as part of the Slovenian People's Army. In 1945 Melaher signed an cease-fire agreement with German occupying forces.
After World War II
With some members of his detachment he escaped in front of Soviet Red Army and Yugoslav Communist forces, first to Italy and than to the USA. Melaher died on 10 June 1991, in Cleveland, Ohio.

The Story of Star Wars is a 1977 record album presenting an abridged version of the events depicted in the film Star Wars, using dialogue and sound effects from the original film. The recording was produced by George Lucas and Alan Livingston, and was narrated by Roscoe Lee Browne. The script was adapted by E. Jack Kaplan and Cheryl Gard. The album was released on 20th Century Fox Records (T-550) and came with an illustrated book.
The original film became a hit in the days before home video, so for many fans at the time, this album was the closest to owning a copy of the film they could revisit whenever they wanted. The album was also released on compact cassette, 8-track tape, and 4-track reel-to-reel audio tape. It was a commercial success and achieved Gold Record status.
There were even foreign language versions of the album in French (L'Historie de La Guerre des étoiles, narrated by Dominique Paturel), German (Krieg der Sterne, narrated by F. J. Steffens), Spanish (La Historia de La Guerra de las Galaxias, narrated by José Catalá). Mexican Spanish (Argumento Completo Narrado de La Guerra de las Galaxias, narrated by León Canales) and Japanese (スターウォーズストーリー日本語版, The Star Wars Story - Japanese Edition, narrated by Taichirō Hirokawa).
The sequel films were also given the same treatment of being turned into truncated audio dramas of their soundtracks, The Empire Strikes Back was adapted for records by RSO Records, under the subtitle The Adventures of Luke Skywalker with narration by Malachi Throne, and Return of the Jedi was also made by Walt Disney Productions into an abridged version for audio, under its Buena Vista Records banner and with narration provided by Chuck Riley.
VideoNow and DVD
In 2004, the title was used again for a three disc set produced and released for the VideoNow Color personal video player. The first two discs are an overview of the first five-Star Wars films released: The Story of Luke Skywalker (Episodes IV, V & VI) and The Story of Anakin Skywalker (Episodes I & II). These two features are hosted by the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO utilizing pre-existing footage and new voiceover work. They contain no footage from Revenge of the Sith, nor do they have the changes contained in the 2004 DVD releases. The third disc is titled Behind the Scenes and features the following:
Episode I - Fights, a featurette on Lightsaber Duels in The Phantom Menace
Episode II - Action, a featurette on action sequences in Attack of the Clones
Episode III - General Grievous, a featurette on the creation of the Droid General in Revenge of the Sith
Making the Game, a featurette on the creation of the Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith video game
Revenge of the Sith, featurette on the nature of the Sith
An Original Trilogy DVD commercial
An Episode I DVD commercial
An Episode II DVD commercial
A Yoda Electronic Lightsaber commercial
In 2005, Lucasfilm repackaged the content from the first two VideoNow discs for a bonus DVD that was included in a special 2-pack with the Revenge of the Sith DVD at Wal-Mart stores. The DVD is presented in full screen with Dolby Digital 2.0 sound and runs 1 hour in total. The sticker on the cover describes it as "R2-D2 and C-3PO's Chronicles of Luke and Anakin Skywalker".
That same year, the VideoNow release was reissued with new packaging and disc artwork, proclaiming "With Updated Episode III Footage". Other changes include the numbering of the discs themselves, which the first release lack.
In addition to these cosmetic changes, the third disc was reworked. The Fights, Action and Revenge of the Sith featurettes were retained, as was the Episode I DVD commercial. In the place of the other material is the following:
Revenge of the Sith "Saga" trailer
Revenge of the Sith "Dark Side" trailer

Vladimír Vondráček, M.D. (February 23, 1895, Prague – May 10, 1978) was a leading Czech psychiatrist. He is considered one of the founders of Czech medical psychology, psychopharmacology, dietetics and psychiatric sexology. After World War II, Vondráček became the "legendary head physician" at the Psychiatric Clinic in Prague. He was an important popularizer of psychiatry and related sciences, and contributed to the integration of the mentally ill into normal life. Vondráček is the author of about 225 studies and books, of which probably the best known is his work Fantastické a magické z hlediska psychiatrie (Fantastic and Magical from the Viewpoint of Psychiatry). He is also noteworthy for his three-part memories.
Biography
Vondráček was born on 23 February 1895 in Prague to the family of a delicatessen merchant. He graduated from gymnasium and later studied medicine in Prague, graduating in 1919. His military service was as a doctor with the 7th Regiment.
Early in his medical career, he worked at the Clinic of Internal Medicine under Ladislav Syllaba, and at the Institute for the Mentally Ill under Antonín Heveroch. After receiving a doctorate in pharmacology in 1932, he worked at the Pharmacological Institute of Emanuel Formánek, and at the spa in Ľubochňa and Tatranská Lomnica. In 1938, he was appointed professor of psychology, and in 1946, he became professor of psychiatry, at the psychiatric clinic, Charles University in Prague, Faculty Of Medicine. After World War II, Vondráček became the "legendary head physician" at the Psychiatric Clinic and retired in 1957 after 25 years of service. In 1957, he became the head of the psychiatric clinic, replacing Zdeněk Mysliveček. He is credited with establishing a research laboratory at the clinic, working there until his death. He was a proponent for the unity of psychiatry and neurology.
Vondráček was a charismatic figure of the medical faculty, described as being a tall man with a beard, known for his dry humor. He applied his characteristic expression to his professional works, which are clear, readable and accessible to a wider public. His earliest books and articles date to 1923 and cover a wide range of issues, including psychiatric, psychological, sexological, pharmacology, and internal medicine, incorporating findings and observations of his time. His radio shows were well received. Her popularized a healthy lifestyle by discussing it not only in university lecture halls, but also by writing books and talking about it on the radio.
Notable works
Vondráček's most notable professional work (Fantastické a magické z hlediska psychiatrie) was first published in 1968 (State Medical Publishing House, and most recently in 2003 (Columbus). While the original release was intended for experts, later, the book also became popular among the general public. It was co-authored by František Holub (1894–1965), a lawyer, writer, poet, explorer and Vondráček's longtime friend. The book gives a different interpretation of the mysterious and magical phenomena known from the history, folk tales, legends and fairy tales, and shows that such phenomena could be a result of mental disorders, hallucinations, illusory phenomena and suggestion. People with mental disorders often believe that they can predict the future or read minds, that they're cursed or vice versa 'chosen', that they come from another planet or another time. People with physical defects become an inspiration for stories of dwarfs, giants and werewolves. They assembly ideas inspired stories about water sprites, centaurs or vampires. According to Vondráček, tales about haunted castles, evil creations or living dead were created as a result of hallucinations and suggestions. Vondráček shows the signs of various mental disorders and mental phenomena on examples from history, from myths and fairy tales, but also from his extensive psychiatric practice.
The three-part memoirs Doktor vzpomíná ("Doctor Recalls", 1895–1920 (1973)), Lékař dále vzpomíná ("Doctor recalls more", (1920–1938 (1978)) and Konec vzpomínání ("End of Memories", 1938–1945, published posthumously in 1988) are ranked among the top of Vondráček's literary works. The memoirs show both his phenomenal memory and illustrate his life story, and additionally, they describe the first half of the 20th century with many interesting facts and details. The author discusses openly a number of opinions on people he knew, especially from his medical career. His memoirs end in 1945, because in the following period, it was more complicated to write openly and critically.

The Meaning of Meaning: A Study of the Influence of Language upon Thought and of the Science of Symbolism (1923) is a book by C. K. Ogden and me. A. Richards. It is accompanied by two supplementary essays by Bronisław Malinowski and F. G. Crookshank. The conception of the book arose during a two-hour conversation between Ogden and Richards held on a staircase in a house next to the Cavendish Laboratories at 11 pm on Armistice Day, 1918.
Overview
The original text was published in 1923 and has been used as a textbook in many fields including linguistics, philosophy, language, cognitive science and most recently semantics and semiotics in general. The book has been in print continuously since 1982. The most recent edition is the critical edition prepared by W. Terrence Gordon as volume 3 of the 5-volume set C. K. Ogden & Linguistics (London: Routledge/Thoemmes Press, 1995). The full publication history, including serialised publication in The Cambridge Magazine prior to the first edition of the book, is in W. Terrence Gordon's, C. K. Ogden: a bio-bibliographical study.
Richards sets forth a contextual theory of Signs: that Words and Things are connected “through their occurrence together with things, their linkage with them in a ‘context' that Symbols come to play that important part in our life [even] the source of all our power over the external world” (47). In this context system, Richards develops a tri-part semiotics—symbol, thought and referent with three relations between them (thought to symbol=correct, thought–referent=adequate, symbol–reference=true) (11). Symbols are “those signs which men use to communicate one with another and as instruments of thought, occupy a peculiar place” (23). “All discursive symbolization involves […] weaving together of contexts into higher contexts” (220). So for a word to be understood “requires that it form a context with further experiences” (210).
The book later influenced A. J. Ayer's Language, Truth, and Logic, an introduction to logical positivism, and both the Richards–Ogden book and the Ayer book in turn influenced Alec King and Martin Ketley in the writing of their book The Control of Language, which appeared in 1939, and which influenced C. S. Lewis in the writing of his defence of natural law and objective values, The Abolition of Man (1943).

The Royal Commission on Legal Services, commonly known as the Benson Commission (after its chairman Sir Henry Benson) was a Royal Commission set up by the Labour government of Harold Wilson to "examine the structure, organisation, training and regulation of the legal profession and to recommend those changes that would be desirable to the interests of justice". The Commission and its report are seen as one of the elements that led to the passing of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990.
Background
During the 1960s the legal profession (barristers, solicitors, and certificated notaries) came under fire for what was perceived to be poor performance, the high cost of conveyancing, and its failure to deal with the needs of all levels of society. In response, the Labour government under Harold Wilson created a Royal Commission on Legal Services, known as the Benson Commission (after its chairman Sir Henry Benson), which was asked to "examine the structure, organisation, training and regulation of the legal profession and to recommend those changes that would be desirable to the interests of justice". The Commission frightened legal professionals, who believed that they were likely to face severe structural changes and lose their monopolies on probate and conveyancing work.
Commission
The Commission was led by Sir Henry Benson, and also had a sub-committee looking at legal education, which was led by R.G. Dahrendorf.
The Commission's report was presented to Parliament in October 1979. It did not propose any radical changes, with one editorial describing it as "characterised by an over-anxiety not to offend the professional establishment". In particular it ruled out the possibility of partnerships between barristers. It also upheld the idea of a split profession (one with both solicitors and barristers, in contrast to a fused profession), saying that:
"with regard to the administration of justice, the weight of evidence is strongly to the effect that a two-branch profession is more likely than a fused one to ensure the high quality of advocacy that is indispensable, so long as our system remains in its present form, to secure the proper quality of justice"
The report also rejected the suggestion to allow solicitors rights of audience in the High Court The report concluded that the practice of law was a profession, and that a profession had to be independent of government, because without independence the interests of a client cannot be a primary consideration. It did not challenge the existing professional self-regulation through organisations such as the Law Society and Bar Council. The Commission did recommend an examination of the court and legal procedures to see if time and money could be saved for the parties involved.
The report also left the conveyancing monopoly of solicitors intact, although it did pave the way for the system of licensed conveyancers established by the Access to Justice Act 1975.
In other ways, however, the report was revolutionary – it recommended a Council of Legal Services to advise the Lord Chancellor (something eventually realised in the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Committee on Legal Education and Conduct), a movement of advice services such as the Citizens Advice Bureau into the legal fold, and a single unified body to regulate barristers, rather than a fragmentation between the Bar Council and Inns of Court.
The government response to the Benson Committee's report was published in 1983, and established a Civil Justice Review to examine court procedure. The report of the review board was put before the House of Commons on 7 June 1988.
Impact
The report did not have the impact that Benson wanted - The government took four years to reply to the report, and did not institute many of the changes he recommended. By 1995 the citizen advice services were still not within the legal mainstream, and it took 12 years to implement other recommendations (such as that the Lord Chancellor should have a junior minister in the House of Commons). Despite this the Commission and its report are seen as leading to the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, even though the act disagreed with the report of the Commission in many ways.

The Roderick Bryan House is a historic house at 867 Linkfield Road in Watertown, Connecticut. Built about 1820, it is a well-preserved example of a rural Cape style farmhouse. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.
Description and history
The Roderick Bryan House stands in a rural area of northeastern Watertown, at the northeast corner of Linkfield and Bryan Roads. It is a -story Cape style wood-frame structure, oriented facing west toward Linkfield Road. It has a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. The main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance framed by a 1940s Federal Revival surround of sidelights, doubled pilasters, and a peaked entablature with cornice. An ell extends to the rear (east) of the main block, joining the house to a barn. The interior follows a typical central chimney plan, with chambers to either side of the chimney, and a long room across most of the rear. Stairs to the attic are found in one corner. The interior retains many original features, including wainscoting, chair rails, fireplace paneling, and doors.
The house was built about 1820 by Roderick Bryan, on land purchased by is father in 1807. Bryan was a farmer, who apparently also operated a small tavern in the back of the house. The house was sold out of the family in 1910, to the son of a family servant for $1. The house exhibits a number of conservative building practices, notably in the layout, which is typical of mid-18th century Capes, while also adopting period practices such as raising the roof plate to provide additional interior space in the attic level.

Netsanet Gudeta Kebede (born 12 February 1991) is an Ethiopian long-distance runner who competes in road running and cross country running events. She was the bronze medallist at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships in 2015. She shared in the team title at that competition and also won team silver at the IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in 2014. Her best for the half marathon is 66:11 minutes (women's only race world record).
Career
Netsanet grew up in Bekoji, Ethiopia – an area well known for producing top athletes, including Kenenisa Bekele and Tirunesh Dibaba. She began training with Aberu Kebede and Aselefech Mergia, among others She made her debut abroad at the 2013 Prague Grand Prix in the Czech Republic, finishing in tenth place. The Great Ethiopian Run brought her name to prominence nationally as she saw off a challenge over the 10K distance from Atsede Baysa, the 2012 Chicago Marathon winner. She closed the year with a runner-up finish at the São Silvestre Road Race in Brazil, setting a 15K best of 52:08 minutes.
Her opening race of 2014 was March's Roma-Ostia Half Marathon and in her debut over the distance she finished in third place with a time of 68:53 minutes. She was chosen to represent her country at the 2014 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships later that month and was the leading Ethiopian in a Kenya-dominated race. Her finishing time of 68:46 minutes was a new personal best and brought her sixth place, as well as a team silver medal. She continued on the international road circuit and was sixth at the World 10K Bangalore and tenth at the Luanda Half Marathon. She returned to the Great Ethiopian Run in November but was edged out of the title by Wude Ayalew. At the São Silvestre Road Race on New Year's Eve, she was again runner-up.
Netsanet turned to cross country at the beginning of 2015 and her fourth-place finish at the Jan Meda International Cross Country gained her another international selection. She adapted well to the grass course of the 2015 IAAF World Cross Country Championships and won her first individual medal by finishing third behind Ethiopian teammate Senbere Teferi. The pair led Ethiopia to the senio women's team title at the competition.

Carry On Up the Jungle is a 1970 British adventure comedy film, the 19th release in the series of 31 Carry On films (1958–1992). The film marked Frankie Howerd's second and final appearance in the series. He stars alongside regular players Sid James, Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims, Terry Scott and Bernard Bresslaw. Kenneth Connor returns to the series for the first time since Carry On Cleo six years earlier and would now feature in almost every entry up to Carry On Emmannuelle in 1978. Jacki Piper makes the first of her four appearances in the series. This movie is a send-up of the classic Tarzan films. It features an unusually dark tone for the series, as the protagonists are faced with certain death after they are apprehended by a cannibalistic tribe in the jungle.
Plot
Camp ornithologist Professor Inigo Tinkle (Frankie Howerd) tells a less-than-enraptured audience about his most recent ornithological expedition to the darkest, most barren regions of the African wilds in search for the legendary Oozlum bird, which is said to fly in ever decreasing circles until it disappears up its own rear end. Financing the expedition is Lady Evelyn Bagley (Joan Sims) and the team are led by the fearless (and lecherous) Bill Boosey (Sid James) and his slow-witted African guide Upsidasi (Bernard Bresslaw in blackface). Also on the expedition is Tinkle's idiotic assistant, Claude Chumley (Kenneth Connor) and June (Jacki Piper), Lady Bagley's beautiful but unappreciated maidservant. The journey does not get off to a good start, with a mad gorilla terrorising the campsite and the travellers realising they have ventured into the territory of the bloodthirsty "Noshas", a tribe of feared cannibals.
On the first night of the expedition, at dinner Lady Bagley reveals that she has embarked on the journey to find her long-lost husband and baby son who vanished twenty years ago on their delayed honeymoon, whilst out on a walk. Her husband is believed to have been eaten by a crocodile, but she hopes to find her baby son, Cecil's, nappy pin as something to remember him by. What the group do not know is that watching them from the bushes is Ug (Terry Scott), a bungling yet compassionate Tarzan-like jungle dweller that wears a loincloth and sandals. Ug has never before seen any other white people, especially a woman. The next day, June stumbles across a beautiful oasis where she saves Ug from drowning and the two begin to fall in love.
That night, Ug wanders into camp and encounters Lady Bagley in her tent (mistaking it for June's tent) and she is astonished to see that Ug is wearing Cecil's nappy pin, and that Ug is in fact her lost son Cecil. But before they can be reunited, Ug flees in fear and Lady Bagley faints with shock. The next day, the travellers are kidnapped by the Noshas, but manage to bribe their way out of being cannibalised by giving the tribal witch doctor Tinkle's pocket watch. Tinkle however delays and promises the witch doctor that their gods will bestow a sign of thanks upon them. Intending rescue, Ug accidentally catapults himself into the Nosha camp and starts a fire. In the chaos, Ug, June and Upsidasi manage to escape but the enraged Noshas apprehend the other travellers and prepare to kill them.
As they wait to be put to death, they are suddenly rescued by the all-female Lubby-Dubby tribe led by the stunning Leda (Valerie Leon) from the Lost World of Aphrodisia. They are taken to Aphrodisia and meet the king of the tribe Tonka who turns out to be Lady Bagley's missing husband Walter Bagley (Charles Hawtrey) who was taken by the Noshas years ago, but saved and brought to Aphrodisia by the tribal women. Evelyn Bagley is infuriated that he never bothered to search for their missing son and laments she has seen him but has once again lost him. June and Ug are revealed to be living happily together and June is teaching Ug to speak English.
Bill Boosey, Prof. Tinkle and Chumley enjoy the attention given to them by the tribal women, and Tinkle and Chumley are stunned to find that their elusive Oozlum bird is in fact a sacred animal to the Lubby-Dubby females. It transpires that the Lubby-Dubbies need the menfolk to save themselves from extinction, as no males have been born in Aphrodisia for over a century. The men think their dreams have come true... until Leda makes it clear that the Lubby-Dubby women have no intention of letting them go. Tonka implies that the last man who tried to escape Aphrodisia was murdered by the tribe.
Lady Bagley is resentful of this work the men have been given and taking over control from her husband (Tonka) ensure the mates assigned to the men are the least attractive women in the tribe. Three months pass and the men now are fed up and Leda is outraged that none of their "mates" have gotten pregnant, so she overthrows Tonka and assumes his place, threatening harm to the men. However, Upsidasi arrives disguised as a woman and says he has brought soldiers to save them. Ug and June also search for their friends and Ug summons a stampede of animals to create chaos and enable the men to get away. During the confusion, Tinkle snatches the Oozlum bird, and the team escape along with Tonka. After the chaos, Leda and her army chase after the men, but are more interested in the trampled soldiers. She says to let the others go not needing them now that they have "some real men." Lady Bagley is reunited with her beloved son and the group return to England. Tinkle unveils his Oozlum bird to his audience... only to find it has apparently vanished up inside itself. June and Ug are happily married with a baby and live in a treehouse in the suburbs whilst Ug goes to work in a bowler hat, suit, and no shoes.

Production and casting
Carry On Up the Jungle is, in part, a parody of Hammer Film Productions' "Cavegirl" series: One Million Years B.C. (1966), Slave Girls (1967) and more particularly Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan series of books and films.
Bernard Bresslaw learned all his native orders in Swahili; however, the "African" extras were of Caribbean origin and did not understand. But Sid James, who was born in South Africa, recognised it and congratulated him.
The storyline is partly referenced in the Christmas Special Carry On, when all the characters sit down for Christmas Dinner and eat the Oozlum bird instead of a traditional Turkey.
Charles Hawtrey (born November 1914) as Walter Bagley plays the father of Ugg/Cecil Bagley Terry Scott (born May 1927) despite being merely twelve and a half years his senior. Joan Sims (born May 1930) as Lady Bagley plays his mother though she is three years his junior.
The role of Professor Tinkle was written for Kenneth Williams, and the role of Jungle Boy was written for Jim Dale, but Williams was unavailable as he was preparing to star in his own series, The Kenneth Williams Show, and Dale turned down his part due to the character having limited dialogue.
Reception
The film was among the eight most popular movies at the UK box office in 1970.
In a diary entry for Saturday 3 April 1976, Kenneth Williams wrote about the film, which he watched on television that evening, in positive terms. "It was quite funny and at one point I was laughing aloud. I was staggered to see what they got away with!" He was particularly complimentary about Kenneth Connor and Terry Scott, less so about Sid James.

Oman competed at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 7 September to 18 September 2016.
Disability classifications
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.

Said bin Taimur (; 13 August 1910 – 19 October 1972) was the 13th Sultan of Muscat and Oman from 10 February 1932 until he was deposed on 23 July 1970 by his son Qaboos bin Said.
He was a member of the House of Al Said who in 1932 became the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, succeeding his father Taimur bin Feisal who had abdicated for financial reasons. The 21-year-old Said inherited an administration that was in debt. He consolidated power, with the help of the British SAS, and regained control of the tribal interior, bringing together Muscat and Oman. Once the country was united, Said left the capital of Muscat and resided in a coastal town in Dhofar. Muscat and Oman became fully sovereign and independent states in 1951 with him as ruler.
Early life and education
Said was born in 1910. He attended Mayo College at Ajmer in Rajputana, India, from 1922–1927 where he mastered English and Urdu. Upon his return to Muscat in May 1927, it was suggested he attend Beirut to further his education. His father, Sultan Taimur bin Feisal, feared that by sending him to Beirut, he would be influenced by Christianity.
Said's father was strongly against him learning the ways of the Western world and speaking English. When Said was younger, his father found Sa'id and his brother Nadir possessing an English primer, and he ordered all their books be burned. Instead of sending Said to Beirut, his father sent him to Baghdad to study Arabic literature and history for a year.
Early political career
After completing his year-long study in Baghdad, Said participated in the Omani government upon his return home. He became the president of the Council of Ministers in August 1929. Sultan Taimur's inability to govern the state affairs of Oman created an opportunity for a new leader. The British were very fond of Said and during February 1932, at the age of 21, Said became the new crowned Sultan. Sultan Said inherited a country that was heavily in debt to Britain and British India. In order to break away from Britain and maintain autonomy, his country needed to regain economic independence. Therefore, beginning in 1933, he controlled the budget of the state until being overthrown in 1970.
Family affairs
In 1936, Said married his second wife, Mezoon al-Mashani (cousin of his first wife, Fatima) who in 1940 gave birth to Said's only son and heir Qaboos.
Said had three children
Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al-Said
Sayyida Hujaima bint Sa'id bin Taimur Al-Sa'id
Sayyida Umaima bint Sa'id bin Taimur Al-Sa'id
Reign
Accession
On his accession, he inherited the remains of the Omani Empire, which included the neighbouring provinces of Oman and Dhofar, as well as the last remnants of an overseas empire, including Gwadar in the Arabian Sea. Nevertheless, his petroleum-rich country also had long established ties with the United Kingdom, based on a 1798 Treaty of Friendship, and had been a British protectorate since 1891. He also inherited an administration that was in debt.
Foreign affairs
Once he became Sultan, Said maintained a friendly relationship with the United States. In 1938, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt invited Said and his father to visit the United States. Said landed in San Francisco and began a tour from California to Washington, D.C. During his visit to the White House, Roosevelt presented him with two books he had written. Said toured the FBI Headquarters, and laid a wreath upon George Washington's tomb, at Mount Vernon.
During World War II, the Sultan cooperated readily with the British; several Royal Air Force landing fields were constructed between Salalah in Dhofar and Mascat. This allowed the channels of supply to remain open between Britain and the Allies.
Leadership
As Sultan, oil wealth would have allowed Said to modernize his country. He secured British recognition of its independence in 1951. Nevertheless, he also faced serious internal opposition, from Imam Ghalib bin Ali, a religious leader of Oman, who claimed power in the sultanate for himself. The Imam's revolt in Jebel Akhdar was suppressed in 1955, with British help, but this in turn earned Said the animosity of Saudi Arabia, which supported the Imam, and of Egypt, which regarded British involvement in suppressing the revolt as not conducive to the cause of Arab nationalism. In 1957, these two countries supported a renewed revolt by the Imam, which was similarly suppressed by 1959.
In 1958 Said sold Gwadar to Pakistan for $1 million, while in 1967 Britain returned the Khuriya Muriya Islands.
Said became more reclusive from his people and country. In 1965, after making concessions to export oil with Iraq, Iran and Britain, he did little to improve the life of his people. The benefits of this deal would not come to fruition until his was deposed in 1970 in a palace coup.
In 1965, the province of Dhofar revolted, this time with the support of the People's Republic of China and some of the nationalist Arab states, followed by an assassination attempt in 1966. It had a marked effect on Said, causing him to become even more erratic in governing the country. It was forbidden to smoke in public, to play football, to wear sunglasses or to speak to anyone for more than 15 minutes. No one was safe from the sultan's paranoia, not even his own son, Qaboos, who was kept under virtual house arrest at the Sultan's palace in Salalah.
Before he was overthrown in 1970, because of his backwards policies, Oman had an under 5 mortality rate of around 25%. Trachoma, venereal disease and malnutrition were widespread. There were only three schools, the literacy rate was 5%, and there were only of paved roads.
Deposition
Qaboos returned from his educational studies in the United Kingdom at the Royal Military Academy, and a year of service in the British Army infantry in 1964, and was placed under house arrest. Said did not speak to his son during the last 14 months before the coup, even though they lived in the same palace.
On 23 July 1970 at the Sultan's palace in Salalah, Qaboos executed a successful coup against his father with the help of the British and his uncle, and exiled his father to the United Kingdom. Said lived his last two years at the Dorchester Hotel in London. He was originally buried in Brookwood Cemetery, Woking, Surrey, England. His remains were then disinterred and transported back to Oman, and he was buried in the royal cemetery in Muscat.

Storm tides of the North Sea are coastal floods associated with extratropical cyclones crossing over the North Sea, the severity of which are affected by the shallowness of the sea and the orientation of the shoreline relative to the storm's path, as well as the timing of tides. The water level can rise to more than 5 metres (17 ft) above the normal tide as a result of storm tides.
Northern Germany and Denmark are particularly susceptible to storm tides. The coastline of the German Bight forms an L-shape facing northwest. Also vulnerable are the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, where the sea shallows and is funnelled toward the English Channel.
Storm tides are a regular occurrence in the North Sea basin; several forms each year. Although most do not cause significant damage, the impact of some has been devastating. During one, the February flood of 1825, the Danish coastline changed, as the North Jutlandic Island became separated from the Jutland Peninsula.

The flood of 1976 and the "North Frisian Flood" of 1981 brought the highest water levels measured to date on the North Sea coast, but because of sea defences such as improved warning systems and dikes built and modified after the flood of 1962, these led only to property damage.

Corky Row Historic District is a historic district located in Fall River, Massachusetts bounded by Plymouth Avenue, Interstate-195 and Second Street. The district contains many early multi-family mill tenement houses, along with the Davol Mills, the Tecumseh Mill No. 1 and several commercial properties.
Perhaps the most famous property listed within the Corky Row Historic District is the house of Andrew J. Borden, located at 230 (92 before 1896) Second Street. This house was the scene of the infamous 1892 double ax-murder of Mr. Borden and his wife, which led to the trial and acquittal of Andrew's daughter, Lizzie Borden. Today, the house has been restored as a bed-and-breakfast.
The district contains over 400 structures with an area of and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.
Historical background
The Corky Row neighborhood was developed between 1840 and 1870 and represents the second major phase of expansion within the city of Fall River. Largely settled by immigrants from County Cork, Ireland who came to work in the city's burgeoning textile industry. The historic district contains dozens of four- and six- family apartment houses in various configurations, as well as a number of classic New England-style triple deckers, many built by the new cotton mills constructed during the 1860s: the Tecumseh, Davol and Robeson Mills, located along Hartwell Street on the eastern edge of the historic district.
Today, the neighborhood contains a mix of residential and commercial uses, including recent developments along Plymouth Avenue, Hartwell Street and along Second and Rodman Streets. The Tecumseh Mill was converted into housing in the 1980s. The Robeson Mills (also known as Luther Manufacturing) were demolished in the 1990s for what is now Applebee's, Walgreens and a more recently built convenience store and gas station at the corner of Rodman Street and Hartwell.
The Corky Row Club, located on Third Street was established in 1938 as an Irish social club. The James T. Griffin playground, located within a few blocks of the Corky Row Club, was named for one of the first to be killed in World War II from the area.

Charles-François Delacroix (or Lacroix; 15 April 1741 – 26 October 1805) was a French statesman who became Minister of Foreign Affairs under the Directory. The painter Eugène Delacroix was his fourth son, although doubts have been cast on his paternity.
Family
Charles-François Delacroix was born in Givry-en-Argonne on 15 April 1741.
He married Victoire Oëbène, daughter of the cabinet-maker Jean-François Oeben.
Victoire's uncle Henri-François Riesener was a distinguished painter.
They had four children.
Charles-Henri Delacroix (9 January 1779 – 30 December 1845) became a soldier, and rose to the rank of General in the Napoleonic army.
Henriette was born in 1780.
She married the diplomat Raymond de Verninac Saint-Maur (1762–1822).
Henri was born six year later. He was killed at the Battle of Friedland on 14 June 1807.
The youngest child was the future painter Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863).
When Eugène was born the gossip in Paris had it that Delacroix had been succeeded in his bed by the man who had succeeded him at his desk, Maurice de Talleyrand.
On 13 September 1797, the surgeon Imbert-Delonnes removed a "monstrous tumor" of twenty-eight pounds, in which were tangled "the most delecate masculine organs".
The tumor apparently would have rendered him impotent.
Whatever the truth, it seems certain that Charles was sent away to the Hague to avoid the gossip.
Career
Delacroix was secretary to Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune (1727–1781), Minister of Finance during the reign of Louis XVI of France.
During the French Revolution (1789–1799), he became a deputy to the National Convention and voted for the death of the king.
Delacroix interrogated Georges Danton, who was accused in 1793 in Belgium.
In 1793 Delacroix proposed to the Convention to confiscate the metal statuary at Versailles and melt it down to make cannon.
The proposal was rejected after some debate.
Delacroix joined the Thermidorian Reaction.
He was appointed French Minister of Foreign Affairs between 3 November 1795 and 15 July 1797, when he was replaced by Talleyrand.
On 2 December 1797 he became a special envoy (ambassador) to the Batavian Republic.
In January 1798 he advised Herman Willem Daendels in his coup d'état against a group of federalists in the Dutch National Convention. In 1799, he became the first prefect in the Bouches-du-Rhône and in 1803 in the Gironde.
Delacroix died in Bordeaux on 26 October 1805.
When his wife, Victoire Oeben, died in 1814 it was found that family estate was fully mortgaged, and his attorney had been stealing from it.
Rather than being worth 800,000 francs as thought, the estate was in debt by 175,000 francs.
A monument to Delacroix stands in the Chartreuse cemetery in Bordeaux.

Robert Townshend Thompson (1792–August 9, 1887) was a Virginia lawyer, planter and politician in Fairfax County, Virginia, which he represented in the Virginia House of Delegates for nearly a decade (1816–1825).
Early and family life
He was the only son born to the former Ann Washington (1761–1824) and her second husband, Fairfax County merchant William Thompson (d. 1799). The boy's middle name honors his maternal grandfather Townshend Washington (1705–1743). His uncle Lund Washington was the longtime estate manager for George Washington, and another uncle, Laurence Washington (1735-1799) who died the same year as his wife Catherine Foote (and who did not have children) gave his Belmont estate in Fairfax County to Robert when he reached 18 years of age, subject to a life interest of his mother Ann, and the emancipation of certain slaves in 1801 and others when they reached 25 years of age. In addition to operating a store near the Occoquan river at Colchester, Virginia, his father also was a captain in the Fairfax County militia, and held various appointments to appraise estates, including that of prominent planter George Mason (which is now lost). His father wrote a will shortly before his death, naming his wife as executor on behalf of their three children, but not naming them in the document. His sisters Elizabeth Lund Thompson (b. 1787?) and Catherine Foote Thompson (b. 1794?) would have inherited Belmont had Robert died before reaching 18 years old.
Rev. Robert Townshend Thompson married Leah W. Kitchen, daughter of Thompson Kitchen of Fairfax County on May 9, 1822, in a service conducted by Rev. James Reid. Although the date of her death has been forgotten, and it occurred before the 1860 census, she may have been alive in 1856, when her father wrote his last will and testament (which indicated she had already received her inheritance).
Career
Upon reaching legal age, Thompson received a deed of gift from his mother. He operated an approximately 870 acre farm, part of Belmont Plantation in Fairfax County near the Occoquan River. In the 1820 U.S. Federal Census, Thompson owned 19 slaves, and his household also included two free blacks.
In 1816, Robert T. Thompson was nominated to become a first lieutenant to command a horse militia troop, part of the 60th regiment of Virginia militia, and a year later he was recommended to become a captain to replace Thomas Wheeler, who gave up his commission.
In 1819, local officials recommended Thompson to become one of the justices of the peace for the county, and a year later, on September 18, 1820, Robert T. Thompson took the oath required of the justices of the peace. However, he resigned, possibly in order to practice as an attorney before that court. He received a law license and took an oath as attorney on October 22, 1821.
Fairfax County voters elected Robert T. Thompson as one of their delegates (part-time) to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1816, and continued re-electing him until 1825. In 1824, delegate Thompson objected to a legislative committee's recommendation for the sale of an infant child born in the Fairfax jail to Hannah Smith, the daughter of Bushrod Washington's life-long personal servant Oliver Smith and who had been convicted of trying to poison Washington's overseer in 1821. On November 25, 1825, Thompson was jailed because he could not find security for keeping the peace and Robert Allison, Benjamin Cross, Charles Coleman and Hiram Carter became his securities for $12.50 each to post his $50 bond. In May 1828, creditors foreclosed Thompson's mortgage on Belmont, and conducted an auction of the remaining property.
Thompson appears to have left Fairfax County by 1829 (possibly for the District of Columbia across the Potomac River). In 1850, the Alexandria Gazette published a marriage notice for his daughter Marion (a/k/a Mary), who married Isaac Leeds of Philadelphia (actually Burlington County, New Jersey across the Delaware River) on the preceding February 28, in a service conducted by Rev. Lanaham. The Leeds family lived the rest of their lives in Fairfax County, through and long after the Civil War; their firstborn son Charles T. Leeds (1862-1912) shared his grandfather's middle name, and their second son his first name, Robert Herbert Leeds (1862-1925). They lived near Dranesville on the Leesburg Pike (on the other side of the large county). The 1860 census shows Isaac Leeds as heading a large household with his wife their children, as well as this man, his second wife and their young daughter. In a census entry a decade earlier, farmer and household head Robert Thompson's gender is given as "female", his middle initial is spelled out as "Tuel", his birth year given as 1799 and birthplace as the District of Columbia (which didn't exist at the time) and Leah's name instead given as "Leo" and they lived with several adult sons and underage daughters. The 1860 census also has the dual household living around Dranesville, by which time Thompson's occupation is as a "saddler" rather than farmer and his middle initial seems "S". The 1870 census also gives his correct gender and lists him as a harnessmaker.
Death and legacy
Although one source indicates R.T. Thompson died in 1835, the Alexandria Gazette published a death notice for the "old and respected citizen" Robert T. Thompson, aged 88 years, who died at his home near Vienna (a few miles east of Dranesville).

Admiral Gifford was a wooden schooner that was lost while travelling between Port Macquarie and Sydney, New South Wales, on 8 October 1834 with a cargo of grain, hides and tallow.
Description
Little detail is known about Admiral Gifford. She was variously described as a colonial schooner with Walker as the master, and 43 tons, coppered and copper fastened.
She was similarly described whilst on a journey from Sydney to Hobart as
Service history
The vessel made a number of journeys to and from New Zealand as well as Western Australia and Queensland.
Trips included departing Sydney Thursday 13 November 1828, and returning Sunday 11 January 1829 with a general cargo of pork and flax as well as Mr. Love and 3 New Zealanders as passengers.
March 1829 Admiral Gifford arrived in Sydney and reported her cargo to be potatoes and flax from New Zealand. She remained in the New South Wales port until early May when she departed on another speculative voyage. It was during this voyage on 24 June 1829 that she picked up the boats and crew of the cutter , which had struck a reef near Frankland Reef, Queensland, and later transferred them to the brig Swiftsure. However, within a few hours Swiftsure was also wrecked and both crews again forced to take to their boats. They were eventually picked up by Resource and landed at Port Raffles on 20 July.
Admiral Gifford supported the settlement of the Swan River Colony on the west coast of Australia at the time of the founding of Perth. She arrived there on 22 October 1829 carrying a cargo of spirits and corn.
In 1830 Admiral Gifford was working along the east coast of Australia between Sydney and Newcastle carrying coal, apparently under the command of Captain Taggart. It was during January 1832 that Admiral Gifford made her trip to Hobart.
During 1832 she made another journey to New Zealand and arrived back in Sydney with a cargo of 11 tons of flax from New Zealand. On this trip she left an old captain from Sydney called William Kinnard, who was accompanied by two whites and several New Zealanders on Rocky Point, where they intended to establish a sealing station.
The barque Vittoria, 281 tons, S. Ashmore, belonging to R. Jones & Co., brought up 37 tons of flax, 50 pounds whalebone and 5 butts whale oil to Sydney on 12 November 1832. She also brought sad news. Vittoria, had gone to pick Kinnard's party and their bales of sealskins but found no trace of them. Ashmore learned, to his horror, that a band of local Maori had burned Kinnard's camp, seized the men, and then slaughtered and eaten them.
On 1 November 1833 Admiral Gifford left again New Zealand for Sydney, her supercargo including Europeans Spyres, Battersy and Thomas Baker and three native New Zealanders. Her voyage back to Sydney took 12 days
The master of Admiral Gifford also had strong views on the local Aborigines
Wreck
Little is known how Admiral Gifford sank. Fears were being raised by late October 1834
Great fears are entertained for the safety of Admiral Gifford. In order that the communication may, in the meantime, not be interrupted, Messrs. John Lord & Co. have advertised Taree to sail on Saturday.
By December no sign had been heard
There is no doubt of the melancholy loss of the schooner Admiral Gifford belonging to Mr. F. Mitchell, of Sydney, and of late employed as a trader to Port Macquarie, By a private letter from a person on that settlement, we are enabled to furnish the names of the unfortunate individuals who have, by this catastrophe, met a premature death, viz
Mrs. Thompson, wife of the Clerk of Works, and two children
A young female emigrant named Watts, who was proceeding to Sydney to be married,
A young man from London named Marriott, who emigrated about two years ago,
Mrs. Tregurtha, wife of the master,
A carpenter, late in the employ of Major Innes
with the master and four seamen,
making in all twelve human beings, who have met a premature grave.

The Robert J. Terry Anatomical Skeletal Collection is a collection of some 1,728 human skeletons held by the Department of Anthropology of the National Museum of Natural History of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., United States.
Background
It was created by Robert J. Terry (1871–1966) during his time as professor of anatomy and head of the Anatomy Department at Washington University Medical School in St. Louis, Missouri from 1899 until his retirement in 1941. It was transferred to its present holders in 1967. The Terry Collection is composed of skeletons that Terry collected from the Medical School's Gross Anatomy classes during his tenure at Washington University. The majority of the remains that make up the collection came from local hospitals in the St. Louis area, as well as institutional morgues. The remains obtained from these hospitals and institutions were those of individuals who had not been claimed by relatives, effectively making the remains the property of the state. The state of Missouri decided to donate the bodies to the medical school rather than spend taxpayer money to bury them.
The collection is an important source for anthropological research because of the extensive documentation that accompanies each skeleton. Terry attempted to collect data such as morgue records, dental charts, bone inventory forms, and anthropometric and anthroposcopic forms for the majority of the skeletons in the collection. Although methods of data collection changed over the years that the collection was being amassed, the same basic information was consistently collected. This information includes name, sex, age, race, cause of death, date of death, morgue or institution of origin, permit number, and various dates and records that pertain to embalming and processing of the cadaver. Terry also collected other resources for some of the individuals in the collection such as photographs or photo negatives of cadavers, plaster death masks, hair samples, and skin samples. The skin samples, however, had to be disposed of when the Anatomy building underwent renovations in the 1960s and the room they were stored in was removed.
Research using the Terry Collection
There have been considerable amounts of research performed utilizing the skeletal remains within the Robert J. Terry collection. Much of this research has centered around attempts to create new methods of determining biological profile (height, age, sex, and ancestry) from an individual's skeletal remains. Some of the more prominent studies have included ones such as Trotter and Gleser's stature estimation from the long bones of American Whites and Negroes, Giles and Elliot's cranial measurements for determining ancestry and sex, Işcan's ancestry determination using the pelvis, DiBennardo and Taylor's method of sex and ancestry assessment utilizing the pelvis and femur, which was later expanded upon by Işcan and Cotton, who included the tibia in the analysis. Other, more modern, studies using the Terry Collection have continued to focus on estimation of sex, ancestry, and stature as well. These include the attempt to estimate sex from the posterior portion of the ilium by Novak, Schultz, and McIntyre, Kindschuh, Dupras, and Cowgill's approach for estimating ancestry utilizing the hyoid, and Albanese's use of the clavicle, humerus, radius, and ulna to estimate sex.
These studies have contributed greatly to the field of anthropology, especially forensic anthropology and bioarchaeology, in that many of the earlier methods, such as Trotter and Gleser's stature estimation formula, are still utilized today in conjunction with more modern methods to assess biological profile of skeletal remains. It is the well documented, and highly detailed, nature of the Terry Collection that has allowed for successful development of these methodologies which are still utilized today. It is this same nature that perpetuates continued use of the Terry Collection for research into skeletal biology and pathology, thus leading to development of more successful methodologies for assessing biological profile and pathological affects on the human skeleton.
The Terry Collection has also contributed to the construction of the Forensic Anthropology Data Bank (FDB), which is large digital database of skeletal measurements taken from various cases since its establishment in 1986. A number of African-American skeletal measurements from the Terry Collection were contributed to the FDB. The FDB is the main data pool that the computer program FORDISC utilizes in order to estimate sex, stature, and ancestry from specific skeletal measurements. FORDISC is primarily utilized in forensic applications, but may be applied to any skeletal measurements providing that they are diagnostic in nature, such as measurements of the skull and long bones.
Forensic anthropological research
As mentioned above, numerous studies have utilized the Robert J. Terry Collection for research and development of skeletal identification techniques. A vast majority have been aimed at advancing forensic anthropology and its methodologies for identification through various aspects of skeletal anatomy. One of the most well known of these studies was performed by Mildred Trotter and Goldine Gleser in 1952. Trotter and Gleser utilized the Terry Collection to create stature estimation formulas for American Whites and Negroes utilizing the long bones of the arm (humerus, radius, and ulna) and of the leg (femur, tibia, and fibula). This was achieved by taking measurements of all of the aforementioned bones and creating regression formulas from the taken measurements. The result was a number of formulas that allow for accurate estimation of the living stature of both American White and African-American males and females from dry bone.
Another well known study that utilized the Terry Collection to create forensic identification methods was the assessment of race/ancestry using the pelvis performed by Mehmet Yaşar Işcan. His study utilized 400 individuals from the Terry collection that encompassed both White and African American male and female pelves of known age and race/ancestry. Measurements of the pelves were taken while they were in articulated form, and then analyzed to determine if successful estimation of race/ancestry was possible. Results indicated that there was the possibility of an 88 percent correct assessment, and that race/ancestry assessment of female pelves was easier than that of male pelves. It was, however, cautioned to use these results carefully due to the fact that a large number of the remains were of low socioeconomic status and of unknown nutritional health.
Bioarchaeological Research
While bioarchaeology benefits from the methodologies that have been developed by forensic anthropological research using the Terry Collection, there are other studies that take a solely bioarchaeological focus. While not nearly as numerous as the forensic studies, they provide a different aspect to and use of the Robert J. Terry Anatomical Collection. Such studies have been conducted by Kristina Killgrove, who aimed at determining biodistance of Native American populations on the North Carolina Coastal Plain and utilized 52 individuals (26 White males and 26 White females) from the Terry Collection as a control group for comparison against the Native American data that was processed.
Further bioarchaeological research using the Terry Collection was performed by Kristrina Schuler and J. Alyssa White of Auburn University in Alabama. Their research focused on reconstructing body mass from skeletal remains and used a sample of 60 individuals (30 males and 30 females) from the Terry Collection in order to make these assessments. They opted to use the Terry Collection because of its highly controlled collection of living weight for many donors.
Potential issues for modern use
While the Robert J. Terry Anatomical Collection has proven to be an excellent source for research in the field of anthropology, specifically forensic anthropology and bioarchaeology, the collection is now over 100 years old and no modern remains have been added. This has raised questions about the collection's applicability to modern populations when compared to collections such as the William Bass Donated Skeletal Collection where modern skeletal remains are still being added to the collection. This is thought to raise problems due to the secular changes that are taking place in American populations. It has been demonstrated that clear secular changes have taken place in North America over the last 100–125 years. This has implications for the applicability of studies utilizing the Terry Collection because these changes could impede the ability to make generalizations that are applicable to modern society from these remains since population statistics are not the same today as they were when the collection was being amassed. It was found, however, that the Robert J. Terry Collection and the William Bass Donated Skeletal Collection only have significant differences between age-at-death and year of birth for individuals in the collection, therefore indicating that the more modern remains in the Terry Collection are still applicable to modern research. There were potential secular differences noted in the males of the Terry collection, however. Females had less significant secular differences when compared to males, and while none of these changes were found to be present in large quantities it does indicate that secular change could be beginning to affect skeletal morphology, specifically that of males. Further research utilizing the Terry Collection, specifically utilizing those individuals born before 1890, is required to determine if these changes are significant and what may be causing them.

The Siena-Grosseto railway line is an Italian railway line that connects the cities of Siena and Grosseto in Southern Tuscany.
History
The first connection between Siena and Grosseto was completed in 1872 by the Società per le Strade Ferrate Romane, first using the Central Tuscan Railway down to Asciano, before using the whole length of the Asciano-Monte Antico railway up to Monte Antico and continuing to Montepescali on the Tirrenica railway, before using this line to run into Grosseto. In 1906, a proposal was submitted to construct a faster line between Monte Antico and Siena via Buonconvento. The contract to construct this line was awarded in 1910 to the Société Française de Chemins de Fer en Toscane, and the line began construction in 1923. Two years later, the contract was modified and the Società Italiana per Imprese Ferroviarie e Lavori Pubblici (SIF) was awarded the contract to finish the line, which it completed in 1927. The line was inaugurated on 30 May 1927, and served the old Madonnina Rossa station in Siena until the new station was completed in 1935. The line suffered serious damage during the Second World War and was only reopened in 1951. In 1955, the FS took over operation of the line. On 16 June 1966, floods damaged large sections of the line, and along with the Asciano-Monte Antico railway, the line did not reopen until May 1980, during which period the line was modernised. In October 2013, a flood washed away the trackbed near Murlo station, which meant the line was closed for a year between Buonconvento and Montepescali. The line has also been victim to other floods more recently that have caused the line to be temporarily closed on multiple occasions.
Traffic
The line is served by regionale trains operated by Trenitalia, which primarily connect Siena and Grosseto, and in early mornings and evenings also run to Empoli and Florence. On selected dates, Treno Natura historic steam trains are operated that use sections of this line as well as the Asciano-Monte Antico line.

Frederick Cayley Robinson (18 August 1862 – 4 January 1927) was an English artist, creating paintings and applied art including book illustrations and theatre set designs. Along with a number of other British artists, Cayley Robinson continued to paint striking Pre-Raphaelite and Victorian subjects well into the twentieth century despite this approach becoming deeply unfashionable. His work has been examined in a PhD thesis by Alice Eden and an exhibition Modern Pre-Raphaelite Visionaries at Leamington Spa Art Gallery & Museum.
His series of large-scale mural paintings for the Middlesex Hospital entitled Acts of Mercy commissioned around 1915 and completed in 1920 are some of his most impressive works, along with Pastoral, 1923, (Tate, London), which was bought by the Chantrey Bequest for the nation. However his many smaller paintings, particularly of interiors featuring sombre women as well as the theme of departure, are significant works of modern British art.
The artist's time studying at the Académie Julian in Paris from 1891-1894 had a critical influence on his entire artistic output which displays the influence of European Symbolism, especially the avant-garde group the Nabis and the cult revival of interest in Burne-Jones in Paris at this time. Like many of his peers, Cayley Robinson felt drawn to a new style of art, moving away from modern impressionism and appearing to emulate the visionary medievalism of the Pre-Raphaelites.
Various connections - within the circle of Ricketts and Shannon and the Glasgow School of Art for example - brought Cayley Robinson closer to the occult revival of the period, including the Golden Dawn and esotericism. This context also infused his artworks. From the late 1890s, Cayley Robinson developed his own distinctive oeuvre of artistic expression which combined simple, quiet domesticity – the everyday - with hints of the occult, the mysterious, the wondrous.
In recent decades, Cayley Robinson's work has been exhibited in Tate exhibitions, Chasing Happiness at the Fitzwilliam Museum, (2006-7), which displayed his illustrations for Maurice Maeterlinck's The Blue Bird and the Acts of Mercy exhibition at the National Gallery, (2010). The latter displayed striking mural works, rescued and purchased by the Wellcome Trust in 2007.
Many of Cayley Robinson's artworks are featured in the exhibition Modern Pre-Raphaelite Visionaries: British Art, 1880-1930, (Leamington Spa Art Gallery, 13th May - 18th September, 2022 and the Watts Gallery, Artist's Village, Compton, October, 2022- February, 2023). A publication entitled Modern Pre-Raphaelite Visionaries: British Art, 1880-1930 was produced to coincide with the exhibition.
The publication features essays by scholars Tim Barringer, Colin Cruise, Charlotte Gere, Jan Marsh, Elizabeth Prettejohn and Sarah Victoria Turner.
The book is edited with an introduction and catalogue by Alice Eden.[1] The exhibition displays Cayley Robinson alongside many of his peers working in similar ways, engaging with revivals as well as their modern historic moment.

Biography
Born on 18 August 1862, in Brentford-on-Thames, Middlesex, Frederick Cayley Robinson was the son of an engineer. He studied at the St. John's Wood School of Art, London, and from 1885 to 1888 at the Royal Academy Schools. Early on Cayley Robinson painted scenes of the sea, in the fashionable Newlyn style, and from 1889 to 1891 he sailed off in a boat around Britain. When he returned, Cayley Robinson studied at the Académie Julian in Paris from 1891-1894.
The artist married the painter Winifred Lucy Dalley in 1898 and they had one daughter. From 1898 to 1901, like many artists of the period, Cayley Robinson visited Florence and during that time studied the Old Masters and techniques such as tempera. In 1904, Cayley Robinson became a founder member of the Society of Painters in Tempera. This brought him in contact with a number of other like-minded artists, notably Mary Sargant-Florence and Lady Christiana Herringham, both of whom were involved with the suffrage movement.
A central theme of Cayley Robinson's paintings was enchantment. He produced very popular illustrations and set designs for the Haymarket Theatre production in London of Maurice Maeterlinck's The Blue Bird in 1910. For the period 1907-1914, Cayley Robinson was connected with the London based Art Theosophical Circle, a group which sought forms of artistic enchantment in the modern world. The artist contributed illustrations for their published journal Orpheus.
In 1914, Cayley Robinson moved with his family into 1 Lansdowne House, Lansdowne Road, Kensington, London. This was a custom-built studio apartment block inhabited solely by artists. In the same year, the artist took up his only teaching professorship, at the Glasgow School of Art, which he held for ten years.
Frederick Cayley Robinson died of influenza on 3 January 1927 in a nursing home at 1 Ladbroke Square, Kensington; he was survived by his wife.

Exhibitions
During his lifetime, Cayley Robinson regularly exhibited at the Royal Academy and the Society of British Painters and held several important solo shows.
Whilst neglected for much of the twentieth century, Robert Upstone curated an important exhibition in 2010: the National Gallery displayed six works by Cayley Robinson including the four panels of the Acts of Mercy series in the Sunley Room. The exhibition ran from 14 July to 17 October.
