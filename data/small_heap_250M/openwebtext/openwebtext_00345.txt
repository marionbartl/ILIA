This past Friday the police department in Seguin – population around 26,000 – took part in what they say was the largest coordinated investigation in the town's history.
With federal agents, state troopers, and other law enforcements agencies, local police raided nearly 20 locations targeting top members of what they call the Texas Mexican Mafia. But who are they?
Nathan Jones, a professor of criminal justice at Sam Houston State University and author of the new book Mexico's Illicit Drug Networks and the State Reaction, says this group is different from the Mexican Mafia based in California, one of the country's largest prison gangs.
“The Texas Mexican Mafia started in the 1980s to protect Hispanic members of the prison system from another predatory group, the Texas Syndicate,” he says.
Jones says they have a strict hierarchy with a militaristic ranking structure. “It prides itself on being fairly disciplined,” he says. “It even has recent cases where members have killed other members for misbehavior and that's is kind of a hallmark of a hierarchal and highly disciplined organization.”
What you'll hear in this segment:
– What police encountered during the raid, including scenes like something out of “Scarface” with stacks of cash and kilos of drugs
– Why these traffickers chose Seguin as their base
– Who flipped and how that may have helped them target this group in particular
Eileen Gittins, CEO and founder of Blurb – an online platform that allows individuals to design and publish their own photo books – has announced that Blurb users will now be able to sell and distribute their books globally through Amazon.com, even if they only sell one copy.
Although Amazon has sold self-published books before, this is the first time that the retailer has invested so heavily in photo books (Blurb users can also create text-based titles, but the platform's focus is on photo books). The decision marks a huge leap forward for the ever-growing group of photographers who are designing and printing their own photo books rather than working with traditional publishing houses.
In recent years, self-published photo books have become more popular and more readily accessible – with titles being sold in small bookshops, by independent dealers, or on lesser-known websites. But “self-publishing photographers want to be on Amazon; it's today's equivalent of being in a high street shop,” says Gittins. “We will facilitate the whole thing: get the book an ISBN and print it on demand – there's no minimum print run,” she explains. “The only difference [to selling via Blurb's online shop] is that Amazon has some fees attached [a referral fee of 15% of the product price].”
Gittins has also announced that, for print runs over 300, Blurb will warehouse the books for six months.

"Tap" cards, which have become increasingly widespread, use radio frequency identification (RFID) chips embedded in plastic credit and debit cards to make checkout faster — but it also makes identity theft easier.
Smartphones can be adapted to read RFID frequencies from a distance.
Sarah Fakkeldy suspects that's what happened to her on Wednesday after a trip to the Dartmouth Crossing Walmart, followed by a call from her bank saying someone was trying to use her bank card.
She says she wasn't alone.
"When we went to the bank to get it checked out, we found out that Thursday alone, they had dealt with 75 people," she said.
Fakkeldy didn't lose any money, but says the CIBC did reimburse others she talked to in line at the bank.
Pascal Fortin, who heads cybersecurity company GoSecure, said this type of fraud is not unusual.
"You can have a reader with compromised software that can do that," he said. "Limited to transactions of $100, which means for the banks, this is pretty acceptable risk."
CIBC has not responded to questions about recent digital thefts.
However, for those concerned about being electronically ripped off, there is a cheap fix to help prevent your card from being scanned at a distance by smartphones or other readers.

Russian billionaire-turned-politician Mikhail Prokhorov's mining company has agreed to snap up a Canadian copper producer in a $100 million deal requiring the listing of the new firm's shares in Toronto, the companies announced Thursday.
WASHINGTON, December 12 (RIA Novosti) – Russian billionaire-turned-politician Mikhail Prokhorov's mining company has agreed to snap up a Canadian copper producer in a $100 million deal requiring the listing of the new firm's shares in Toronto, the companies announced Thursday.
Intergeo MMC, a mining company controlled by Prokhorov's Onexim Group, has acquired Vancouver-based Mercator Minerals and will hold an 85 percent ownership stake in the new company, which will be named Intergeo Mining, Onexim and Mercator said.
“We are very excited about the potential of Intergeo Mining,” Onexim chief executive Dmitry Razumo said in a statement. “The combined company will be led by a team of professionals with unique experience in managing metals and mining companies internationally.”
Prokhorov will invest $100 million in the new company as part of the deal, which is conditional upon Intergeo Mining's listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange, according to a statement issued Thursday by Mercator.
Intergeo had planned an initial public offering in Canada last year but postponed the move, citing an unfavorable market, Bloomberg reported.
Prokhorov, 48, made his fortune in metals, banking and an array of investments. Forbes Russia estimated his net worth this year at $13 billion.
His most high-profile move into North American was his 2010 purchase of the New Jersey Nets of the National Basketball Association, a team he relocated to Brooklyn, which has a large Russian-speaking population.
Prokhorov entered into Russian politics in 2011, unsuccessfully attempting to participate in the parliamentary elections. He also squared off against Vladimir Putin in last year's presidential race, finishing third with about 8 percent of the vote.

Vegan documentary Andy Goes In will premiere at the Toronto Film Festival on September 12. The nine-minute short follows “Andy”—an undercover investigator for animal-rights organization Mercy For Animals (MFA)—as he gathers horrendous footage of animal cruelty at a farm in rural Tennessee that supplies chickens to companies such as Tyson and McDonald's. While the footage is meant to expose animal cruelty, it is also a peek into the difficult life of an undercover investigator who risks his well-being, both physically and mentally, in order to bring awareness to the animal abuse inherent in factory farms. “My main goal was to give a sense of how important this work is to Andy and the lengths he's willing to go for it,” filmmaker Josh Polon said. “And hopefully this inspires people to be a little more courageous in working for the changes they want to see in the world.” Footage gathered in such investigations prompts companies such as Tyson and Perdue to terminate abusive employees and implement animal welfare reforms in order to maintain their public image. The film will be available to the public on the MFA website on September 17.

Image caption The ban on accessing sites only applies to public sector workers
Jordan has barred public sector workers from accessing more than 50 websites at work, after it was found they were wasting almost 3 hours a day online.
The 30-day study found that public servants visited 70 million websites at work, of which only 130,000 were relevant to their jobs.
The country's Information Minister, Marwan Juma, told BBC News that the policy would "improve services".
"We knew there was waste, but not to this extent," he said.
"These policies are not unique; when I worked in the private sector, all the companies I worked for had policies.
"It's part of our attempts to improve services and get staff to use the internet as a tool to help them with their work."
Mr Juma stressed that the blocked access would only be in place during office hours.
"This is a continuous process and we are revamping our monitoring and filtering tools with a view, perhaps, of time limited access to certain sites, rather than an outright block," he added.
Immediate action
The government said that action needed to be taken, pointing out that there were more than a quarter of a million attempts to access the blocked sites in the first day after the ban came into effect.
"This measure must not be misinterpreted," said the Jordanian Communications Minister, Ali Ayed.
"The government is not targeting any particular website," adding that even the government's own news agency, Petra, has been blocked.
Image caption King Abdullah II has encouraged the country's move into ICT
The Jordanian ministry said that employees were wasting, on average, two and a half working hours every day on the internet.
"The public sector's time must be spent in service of the public interest and public servants must focus their attention on the public's needs, instead of wasting their time surfing the web or playing games," said Mr Ayed.
Mr Juma agreed, telling BBC News that "when someone is at work, they should be focused on their job".
Jordan has ambitions to be the hi-tech capital of the Middle East.
King Abdullah II established an ICT (information and communication technologies) curriculum into the education system not long after he came to the throne in 1999 and today almost 40% of Jordanian households have internet access.
Mr Juma said that the country was continuing with its broadband roll out and that parts of the country - notably Amman - were having fibre laid.
French authorities are carefully examining a video released by jihadists to check if a masked woman featured in the clip is the fugitive partner of a terrorist who killed four Jewish people and a policewoman in France last month, CNN reported on Thursday.
The video clip, titled “Blow up France 2” and apparently made by French-speaking Islamic State members, was published on Tuesday and shows a group of people armed with rifles, including a woman resembling Hayat Boumeddiene, who is believed to be in Syria.
Although the woman is clad in camouflage clothing and a head covering that reveals only her eyes, authorities believe she may be the longtime partner of Amedy Coulibaly, one of three terrorists who carried out a series of attacks in Paris during January, including on a kosher supermarket.

“French authorities are investigating the possibility this woman could be Hayat Boumeddiene,” a source said according to the report.
In the video, the jihadists threaten further attacks on France.
“If you fight for democracy, we will fight for Islam,” the leader of the group says. “You will have to accept that we will react fully to the numerous crimes you committed. You took our rights. Therefore you can't expect to be in peace.”
The Paris attacks started with the January 7 massacre at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo where 12 people were shot dead by the brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi.
In a separate incident the next day Coulibaly shot a policewoman to death on the outskirts of Paris and then killed four Jewish hostages at a kosher supermarket the day after that.
All three gunmen were eventually shot dead by police.
Boumeddiene, who is suspected of having had a role in her partner's attacks, was seen traveling through Turkey with a male companion before reportedly arriving in Syria with him on January 8 — the day after the Charlie Hebdo attack and the same day Coulibaly began his murderous spree.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told the state-run Anadolu Agency that she had stayed at a hotel in Istanbul with another person before crossing into Syria on Thursday. She and her traveling companion, a 23-year-old man, toured Istanbul, then left January 4 for a town near the Turkish border, according to a Turkish intelligence official who was not authorized to speak on the record.
Her last phone signal was on January 8 from the border town of Akcakale, where she crossed over apparently into Islamic State-controlled territory in Syria, the official said. Their January 9 return plane tickets to Madrid went unused.

Battle of Mohács, (August 29, 1526), decisive defeat of Hungary, led by King Louis II, by the Turks of the Ottoman Empire, led by Sultan Süleyman the Magnificent. This victory at Mohacs marked the effective destruction of the Hungarian monarchy and paved the way for Habsburg and Turkish domination in Hungary.
In order to expand the Ottoman Empire into the heart of Europe, Süleyman would have to conquer the kingdom of Hungary. The first stage to accomplishing this goal was the capture of Belgrade in 1521. Süleyman could then use Serbian territory to launch an invasion.
The Hungarians knew that an attack was coming but could not win any support from other Christian powers. Süleyman's army made an uncontested crossing of the Drava River on a pontoon bride, which took five days, while King Louis waited to face the invaders on a large marshy plain at Mohacs. The Hungarians intended to rely upon the shock effect of their charging armored knights, but Süleyman had better balanced forces, including infantry Janissaries armed with arquebuses, sipahi light cavalry, and formidable banks of cannon.
The charge of the Hungarian cavalry caused serious casualties to the Ottoman vanguard, but Süleyman's elite Janissaries pushed back the Hungarians, who were also torn apart by Turkish cannon fire. As the Hungarians fell back, they were outflanked and encircled by the fastmoving Ottoman light cavalry. The Hungarian force was annihilated. King Louis of Hungary was thrown from his horse and killed as he tried to escape the carnage. Süleyman proceeded into Buda (September 10) but then withdrew from the country, taking more than 100,000 captives with him.
The defeat at Mohacs was a disaster that ended the existence of Hungary as an independent united kingdom . A prolonged civil war (1526-38) ultimately resulted in the incorporation of the central and southern two-thirds of Hungary into the Ottoman Empire (1547) and in the establishment of Transylvania and the eastern Hungarian provinces as an autonomous principality within the Ottoman Empire.
Losses: Ottoman, 2,000 of 60,000; Hungarian, 18,000 of 35,000.
The International Cycling Union UCI has announced the list of teams that have applied for WorldTour and pro continental licenses for the 2017 season.
Teams wishing to be registered in first or second division for the 2017 road season are required to submit a registration file to the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI). The UCI, in association with the appointed-auditor EY, evaluates whether the teams are in compliance with the UCI Regulations.
In accordance with its regulations the UCI is today publishing the list of teams that have submitted a registration file as per Articles 2.15.069 bis and 2.16.014 bis.
As expected, 16 of the current 18 teams have all applied. Only IAM and Tinkoff that will fold at the end of 2016, are absent from the list. Furthermore, the new Bahrain-Merida team of Vincenzo Nibali and Bora-hansgrohe which has signed Peter Sagan have sent an application.
According to an agreement between the main stakeholders of cycling, the number of WorldTour teams will be reduced to 17 in 2017. As 18 teams have applied for a license, one is going to miss out.
The rules stipulate that the top 16 teams in the UCI WorldTour ranking have satisfied the sporting criteria. IAM and Dimension Data finished at the bottom of the ranking and so are offically known as candidate teams for the WorldTour. As IAM will fold, Dimension Data will be battling with Bora-hansgrohe and Bahrain-Merida for the final spot and the three teams will be evaluated based on the WorldTour points obtained by their best five riders for the 2017 season. Initial calculations suggest that Dimension Data is likely to lose the battle.
The UCI also announced the list of applicants for a pro continental license. It includes the new Irish Aqua Blue team which has signed current WorldTour riders Lars Petter Nordhaug and Matt Brammeier, and current continental teams Manzana Postobon from Colombia and Wallonie-Bruxelles from Belgium. Veranda's Willems that had also indicated their intention to step up to the higher level is missing from the list.
From the current group of pro continental teams, Drapac, Verva-ActiveJet, Funvic, Team Stölting and Roth are all missing from the list. The latter two have both announced their intention to step down to continental and U23 level respectively while the former has merged with the Cannondale team.

Paige VanZant was presented with several outside-the-octagon opportunities following her stint on “Dancing with the Stars” earlier this year. She turned all those down, however, because currently, nothing outweighs her desire to fight again for the UFC, she said.
VanZant (6-2 MMA, 3-1 UFC) gained plenty of recognition in recent months when she made a deep run on “Dancing with the Stars,” eventually finishing as runner-up in the competition. She had the chance to parlay that success with a role in the “Kickboxer” movie sequel as well as an appearance at WWE's “SummerSlam” event, but instead, opted to accept the fight with Bec Rawlings (7-4 MMA, 2-1 UFC) at UFC on FOX 21 in August.
The chance to build on her celebrity through movies and WWE appearances were tempting, but VanZant told ESPN's “SportsCenter” today her priority remains with fighting.
“Fighting definitely comes first,” VanZant said. “I've recently declined to be in the ‘Kickboxer' movie because I want to be 100 percent for this fight and train 100 percent and filming that movie was kind of going to get in the way. We couldn't get a date set that worked with my fight schedule.
“Right now I'm 100 percent fight-focused and I would love to participate in anything the WWE has to offer when the timing's right as long as it works with my fight schedule. I love WWE and if they ever reached out to me again I would love to work with them but right now I'm focused on Bec Rawlings.”
UFC on FOX 21 takes place on Aug. 27 at Rogers Arena in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The main card airs on FOX following prelims on FOX Sports 1 and UFC Fight Pass, though the bout order has not been set.
Although fighting is a more physically taxing and time-consuming endeavor than the other options presented, VanZant couldn't accept spending more time away from the octagon. She hasn't competed in since a one-sided submission loss to Rose Namajunas at UFC Fight Night 80 in December and couldn't go any longer without trying to redeem herself.
VanZant could have attempted to juggle acting and WWE commitments along with her preparation for Rawlings, but said that would have been detrimental to her desire to return as a better fighter than displayed in her most recent bout.
“It feels really good to get back to my roots,” VanZant said. “I really, really miss MMA. I miss the UFC and this is my world and I belong in it and I'm excited to get back in the cage.”
“I feel like I just missed violence. I went to a few UFC fights and it's really hard for me to sit still cageside because I just want to be in there and that's how it's been every time I go to a UFC fight.”
What helps even more, VanZant said, is the fact she can get excited about her return. Rawlings will enter UFC on FOX 21 with a two-fight winning streak including a unanimous decision win over Seo Hee Ham at UFC Fight Night 85 in March. Although Rawlings has been streaking, VanZant said she sees the matchup as advantageous in her favor, even going so far as to call “Rowdy” the “perfect” fit for her comeback.
“I am so excited about this matchup I think it's perfect, especially with me coming back into the UFC after being away for ‘Dancing with the Stars,'” VanZant said. “It's a perfect matchup, I'm very excited about this fight and I'm excited to go to Canada and have it take place there. I love Canada, so this is a great matchup and I can't wait for this one.”

The beating drums of progress are emanating from Anfield. Liverpool FC are apparently on the way up after battling to a 2-2 draw against reigning champions Manchester City. But why the positivity?
The answer seems to be a simple one, and one of the most fundamental parts of the ideology of good football, we passed and moved.
It wasn't perfect, and there were errors, but the players were obviously trying to implement one of Brendan Rodgers' now famous philosophies.
The match against Roberto Mancini's men highlighted a few interesting things about Liverpool this season that we might expect to see for the duration, but it also raised some problems.
Firstly, the positives:
1) Pressure.
Something we saw during the first 4 years of Rafael Benitez tenure in charge. This was a ‘press from the front' mentality that became globally recognised through Barcelona's Champions League performances.
The Catalan club's forwards pushed relentlessly forward against opposition defenders, often barricading the opposing team in their own half. Any possession regained during this pack hunt would almost inevitably lead to a chance due to the proximity of the forward players and the opposing teams goal. Winning the ball back 30 yards from the opposing goal is always going to cause chaos in the calmest of defences.
This is what Liverpool showed glimpses of at Anfield. Suarez and Borini were particularly energetic in their closing down, as was Shelvey. Gerrard, who carries the burden of age looked comfortable in marking the space in central areas, discouraging through balls. This was one of the key reasons behind Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri being starved of time throughout the game.
2) Midfield.
As alluded to in the Pressure section, the midfield battle seemed to be dominated by Liverpool. Rodgers favours a three man central midfield, essentially flooding what many feels is the most important aspect of the game.
Mancini tried to counter this by going three at the back and having Yaya Toure sit deep with De Jong with Nasri as a ‘point', but I genuinely feel there was a bit more harmony and balance between Liverpool's players, although both teams did look uncomfortable at times as they adjusted to a new formation and a new system respectively.
Joe Allen hit 93.5% of his passes successfully, the highest out of any player, and it looks as though the Welshman will be a cornerstone of Liverpool's side for the next decade. Allen's influence on games will only increase as the players around become used to his style and abilities. He is a non-headline grabbing player, but one who will act as the metronome allowing other players to go and grab the glory.
Ironically, after the loan signing of Nuri Sahin, one of the ‘odd ones out' in Liverpool's midfield may appear to be Gerrard. Whilst still a classy player, Gerrard no longer seems to be the focal point of the team either in midfield or in attack, with Suarez and Allen taking these roles, probably with increasing authority over the next year or two, it means the long time talisman may have to get used to rotation. Rodgers will no doubt be looking to the future, and with Lucas, Allen and Sahin being young internationals, the future looks bright in that area.
3) Sterling.
Not much needs to be said about the young starlet. Rodgers showed an immense amount of trust in Raheem Sterling and he will certainly feel vindicated.
The Jamaican born winger looked full of confidence and speed. It is a strong message to other players like Stewart Downing that their futures are on the line if youngsters are suddenly propelled above them in the pecking order.
Liverpool looked to isolate Sterling one-on-one against Kolo Toure when possible, and for 60 minutes it worked. Sterling looked willing to go on the outside of players as well as cutting in on his favoured right foot, which is something he'll have to keep up in order to maintain an air of unpredictability.
Sterling did tire after the hour mark as some of his passing started to get erratic. But this shouldn't concern Liverpool fans as, at 17, he is still coming to terms with the pace of professional football. I think Rodgers would have subbed Sterling had he not been forced into an early change with Lucas' injury.
4) Sebastian Coates.
The Uruguayan centre-back is often overlooked when talk of young players is brought up, but at 21, Sebastian Coates looks like he could become a great player. Most centre-halves don't mature until they're in their late 20's but sometimes Coates plays like a player with 20 years experience behind him.
He's far from the finished article and at times can go to ground too easily, but I was incredibly impressed by his reading of the game.
My main worry about him when we signed was his lack of speed, but I felt reassured about the players' abilities after seeing him read the game extremely well during last years Copa America and his small number of appearances at Liverpool. Although Aguero wasn't present on Sunday, he still faced up to one of the best attacks in Europe and did himself proud next to Martin Skrtel and Martin Kelly.
The positives that we can take out of the game against Man City shouldn't be overlooked. This comes after a season of uncertainty and disappointing performances. Although it should be remembered that even under Dalglish, Liverpool did manage to look competitive against the top opposition. A real test of our evolution as a group will come against teams outside of the Champions League, where tactics come into it more due to a reduction in atmosphere, hype and adrenaline.
Positives were not the only thing to take out of the game, however, a few concerns did present themselves that I hope are obvious to Brendan Rodgers.
Concerns:
1) Stamina.
Liverpool's players expended a lot of energy against Manchester City. Pressure from the front works extremely well in games, especially against teams who are comfortable in possession, however the toll it takes over the course of a season, especially one which incorporates a Europa League run, can be damaging to a team.
In Rodgers' first season with Swansea in the top flight, the team noticeably dropped off in the last 10 games. Rodgers' team won only two of the last 9 games, losing 5 times.
This, I feel, would be a result of high energy performances early in the season. Another burden to consider would be the amount of extra games Liverpool FC may play compared to The Swans. With a domestic cup run and an extended European experience, Liverpool could well see themselves playing over 60 games.
One thing Rodgers does have at Anfield that he didn't at the Liberty Stadium, would be resources and squad depth. Whilst Liverpool's squad depth isn't superb, it does allow the manager to make wholesale changes for midweek games, especially early on in the season against ‘weaker' opposition.
2) Andy Carroll.
I'm a fan of the big man, I must admit. Carroll's attributes are all physical, and he does it well, whether he's back defending corners or attacking headers. I felt like last season we were extremely obvious in our approach. Signing Downing to supply the crosses and Carroll to head them in. Sadly that type of game is easy to read for a team who have the kind of exposure we do.
Under Rodgers' fluid, attacking system, Andy Carroll seems like a square peg in a round hole. It's not his fault, but I don't see him fitting in here at all.
Rodgers prefers mobility over strength, and it looks like he'll go with Suarez alone for the biggest games. That doesn't bode well for the £35m striker but it's a problem we'll be stuck with for the season unless Newcastle cough up £20m.
I think it's the sensible thing to to cut our losses on Carroll, as long we have enough money to sensibly reinvest. He's a powerful number 9 with a hammer of a left foot, but he'd be wasted on our bench and we could put the recouped money to better use, even if it does mean selling him to a rival.
If we don't manage to offload him, then I see Carroll's role reduced to cup games and impact substitutions. A sad situation for the most expensive fish out of water in British transfer history.
3) Left back.
Despite all of the bad press regarding his defensive side, Glen Johnson is an excellent defender. Quick, powerful and technically good on the ball, Johnson has an unfair reputation for defensive vulnerabilities. However, I don't think it would be fair to expect either him or Daniel Agger to be stand-in left backs should Jose Enrique drop out of the side.
Enrique is a good player but he's painfully slow. With a lack of decent competition there (Jack Robinson seems a little way off yet), I worry that Enrique's place will be guaranteed, meaning complacency is a danger for a defender who can look switched off at the best of times.
I think left back is an area Liverpool needs to reinforce.
4) Fabio Borini.
The £10m Italian looks a good player, but his long term place in the team for me, isn't guaranteed.
He's hardworking, direct and technically sound. A Rodgers player for sure, but I think he lacks that edge that maybe Suarez has. That world class vibe that puts you above the rest. I wouldn't fancy Borini against left backs such as Aahley Cole. For me that means in that area there is room for improvement.
Of course, I hope I'm mistaken and Borini grows into a great player, he does have time on his side. Until then I hope he gets in tune with the players around him quickly and helps the team develop into the formidable passing unit that Rodgers wants us to be.
All in all, I think the positives from the game far outweigh the negatives. However, as I mentioned earlier Liverpool have never really had trouble getting up for the big games. The real acid test will be our next tricky away encounter, or even a home clash. An away game at Sunderland and a home game against Stoke in the next month will be perfect tests to see how far we've come under Rodgers first few months.

Toddler kidnapped from SUV in Oakland

A 21-month-old girl was reported kidnapped from her family's parked SUV outside an East Oakland mini-market Wednesday, prompting an intensive search for a woman who witnesses told police led the toddler down the street, authorities said.
Dozens of police officers from Oakland and other agencies and FBI agents, some with German shepherds, went door to door in the neighborhood around 79th Avenue and International Boulevard looking for Daphne Viola Webb after her father reported her abduction at 11 a.m.
Police later said they wanted anyone who had seen the father within the past 30 days to contact them, calling it part of a "wide focus" on the case. They said he was not a suspect.
The father, John Webb, told police he had ducked into Gazzali's Supermarket at 7838 International Blvd. to buy an energy drink, leaving his daughter with an adult relative in his Ford Explorer, said Officer Johnna Watson, a police spokeswoman.
When he came out of the store, he said, the girl was gone.
Police said the relative who was with Daphne was disabled, but gave no details. Witnesses described her as an older woman.
The father said he had not seen the kidnapper, but people in the area soon reported seeing a woman carrying Daphne in her arms down the sidewalk, Watson said.
Police said the woman was described as a Latina or light-skinned black woman in her 30s, with very long black hair. She was wearing a light-colored top and blue jeans, police said.
Daphne is black, with short, curly black hair and brown eyes. She was wearing clothing similar to orange pajamas with pink hearts, and pink socks.
About three hours after police issued an Amber Alert, Watson gave an evening briefing at which she said police wanted anyone who had seen Webb, 49, or his daughter within the past 30 days to contact them.
She said investigators still considered the case to be a kidnapping, and said of Webb, "We are not calling him a suspect."
Watson said the need to "keep an open mind to everything that occurred" prompted the unusual public request.
"We want to be cautious, careful and very thorough," Watson said. "We need to have a very wide focus."
She added that police had interviewed Webb and Daphne's mother, who does not live with him, along with other family members. She described them as "extremely cooperative."
Police continue to look for the woman whom neighbors reported seeing leading Daphne away, Watson said.
Acquaintances said Webb lived with Daphne and his mother, who is in her mid-80s.
"I hate that this has happened to them; they are just a great family," said Bill Owens, the owner of a martial arts studio who lived near Webb until the family moved to the Oak Knoll neighborhood a few months ago. "He was just an all-out great guy. He was always trying to do good for people."
Daniel Chavez, a clerk at the mini-market, said Webb was a regular at the store. On Wednesday, Chavez said, "he was here maybe one, two minutes. And then this happened."
Oakland police asked anyone who sees Daphne or has other information about the case to call them at (510) 238-3641.

Charlotte Talks Midterm Election Special Oct. 23
With the midterm election only weeks away, Mike Collins will preview the races in WFAE's "Charlotte Talks Midterm Election Special," which will be broadcast live at 7 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 23, at the Booth Playhouse.
The Air Force's new top enlisted leader, Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force Kaleth Wright, doesn't mince words when he talks about his rough, early days in the service.
"I was a pretty crappy airman, honestly," Wright said in a Feb. 15 interview in his new, still-bare office at the Pentagon. "I used to get in trouble a lot, got wrote up a lot. Coming to work late, not paying my bills, talking back, just kind of being irresponsible. Fighting. I used to fight a lot when I was a young guy."
But Wright was fortunate enough to gain the attention of a tough master sergeant who took him under his wing, set him straight, and became a father figure to him. The example that Master Sgt. Joe Winbush set inspired Wright's own leadership style and his desire to help other young airmen find their talents.
And now, as the 18th chief master sergeant of the Air Force, Wright has the opportunity to help shape the entire enlisted ranks for the better.
Wright took over Feb. 17 as the new CMSAF, at the retirement ceremony for his predecessor, Chief Master Sgt. James Cody. Wright was previously the command chief master sergeant of U.S. Air Forces in Europe and U.S. Air Forces Africa, headquartered at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. He comes from a dental background and has deployed to support Operation Desert Storm and to Afghanistan.
Wright joined the Air Force in 1989 — but it wasn't the path he ever imagined himself on. Even though his hometown of Columbus, Georgia, is an Army town that's home to Fort Benning, he didn't come from a military family or have any desire to pursue a career in the armed forces.
‘Call it an omen'
But Wright had to drop out of Winston-Salem State University in North Carolina after less than a year because he didn't have enough money to stay in school. He went back home to mull over his future, he said.
"I was laying on the couch, I rolled over, my wallet fell out, hit the ground, one thing fell out: it was an Air Force recruiter's card," Wright said. "I looked down at it, and said, ‘Hey, I'll join the Air Force.' I called a recruiter and two months later I was in San Antonio. It was kind of … call it an omen."
It wasn't a good fit at first, as he got into what he called "19-, 20-year-old mischievous stuff. That type of stuff that in today's Air Force, you won't last long doing those types of things."
But during Wright's first few misguided years at Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina, Winbush noticed him and took him under his wing.
"That was the beginning of my 180," Wright said.
One day — after Wright had been in the Air Force for about three years — Winbush handed Wright an application to join the base's honor guard. Wright handed it back and said he wasn't interested.
"He gave it back — with a few choice words," Wright said. "So I had to clean my act up a little bit. My uniform used to be really shoddy. I wasn't really that into serving. But joining the base honor guard gave me a different perspective."
Wright worked his way up to team lead, and recalls vividly the day he had to present a flag to the widow of a late airman during a funeral.
"I remember the second that I changed my life around, when I presented this flag and made eye contact," Wright said. "You have to say this canned statement. 'On behalf of the president of the United States and this grateful nation.' I made eye contact with the spouse. She cried, and that moment, I said to myself, 'Hey man, you got to get your life together. You got to get serious about your life and your career.'"

The newly-focused Wright began working harder, winning awards, going back to school, and paying more attention to the way he looked and the way he spoke.
Winbush "was really tough on me," but fair, Wright said. "Even though he was a dental guy, he was more like a maintenance NCO. A lot of cursing, a lot of hard lessons to learn. He would always tell me what I need to hear, not what I wanted to hear."
Sometimes, Winbush's tough love included letting Wright fall and make mistakes. And when Wright screwed up, unbeknownst to him, Winbush would talk to his first sergeant or commander — not to get Wright off the hook, but to ask his leaders not to give up on the young airman.
"He would say, give him whatever he deserves, letter of counseling, letter of reprimand," Wright said. "But he would assure them, 'I'm working on him, I got him.' To this day, he's still tough on me. Had it not been for him, I don't think I would have made it in the Air Force, and certainly I don't think I would have made it to where I am today."

The new chief's agenda
Today, there is no shortage of challenges facing the enlisted force. The biggest concern Wright sees is the punishing operations tempo enlisted airmen are working under with limited resources, and the resulting drag on morale.
"The fact is, we ask our airmen to do a lot with a lot less people, and a lot smaller budgets," Wright said. "Being a young airman or a young NCO in the Air Force is tough."
It's especially tough for young NCOs who have to do their primary job and then also have to supervise a handful of other young airmen, all while balancing their family needs, deployments, and other requirements such as professional military education, he said.
The active-duty Air Force is slated to grow from 317,000 airmen — both officers and enlisted — to 321,000 by the end of this year, which is an improvement over the 311,000 at the beginning of fiscal 2016. But that's still close to historically high-end strength levels and is far less than the more than 510,000 active-duty airmen during the Gulf War.
And while the Air Force is short staffed, it has no shortage of missions — daily operations in Iraq and Syria supporting the mission to fight the Islamic State, ongoing operations in Afghanistan, the need to support Eastern European allies wary of a resurgent Russia, and countering an emboldened China.
That isn't likely to change anytime soon, Wright said. And while the Air Force wants to eventually grow to 350,000, that's still years away from happening. So the Air Force needs to find ways to ease the burden on airmen tasked with those fights, and help their families cope with challenges such as frequent deployments by making them more "resilient."
Wright said the Air Force has several programs to help airmen and their families, but they might need to be better coordinated to work more effectively.
But even airmen who aren't dealing with deployments will still have challenges — a bad supervisor, or a pass over for the next promotion, or other problems — and they'll need to learn resiliency too, Wright said.
"It happens to all of us," Wright said. "These things are designed to help us grow, and as an airman, you have to be able to bounce back from that."
Wright said he doesn't have plans for new programs, but wants to "synthesize" existing programs to get them to better work together. He also wants to make sure airmen know what kind of programs are out there to help them and that it is OK to seek mental health services.
In high demand
The Air Force has long been concerned about high deployment rates, and in recent years has made progress in ensuring most airmen are home for at least twice as long as they were deployed before they are called up again.
But there are some highly in-demand career fields — such as those at Air Force Special Operations Command — that have been facing a 1:1 dwell-deploy ratio, meaning they're deployed about as long as they're home.
Easing the strain on such airmen will be tough, Wright said, because they have a "unique and specific skill set." Wright said the Air Force will need to talk more to commands in the Army, Navy and Marine Corps that have similar skill sets and are facing similar challenges, to get new ideas on how to handle it.
Wright also wants to focus on improving the Air Force's training. That could include getting rid of unnecessary training to allow airmen to better concentrate on what matters, as well as taking advantage of technology, such as for "virtual" training.
Better training will be key to achieving Chief of Staff Gen. Dave Goldfein's desire to overhaul how Air Force squadrons operate, Wright said.
"I don't think we get to be the greatest Air Force that ever existed without being really well-trained," Wright said. "As the boss focuses on revitalizing the squadron, I think you can give the commander more responsibility, more authority, you can give him more resources, but if the airmen in the squadron aren't well-trained, they won't be able to perform their mission."
Leadership development is another area of interest for Wright.
"How can we get the right airman in the right job at the right time with the right experience, and the right attitude?" Wright said. "It comes down to managing talent. Not only do those airmen need to be well-trained, they need to be well-led. Well-trained, well-led, resilient airmen will be the goal."
Wright said he thinks the new enlisted evaluation system — a major effort during Cody's tenure — is working as intended, and was the right move.
"I think it's fair, I think it allows folks a broad range of opportunities to advance, to get promoted, to be recognized, to receive decorations, all things that were pretty limited under our old system," Wright said. "When I wasn't getting promoted, I wasn't happy with the system, so there are some folks that [may not like it]. I do hear some feedback about, we still have some issues with the performance ratings, and some folks are still far to the right [receiving ratings that may be inflated]. We need to figure out a way to get everybody thinking the same way with respect to the performance ratings."

About a year and a half from now — three years after the new performance system went in place — the Air Force will take a look at it to see how it's going.
Wright said he also has heard complaints from some that it has led to favoritism. He said he's "not naïve enough" to think that never happens, but that in most cases, it's subconscious favoritism.
"Those are real problems, so I think we as senior leaders owe it to our airmen that the chiefs and the other senior NCOs are aware of those biases, and are aware of the perception that there is favoritism, and they understand the importance of being as objective as possible, and not whether you like the person," Wright said.
Return of warrants?
Wright is happy with how the effort to allow enlisted airmen to fly the unarmed RQ-4 Global Hawk remotely piloted aircraft is going so far. And he thinks that, eventually, the range of aircraft enlisted airmen can fly will be expanded even further, to armed MQ-1 Predators and MQ-9 Reapers — and perhaps even to flying manned aircraft.
"We have airmen that are perfectly capable of flying, not just other RPA systems and dropping ordnance, but that are perfectly capable of flying manned aircraft," Wright said. "Many of them have private pilot's licenses. I don't know that it will happen on my watch, but I think that's the natural progression. We have some brilliant young minds in our Air Force that are perfectly capable of flying manned aircraft."
Wright said he's "a little torn," because part of him thinks an enlisted airman who is talented enough to fly a manned aircraft deserves an officer's commission.
And Wright said it's worth taking a look at reviving the warrant officer program to handle enlisted pilots, as well as other specialized fields. But he said it will require more study to see if it makes sense for the Air Force, and that he doesn't now have a position for or against warrant officers.
The 'unfiltered' truth
Wright is planning a series of trips to bases around the world over the next few months, beginning with his first week in office, to talk to enlisted airmen face-to-face and find out what's on their minds. He also plans to continue Cody's practice of holding Chief Chats — town hall-style meetings where the chief takes questions from enlisted airmen, that are then posted on YouTube.
And Wright said he plans to be active on social media platforms such as Facebook to get feedback from airmen.
"I'm all about access," he said. "I plan to be very open and accessible."
It's important to hear honest thoughts from enlisted airmen, he said — even if those thoughts might make those airmen's leaders uncomfortable.
Chelsea has a 10-point lead in the Premier League with six games to go
Premier League leaders Chelsea are overachieving when wages are compared to league position in the top flight.
The Blues (£192.7m) have the third-highest wage bill behind Manchester United (£215m) and Manchester City (£205m).
Those figures come after top-flight clubs posted their accounts for the 2013-14 season.
The period also includes the first season of the £3bn television rights deal between 2013-14 and 2015-16.
Southampton is the biggest overachievers as they have the 16th-highest wage bill but are seventh in the Premier League.
QPR, who are 19th, are the biggest underachievers as their wage bill from last season in the Championship is the eighth-highest when compared to their top-flight rivals.
Overall, however, the figures show a close correlation between total salary bill and league position, with the current top four in the Premier League also the four biggest spenders on players' wages.
A recent report by Deloitte also noted that Premier League clubs generated their first pre-tax profit in 15 years by making £190m in 2013-14.
VIDEO=> Angry Muslims Beat Man Bloody Outside Holy Mosque for Honking His Horn
Muslims at a mosque at Austin Perdana, Johor Baru left their Friday service to beat a motorist who was honking his horn outside.

The Star reported:
Two videos of an altercation outside a mosque at Austin Perdana, Johor Baru on Friday afternoon are going viral. The incident is said to have sparked when a man driving a white car honked repeatedly outside a mosque during prayer time because his car was blocked by vehicles parked on both sides of the road. After prayers, it is believed that a group of men emerged from the mosque to confront the driver of the car. In videos captured by bystanders, some men are seen kicking and hitting the car. The driver then reverses the car suddenly in an attempt to escape the crowd, almost hitting a man standing near the car. The men shout at the driver and then start bashing the rear car windshield with a helmet and orange road cone, breaking it. The driver then steps out of his car, only to be attacked by the large group of men.
The worshippers were filled with the spirit.
Here's the video:

That's exactly what the folks at Bristol Motor Speedway have been doing for the past few years. And today, the Battle at Bristol - a neutral-site college football game between Tennessee and Virginia Tech scheduled for September 10, 2016 - is announcing a title sponsorship with Pilot Flying J and a broadcast partnership with ESPN/ABC.
Jerry Caldwell, the executive vice president and general manager of Bristol Motor Speedway, says the first conversations about staging the Battle at Bristol began as long ago as 1997, making it a game nearly twenty years in the making by the time the teams take the field next year.
That's not the history-making aspect of the game, however. The Pilot Flying J Battle at Bristol is expected to shatter the current college football attendance record - set in 2013 at Michigan Stadium in a Michigan-Notre Dame matchup with 115,109 in attendance - with a projected attendance of 150,000.
"One of the reasons we really liked this partnership knew this would be the largest football game ever played," said Whitney Johnson, Pilot Flying J's director of brand and customer experience.
"We felt like it would be a yearlong event we could capitalize on. We're kicking it off with our employee announcement [today], and next year we'll do something around the Super Bowl. We'll leverage both the [Sprint Cup Series] races at Bristol next year, and we'll do activations on campus at Tennessee and Virginia Tech."
The connection between Pilot Flying J and the game goes beyond the expected attendance record, however. As it turns out, it's just as much about the teams involved in the game.
“We likely wouldn't be sitting here today if I had not been given the opportunity to play college football for the Tennessee Volunteers. That experience had a significant impact on my life, teaching me valuable life lessons that provided me with the foundation to be a successful businessman,” said Jim Haslam II, founder and chairman, Pilot Flying J.
In addition to the connection to the University of Tennessee, Johnson points out that Pilot's roots are in Virginia, where Pilot was founded in Gate City in 1958 - just 30 miles from Bristol Motor Speedway. Between the two states, Pilot Flying J has 43 locations.
"It's a great area of the country for us," said Johnson.
Pilot Flying J's sponsorship will complement its current sponsorship of NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Michael Annett's No. 46 car.
"We've always entertained customers and employees at Bristol and other NASACAR events," said Johnson.
She emphasized the employee-centric culture at Pilot Flying J, saying "Any time we think about partnerships or sponsorships, we think about how we can leverage this as an employee incentive or for employee morale."
Johnson says the company will host several hundred employees and several hundred customers at the game next September.
The title sponsorship is also a chance for the company to refocus their marketing strategy. Pilot engaged in very little marketing prior to its merger with Flying J in 2010 - a landmark for the company because Flying J was its biggest competitor. Pilot Flying J is now the 8th-largest privately-held company in the world, according to Forbes' latest rankings.
For their part, the event organizers at Bristol Motor Speedway say they'll be keeping the number of sponsors for the game limited in order to provide the highest value to their partners.
"With a game of this magnitude, we wanted to be careful with the way we treated our partners and allow those coming on to have the most exposure and use this amazing event the right way."
Pilot Flying J will have the opportunity to engage with fans at the racetrack throughout the 2016 NASCAR season leading up to the football game. Throughout the company's 650 retail locations across North America there will also be unique in-store retail promotions and displays leveraging the partnership.
Title sponsorships like this are increasingly important for neutral-site college football games, which must offer payouts lucrative enough to convince one team to give up a home game. USA Today reported each team can make $4.3 million if tickets sell out. There's also the expense of converting the speedway to a college football field, which will begin immediately following the August 20th NASCAR race at Bristol.
In addition to announcing the title sponsorship, the Pilot Flying J Battle at Bristol also announced today that ESPN/ABC has signed on to be its broadcast partner. The game time will be announced at a later date.
Archaeologists and scientists of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens are to study 1,070 skeletons found at Faliro, dating from around 2500 BC.
The skeletons — that archaeologists believe belong to captives or slaves since they were found in shackles — were dug out of the ancient cemetery at Faliro, a southeastern seaside suburb of Athens. This is the largest and most extensive necropolis of the ancient world, among the most important antiquities found ever. Archaeologists believe that by “decoding” the skeletons and their identity, they will learn important things about ancient Athenians.
The skeletons are carefully preserved and guarded in the premises of the American School of Classical Studies in central Athens. Researchers have started the study of hundreds of thousands of bones.
The colossal project that will cost about one million euros is funded by American and Greek individuals. There are 1,300 crates containing bones of humans, equine and other creatures. It will take scientists and archaeologists at least six years to examine, study and preserve the 1,070 “Captives of Phaleron” as they have named them. Many of the skeletons were found with their hands tied to their backs and with the faces in the soil. The researchers will have to find out why they were tied, how they died or how they were killed, why they were buried together, what relation they had with each other, where they come from, if they were Greeks or foreigners, if they were Athenians, if they were slaves of prisoners of war and why they were killed, answering to as many questions as possible.
After answering all these questions, archaeologists will be able to draw conclusions about life in Athens in the period between the 8th and the 5th century BC.
Palin called attacks like Bashir's 'par for the course.' Palin's first comments on Bashir
Sarah Palin on Thursday dismissed the attacks of former MSNBC host Martin Bashir, saying in her first comments since his resignation that she's “used to it.”
“At this point, I'm used to it. That's kind of a sad state of affairs to have to admit that I am used to it,” Palin said on Fox News's “Fox & Friends.”
Story Continued Below
She called attacks like Bashir's “par for the course.”
( Also on POLITICO: Martin Bashir's original comments to Sarah Palin)
Bashir quit on Wednesday for comments he made on his Nov. 15 broadcast during which he called Sarah Palin “a world class idiot” and referenced a diary of a former plantation manager who forced a slave to defecate in another slave's mouth, adding Palin would be an “outstanding candidate” for such treatment.
However, Palin praised the media for criticizing Bashir's remarks.
“It was refreshing to see though, that many in the media did come out and say, ‘Look our standards have got to be higher than this,'” Palin said. “Those with that platform, with a microphone, a camera in their face, they have to have some more responsibility taken.”
( PHOTOS: Sarah Palin's career)
When asked whether Bashir's resignation was enough, Palin said she has to move past it.
“My role is to accept his apology and to [be] humble enough to accept it and move on,” Palin said, referring to Bashir's on-air apology during his Nov. 18 broadcast.
Palin said five or six years ago, she would have been “personally hurt” but now acknowledges that “attacks will come your way” and she feels “kind of calloused.”
Echoing her response to Bashir's comments and apology last month, Palin added that those attacks are usually targeted toward conservative women and said there is an “obvious” double standard.
( Also on POLITICO: Bashir resigns from MSNBC)
“As I've said before, the target of the attack is usually more significant than what the attack, the articulated words used, actually are and that's part of that double standard,” Palin said, adding that she hasn't heard from any feminist groups or organizations.

It took a trip to Ecuador for NYCFC to know for sure they had a special homegrown prospect on their hands.
James Sands, just 16 years old, with not a professional minute to his name, started for NYCFC against Emelec on Feb. 8 in one of South America's most hostile environments, the newly renovated Estadio George Capwell, in front of 40,000 screaming and jeering fans. Friendly match or not, it's the type of atmosphere that can shake the calmest vets, but Sands didn't look the least bit fazed.
“[That game] helped me a lot,” Sands told The Post. “I think all you can do is just learn from it, and I think it really helped me to the point where I'm at today.”
Sands' performance – considered one of the best on the night by NYCFC sporting director Claudio Reyna – showed a calm and maturity is not common in teenage players. It allowed Sands, a defender, to showcase his technical ability, enough to give NYCFC confidence he could play with the first team. And it became one of the reasons why, on Wednesday, Sands became the first NYCFC academy player to sign a homegrown contract with the team.
“It's a dream come true for me,” said Sands, a native of Rye, NY. “Ever since I was little, just in my backyard up until today, I've always been hoping to start my pro career, especially to do it at a club like [NYCFC].”
Part of Sands' growth and readiness comes from training at the United States Under-17 residency program in Bradenton, Fla., where he went for the spring semester — he previously attended the Brunswick School in Greenwich, Conn. — to hone his game ahead of the U-17 World Cup in India this October. NYCFC knew they couldn't risk exposing him to the scouts at the World Cup without having him signed, so the timing of Wednesday's pact, right before summer, made sense for everyone.
“Speaking to his parents, speaking to James, we had a pretty good feeling he wanted to stay in New York,” Reyna told The Post. “He wanted to stay close to home, he wanted to be part of our club and have Patrick [Vieira] as a coach and work with our coaching staff.”
Reyna described Sands as “self-critical” and a perfectionist. That mentality partially can be attributed to his stay at the US residency program. Sands also praised NYCFC's academy, which he joined in 2015, for getting him ready to sign an MLS deal.
The coaching in the academy emulates the philosophies and style employed by first-team head coach Patrick Vieira, and with Sands' experience and ability, the jump into NYCFC's starting eleven could come quick.
“He's got a very mature head on his shoulders,” Reyna said. “He's very, very excited. He wants to compete. He wants to play, and all of us together are going to help him and make sure he goes through this journey with us supporting him. We're confident he'll manage any situation and any pressure that he may get thrown at him.”
He will start training immediately with NYCFC stars such as David Villa and Maxi Moralez (he cites Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure as his favorite player). Sands, who doesn't turn 17 until July, said he is relishing the opportunity to soak in all the knowledge he can.
“When you look at the staff, you have Patrick [Vieria], who played the position that I played at such a high level,” said Sands, referring to his defensive, holding midfield role. “I think learning from him every day will help me develop. I'm excited to see how much I can develop under him.”
Sands is expected to be away for much of the summer due to his commitment to the United States U-17 team, but Reyna didn't rule out the possibility of Sands making his NYCFC debut this summer.
“You know, ever since I started with the club, I think my ultimate goal has been to play with the first team,” Sands said. “I think I'm ready to do that now.”
Washington (CNN) The massive hack that may have stolen the personal information of four million federal employees appears designed to build a vast database in what could be preparation for future attacks by China against the U.S., cybersecurity experts advising the government told CNN Friday afternoon.
Law enforcement officials also said Friday that the hack appears to have been carried out by the same Chinese hackers who attacked Anthem Insurance earlier this year, in which information on tens of millions of customers was stolen.
U.S. officials believe the breach, which was revealed Thursday and affected current and former federal workers from nearly every government agency, could be the biggest ever of the government's computer networks.
"The extent of personal data stolen makes this attack an order of magnitude greater than any we have seen of its kind in the past," said California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee who was briefed on the attack.
China has called the allegation that it was behind the attack irresponsible. But the experts said that the goal behind the attack is to build a database of federal employees -- using the stolen personal information to fool and impersonate government workers -- to set up future "insider" attacks. By revealing who has security clearances and at what level, the Chinese may now be able to identify, expose and blackmail U.S. government officials around the world, the experts added.
The connection between the hacking attack and the Anthem incident was first reported by The New York Times.

The cybersecurity experts added that some government agencies have not been following the government's own best practices for cybersecurity, such as updating operating systems with the latest protections.
The Office of Personnel Management, which is conducting background checks, warned it was urging potential victims to monitor their financial statements and get new credit reports.
Federal employees lash out
Some federal employees took to Facebook to express their displeasure.
"Unreal, I don't have enough money as it is," Facebook user Shari Saeler posted on the Office of Personnel Management's page. "Now I have to worry about someone stealing it!"
Retiree Linda Eleanor Rigby Robbins posted she didn't know if she was affected.
"I do not understand why I heard this on the news instead of via letter or email from OPM," she wrote.
George Thomas, who works as an analyst at the Smithsonian Institute, said he felt his employer had done its job in trying to keep his personal information safe. But Thomas also said that in the fast-changing world of technology, it can be difficult for employers to stay ahead of hackers and information breaches.
"It's an uphill battle," Thomas said.
The breach was initially thought to have affected the Office of Personnel Management and the Department of Interior, but government officials said hackers hit nearly every federal government agency.
An assessment continues, and it is possible millions more government employees may be affected.
U.S. investigators: We believe this was China's work
U.S. investigators believe they can trace the breach to the Chinese government. The Chinese Foreign Ministry neither confirmed nor denied its involvement in the hack, simply pointing out it too has been a victim of cyberattacks in the past.
"China itself is also a victim of cyberattacks," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Friday in Beijing. "China resolutely tackles cyberattack activities in all forms."
He added that China would like to have more global cooperation "to build a peaceful and safe, open and collaborative cyberspace."
And he also called on the United States not to make groundless accusations about China's involvement "but instead add more trust and cooperating in this field."
A spokesman from the Chinese Embassy in Washington late Thursday objected to allegations that the Chinese government may be behind the massive hack.
"Cyberattacks conducted across countries are hard to track, and therefore the source of attacks is difficult to identify. Jumping to conclusions and making (a) hypothetical accusation is not responsible and counterproductive," Zhu Haiquan said.
EINSTEIN detection system
Employees of the legislative and judicial branches and uniformed military personnel were not affected.
There are 2.7 million federal executive branch employees. It's unclear whether the breach affected all of them, along with former employees, or only a portion of them.
The federal personnel office learned of the data breach after it began to toughen its cybersecurity defense system. When it discovered malicious activity, authorities used a detection system called EINSTEIN to unearth the information breach in April, the Department of Homeland Security said.

"We take all potential threats to public and private sector systems seriously and will continue to investigate and hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace," the FBI said in a statement.
The federal personnel office said "personally identifiable information" had been breached, though the office didn't name who might be responsible.
Senator: The breach is 'disturbing'
Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, called the breach "disturbing" and said the Office of Personnel Management needs to do a better job securing its information.
"It is disturbing to learn that hackers could have sensitive personal information on a huge number of current and former federal employees -- and, if media reports are correct, that information could be in the hands of China," Johnson said in a statement. "(The office) says it 'has undertaken an aggressive effort to update its cybersecurity posture.' Plainly, it must do a better job, especially given the sensitive nature of the information it holds."
U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said hackers are one of the "greatest challenges we face on a daily bases."
"It's clear that a substantial improvement in our cyber databases and defenses is perilously overdue," Schiff said in a statement. "That's why the House moved forward on cybersecurity legislation earlier this year, and it's my hope that this latest incident will spur the Senate to action."
And former Arkansas governor and 2016 Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee blasted the Obama administration in a statement over what he felt were inadequate precautions taken to protect the personal data of millions of federal workers.
"What will it take for the White House to do its job? What will it take for the Obama administration to wake up and defend America?" he asked. "The lack of common sense in this White House is beyond breathtaking."
At a press briefing earlier Friday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, citing the ongoing investigation, declined to discuss specific details about the attack. But he blamed Congress for not doing enough to pass laws that would enhance cybersecurity.
"We need the United States Congress to come out of the Dark Ages and actually join us here in the 21st century to make sure that we have the kinds of defenses that are necessary to protect a modern computer system," he said.
SPRECKLES, California — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) vowed Wednesday to ban the practice of fracking throughout the United States if he becomes president.
“If I win, we are going to ban fracking all across this country,” Sanders said during a morning press conference at the Spreckles Veterans Memorial Building in a rural farming community in Monterey County.
“Fracking not only threatens our water supply, it pollutes the air supply. it contributes to climate change, it is highly explosive and it has resulted in more earthquakes, something Californians know a little bit about,” Sanders added. He noted that Vermont was the first state to ban the practice and New York was the second to follow suit, but lamented that nothing has yet happened in California or the rest of the United States.
Gov. Jerry Brown has come under pressure from his own Democratic Party for allowing fracking to take place in the Golden State. On Tuesday, Brown endorsed Hillary Clinton for president over Sanders in an open letter he penned and posted to his website. He said he was “deeply impressed with how well Bernie Sanders has done.”
Asked by Breitbart News if Sanders has discussed with Brown his position on fracking, Sanders said “no.” Asked if he intends to, he said “I hope to. Yes.”
In his speech, Sanders pointed out that “Secretary Clinton and I obviously have many differences of opinions on many issues. But on the issue of fracking, our differences are pretty profound.” He said that while she wants to regulate it, Sanders wants to ban tracking altogether in the United States. “As Secretary of State, she actively pushed the fracking technology in other countries throughout the planet.”
Sanders' Latino Outreach Coordinator said she has visited “majority Latino schools near oil fields where fracking and other extreme extraction have taken place The students suffer from nose bleeds, asthma, headaches and unusual forms of cancer.” She referred to the practice of fracking as “environmental racism.”
“The fight against fracking is a fight for environmental justice. And enough is enough. “¡Si se puede con Bernie Sanders!” she exclaimed (which means “Yes we can with Bernie Sanders!” in Spanish).
Racial inequality and environmental issues have often intersected in Sanders's rhetoric. On Monday, he touched upon the issue of “the transport of coal and other pollutants … being transferred through African-American and impoverished communities,” as opposed to the suburbs, during his Oakland community town hall at the predominantly black Allen Temple Baptist Church.
“I think everyone here knows that in low-income communities, in African-American communities, there is a heck of a lot of pollution going on. The number of children dealing with asthma, you've got that here as well?” he asked the audience.
Sanders said: “The Democratic Party should make it absolutely clear that they stand with the American people to ban fracking. I would hope that the Democratic National Committee makes it clear that it is on the side of the American people, of the minority community that most experiences the effects” of this practice.
Later in the day, Sanders spoke to an enthusiastic crowd in Palo Alto, California:

Paris, France August 4th, 2017—Powered by Ethereum smart contracts, Dether is a revolutionary new way for anyone on Earth to buy ether using cash and spend it at physical stores nearby. Unlike existing solutions, a user doesn't need a bank account, only a mobile phone with internet access.
While the Ethereum blockchain opens the doors to a trustless digital world where its applications don't have any kind of censorship, fraud or third party interference, its hurdle is mass adoption. Buying ether is currently a long and difficult process. Dether wants to change that.
For the first time, a decentralized application (Dapp) is creating a worldwide ecosystem of ether buyers, sellers and physical stores willing to trade ether for fiat cash and accept it as a means of payment.
Creating a peer-to-peer bridge between fiat currency and Ethereum cryptocurrency
With Dether, any ether owner can become a teller and have an accessible way to make money. Ether sellers can become mobile ATMs by being on the Dether map and selling ether for fiat currency anywhere in the world at any time.
Users interested in buying ether can discover ether sellers near them on the Dether map, the app's built-in location system. Users can view a seller's ether/fiat rate and fees and chat anonymously via an encrypted peer-to-peer messaging solution to agree on the trading conditions and the meeting point to carry out the exchange.
On the Dether map, users can even locate physical stores that accept ether as a means of payment, or who wish to trade ether for cash. This represents a unique opportunity for merchants. As Ethereum popularity explodes across the globe, more and more businesses are accepting ether.
“Our mission is to break barriers to foster Ethereum mass adoption,” said Hamid Benyahia, Dether co-founder. Frustrated at the fact that his family members in Algeria, restricted by the Algerian dinar, weren't able to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, he searched for a solution that would make Ethereum accessible to anyone on Earth. Dether was born.
A fully decentralized solution that brings more security to buyers and sellers
Unlike existing solutions, Dether has a technology roadmap that integrates different key elements of decentralization on each integrated feature, in order to propel Dether towards full decentralization. No central entity has any control over the user's accounts, funds, conversations etc. Conversations are fully decentralized and peer-to-peer. No funds are held, and users are anonymous.
“From its outset, we envisioned and built Dether to be a fully decentralized solution,” said Mehdi Amari, Dether co-founder. “We strongly believe that having a trustless solution is the key to Dether's success. Users must be able to exchange and trade with one another with trust, despite not knowing each other beforehand. In other words, we've decided to align our strategy with blockchain's core principles, where the power of its users, and not a central entity, determines its success.”
Powered by Ethereum smart contracts, the reputation system is also fully decentralized. Buyers and sellers have their own public reputation rating based on the transactions they have successfully achieved and their volume of transactions.
From the Arab Spring to a decentralized peer-to-peer ether network.
“I remembered the huge demonstrations that happened in North Africa and the Middle East back in 2011. I thought that if these populations had had the chance back then to have a decentralized social network, for example, it would have prevented a lot of activists from going to prison, as they were constantly identified through social media. And when I look at all of the decentralized applications that are being developed on top of Ethereum, it only consolidates my initial idea that more and more people will use it, and that one of its challenges is mass adoption,” said Hamid.
For months, a team of eight Blockchain and Ethereum enthusiasts have been working on Dether. The team will release an alpha version this summer and is already looking for testers. Users will be able to create their Dether Wallet, communicate anonymously with each other and start trading together.

News Release 16-024
Accelerating discovery in materials science
NSF funds platform to speed the development of new materials -- and ultimately new technologies
The surface of bismuth selenide film.
March 4, 2016
This material is available primarily for archival purposes. Telephone numbers or other contact information may be out of date; please see current contact information at media contacts.
A new Materials Innovation Platforms (MIPs) program that aims to significantly accelerate materials research and development has made its first awards, to Penn State University and Cornell University.
The institutions will serve as "platforms" to develop new bulk and thin film crystalline hard materials through state-of-the-art instrumentation. They will foster an environment that combines multidisciplinary expertise with the best tools available, providing access to the instrumentation, data and new materials created.
The Cornell University award is a multi-institution effort in collaboration with Johns Hopkins University, Clark Atlanta University and Princeton University.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) will provide up to $25 million over the next five years to support the platforms, with each eligible for a one-time, five-year renewal. The platforms, which add to NSF's portfolio of mid-scale infrastructure and instrumentation, will advance a focused research area of national importance and expand access beyond traditional user facilities.
"We see the platforms as pushing the frontiers in materials research," said Fleming Crim, NSF assistant director for mathematical and physical sciences (MPS). "In its first call for proposals, NSF is focusing on crystal growth because the U.S. has fallen behind in this area of science after having been a global leader in material synthesis, which is essential for advancing basic materials research and will add to the important investment the foundation is making in mid-scale instrumentation."
The MPS mid-scale research infrastructure program, begun over the last few years to meet critical research needs, has received strong support from the community.
"MIPs will serve as focal points that promote cross-fertilization of ideas between internal and external researchers, thanks to their unique convergence of expertise," said Linda Sapochak, acting director for NSF's Materials Research Division. "To accelerate research outcomes, the platforms will focus on a targeted material grand challenge and/or technological outcome that addresses a national priority. Along with the discovery of new materials, research conducted at a MIP will lead to the understanding of new materials phenomena."
The platforms program was inspired by the paradigm the administration set forth in its Materials Genome Initiative. Launched in 2011, the initiative seeks to "discover, manufacture and deploy advanced materials in half the time and at a fraction of the cost."
The MIPs program will enable researchers using the platforms to develop new materials, new techniques and the next generation of instrumentation that will lead to understanding and discovering all kinds of new phenomena. Additionally, the processes used by these platforms will move between theory, measurement and actual fabrication with the aim of accelerating discovery of new materials in half the time.
The science will accelerate the development of technologies in a wide range of areas, such as microelectronics, fuel and solar cells and new biomaterials, generating economic gains for the nation. The effort is data-intensive and researchers not directly involved with the platform will also have access to, and benefit from, the generated data.
The awardees will act as "nexus of activity" for a focused research theme, where platforms are equipped with user facilities. Researchers from across the nation who also engage in this area of research will be able to use these resources to accelerate their own work. Access to the platform is free to academic users and includes not just instrumentation, but also expertise in synthesis, characterization, and theory/modeling/simulation. Additionally, the platforms will enable researchers to work in new ways, fostering new approaches to multidisciplinary education and training.
"Without question, one of the most exciting aspects to these awards will be to see just how quickly these platforms can accelerate the pace of materials development," said Sean L. Jones, NSF materials research program director. "The awards are fairly complementary to one another and accelerate research in two distinct material systems likely to have a significant impact on technology as they transform the field at the most fundamental level."
Cornell University's focus on 2-D materials with PARADIM
Cornell's Platform for the Accelerated Realization, Analysis, and Discovery of Interface Materials (PARADIM) will focus primarily on oxide and oxide-based two-dimensional films on new substrates -- physical materials meant for next generation electronics. Researchers using the platform will search for "new materials" where the combination of 2-D materials coupled with novel substrates will yield new phenomena, such as smaller, faster, smarter computer chips. More information about this platform is available here.
Penn State University's focus on material development with improved electronic properties
Using Penn State University's platform, researchers will study metal chalcogenide materials, which include sulfides, selenides and tellurides. Metal chalcogenides have become quite popular for a range of technical applications, including digital circuits and flexible electronics. Called the Two-Dimensional Crystal Consortium (2DCC), the new facility at Penn State will foster the growth of a national community of users who develop new materials for next-generation electronics that are faster, use less energy, and can be built on flexible substrates, as well as other applications. More information about this platform is available here.

Scrabble board Scoreboard Scrambled words (see below)
Prep
Poster-print or blow-up the Scrabble board to stick on the blackboard. Prepare lists of scrambled words from the appropriate vocab list. I usually make about 40 cards for each group.
Pick the vocab depending on how far through the year you are. I can't give you sets for every eventuality, so best to just use this blank template and scramble them up yourself. Just for your convenience, here are sets for the start of second grade and the start of third grade.
Execution
Make groups of four students, Use the big board to explain to the class how scrabble works, Hand out the packs of scrambled words (one each group), Give each group a game board and score board, Have them unscramble one word each, and then write it on the game board, After writing their word, they must use the key on the scoreboard to add up their score, The Highest score at the end of the game wins.
Different versions of this game are floating around ELT/ALT circles, but this one is wholly original to this site, and arguably much easier for kids to understand. So there!Everyone knows Scrabble, right? Well this is a combination of that and a word scramble. Hence the name.It can last up to the whole lesson with some classes, or you may want to set a time limit and see who has the most points after that.Here's how to set it up and play.(Click to download, but as always bear in mind that Google Doc's will mess with the formatting.

Nearly four centuries ago Isaac Newton demonstrated that a glass prism could separate white light into all the colors of a rainbow. Now a Switzerland-based team of electrical engineers has built a device that can do something similar for sound—splitting noise into its constituent frequencies by physical means only.
The so-called acoustic prism comprises a 40-centimeter-long hollow aluminum case with a series of 10 holes on its side. Within, flexible polymer membranes divide the case into chambers. These barriers vibrate and transmit sound to neighboring cavities with a delay that depends on a sound wave's frequency. When the delayed waves escape from the holes, they are refracted in different directions so that waves with the lowest frequencies (comparable to red light) can be heard at the end nearest to the source, whereas higher frequencies (comparable to blue light) are refracted farther down the device. “This mimics how a water droplet or glass prism refracts each color of light at different angles,” says Hussein Esfahlani, who studies signal processing at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne. The device's design was recently published in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America.
The prism began as a thought experiment according to Esfahlani, but in practical terms it could be used to separate meaningful frequencies from incoming white noise or to determine precisely where a specific frequency is coming from. “This is a very elegant and efficient way for distinguishing sound frequencies,” says Nicholas Fang, a professor of mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was not involved in the project.
During Monday afternoon's no-camera, audio only press briefing, CNN's senior White House correspondent Jim Acosta interrupted other reporters twice to question White House press secretary Sean Spicer about why the briefing wasn't being broadcast live.
“We should turn the cameras on, Sean. Why don't we turn the cameras on? Why don't we turn the cameras on?” Acosta asked, talking over another reporter's question. “Why don't we turn the cameras on, Sean? They're in the room, the lights are on.”
But Spicer refused to acknowledge Acosta or his question, which prompted the CNN reporter to post a series of tweets about the off-camera briefings, saying the move is an attempt to “get the coverage without the accountability.”
Like the off camera briefing, this is an attempt to get the coverage without the accountability. https://t.co/VFrEsmx4W5 — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) June 26, 2017
No cameras allowed at today's briefing so here's your sock update. pic.twitter.com/3eluwr77Sf — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) June 26, 2017
I asked Spicer if we could turn the cameras on at today's briefing. He ignored the question. — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) June 26, 2017
Just a few minutes later, another reporter asked if the off-camera briefings will be the new normal, to which Spicer responded, “We'll see.”
Acosta interrupted again, asking why the cameras were off, as Spicer called on Trey Yingst, from the One America News Network.
“You are a taxpayer-funded spokesman for the United States, can you give us an explanation to why the cameras are off? It's a legitimate question,” Acosta said, as Yingst asked Spicer, to “get this out of the way” and address why the cameras are off.
“Some days we'll have them, some days we won't. The President's going to speak in the Rose Garden today, I want the President's voice to carry the day today, and I think, so look, this is nothing inconsistent from what we had since day one,” Spicer said.
Appearing on CNN with host Ana Cabrera after the briefing, Acosta said the White House hasn't taken a question from CNN for several weeks, calling the off-camera briefings an “erosion” of traditions in Washington.
“Make no mistake, this is a gradual erosion of the exceptions of the traditions that have been in place in this city for about a quarter of a century now, that these briefings be held on camera,” he said.
Guatemala first participated at the Olympic Games in 1952, but then missed the next three Olympiads. Guatemala has sent athletes to compete in every Summer Olympic Games since 1968. The nation has participated in the Winter Olympic Games once, in 1988.
Guatemala won its first Olympic medal sixty years after its first Olympic appearance, during the 2012 Summer Olympics, when Erick Barrondo took second place in the men's 20 km walk.[1] This makes Guatemala notable as one of the only countries with more Nobel laureates than Olympic medalists.[2]
The National Olympic Committee for Guatemala was created in 1947 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee that same year.

The Sheaf has learned that a case of tuberculosis has been identified on campus. The Saskatoon Health Region has taken control of the situation.
One student has been removed from campus for treatment and the health region now has a list of that student's classmates and professors and is working to contact them.
“Control of tuberculosis hinges on prevention, finding and providing supervised treatment of new cases, and educating the public,” reads the health region's website.
Tuberculosis is a relatively common and dangerous disease that is transmitted through inhalation of bacteria coughed or sneezed by someone infected.
Only 10 per cent of those infected with the disease show symptoms. Symptoms can include fever, a severe cough and a loss of appetite.
If symptoms are left untreated, TB can be lethal up to 50 per cent of the time.
The Sheaf has reached out to university communications but as of this morning no one was available for comment.
Update 12:08 p.m.: The Sheaf has confirmed the student that has been identified to be infected is enrolled in Arts and Science classes.
Update 1:17 p.m.: The CBC is reporting that 600 students will have to be tested for TB. The tests will take place sometime next week.
For more information on tuberculosis outbreaks and treatment, visit the Saskatoon Health Region's website.

There have been leaps and bounds in development methodology and new, impressive localization management tools streamline a once very clunky path. Nevertheless,While localization should be considered before development commences, the real bulk of its work occurs after development. Being tied to development, localization teams try hard to remain as agile as possible; however, the requirements of agile development processes tend to conflict with the overall idea of localization. There's a topic for another blog.Localization is a costly, time-consuming process that often employs external help in the form of LSPs, or. Furthermore, third-party LSPs, having very little contact with developers, rely on written style guides and strict hand-off procedures to adapt to the development process. Localization teams end up working more with external LSPs and less with developers within their own company.Developers sometimes prefer working with other teams than localization as well, such as user experience or design. When a localization manager stops by a developer's workspace, it's typically to report an internationalization bug or complain about his or her concatenated strings. Then the developer has to put on hold whichever cool project he or she is working on, rewind to the old project where the internationalization bug resides and squash it.Being stuck in this nocuous duet has also caused a certain degree of stagnation, and the relationship has lost its flame. Besides changing from a linear to slightly overlapping model, not much has changed from the localization workflow of twenty years ago in regards to its relationship with development. Localization still lags behind its counterpart and then interrupts developers for help later on despite an otherwise lightweight agile development cycle.New localization technology tends to focus on improving project management and increasing internal communication. However, the vastly superior issue -- has been almost entirely overlooked.There was once a point in time when bad marriages always stayed together because thereno alternative. Similarly, because of development and localization's intertwined nature, they needed to stay together no matter what and just endure one another to achieve some degree of quality in a localized product.Products that regularly connect to a server for new content (such as with mobile apps or regularly updated software) can utilize cloud-based localization tools. With cloud-based technology, localized content can be stored and maintained apart from the development cycle. When a user sends a request to view localized content, that content is pulled directly from the cloud. Apart from internationalization and formatting issues that must be touched by developers, localized content can be created, tested, edited and maintained on its own schedule without the need for direct developer involvement. Thus, liberated developers no longer need to freeze their current projects to update localized content from a previous version or create new builds for testing.But that's not to say that development and localization can't and shouldn't remain friends. All things considered, they still need to work together especially when localization needs to be of utmost consideration as early on as (if not earlier than) development itself. One such example occurs when, or simultaneously releasing a product in multiple languages.What's changed is that now localization can work alongside development and complement one another while not interfering with each other's workflow or processes. Localization managers can create and test localized content directly without calling upon the help of a developer to create test builds. Additionally,While it's true that new localized version should be released with a new feature, typos, terminology updates and other edits can be deployed immediately, bypassing any developer eyes and app store updates. Rethinking the conventional position of localization within a development cycle can empower both developers and localizers to focus on their work in a mutual symbiotic relationship. Localization and development teams should be able to pass and greet each other in the office, smile and reflect on their past together, while at the same time, understand that the happiest and best solution for one another is to work individually, but remaining in sync with one another.

But the real focus of Ryan's new budget proposal, like his previous one, is to dramatically reduce spending. The effort starts with a plan to transform Medicare into a voucher scheme. Ryan and his supporters don't like the word "voucher" because it implies that Ryan's Medicare reforms would undermine the guarantee of comprehensive health benefits that Medicare has traditionally provided to America's seniors. But the implication is correct. As of 2024, people who reach retirement age would no longer get government insurance. Instead, they would get a voucher, which they would then use to buy insurance. Year after year, the voucher's value would rise at a pre-determined pace. And if the voucher weren't big enough to pay for decent benefits? The last Ryan budget never explained how such a scheme would protect seniors in those cases. The new Ryan budget doesn't either. Most likely, some if not most America's seniors would end up having to make up the difference on their own dime.
Ryan's proposed changes to Medicaid get far less attention. But those changes would be even more profound. Today, Medicaid guarantees a set of benefits to everybody who meets the program's eligibility requirements, and the federal government promises to pick up the majority of the funding, no matter the cost. Ryan's budget would end those guarantees. The federal government would write states a check, based on a pre-determined formula, and give states more flexibility over how to spend the money. Problem is, Ryan would also dramatically reduce the programs' funding. A 2012 analysis of Ryan's previous proposal, produced by the Kaiser Family Foundation and conducted by researchers at the Urban Institute, concluded that between 14 and 20 million people would lose health insurance as a result.
By the way, that figure doesn't include an additional 17 million people the researchers estimated would lose Medicaid—plus a roughly equal amount who would lose government-subsidized private insurance—because Ryan's budget assumes the unlikely repeal of Obamacare's coverage expansions.
All of this was in the last Ryan budget. The same goes for Ryan's proposal for food stamps, which now goes by the name Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP). Like his plan for Medicaid, Ryan wants to end its entitlement status and turn it into a block grant. As many as 10 million people would have lost food assistance under Ryan's last proposal, according to an analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Ryan also has renewed his call for much lower “discretionary spending,” which is spending that doesn't renew automatically like the entitlements do—think of food inspections, border control, housing assistance, pretty much any spending that requires regular congressional authorization. Ryan would protect defense spending from these cuts, meaning he needs larger cuts everywhere else. Last year I described Ryan's budget as “effectively eliminating” these discretionary-spending programs. In retrospect, that was overstated. It would merely devastate those programs. As Ezra Klein writes, “The real justification for Ryan's budget and the choices it makes is not fear of a debt crisis but fear of government.”
The report's distinct treatment of defense and non-defense spending is actually a great window into Ryan's fundamental philosophy. The section on defense spending has long passages about the importance of national security and the dangers of intemperate cuts. Rooting out waste is important, the document says, but it must be done carefully. The section on the social safety net has virtually no similar language. A reader unfamiliar with the reality of American life would have no idea that millions of Americans live in poverty—that they struggle, every day, to pay for bare necessities like gas, rent, and food. Of course, if "The Path to Prosperity" mentioned those things, readers might want to know what Ryan proposed to do about them. But Ryan doesn't propose meaningful substitutes for the support he'd take away. Instead, he puts his faith in the strength of individuals and communities to help those who struggle.
Once Avengers: Age of Ultron hits, the Marvel Cinematic Universe goes into Phase Three... and possibly the beginning of the end. The studio's biggest actors are under limited contracts, and those contracts will begin to expire in Phase Three. Chris Evans, for instance, has just two more movies left on his contract, and Captain America 3 will eat one of those up. Robert Downy Jr has one more film, and Chris Hemsworth is also entering the home stretch. Renegotiations can happen, but they would be costly and go against Marvel's general spirit of keeping things cheap.
Guardians of the Galaxy is the solution for Marvel; they've proven the brand is big enough that they can keep introducing new characters to take the places of older ones, and Phase Three will see Doctor Strange, Ant-Man and maybe Ms. Marvel trying to step in for the older franchises. But how does Marvel make the most of this changeover? Will all of the current Marvel franchises come to a basic end after Avengers 3?
Not exactly. Last week a rumor hit that Marvel was going to split Avengers 3 into two movies, and this would be how they would get around the ending of actors' contracts. I explained why that isn't possible, from a basic legal standpoint, but while doing some digging on this rumor I discovered it was closer to truth than I ever imagined. Marvel isn't spltting Avengers 3 into two movies, but they are planning Avengers 3 as the springboard to... something else. And they're going to use their biggest characters in that something else, keeping them out of Avengers 3.
Imagine an Avengers 3 without Thor or Captain America, maybe without Black Widow. It's a movie where the secondary characters from the MCU get to stand up and prove their worth, possibly even setting up their own spin-offs. With Guardians Marvel has shown that their brand is the star, and by the time we get to A3 clearly people will be on board with the entire universe. Keep Iron Man - Robert Downey Jr's renegotiated contract seems to specify Avengers 3 as his next film - and you have a new launching pad for characters to take over from the current big guns.
Storywise this is all easy to do - Cap will be very busy with the fallout of Captain America 3, and I wouldn't be shocked to see Steve Rogers give up the shield at the end of that movie. Thor 3 is going to wrap up all the Asgardian drama, and could very well end with Thor forced to sit on his father's throne. Black Widow is easy to write out on another adventure. Hulk... well, Hulk's planet of residence could well be up in the air by 2018 or so.
For the actors this is all good news. Chris Evans has been living in the Marvel Cinematic Universe non-stop for the last few years. A year off to pursue other projects could help soften him up for further negotiations. And this just whets the audience's appetite for what comes next, especially if what comes next hits theaters the very next year.
This next part is speculation, but what if the big guns sit out Avengers 3 so that Marvel can bring them in for a crossover movie? A huge, all-franchise crossover that could be called Marvel's Infinity Gauntlet or Marvel's Secret War? What if Avengers 3 isn't the conclusion of the Thanos story but just the spark that ignites it in the massive crossover film that brings all the Marvel characters - TV included - together in one film? That's the sort of next-level thinking we expect from the House of Cinematic Ideas at this point.
Like I said, that last bit is speculation, but the rest comes from sources close to the actors, who have been having scheduling discussions with Marvel. We're still a ways off from any of this being official, but this is all part of the plan that Kevin Feige and the creative committee hatched some time ago. I really think they're about to redefine blockbuster moviemaking again.
In other news, there is one (or many) vandals that have something against Toyota Prius hybrids in Petaluma, California. The Press Democrat reports that there has been six police reports of Prius hybrids being damaged in the past two weeks, and there might be cases that haven't been reported.
Five of the cars were parked on the West side of town, and in most cases a brick, hammer or rock was thrown through a window, while one time, a fender was dented. If you live in Petaluma and have a Prius, stay vigilant! And if you are in the area and know anything that could help with this case, you can let the police know at 778-4372. ::Vandals strike 6 hybrid cars, via ::Prius pillage pre-meditated in Petaluma
Story highlights Sen. Rand Paul sustained six rib fractures in an attack
The fight had nothing to do with politics, Boucher's attorney has said
Washington (CNN) The man who allegedly assaulted GOP Sen. Rand Paul outside his Kentucky residence pleaded not guilty Thursday to misdemeanor assault in the fourth degree at his arraignment in Bowling Green.
Rene Boucher allegedly tackled Paul, breaking six of his ribs and sustaining bruised lungs. There was no change to the charges and no change in bond.
Doug Stafford, a senior adviser to Paul, told CNN Thursday that Boucher attacked the senator without any prior conversation.
"Last week, Sen. Paul was vigorously assaulted by someone in his neighborhood. This is a serious criminal matter involving serious injury, and is being handled by local and federal authorities," Stafford told CNN in a statement. "As to reports of a longstanding dispute with the attacker, the Pauls have had no conversations with him in many years."
He continued: "The first 'conversation' with the attacker came after Sen. Paul's ribs were broken. This was not a 'fight,' it was a blindsided, violent attack by a disturbed person. Anyone claiming otherwise is simply uninformed or seeking media attention."

Derek St. Holmes (born February 24, 1953) is an American musician, best known as the vocalist and rhythm guitar player for Ted Nugent's early solo career.
History [ edit ]
Derek St. Holmes was born and raised in Riverview, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. He received his first guitar for his eleventh birthday. He started his own neighborhood band, The Organized Confusion, and also played for high school dances.
In 1974, Derek's band, "Scott", opened for an Amboy Dukes show at the Lincoln Park Theater. The Amboy Dukes and their guitar player Ted Nugent had already recorded several albums and were a staple of the Midwest rock scene at the time. When the Amboy Dukes broke up, Nugent's road manager (Phil Nicholson) contacted St. Holmes about auditioning for Nugent's project as lead singer.
St. Holmes joined Ted Nugent, former Amboy Dukes bassist Rob Grange and drummer Cliff Davies to release Nugent's self-titled debut album in 1975. St. Holmes remained in Nugent's band until 1978, when he and Nugent parted ways due to personal, financial and musical differences.
In 1979 Derek joined up with Ted Nugent's bass player Rob Grange, ex-Montrose drummer Denny Carmassi to form St. Paradise. They released one self-titled album for Warner Brothers in 1979 before moving on to other musical careers. In 1981, he teamed up with Aerosmith guitarist Brad Whitford for the short-lived Whitford/St. Holmes Band.
In 1983, St. Holmes joined the Michael Schenker Group for its 1983 release “Built To Destroy", and also contributed to the live follow-up, “Rock Will Never Die”.
In 2000, St. Holmes released Then and Now, a collection of many St. Holmes' rock material. Bassist Chase Chitty (Pat Travers Band), drummer Steve Pace (Hydra, Krokus, Whitford/St. Holmes) and keyboardist Russ Still accompany St. Holmes with songs such as "Standing In The Rain", "Dr. Love" and "Surrounded", and the energy rocker "In Too Deep".
On July 4, 2008 St. Holmes made a guest appearance at Ted Nugent's 6000th concert in Detroit, MI. He jammed on "Hey Baby", "Cat Scratch Fever", and "Stranglehold" with Ted.
On August 24, 2008 he joined Ted Nugent on stage at Capital One Bank Theatre at Westbury in Westbury, New York. He sang and played guitar with Ted Nugent on "Hey Baby", "Just What The Doctor Ordered", "Dog Eat Dog", "Stormtroopin", "Cat Scratch Fever" and "Stranglehold".
Derek has re-recorded some famous Aerosmith songs for a special promotion, and is making them available in MP3 format. Derek's versions are available online on his website.
Derek sang in the Paul Reed Smith Band, co-writing songs including "One In the Same" and "Ice Cold Kisses". The eponymous CD was released in June 2010,[1] with a second album (Time to Testify) slated for release February 17, 2017.
On 27 December 2008, St. Holmes was a special guest at a Get The LED Out concert at Ram's Head Live in Baltimore, MD. He played guitar for "Rock and Roll", then sang and played "Stranglehold" (Ted Nugent). St. Holmes is actually the voice heard in the track recording. He also performed "Stranglehold" with Get the LED Out at the Nokia in New York City on March 7, 2009 and again in Baltimore on May 15, 2010.
In 2010, Derek participated in a tribute album titled Mister Bolin's Late Night Revival, a compilation of 17 previously unreleased tracks written by guitar legend Tommy Bolin prior to his death in 1976. The CD includes other artists such as HiFi Superstar, Doogie White, Eric Martin, Troy Luccketta, Jeff Pilson, Randy Jackson, Rachel Barton, Rex Carroll, Kimberley Dahme, and The 77's. A percentage of the proceeds from this project will benefit the Jackson Recovery Centers.[2]
He toured again with Nugent from 2011 to 2014. Whitford/St. Holmes reunited for a 2015 tour, and the follow-up CD Reunion was sold at these shows.
Also in 2014, Derek announced that Gibson would release a signature guitar in his name later in the year. The guitar is a white Gibson SG custom with an ebony fingerboard and three humbucker pickups. The guitar is fitted with a vibrola.
Derek is known for playing a variety of guitars throughout his career, including Fender Stratocasters, Gibson Les Pauls, PRS Guitars, and various Gibson hollow-bodies.

A new study should delight fans of the comic book superhero Spider-Man. Researchers from the Munich Technical University (M.T.U.) in Germany have built a microfluidics (miniature plumbing) system for spinning short strands of artificial spider silk. The new strands are less than half a millimeter, or 0.02 inch long, and their strength and elasticity are still untested.
Other research groups have already created strands yards or more in length that come close to the properties of real spider silk. Such strands have long been desired for weaving into lighter bulletproof vests or artificial tendons and ligaments, but even relatively short strands could find niche applications in medical procedures such as brain surgery, says M.T.U. biophysicist Andreas Bausch, a co-author of the new study.
Devotees of Spider-Man comics will recall that—contrary to cinematic revisionism—Spidey slung webs not from glands in his wrists but by using a special web fluid of his own design, shot from a pair of wrist-mounted sprayers. Similarly, researchers have built their own versions of web shooters in the past out of syringes. Forcing silk proteins with the right additives through a narrow opening fuses the proteins into strands.
The Munich researchers took the technique a step farther. They studied artificial dragline silk, which spiders use to hang from ceilings and outline their webs, based on that of Araneus diadematus, the European garden spider [see image]. One of the team members had previously inserted a pair of dragline silk genes (dubbed eADF3 and eADF4) into bacteria for easy production. Without such tricks, "you would have to milk spiders to do these experiments," Bausch says.
Bausch and his colleagues used a trident-shaped set of channels [see image] to first mix their dissolved silk proteins with potassium phosphate, which causes the silk proteins to clump into microscopic spheres measuring a mew micron in diameter (a micron is one millionth of a meter). They then lowered the pH of the mixture from 8.0 to 6.0 (to make it slightly more acidic) and forced it through a constriction measuring roughly 10 microns wide.
The scientists report in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA that they created a series of short strands by ratcheting up the speed past 600 microliters per hour (equivalent to less than 10 ounces per minute from a garden hose).
Bausch and company believe that the pH drop causes the spheres to change shape after bonding together via chemically sticky ends, and the narrow constriction mashes the silk globs together once they are flowing fast enough. They note that real spiders can spin their silk at a more leisurely pace because they start with a more viscous silk solution.
Making fibers is a small first step, says Randy Lewis, a molecular biologist at the University of Wyoming in Laramie. He says his team has spun strands up to a yard long that stretch as much as 50 percent and have roughly half the tensile strength of real spider silk. "Without mechanical testing data," he says, "it's really hard to analyze whether the kind of system they have is going to be particularly useful" for applications.
But he says the new system may help researchers improve artificial silks, which vary from strand to strand in unpredictable ways. Spider-Man's science-whiz alter ego Peter Parker would surely approve.

The Grangemouth petrochemical giant, Ineos, has links with the controversial offshore tax haven firm exposed by the recent ‘Paradise Papers' leak.
The Appleby Trust had share capital in Ineos from 2012 to 2015, while its successor, Estera Trust, had shares in 2016. Both firms are based on the island of Jersey and have faced a storm of criticism in recent weeks for helping multinational companies, celebrities and royals cut their tax bills.
Campaigners attack Ineos for its lack of transparency, and are demanding reforms to make multinational tax affairs clearer. Ineos says that it used the offshore companies to administer an employee equity plan, and has never sought their tax advice.
Over 13 million documents were leaked as part of the Paradise Papers, detailing the confidential business of 120,000 organisations and individuals. The leak has exposed the complex offshore financial arrangements made by the Queen, Prince Charles, Apple, Nike, the racing driver Lewis Hamilton and many others.
Appleby, which was rebranded as Estera in 2016, specialises in offshore legal and tax services, and helps manage staff bonus payments and equity plans. There is nothing to suggest it acts unlawfully.
On 12 November the Sunday Post reported Ineos saying that it didn't use Appleby for bonus payments, and had not used the firm for several years.
But Ineos annual reports in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 all mention that “non-voting issued share capital” was held by Appleby Trust (Jersey) as the trustee of an Ineos group share benefit trust and by Appleby Nominees (Jersey). The Ineos annual report for 2016 says that Estera performed the same role.
The campaign Group, Food and Water Europe, pointed out that Ineos had lobbied to exempt manufacturers from £350 million worth of green taxes and its parent company was located on the Isle of Man.
“The UK and the European Union should enact and implement rules to penalise companies that reside in offshore tax havens and push for full corporate financial transparency,” said the group's policy advisor, Andy Gheorghiu.
“This should be in particular the case for a company that is ploughing billions into fossil fuels and petrochemical plants when we must act decisively to invest in clean, renewable energy.”
Ineos needs to be transparent about the tax dealings of their complex web of subsidiaries Dr Richard Dixon, Friends of the Earth Scotland
Friends of the Earth Scotland said it was no surprise that Ineos had dealings with the company at the heart of the Paradise Papers row. “Ineos needs to be transparent about the tax dealings of their complex web of subsidiaries,” said the environmental group's director, Dr Richard Dixon.
The Tax Justice Network warned that the use of opaque offshore financial structures had become systemic. It estimated global revenue losses from multinational companies' tax avoidance at around $500 (£380) billion a year.
“It's extraordinary that we still tolerate these practices,” said the network's chief executive, Alex Cobham.
“The UK already has legislation on the books to allow it to require multinationals to publish their country-by-country reporting, which would immediately lay bare the pattern of profit shifting, and allow the public to vote with their wallets about the level of tax avoidance they're willing to tolerate.”
Ineos reiterated that it had never used deferred bonus payments, and had never used Appleby for them. “We confirmed that we had worked with Appleby in the past but had not used them for some time,” said a company spokesperson.
“For clarity, Ineos has used the fiduciary services division of Appleby for a number of years to act as the administrator for its employee equity plan. Ineos closed the equity plan two years ago, but a very small portion of equity continues to be held by the administrator on behalf of a small number of former employees.”
Ineos has never sought nor received any form of legal or tax advice from Appleby Spokesperson, Ineos
He added: “Ineos has never sought nor received any form of legal or tax advice from Appleby.”
Appleby has stressed that it is subject to frequent regulatory checks and there is no evidence of wrongdoing. “We are an offshore law firm that advises clients on legitimate and lawful ways to conduct their business,” said a company statement.
“We do not tolerate illegal behaviour,” it continued. Allegations made in the media “are unfounded and based on a lack of understanding of the legitimate and lawful structures used in the offshore sector”.

Type the word “Atlantis” into Google and 120 million results pop up. Like El Dorado or Shangri-la, the legendary sunken city of Atlantis hovers on the horizon of our imagination, tantalizing, mysterious, unreachable. Meet Me in Atlantis: My Obsessive Quest to Find the Sunken City pulls together the tangled web of conjecture—and sticks a new locator pin in the map.
Talking from his home in Pelham, New York, author Mark Adams explains why he thinks Atlantis may have been off the coast of Morocco; how an Irishman created the world's largest database of Atlantis lore; and how the parting of the Red Sea, in the biblical story in Exodus, may be connected to Atlantis.

You're best known as a travel writer who has covered real places like Machu Picchu. Why did you choose to write a book about a subject usually discussed in the same breath as UFOs and Bigfoot?
[Laughs] I was writing the Machu Picchu book, and I read this headline in the New York Times: “German discovers Atlantis in Africa.” I was like, what? The fact that someone could actually search for Atlantis and be taken seriously was weird.
A year or two after that, I was working on a magazine story about the greatest philosophers of all time, so I started reading about Plato. And the one thing that came up again and again was that Plato is our sole reputable source for the story of Atlantis.
Your interest in Atlantis began with a series of movies you saw as a boy in the 1970s. Take us back in time.
You can tell from Machu Picchu that I have an interest in lost cities. [Laughs] I think a certain personality loves that type of thing. The germ for me was a series of movies that came out in the late 1970s. They were these super-cheapo pseudo-documentaries, like Beyond and Back or In Search of Noah's Ark. There was also this show called In Search Of... hosted by Leonard Nimoy. If you get two people in a room and one finds out the other one loves In Search Of... as well, they'll end up having this Vulcan mind-meld, and talking about it for the next three hours. [Laughs]
Pull Quote It was Plato's “Critias” that set people off thinking that Atlantis actually existed. Mark Adams, Author
When is Atlantis first mentioned in the historical record?
The only mention of Atlantis by name is in Plato's Dialogues (written around 360 B.C.): “Timaeus,” which was a very complicated attempt to explain the universe, and “Critias,” which has dozens of precise details about what Atlantis looked like, and where it may have been located in relation to other landmarks in the ancient world. It was “Critias,” in particular, that set people off thinking that Atlantis actually existed.
I am taken with the theory of Atlantis being in Morocco. Tell us why it could be right—or wrong.
One of the things I've found with people reading this book is that different people find themselves sympathizing with different theories. I have four main theories, and I talk to the people behind the theories and visit the locations.
In the case of Morocco, a German computer expert, Michael Hübner, became obsessed with “Timaeus” and “Critias” because he's mathematically inclined. He set up what's called a Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction and looked at every one of Plato's clues in “Timaeus” and “Critias.” He weighted them and came up with an area on the map that was within 3,000 miles (4,828 kilometers) of Athens, Greece.
What a lot of people forget is that the story of Atlantis is actually a war story where Athens defeats Atlantis. Hübner plugged in the clues—essentially it was like a game of Battleship, [in which] whatever area had the most pegs sinks the battleship, or in this case discovers Atlantis. He theorizes that Atlantis was a little bit south of Casablanca in modern Morocco.
One of the best clues that Plato gives about Atlantis is that there was a series of concentric circles around the city, black and red stone, and of course it was a seafaring society.
Michael Hübner and I walked across the desert and, sure enough, there was black and red striped stone. Then he took me to the edge of the Sahara desert, and walked me up the hillside. Lo and behold, there were these concentric circles on the edge of the desert, and just a few miles away was the Atlantic Ocean. He makes a really compelling case that Atlantis was located in Morocco, and that's a relatively new theory. Not a lot of people have come up with his hypothesis.

What are the other three front-runner locations?
The traditional front-runner and the only one so far that has gotten a lot of traction with mainstream academics is the island of Santorini in the Aegean Sea. There is real archaeological evidence there. The island has a bull's-eye shape with a ring around its center, and it has a relatively new volcano, which we know erupted in ancient times.
Santorini was also the site of an important maritime city called Akrotiri, which was discovered in 1967. There is a lot of evidence that it was a flourishing naval center. There were frescoes showing ships, very similar to the details that Plato gives about the Atlantis story. In the mid-1970s, Santorini was major news. Jacques Cousteau went to Santorini to look for Atlantis. It was taken pretty seriously.
The other two are Tartessus, in southern Spain, another lost city from antiquity, which is not too far from the modern-day city of Seville. Finally, there is Malta. Malta has the most ancient temples in the Mediterranean area, and Malta's culture was destroyed by a tsunami and earthquake.
Jose Maria Galan, a naturalist, says the real story of archaeology and Atlantis is that “no matter how big and powerful you get, you can disappear like that.” Explain.
Jose Maria Galan worked at Doñana National Park [on the southern coast of Spain]. He took me out to the shore there and said: “In the summer, you'll see thousands of people lying out on the beach. Now imagine that there's a wave 60 meters high coming in, and you can see how a civilization could get wiped out right away.”
Then he took me out to this area of dunes and we started digging into the hills, and Jose starts plucking out all these various pieces of pottery: Roman pieces, Muslim pieces from the Middle Ages, Greek, all the way back to Phoenician. It was amazing that so many cultures in this quiet spot had come and gone over the millennia. He says: “The only thing we know for sure is that everything gets wiped out in the end.”
I think that is one of the main messages Plato was trying to get across: Time is cyclical, and even a very powerful, technically advanced civilization like Atlantis is going to get wiped out eventually.

You use the term “geo-mythology.” Are there any reliable maps that show Atlantis?
No, though there have been people who have tried to place it on maps. There was a sort of odd, brilliant polymath named Athanasius Kircher, a Jesuit who lived in Germany in the 17th century. He did what's probably the most famous map of Atlantis, where he placed it in the Atlantic Ocean. But there's no way of knowing whether he based this on any reliable information or whether he just made it up. The oldest maps we have don't go back much past 1500. They're post Christopher Columbus.
Your search for Atlantis took you all over the world, even to Ireland. Tell us about Tony O'Connell and how he started Atlantipedia.
Tony is one of those wonderful people that I got to meet. He and his longtime partner, Paul Evans, moved to the country outside of Dublin to take care of Tony's ailing mother. Being a very intelligent busybody, Tony was looking for something to fill his time and started getting into serious Atlantis research. He realized there was no single compendium to look for information about Atlantis, so he started this thing called Atlantipedia online. There are thousands of entries—everything you could ever want to know about Atlantis is there! [Laughs]
He was crucial for my research because when I talked to archaeologists, historians, or philosophy professors, a lot of them didn't want to talk about Atlantis. The subject is like kryptonite for serious academics. You're not allowed to take it seriously. So I went to Tony, hat in hand, and asked if he could help me out. He said, “Come to Ireland and spend a week, and we'll talk about it.” Basically, he played Socrates to my Plato. He talked me through all the possibilities; and at the end of the week, I had my four candidates.

I was intrigued by the explanation of the biblical story of the parting of the Red Sea being a tsunami and the Santorini explosion theory—can you tell us more about that?
A lot of the information from Exodus lines up with things that might have happened during the volcanic eruption: the ten plagues, the sky darkening, the sea turning to blood, locusts. If you compare what happens during a volcanic blast, you can see how the effect of a volcanic blast would get translated into the ten plagues that hit Egypt.
One of the more interesting points he makes is that what is commonly known as the Red Sea parting may have actually been the Sea of Reeds, which is a lagoon in northern Egypt. When a tsunami occurs, as we know from what happened in Thailand, the sea recedes. It can go out a half mile or so. This may be what happened when the Jews reached safety on the other side. Then the water came crashing back and wiped out the Egyptians in pursuit.
It would be an incredible coincidence if all these things happen to fall into place. But in ancient history things are often described as happening in a short period of time that may actually have transpired over hundreds of years. So we don't really know.
Socrates said, “Everything I had done hinged on the truth or falsity of a statement about truth or falsity.” Explain.
Before Plato started writing about Atlantis, he mentions some of the things that are going on in The Republic. But Socrates says: There are stories that we use to teach children. Some of these stories are true; some of these stories are not true. And then there are stories that have some truth and some falsity. The falsity is put in for teaching purposes.
The problem with Atlantis is that we have to figure out whether it's all true or all false. Plato wrestled with the idea of what's true and what's not true. The question is: Does Atlantis actually exist or does it fall somewhere in between? Part true. Part false.
So, Mark, will we meet in Atlantis one day? Or is it all a lot of hooey?
If somebody found concentric circles and an ancient Egyptian inscription mentioning a story like Plato says he found about Atlantis—and those two things are by no means impossible—I think we'd have a pretty good case that there's a lot of truth in the story. And nobody would be happier than me if we did. I would be over the moon.
An 18-year-old Palestinian was killed by Kiryat Gat police on Wednesday after he stabbed a soldier and snatched his rifle before running for shelter in a nearby building.
Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter
The soldier was lightly wounded after Amjad al Jundi, from the town of Yata near Hebron, engaged him after getting off a bus. It has emerged that he stayed in Israel illegally.

A female Kiryat Gat resident struggled with the assailant after he seized the weapon from the soldier and entered her home while fleeing. According to her relative, he tried to shoot but there were no bullets left in the soldier's cartridge that he snatched.
"She came back from shopping, opened the door and apparently he tried to open it," the relative recounted. "She fought him to prevent him from opening the door. He came in and tried to shoot her, but there were no bullets in the cartridge. Then he went into the kitchen and wanted to get a knife. She struggled with him, screamed and fled to a neighbor, and was miraculously saved." The relative added that police killed Al Jundi at the entrance to the apartment.
The dead assailant
The attack in the southern city is the third in the space of a few hours, preceded by a rock ambush in the West Bank and a stabbing attack in the Jerusalem's Old City.
"An initial investigation revealed that the suspect got off the bus in Kiryat Gat, saw the soldier, and stole his weapon," a police spokesperson told Ynet. "The soldier struggled with the attacker, and suffered a minor stab wound to his head as a result. The suspect then sprinted into a nearby residential building. Soldiers from the Kiryat Gat station arrived on the scene within a number of minutes and reached the suspect when he apparently began opening fire on them. The police returned fire and he was killed. Police believe that the attack has nationalistic motives."
Medics and Paramedics from Magen David Adom provided initial treatment and evacuated two people who were lightly injured and fully conscious.
Testimony today in the trial of Tonya Craft, a Chickamauga, Georgia, kindergarten teacher accused of molesting three little girls, provided more ammunition for skeptics like Reason contributor William L. Anderson, who argues that Craft is being railroaded. Craft was arrested two years ago and has since lost her job and custody of her two children. Anderson believes Craft, like the defendants in the McMartin Preschool case and other child molestation panics of the 1980s and '90s, faces false charges based on testimony from child witnesses who have been coached by therapists, police, and prosecutors to "remember" things that never happened. Today's testimony by one of Craft's alleged victims reinforces that impression. Here are excerpts from reporting by WCRB, the NBC affiliate in Chattanooga (emphasis added):
First witness called to stand is a 9-year-old female....Witness later describes Tonya Craft giving her a bath. The testimony is graphic [involving painful digital penetration of her vagina and rectum]. Witness uses hands to show how she was molested. Witness says molestation happened more than once.... Witness says she didn't tell anyone because she was scared. Claims Tonya Craft threatened to kill her mom if she told.... 9-year-old witness says she is an actor. She has played in two movies, says she has also appeared in catalogs and magazines. Witness says she has played a character who was abused. This will be a key a part of the defense strategy in casting doubt.... Assistant District Attorney objects to the defense showing child's acting/model photographs. Defense wants to ask the child about her ability to remember rehearsed lines. The judge overruled. Defense then showed child her resume from a movie web site, asking her about acting lessons.... Witness says she was abused by Tonya Craft when she [was] in her kindergarten class and while in the first grade. Defense attorney is asking child who she talked to about coming to court. The child said her therapist.... Witness asked what she thought of Craft as a teacher. Said, "I didn't like her." Defense trying to prove that isn't true. Defense reading letter written to Craft by child witness and her mother thanking Tonya for her teaching. Child looking at card she wrote to Craft at end of school year. It says "I love you." Child witness changing story about where in Tonya Craft's house molestation allegedly happened, and when. Defense still probing for answers. Defense: "Is there anything else?" Girl: "There is more, but I can't remember." Child witness then added that Tonya would mow lawn in short shorts & bra.... The witness on the stand says Craft molested her six or more times. When the defense attorney asked her why she didn't remember before, she said, "I just remembered."
Obviously, none of this is conclusive one way or the other, but if this is the general quality of the testimony against Craft (and presumably the prosecutors led with their strongest witness), reasonable doubt will be inescapable. Anderson notes that the usual line from accusers in cases like this is that we must "believe the children," but it's clear from overturned convictions and academic research (not to mention everyday experience) that little kids frequently will insist that something happened when it did not, especially if they are repeatedly coached by adult authority figures (who themselves may sincerely believe that abuse occurred). Here we have a 9-year-old recalling what allegedly happened when she was 5, with who knows how many intervening conversations aimed at eliciting descriptions of abuse. Furthermore, Anderson reports, several children who were at Craft's house when some of the abuse allegedly occurred insist that nothing untoward happened. If so, "believe the children" does not bring us any closer to the truth.
Anderson says the indictments in this case, which charge Craft with 22 counts of child molestation and aggravated sexual battery, are suspiciously vague about the timing of her alleged crimes, which compounds the difficulty of rebutting the prosecution's case. He also notes that the judge, who has been notably hostile to the defense, represented Craft's ex-husband in divorce proceedings as a lawyer, the sort of experience that could be expected to bias him against her. He rejected defense requests to recuse himself. After the prosecution, with the help of local media outlets, dragged Craft's name through the mud, the judge imposed a gag order that prevented her from defending herself in public.
Craft's supporters have a website.
A second woman has now accused ‘Gossip Girl' star Ed Westwick of rape, only days after the British actor took to Twitter to deny the initial claims made against him.
Westwick is now being investigated by the LAPD's sex crimes unit over allegations made by actress Kristina Cohen, according to the LA Times.
Cohen took to Facebook Monday to detail her rape allegation, adding #metoo to the end of her post. The hashtag has become a symbol of strength for women after film producer Harvey Weinstein was accused of rape and sexual assault by dozens of women in Hollywood.
Cohen recounted how Westwick held her down and raped her.
“I now realize the ways in which these men in power prey on women, and how this tactic is used so frequently in our industry, and surely, in many others,” Cohen said.
“I hope my coming forward will help others to know that they are not alone, that they are not to blame, and it is not their fault. Just as the other women and men coming forward have helped me to realize the same. I hope that my stories and the stories of others help to reset and realign the toxic environments and power imbalances that have created these monsters.”
Westwick was quick to refute the allegations, tweeting to the world that he has never met Cohen.
“I do not know this woman,” Westwick said. “I have never forced myself on any woman, in any manner. I certainly have never committed rape.”
On Wednesday, a second woman took to social media to accuse the 30-year-old actor of rape.
Former actor Aurelie Wynn said she was dating ‘Glee' star Mark Salling at the time. Salling is currently facing up to seven years jail for child pornography charges.
She alleges that when she told Salling of the rape, he broke up with her and friends advised her not to say anything.
“In July 2014, I went through a very similar ordeal with Ed Westwick,” said Wynn.
“And like Kristina, I said no and he pushed me face down and was powerless under his weight,” she said.
“My other friends and people around me told me it was best not to say anything, to not be “that girl” and that no one would believe me and think I was just out trying to get my 10 seconds of fame.”
Wynn said Cohen's revelation gave her the courage to come forward and speak out about her alleged sexual assault.
“I believe you Kristina Cohen and thank you for speaking up so eloquently and really encompassing what young female actresses have to go through at the hands of men like Ed Westwick. Without you I would not have had the strength to speak up publicly about my ordeal,” she added.
Westwick has not responded to the second rape allegation.
The last time I told what my IQ was on a website/blog, I was ridiculed and called a troll and told there is no way my IQ is what it is because only xxx amount of people on the planet have one in that range… blah blah blah shit blah.
After all of the many, many days of testing I was told I read and comprehended at the rate of someone who was 24/25 who had been in college for at least 2.5 years. I had about an 85% photographic memory and that my IQ was 192. I was about 12.
The results didn't make sense to me until I met my real father and his father and learned they had extremely high IQ's. My father even though his IQ was 165 had little common sense and was the absolute opposite of mechanically inclined.
I am extremely mechanically inclined. I feel I sort of lack in the vocabulary section, but that is probably because I don't read fiction, that shit is a waste of time. I read all reference material and it typically does not have the same vocabulary as fiction books and many IQ tests focus on vocabulary that people would pick up from reading fiction. I don't really have an urge to improve my English vocabulary as I plan on learning Spanish soon. I'd rather learn a foreign language than try to improve my English vocab by either reading fiction or just memorizing new word definitions. I don't really agree with most IQ tests and how they test learned skills instead of the speed that one can learn new skills. To me the speed a person can learn new skills is a better judgement of IQ than what someone already knows.
I was tested because I got in a lot of trouble for answering questions out loud and making jokes. I started reading at about 3. My parents played music on my mothers stomach while she was pregnant, they started teaching me to read when I was a few months old. My toys as a kid were a map of the USA a Speak N spell and flash cards. So by the time I started school I was already far beyond most kids
I've always done pretty good at making friends. I don't have a problem being nice to people and making small talk, I try not to analyze shit too much, but that can be hard when I am talking to a beautiful female. I've gotten over that shit though, nothing that anger and determination can't fix. Now that I've grown up I learned that all these girls I was just friends with actually liked me at one time and thought I was rejecting them. I feel like a fucking idiot for not being able to pick up on hints that women like me. LOL I feel very fortunate that I am fairly attractive and I can meet women, but stupid as shit that I can't quite figure out if they like me, plus I try to be a nice guy and not look at women as sexual objects.
I don't do so good at having like day-to-day conversations with people, but that is no big deal. I mean my interests are different than other peoples regardless of my IQ or theirs. I do prefer talking to people of higher intelligence though. I once had an awesome conversation with some Government defence scientists negative ION propulsion and how it works. I found that to be very interesting.
I like being around people, but mostly if we are going to do something, I don't like sitting around doing nothing just to be around people. I'd rather go home and read something about Database design theory. I do enjoy outdoor activities and always have. I did all of the exgame sports growing up, I don't know shit about foolsball or baseball or any of that. I am paying the price physically for all of my outdoor activities now though.
I enjoy fishing with people, 4 wheeling, mudding, and other activities from time to time. I get frustrated with humanity and most humans in general, but I don't display it outside of my house. I try not to hurt peoples feelings.
I feel very fortunate to have such a high IQ it gives me many more opportunities in life that I wouldn't have if my IQ was average. Many problems in IT and Comp Sci subjects require you to think long and hard to develop a solution. Often you have to go over the steps in your head to envision how something will work, I do that with notes and other software as well. The human brain can only think about somewhere along the line of 7 steps in depth.
I don't really regret having a high IQ other than the fact it can get a little lonely some times and people can frustrate you, especially with stupid questions that defy logical thinking. The one thing that makes me feel bad is when I get closer to people, friends, family etc. and they are trying to do something and I can see immediately that what they are going to do won't work. I often fight telling them that I don't think their plan will work because I don't want to hurt their feelings by showing my intelligence and predicting their failure. I have had to learn to not intervene or give my opinion in order to not come off as a narcissistic self absorbed asshole who thinks he is superior.
Even though I feel most people are drooling mental retards, the only person that has ever heard me say anything is my mother. It is not my high IQ that bothers me it is the fact that so many other people don't have a higher IQ and I have to witness it.
It makes me sad that more people don't have a higher IQ. I hate watching people struggle with things. I tutored all through college, I tutored over 40 courses in Accounting and Computer Science. I also tutored special needs kids when I was younger. I loved tutoring because I could help people who were struggling, mostly because the way I solve problems is usually drastically different than how most people solve problems. I have been able so many times to explain subjects to people who were seriously struggling and 99% of the time the ways I showed them were absolutely nothing like what their instructor or books were trying to teach them. I showed them simple ways, ways they would remember. I had many people come to me after tests and tell me they aced the test and thank me for showing them the tricks to solve the problems in a simple way.
I literally destroy any subject I want to learn. I can't wait to get back to college and take Calculus, statistics and discrete math and finish my degree. I love learning, the problem is deciding what I want to learn, I hate that life is so short and there are so many things I won't get to research and learn, that makes me sad.
I would really love to meet a woman with a High IQ who is attractive. I've seen them and met them I know they exist, some are smoking fucking hot too. I will be trying dating sites. I think that would work better for me since I would know that if I met the woman on a dating site and we were dating that she was interested in me. Finding things to talk about can be hard, I fear that I will come off as some really smart guy who is intelligent but self absorbed. I have learned to let others speak more and to talk less. That is a must when talking to a woman, and you better be able to talk about what ever it is she is talking about too. LOL
I know that many women who liked me that I didn't know liked me because I was smart. Women like smart men as long as they don't act like they are superior or try overly hard to impress them with what knowledge they have. Other than that I have to be careful of what I say, I don't lie, I don't beat around the bush, I don't sugar coat shit, I just say it and the truth can be brutal sometimes. I've learned I have to be with someone whose IQ is at least near 120 or higher or once they get to know me they may feel dumb.
The only other thing that disappoints me is that people tend to call me crazy once they get to know me because I open up more and my mouth filter gets removed and shit just comes out as I see it. Some people think the shit I say is funny, even when I am not trying to be funny. Most can't tell when I am being sarcastic, but when I rethink about some things I can understand why. I have a sense of humor but not everyone shares it with me. LOL
I hope to do some more research on IQ test and take a few in the next year or two, real tests not online shit guessing tests. Who knows maybe I'll meet my future wife if I run into a hot psychiatrist who is intelligent. But then I'd be with someone who analyzes me as much as I analyze others, then I may need to analize her. LMMFAO

I know it's been said many times, in very different ways, but you're going to spend a lot of money on a Disney vacation. Your friends and family members are quick to judge and have preconceived notions that you must be putting a second mortgage on your house to pay for all of it… You can't even avoid hearing it from guests in the parks (you'll hear some form of this complaining at least once a day), “do you know how much I spent on this?” they say. A bulk of the complaint has to deal with the food prices, heat, reservation hiccups, and the wait times. I can't help you figure out your smartphone (pro tip: your battery drains so quickly because it's always searching for a Wi-Fi connection that will be slow in the park anyway-so you're probably better off using cellular data and turning off your location services, because you have a park map) or remind you again that you need to be well-hydrated in the Florida summer, but I can show you a Disney vacation compared to sporting events using published data.
Major League Baseball (MLB) has something called the Team Marketing Report that comes out every year, so I'll be using this organization. The report includes numbers and figures on various things, but for the purposes of this topic I'm going to be using something called the “Fan Cost Index” or FCI. This takes all the ballparks and averages out their prices. It includes: 4 average adult tickets, 2 draft beers, 4 soft drinks, 4 hot dogs, parking for 1 car, 2 programs, and 2 adult-sized hats. In 2014, the FCI was $212.46. For simplicity's sake, I'm going to compare the Mickey Pretzel (since the hot dogs come with chips that are $2.99 and both totals equal $7.49 as a meal) to hot dogs and the park map to a game day program. Since the FCI uses average ticket price and not premium (which is $93.41 by the way, compared to Disney's $105.00 for a single day at the Magic Kingdom), I'm going to say that a typical baseball fan will try to attend 10 out of 81 home games (if they live close by) or other events throughout the year like college basketball or football in place of that, so we can compare those to a ten day ticket at Disney.
Ticket: $27.83 / $36.50 (Ten day ticket for WDW, purchased through Disney).
Beer: $6.09 / $6.25 (Bud Light at Flame Tree BBQ in Animal Kingdom).
Hot Dog: $4.32 / $4.49 (Mickey Pretzel at Lunching Pad in Magic Kingdom).
Soda: $4.02 / $3.29 (Most places in Magic Kingdom).
Parking: $15.09 / $17.00 (One day, any park for that same day).
Program: $2.84 / $0.00 (Park maps make great souvenirs for scrapbooking).
Hats: $17.23 / $17.95 (Themed Mickey Ears-plain Mickey Ears are $13.95).
As you can plainly see, the prices aren't too far off. The grand total of Disney's would-be FCI is $242.52, which is $30.06 more than the MLB experience, but mind you, an average game lasts a little under 3 hours (and they're now implementing rules that will speed up the game). MLB doesn't allow food into many of their parks and stadiums which is why tailgating is so popular, but Disney does allow it (of course, you're going to be spending more time in a Disney park). Also, if you're staying at a Disney hotel, you don't have to pay for parking and they provide free transportation to all parks and Disney Springs. What's surprising is that the attendance is quite similar as well. The 30 MLB teams combined for a total 2014 attendance of 69,311,587. While Disney doesn't publish their numbers, the Themed Entertainment Association has their Global Attractions Report which states that in 2013, the Magic Kingdom, EPCOT, Hollywood Studios, and Animal Kingdom combined for 50,125,000 guests. The attendance gets insanely close if you deduct the MLB teams on the west coast (assuming their fans will go to Disneyland).
Just as MLB teams adjust their rosters every year and “put new products on the field” for their fans, Disney always unveils new plans and attractions to keep guests coming through the turnstiles (even if they have to demolish a beloved attraction to do so. I guess that would be the equivalency of your team trading away your favorite player…to Japan). So, the next time your favorite sports fan of the family or co-worker ridicules you for dumping hard-earned cash on “another” Disney vacation, you now have some fuel for your counterargument. It's definitely more refined than a “doesn't have Splash Mountain” type of retort.
Federal Conservative leadership candidate Michael Chong was in the rhetorical hot seat Sunday, defending his proposal for a carbon tax from skeptical rivals vying to take the party into the 2019 election.
The opposing viewpoints prompted pointed jabs during the second of two debates held in the Lower Mainland over the weekend – a gathering of about 300 people in a downtown theatre organized by the Vancouver Centre electoral district association.
Nine of the 14 candidates for the leadership attended, and the most pointed moments came when candidates took the opportunity to dismiss Mr. Chong's proposal as a bad idea for a Conservative Party seeking to return to power.

Campbell Clark: Michael Chong's pro-carbon-tax stance could make for a rocky Tory leadership bid
Adam Radwanski: In populist winds, the Conservatives' inclusive tent is collapsing
John Ibbitson: Voting for Conservative leader: What would Stephen Harper do?
Mr. Chong, an Ontario MP and former intergovernmental affairs minister, stood his ground, declaring the Conservatives won't gain traction with voters without a credible climate-change policy, part of which could be his revenue-neutral tax proposal.
He even cited British Columbia's ground-breaking carbon tax as an example for the federal Conservatives.
"The B.C. model works. We need to take it and export it to the rest of the country," Mr. Chong said, facing criticism, at one point, from Rick Peterson, a Vancouver-based businessman seeking the leadership.
Mr. Peterson noted that B.C. Premier Christy Clark has been wary about increasing the tax, enacted despite some opposition by her predecessor Gordon Campbell, beyond $30 a tonne.

Mr. Chong said the B.C. tax was three times the price on carbon of any other province, and that the Liberals have been re-elected in B.C. despite enacting the tax.
Steven Blaney, a former public-safety minister, was skeptical. "Michael, I disagree with your green tax. I believe that a tax is a tax is a tax. We've seen that movie before with [former federal Liberal leader] Stéphane Dion and his green tax," said the Quebec MP, drawing laughter from the audience.
Mr. Blaney suggested emphasing clean energy, particularly nuclear energy where hydro is not possible. "We must invest in technology to have green and clean energy, but no more taxes."
Erin O'Toole, an Ontario MP and former veterans affairs minister, also piled on, saying, in response to a question from moderator Kirk LaPointe, that the first tax he would kill as prime minister is the federal Liberal carbon tax.
"With respect, Michael, I am not in this race to out-Liberal the Liberals," he quipped, proposing a federal Tory government would work with large emitters to reduce their carbon footprints.
But Mr. Chong insisted the cheapest way to reduce emissions is a revenue-neutral carbon tax, and noted it would consist of a tax cut. Mr. Chong has proposed a levy that would reach $130 a tonne by 2030 and help finance an $18-billion tax cut.

On Saturday, all of the candidates, save Kevin O'Leary and Deepak Obhrai, attended a debate hosted by a nursery in Langley, east of Vancouver. Mr. O'Leary and Mr. Obhrai, as well as Maxime Bernier, Kellie Leitch, and Pierre Lemieux, did not attend Sunday's debate.
Neither of the B.C. weekend events were official party events, thus there was no obligation for leadership candidates to attend.
However, Chris Alexander, Lisa Raitt, Andrew Scheer, Andrew Saxton, Brad Trost, Mr. Blaney, Mr. O'Toole, Mr. Peterson and Mr. Chong were on stage for a debate that featured candidates facing off against each other as well as all present engaging in a larger discussion.
Topics addressed during the two gatherings included the fentanyl crisis, the wisdom of diplomatic relations with Iran, affordable housing, U.S. President Donald Trump and a section on legalizing marijuana that led Ms. Raitt to issue a stern warning to the party.
"I'm going to get real with everybody in the room. If we run an election in 2019 on the platform of recriminalizing marijuana, we will face the same result as we faced in 2015," she said, eliciting cheers and applause.
Speaking to 2019, she said the focus should be on the deficits and "poor economic management" of the federal Liberal government that will be seeking a second mandate.

A spate of cancer-related illnesses among New York's rescue services who worked at Ground Zero sparks fear of an epidemic
A spate of recent deaths of New York police and fire officers who took part in the emergency operation at Ground Zero after the 9/11 attacks has heightened fears that it could be the start of a delayed epidemic of cancer-related illness.
Five firefighters and police officers, all of whom were involved in the rescue and clear-up at the site of the collapsed Twin Towers, have died of cancer in the past three months, the oldest being 44. Three died last month within a four-day period.
Those three were Robert Grossman, a Harlem-based police officer who spent several weeks at the emergency site and died of a brain tumour aged 41; fellow police officer Cory Diaz, 37; and firefighter Richard Mannetta, 44.
In addition, John McNamara, a 44-year-old firefighter, died in September; and Renee Dunbar, a police officer in her late 30s, died in August.
The cluster of cancer deaths comes as Congress is under pressure to pass legislation that would provide federal help to emergency workers who have contracted illnesses since 9/11. Campaigners hope that a bill will be put to the House of Representatives by the end of the year that would set up a $10bn (£6bn) national fund for hundreds of people who now have cancer, respiratory illnesses and other diseases that may be linked to their work at the World Trade Centre site.
Up to 70,000 people took part in the massive operation at Ground Zero, including police, firefighters and construction workers who came to New York voluntarily from all over the US. Many worked for months amid a toxic soup of dust and chemicals.
Amid the pollutants within the giant pile of 1.8m tons of debris and the surrounding air were 90,000 litres of jet fuel from the two stricken planes, about 1,000 tons of asbestos that was used in the construction of the Twin Towers, pulverised lead from computers, mercury and highly carcinogenic by-products from the burning of plastics and chlorinated chemicals.
No official tally is available for the number of those who have died as a result of the 9/11 clear-up. The New York state health department has recorded 817 deaths of emergency workers but it cannot confirm categorically how many of those were directly linked to the site.
Federal funds for ill emergency workers ran out in 2003 and, since then, the onus has fallen on cash-strapped New York city, which is facing up to 10,000 claims for compensation through the courts. Families of those who have died say that the burden should be shouldered by the nation as a whole.
Robert Grossman's father, Stephen, drew a parallel with the $3bn the federal government spent this year on buying up old cars under the "cash-for-clunkers" scheme. "They spent that, but they don't have a dime for people who volunteered after 9/11 and ended up giving their lives for their country."
The 911 Police Aid Foundation, a group run by and for sick police officers, says it is helping more than 100 officers who worked at Ground Zero and who now have cancer. The group is receiving new cases at a rate of about one a week, many of which are extremely rare at such young ages.
Michael Valentin, who volunteers for the group, spent about four months working around the pile of debris from the towers. He now has lymphatic tumours in his chest, as well as asbestos poisoning.
"We all have terminal illnesses, we are all going to die. We just want to help others by showing them that they are not alone," he said.
The bill currently before Congress, which is named after James Zadroga, a police officer who died in 2006, would provide for the health monitoring and treatment of an additional 15,000 emergency workers. Paradoxically, it would not cover cancer, which was not perceived as a priority at the time the legislation was drafted though numbers have escalated since then.
Claire Calladine, a campaigner who runs the organisation 9/11 Health Now, said the fear was that the recent rise in cancer cases was just the start.
"We have only seen the tip of the iceberg. How bad will it get – that is the big question."
RootsRated, Outdoor Research, and ExoticHikes.com have teamed up to bring you the insider's guide to Olympic National Park. This content is written by Exotic Hikes.
Olympic National Park is the location of hundreds of divine destinations, each of which awaiting hikers who are willing to go through a bit of hell to reach heavenly locations. As most locals know, the best trails in the Olympics head up. Rising from towering treed forests, trails in the Olympics come with serious elevation gain. But the reward of hidden lakes and panoramic views more than makes up for the physical exertion.
The hike to Lake of the Angels is no exception to this rule.
Douglas Scott
Nearly 5,000 feet above the Hamma Hamma River, Lake of the Angels sits against the prettiest mountain backdrop in the Olympic National Park. With smoothed-out boulders from glacial activity, rugged peaks, beautiful waterfalls and an abundant mountain goat and marmot populations, this destination is one of the best kept secrets in the park. And at just 8 miles round trip and nearly 3500 feet of elevation gain, hikers will have to earn the majestic views that await them at the top.
Situated beneath the gorgeous Mount Skokomish, Lake of the Angels, is a crystal clear lake fed by melting snow. Called “The Valley of Heaven,” the area around Lake of the Angels really does feel like a hiker's final destination. Sitting on a large rock, or camping at the base of a snow and scree field, it doesn't get much better than spending time at this lake. Sure, the trail up here is not for everyone; but for those advanced hikers needing a fantastic view or moderate hikers up for a challenge, this is the trail you have been craving.
Beginning from the parking lot, the trail climbs about 900 feet, making this the easiest section of the hike. Starting out mostly flat, the trail passes the site where Carl Putvin, a 21 year old trapper, died in 1913 while getting food for his family during a snowstorm. The trailhead to Lake of the Angels is duly called the Carl Putvin Trail. Make sure before you head up the trail to stop and pay your respects, as not doing so can invoke a curse. After the grave markers, the trail meanders through forests with huge moss-covered boulders and across a few impressive ravines, which offer your first glimpses of the Hamma Hamma River Valley below. After a few more minutes of walking, the trail meets an old logging road, before climbing once again.
Douglas Scott
The next bit is where the trail really starts to climb, gaining a grueling 1,100 feet in one mile. The steep trail quickly leaves Olympic National Forest and enters the Mount Skokomish Wilderness, one of six gorgeous wilderness areas on the Olympic Peninsula. As the trail continues to climb, views of the Hood Canal and Cascade mountain range start to appear to the east, giving an excuse to take in the views while catching your breath and resting your legs. From here, the trail somehow gets even more steep, leading to the infamous headwall that must be scaled.
After the trail crosses into the wilderness boundary, it becomes more of a climber's route instead of a trail, quickly ascending steep, loose terrain before leading to a section where you have to scramble up roots and rocks. Some consider the “Headwall” dangerous, but if you take breaks between each section, it can be done much easier than it appears. There are two pretty awkward scrambles though after an incredibly steep dirt path. The first part of the “Headwall” is pretty easy for most, climbing up the root in the trail. The second part can be dicey for those with vertigo. There is a drop off of a few hundred feet, but the rock does slant toward the hillside instead of the waiting emptiness. The climb isn't technical at all, but you do need to be able to use your arms to pull yourself up in a few spots. Generally, the “Headwall” is manageable and almost easy, if done smart and slowly.
Douglas Scott
Once past the craziness of the “Headwall,” the trail becomes mostly flat, offering fantastic views of the Hamma Hamma River Valley and the nearby peaks in all directions, including Mount Rainier far off to the southeast. Strolling through this section, the views become outstanding whether they are draped in wildflowers, covered in snow or brightly lit up from the fall colors.
This is where the trail becomes downright gorgeous. Weaving through a magical meadow, the often hard to locate trail passes next to the Pond of the False Prophet. The Pond, named because many in search of the Lake of Angels thinks that this is their destination, is full of frogs and offers a fantastic place to take pictures of the mountains reflecting off the shallow, calm waters. But this isn't your final destination. From the pond, the path follows a small stream cut into the lush green landscape, leading to the entrance sign of Olympic National Park. One more hill awaits you and then your heavenly view.
As you climb the last hill and walk the last few hundred feet along Whitehorse Creek, you're struck with the feeling that something truly incredible awaits. Your weary legs take the final few steps, you raise your head and expanding before you, in all its glory, is the Lake of the Angels.

About the size of a football field, this gorgeous high-alpine lake, flanked by waterfalls, giant boulders and the rugged Mount Skokomish, is everything a divine destination should be. Roaming around the rocky valley, mountain goats and marmots are common sights, so be prepared to get overwhelmed by the best of nature.
Lake of the Angels sits in the Valley of Heaven, perfectly encapsulating the beauty and majesty of the Olympic Mountains. From here, you can climb Mount Skokomish, camp alongside the lake, and fall more in love with the intoxicating beauty of Olympic National Park. The path to get here may be hellish for many, but the rewards are worth the sore legs, sweaty back and tired lungs.

The hike to Lake of the Angels is one of the most incredible hikes in Olympic National Park, offering high elevations, panoramic views, and stunning scenery.
Apparently, the NSA doesn't think terrorists use Reddit.
As revealed by agency documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the NSA is hungry for information on the Internet. Under programs like PRISM, it taps Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and Yahoo to look at the communications of a literal unknowable number of their users. (It's classified.)
It's inherently hard to talk about how the NSA gets this information because it obtains classified orders for surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which is administered by a secret court. Anyone who gets a FISA order is legally obliged to keep mum about it.
But Reddit, despite being one of the most popular U.S.-based social sites in the world, has never gotten a letter from a FISA court. “We have not received any,” Erik Martin, the company's General Manager, told the Daily Dot.
That might be because most Reddit activity—everything that's not done by private message or in a hidden subreddit—is already out in the open, and thus needs no warrant. Or it could be because the NSA has a mandate to throw out incidental information if it's about an American, and half the site's visitors are from the U.S.
On June 14, the NSA allowed Facebook to become the first company to even hint at how many FISA orders it gets. It announced its total number of law enforcement requests for the second half of 2012—a catch-all figure that can include, for instance, local cops asking for leads on a missing child suspect. The company got between 9,000 and 10,000 requests, it said, referencing between 18,000 and 19,000 accounts.
However, Google, which hasn't been granted the same privilege as Facebook—presumably because they've already released their non-FISA information—criticized that move as being confusing. It has openly petitioned the NSA to share its blanket FISA numbers, so far to no avail.
At least Reddit can share, as can any American company—provided the number is zero.

The referee in a case brought against former Kenosha County District Attorney Robert Zapf recommends suspending his law license and barring him from ever again serving as a prosecutor.
Dennis J. Flynn filed his recommendations Thursday with the Wisconsin Supreme Court after finding in favor of two of the three counts brought by the state's Office of Lawyer Regulation against Zapf.
Supreme Court
The Supreme Court will make a final ruling in the case.
The OLR complaint accused Zapf of prosecutorial misconduct in the trials of Markese Tibbs and Joseph J. Brantley, who were convicted in the April 2014 shooting death of Anthony Edwards of Kenosha.
The complaint was filed in January against Zapf, who already had announced his retirement and and his intent not to run for re-election.
It stems from Zapf's failure to disclose to defense attorneys evidence planted by former Kenosha Police Department officer Kyle Baars.
In addition, Flynn cited Zapf for not disclosing Baars' subsequent resignation after Baars made his misconduct known to superiors, including then-Police Chief John Morrissey.
The OLR, which prosecutes allegations of attorney misconduct, was seeking a 90-day suspension of Zapf's license to practice law.
However, based on his findings, Flynn is recommending:
A one-year suspension.
Permanently barring Zapf from serving as a Wisconsin prosecutor.
Have Zapf pay all costs of prosecuting the case against him.
Have Zapf complete 25 hours of “courses focusing on the ethical obligations of attorneys and particularly prosecuting attorneys in criminal cases.”
Report blasts Zapf
Flynn didn't pull any punches in an 85-page report to the state Supreme Court.
It includes scathing criticism that accuses the Kenosha Police Department of engaging in a cover-up in the case at the highest levels, up to and including Morrissey, who retired in early spring.
But Flynn held Zapf responsible, above all, for “doing nothing” when Morrissey, detectives involved in questioning Baars, and their supervisors failed to obey Zapf's orders that they provide him with written reports in the evidence-planting matter.
He said Zapf's policy of not recognizing oral reports by credible officials about Baars' misconduct was a “convenient excuse” for Zapf in his decision not to disclose the evidence planting.
Moreover, Flynn's report rips Zapf for deciding on his own that he didn't need to disclose Baars' misconduct in the case to the defense attorneys because Zapf didn't feel the information was exculpatory to the defendants.
Flynn cited U.S. and Wisconsin Supreme Court rulings that dictated otherwise. He said withholding the information prevented defense attorneys from investigating the effects of the police misconduct and proceeding from there.
Wrote Flynn: “This matter reflects the actions of a prosecuting District Attorney taking action, or not taking action, in (two) very important homicide cases in an effort to win regardless of the rights of both sides in the matter have to fundamental fairness in the trial. There was a corrupt police officer here who planted evidence in a homicide case then resigned because of that misconduct.”
Zapf, Flynn continued, “did nothing to facilitate truth and justice as he was obligated to under case law, the Wisconsin statutes and our Supreme Court rules. ... And then he made a false statement to the Court about his prior knowledge in this corrupt prosecution.”
“The ‘hide the truth and win at all costs' approach, evidenced here by the actions of this prosecutor, acted to undermine the ability of our citizens to have confidence in the outcomes of our criminal prosecutions and the sentences that result from them,” Flynn added.
Second tenure as DA
Zapf, who has practiced law for 43 years, first served in the Kenosha County District Attorney's Office as an assistant DA from 1974-80, then as District Attorney from 1981-89. He practiced as a private attorney until he was elected again as District Attorney in 2005 and served until his retirement earlier this year.
This isn't Zapf's first time being formally accused of prosecutorial misconduct.
In 1985, he was found to have engaged in misconduct for not disclosing necessary information to a defendant. Flynn noted similarities in that case to the present complaint against Zapf.
“It is recognized here that others were involved in serious law enforcement misconduct,” Flynn wrote. “This is all the more reason for the gatekeeper, the prosecuting attorney, ... to be at the forefront of the effort to ensure ... not just a conviction, but justice through Constitutional fairness.”
Walmart's recent change to free two-day shipping for online orders, with no membership required, is the latest in a series of moves the company has made to fight Amazon and grow its ecommerce business. But Amazon's Prime program is much more than free, fast shipping. Moreover, Walmart's key strategic strengths stem from its unbeatable geographic footprint and low prices. Trying to beat Amazon at its own game is not only likely to fail — it's also not in Walmart's best interests.
Walmart's recent change to free two-day shipping for online orders, no membership required, is the latest in a series of moves the company has made to fight Amazon and grow its e-commerce business. Last year, it purchased Jet.com and installed Jet's founder, Marc Lore, as head of its e-commerce division. It has also been acquiring e-commerce niche players, including Shoebuy and outdoor gear retailer Moosejaw, and digital technology companies, such as search experts Adchemy and cloud platform OneOps.
Walmart does need to shore up its e-commerce capabilities, but its attempts to out-Amazon Amazon aren't a winning strategy. For one thing, by offering the new shipping service, Walmart is really only playing catch-up. Lore himself described free shipping as table stakes.
And the new shipping offer doesn't even put Walmart on par with Amazon, since it only applies to orders of $35 or more. That may seem like a low hurdle, especially when Amazon's Prime membership costs $99 per year. But Prime members are likely to forget about the cost after it's been paid for the year, while Walmart's policy means money is inserted into the purchase equation with every transaction. Anything that makes people think about the amount they're spending during their purchase reinforces Amazon's advantage in delivering no-brainer experiences. Moreover, free two-day shipping already feels like old news. Consider that Amazon also offers free same-day delivery by 9 PM on more than 1 million items in select areas and free two-hour delivery on some products in select metro areas through its Prime Now option.
Importantly, a Prime membership doesn't only include shipping benefits; members also receive access to movie streaming, photo storage, music streaming, and early access to time-sensitive “Lightning Deals.” In Amazon's growing brick-and-mortar bookstores, Prime members can buy books for discounted prices, while others have to pay the cover price. Amazon will likely continue adding Prime benefits to the mix, potentially including the holy grail of entertainment: live sports.
For all these reasons, Prime has been described by CEO Jeff Bezos as one of the company's three strategic pillars. The goal is to make potential customers believe that “if you are not a Prime member, you are being irresponsible.”
Walmart can't compete with this value proposition, at least not yet. Walmart also can't challenge Amazon's existing brand equity in access and selection. With approximately 160 million items for sale, Amazon has become the go-to outlet for anything. In comparison, Walmart.com sells “only” 15 million items — and just 2 million of them are available for the free two-day shipping. It's no wonder 52% of online shoppers start their search on Amazon, according IHL Group.
Amazon also has the advantage of years of consumer data, as well as the data analytics proficiency to spot trending products, make smarter pricing and assortment decisions, and deliver personalized customer experiences. Walmart's acquisitions of e-commerce companies and digital technologies, and the talent that comes along with them, enable it to get better at this, but Amazon will continue to improve too.
Trying to beat Amazon at its own game is not only likely to fail, it's also not in Walmart's best interests. Walmart has perhaps the best physical distribution and retail network in the world. It needs to be competitive on digital channels, sure. But, more important, it should excel at brick-and-mortar. Improving the in-store experience, promoting omnichannel shopping and fulfillment options, and developing in-person service innovations are avenues that leverage its brand equity and core competencies — and they're approaches that would put Amazon at a disadvantage. Instead of cutting human resource jobs (which seems counterproductive for a company that employs 2.3 million people) and closing new store formats (which make the brand more convenient and accessible to more people), Walmart should invest to advance its strongest competitive advantage: its physical stores.
The company's obsession with competing with Amazon also seems to have taken Walmart's focus off its brand identity in everyday low prices. In its announcements and ads about the new free shipping service, product prices have not been mentioned. Walmart has held a low-price leadership position from its start. Now, in some cases, it can often lower prices than Amazon because Jet.com's operating model doesn't rely on holding inventory. But the company has elected to make neither its new pricing capabilities nor its long-standing low prices part of its marketing efforts for e-commerce. Moreover, the company's new television campaign, which employs a whimsical style more suited to tech startups and was launched during programming more suited to higher-end brands (the Oscars), reinforces the company's departure from its focus on low prices.
Many companies feel a pull to imitate the practices of successful rivals. But this rarely ends well. Core competencies stagnate, customers become confused, and the opportunity to lead instead of follow is squandered. Instead of gaining on Amazon, Walmart seems poised to lose valuable ground.
With the Zero, Broken Anchor has devised a universal lens focus gear ring that truly feels like it could work on any lens that needs it.
Pretty much every filmmaker has at some point tried to make equipment do something it wasn't designed to do. While vintage cinema lenses create beautiful imagery, and the world of still glass offers cost-effective options for building out a lens kit, neither were designed to work with modern cinema follow focus units. To overcome this, you can of course buy individual delrin rings to attach to each lens you acquire, but unless they are custom made and fit, they often slip. Most have at least some form of a mounting gap where the follow focus unit will slip for a gear, which can be disastrous when trying to do precise focus moves in your shot. Broken Anchor might just have a solution with their ZERO universal focus ring, and they shipped us a pre-production model to put through the paces. Credit: Broken Anchor CNC-machined out of aluminum, and anodized for hardening and durability, this ring is designed to last for a very long time. Through an ingenious combination of ratchets and springs, you twist the ring in order to move the lens-arms in until the ring is locked firmly onto the lens. This system makes installation completely tool-free, as opposed to the allen keys that are usually required to mount lens focus rings. Each lens arm is tipped with silicon rubber, and in our tests no lenses were marked in any way.
Credit: Broken Anchor
When properly tightened, the ring was surprisingly secure to the lens barrel, holding down with 2.25lbs of force. You can twist the ring around your hand to feel its force, and it feels secure without feeling like it would damage a lens. We did some extreme speed focus racks to see if we could get the ring to skip, and only encountered some very limited slip when reaching the very end of the intended barrel rotation. Since you don't generally want to be torqueing hard on a lens barrel past it's focus range, a bit of slip when reaching the end isn't a problem. While you might worry about the extra force of a focus motor, you calibrate motors so they don't apply force outside the focus range of the lens, so you won't have a problem there either. As long as you stay in the focus range of the lens barrel, the ring works perfectly, never slipping, hopping, or drifting. Credit: Broken Anchor
The ring can be fitted on any lens with a 60-90mm lens body diameter, which covers a surprisingly large array of lenses, especially still and vintage glass. Even on lenses with a larger front diameter, it was usually possible to slide the lens on from the back and find a secure fit. Moving the ring from lens to lens was surprisingly fast and east, just twisting the ring to tighten, and then pushing the button to release the arms.
The designer clearly worked hard to ensure that the fewest possible screws and access points are visible, making for an attractive accessory that is sleek and self-contained. There are screws on the lens mounting arms, but these come as something of a relief, since they give the option for repair in the future if for some reason one of the arms has an issue. While the construction is top notch and seems very durable, sometimes objects on a film set break not because they were made poorly but because, for example, the camera gets dropped off the back of a moving truck. Seeing screws, which can then be serviced, instead of internal clips, is a good sign that if the device takes some impact, limited repair and tweaking should be possible. Credit: Broken Anchor
The ZERO even comes in a surprisingly well thought-out box. Overall, if you are a filmmaker with a wide collection of lenses that require rings to work with follow focus devices, and you've been planning to buy an individual ring for each set, buying a single Broken Anchor ring could be a cost-effective alternative.
Broken Anchor is running a Kickstarter now with a launch price of $299 for the ZERO.
Tech Specs
Since Bandai Namco announced its VR Zone: Project I Can initiative last year, as well as the strong lineup of virtual reality games at this year's JAEPO, it was only a matter of time until the company opened up a bigger event space somewhere in Tokyo.
This new VR Zone will be a temporary installation but it will be a far bigger endeavor than the one that was held in Diver City last year.
Situated in Kabukichō in Shinjuku, this new event space will have 3,600 square meters of floor space and hold host to a variety of VR experiences.
As I said back when I went to the Project I Can exhibit in Diver City last year, it felt like Bandai Namco was experimenting with the future of arcades.
However, if we can get to play the excellent VOTOMS Battling again at this new location in Shinjuku, then I am entirely onboard with all of this.
While I am genuinely skeptical of VR when it comes to gaming, the arcades are in fact a much better fit for this kind of technology. Unlike on PC or console, arcade games can create their own bespoke controls and that in turn makes VR more viable.
This new event space then sounds an ideal way to test this approach and Kabukicho is a great location for this as well.
VR Zone Shinjuku will also be managed by Bandai Namco arcade staff and offer food and drinks. Whether this will use the same reservation setup as with the Project I Can exhibit is unclear but I am guessing due to the sheer size of this new venue that you will be able to walk in and play whatever you want.
The plan is to have VR Zone Shinjuku installed for the next few years, so you will have a better chance to check it out if you are ever visiting Tokyo.
In any case, it seems that Bandai Namco definitely has a long term strategy for VR in Japan and that's worth keeping a close eye on.

If video gaming is designed to be a form of escapism, why would anyone choose to escape to a dead-end, soul-sucker of a job?
"You play a border inspector at a contentious check-point," says Lucas Pope, 36, the developer responsible for the most unlikely of smash hits.
"People are coming into your booth, and they want to get from one side to the other. You've got to check their documents and make sure everything's in order before you let them through.
"It's hard to describe the game and make it sound fun."
Quite.
Papers, Please can lay claim to being the first ever paperwork simulator. You could say that's a void that nobody thought needed filling. You'd be right.
Making of Image copyright Lucas Pope "I intended to make Papers, Please in six months," Pope explains. "It got bigger than I expected along the way - my scope expanded a bit. In the end it took about nine months, which is not so bad. "When I was developing the game I kept a development log about what I was doing and how the game was coming along. "I would post early versions of the game and people would play it - the feedback, almost from the beginning, was really good. "So I had some confidence, but I had no idea it would get as popular as it did. It wasn't a game that I was making in order for it to be popular. "As far as what it cost me, it's hard to pin down. I could say nothing, literally - I bought a few pieces of software, but it was mostly just my time working on it. "And if I wasn't working on this, I'd be working on something else. "So, cost wise it was a pretty cheap project. The return's been pretty fantastic."
And yet, Mr Pope has somehow created a tense, gripping game - a claustrophobic thriller that has been soaked with praise by the critics.
"Papers, Please is self-evidently designed to make you think, it's not entirely meant to be fun," says Nicholas Lovell, from Gamesbrief.com.
"It's hard work."
Most of all it is an antidote, Mr Lovell says, to the all-blasting, all-killing romps that have historically populated the gaming charts.
And at Wednesday's video game Baftas, Papers, Please have a shot at being named "best game".
"It's really insane," Mr Pope says, almost embarrassed at the nomination. It's one of four awards he could win on the night.
Indie scene
Papers, Pleasebe appearance at the event will be made even sweeter because of the journey that lead to its creation.
In the same room - and with a considerably bigger entourage - will be Mr Pope's former employers, Naughty Dog. Their game, zombie-thriller The Last of Us, is also up for best game.
Mr Pope left the company after working on the massively selling Uncharted series and deciding to go it alone, to the understandable surprise of many of his colleagues.
"Leaving Naughty Dog was a really risky move," he says.
"Having this kind of success, and now being alongside them, is a big relief - I didn't pass up a great job and go on into ruin."
The independent developer scene is a mixture of people like Mr Pope - disenfranchised programmers who became sick of working on the nth shoot-'em-up sequel - and newcomers to the industry frustrated at a lack of entry-level jobs.

"If you're passionate about games you will make games," says Harvey Elliott, chairman of the Bafta games committee.
"It's a great case study of what you're capable of."
The amount of attention being heaped on indie games is growing, and the likes of Sony and Microsoft are carefully courting the best to release games on their consoles.
Experimental
It's a movement that is yielding some extremely creative results, argues Mr Lovell, and straying into a level of experimentation where big games companies don't dare to tread.
The competition Papers, Please is up for the "best game" award at the video game Baftas on Wednesday. The other nominees are: Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag (Ubisoft)
Grand Theft Auto 5 (Rockstar)
The Last of Us (Naughty Dog)
Super Mario 3D World (Nintendo)
Tearaway (Sony) Full list of categories and nominees here.
"Big developers absolutely could make this kind of games," he says. "In the same way that Hollywood could make thoughtful movies - but chooses to make the Avengers instead."
Independent developers have always existed, but of late there has been a perfect storm of new technology coming together to solve problems that kept indie games from competing on the biggest stages.
"I started in games when you needed to press discs and put them in expensive boxes and ship them to stores," says Mr Pope, who tried and failed to launch a games company in the 90s.
"That kind of up-front money was just insane. That's all gone now. Just getting from game to consumer is much cheaper now and much easier, and that only helps create this smaller and more experimental games."
And then there's the not-insignificant financial incentives.
While not pulling in the $1bn-plus revenue of Grand Theft Auto 5, Papers, Pleasebe commercial success is more than enough to turn heads.
Image caption Lucas Pope, an American, works from his home office in Japan
Mr Pope is coy about the exact revenues, but with over half a million copies sold, with the full-price set at $10 (£6), it's unquestionably a tidy little earner for a development team of one.
It all means that while Papers, Please be a surprise nominee at this year's Baftas, we should get used to seeing smaller titles muscling in from here on in.
"There will definitely be more of those titles coming through," says Harvey Elliott from Bafta.
"But equally we can't underestimate the quality of those big titles - it's a worthy battle."

Policy-makers have been charged with taking appropriate measures against the looming threat of climate change. But the success of these measures requires acceptance and support on the part of the public. With this in mind, politicians and climate scientists are looking for ways to make the subject, and the costly political measures associated with it, more tangible and easier for the general public to understand. "We looked into the question of whether - and if so, to what extent - the public's attitude to climate policy and the risks of climate change can be influenced," explains Thomas Bernauer, professor of political science at ETH Zurich. "Above all, we wanted to know whether it is better to provide economic justifications, such as the positive effects of climate policy on technological innovation and the labour market, and personal aspects like protection of our health, rather than to focus on conveying scientific facts and the risks of climate change." Previous studies by other researchers have pointed to the idea that an emotional and personal presentation of the issue may help political measures gain acceptance more easily.
We hear only what we want to hear
According to the recent study, there's no magic formula for making climate policy easier to "sell". "We all see the world through our own ideological prism," says Bernauer. It's not specific justifications, but rather preconceived ideas that ultimately decide whether people see climate protection as important and necessary. "Our opinions on climate policy vary according to factors such as socialisation, political attitudes, age, gender and education." Someone who has always supported green policies will find their point of view validated by the arguments, whereas those who have always been sceptical about climate change will not be influenced by reasoning based on economic or health grounds.
The study's results were based on an online survey of more than 1,600 Americans. Various justifications for costly climate protection measures were put to participants on a random basis, and the effect of these arguments on their attitudes to climate protection was then estimated. The survey is part of a five-year research project on public opinion and climate change. Funded by a grant from the European Research Council (ERC), Bernauer's team is investigating public opinion on climate protection in the US, China, Brazil, India, Germany and Switzerland.
No single argument is decisive
"The results of the study are certainly sobering in some respects," admits the ETH professor. But only when viewed from the perspective of climate protection: "Fundamentally, it's a good thing that people don't allow themselves to be easily influenced," stresses Bernauer. As far as communication in climate policy is concerned, the study's results suggest that in future a comprehensive mix of information on climate change and various justifications for climate protection will be necessary. Scientific information about the risks is just as important as messages on the implications for health, technology and the labour market.

As a brewer who enters competitions a decent amount, keeping my beer away from oxygen is important to me, particularly when it comes to packaging it in bottles from my kegs. My fears that oxygen in the bottle prior to filling would negatively impact my beer was born out of years of research that left me concerned if the utmost care wasn't taken to keep oxygen to a minimum, I'd end up wasting beer, an entry, and money. In my mind, oxidation could result in a great tasting beer bound for the medal circle ending up in that pitiful pile of bottles lingering around at the end of a competition, slated to be consumed by the often unfortunate volunteers.
And I'm not alone! Perhaps the most popular solution for bottling beer from kegs, the BeerGun by Blichmann Engineering is lauded by many for it's ability to flush bottles with CO2 prior to filling, reducing both the risk of oxidation and the worries of many a competitive brewer. Then again, a Google search for “bottling from keg” produces a list of DIY solutions that are missing this component with users swearing it works just fine and often reporting positive competition results. As a believer in the havoc oxygen can wreak when introduced at packaging, I looked forward to putting it to the test in this xBmt!
| PURPOSE |
To evaluate the differences between a beer bottled from a keg using a method to reduce oxygen uptake and the same beer bottled from a keg with no effort to mitigate oxygen.
| METHODS |
In hopes of ensuring any impact caused by the variable would be easily noticed by tasters, I decided to brew a delicately flavored Cream Ale.
Cream Sha Boogie Bop
Recipe Details Batch Size Boil Time IBU SRM Est. OG Est. FG ABV 5.5 gal 60 min 20.7 IBUs 3.2 SRM 1.050 1.010 5.3 % Actuals 1.05 1.01 5.2 % Fermentables Name Amount % Pale Malt (2 Row) US 4 lbs 39.75 Pilsner (2 Row) Ger 3.25 lbs 32.3 Corn, Flaked 1.375 lbs 13.66 Acid Malt 12 oz 7.45 Cane (Beet) Sugar 11 oz 6.83 Hops Name Amount Time Use Form Alpha % Sterling 16 g 70 min Boil Pellet 8 Liberty 18 g 5 min Boil Pellet 5 Yeast Name Lab Attenuation Temperature German Bock Lager (WLP833) White Labs 73% 48°F - 55°F Notes Water Profile: Yellow Balanced in Bru'n Water Spreadsheet
A couple days before brewing, I made a starter of Omega Yeast Labs German Lager I from some slurry given to me by my friends at Helicon Brewing Company.
When brew day arrived, I weighed out and milled the grain while my strike water was heating up.
With the strike water ready, I mashed in to hit my target temperature then took a small sample of wort to about 15 minutes into the mash that confirmed I'd nailed the proper pH.
Once the 60 minute mash rest was complete, I collected the first runnings and performed a batch sparge to reach my preboil volume.
The wort was then boiled with hops added at the times laid out in the recipe.
At the conclusion of the boil, I quickly chilled the wort to my desired fermentation temperature before racking it to a sanitized fermentor.
A hydrometer reading showed I hit my target OG spot on.
I pitched the yeast and held the beer at 62°F/17°C 3 days, which is when I noticed slowing activity, so I gently increased the fermentation temperature to 68°F/20°C over the next few days.
With activity absent a few days later, I took a hydrometer measurement confirming my target FG had be reached. I reduced the temperature of the beer for a cold crash, fined with gelatin, then racked to a keg. The beer was briefly burst carbonated in my keezer before being set to serving pressure and left alone for a week of cold conditioning. Once I determined the beer to be adequately clear and carbonated, it was time came to introduce the variable.
Utilizing the popular Blichmann BeerGun, one set of bottles received a 45 second dose of CO2 to purge them of oxygen before being filled with beer and capped.
For the second set of bottles, I used the very simple picnic tap method without any attempt to reduce oxygen. While I know of brewers who have done well in competitions with beer bottled this way, the sloppiness of this approach made me cringe, as I didn't even use a length of tubing to minimize splashing like it seems most people do.
Both sets of bottles were then marked and stored in my warm laundry room to somewhat simulate the conditions a beer might undergo when sent to a competition.
Having friends in the beer industry definitely has its perks, especially for a nerdy science guy like me. As a fun side xBmt, I ran some samples from both conditions to Roundabout Brewery immediately after bottling where co-owner Steve Sloan and his wife, Dyana, graciously helped me measure actual oxygen levels using their orbisphere.
It is suggested to take these measurements immediately after packaging in order to get an accurate oxygen level at that time, otherwise the amount of oxygen introduced when bottling is essentially “consumed by the beer.” Even the short drive between bottling and measurement had me a little concerned, but I figured something would be better than nothing. Over several trials, the beer bottled with the BeerGun averaged 26.5 ppb and 43 ppb of oxygen for non-shaken and shaken samples, respectively. As predicted, the beer bottled using the picnic tap averaged 250 ppb and 700 ppb of oxygen for the non-shaken and shaken samples, respectively. No question, these methods resulted in drastically different oxygen levels present in the packaged beer.
Purely to satiate my own curiosity, I also tested oxygen levels in beers bottled using a picnic tap attached to a length of tubing with a stopper to create back-pressure, similar to the Brü Bottler. The non-shaken sample clocked in at 45 ppb of oxygen while the shaken beer contained 117 ppb, still more than the beers bottles using the BeerGun, but quite a bit lower than those bottled without the tubing. This seems to support the notion that bottom filling may actually push oxygen out of bottles.
After 3 weeks in my laundry room, I moved all of the bottled beers to cold storage and let them hang out for a few days. Before collecting data, I opened bottles from both batches to see how they held up. Both were clear, carbonated, and identical in color, which went against my expectation since oxidation is said to have a darkening effect on beer.
| RESULTS |
A total of 41 people with varying levels of experience participated in this xBmt while hanging at the Grist House. Each participant was served 1 sample of the beer bottled using the BeerGun and 2 samples of the beer bottled using the picnic tap then asked to identify the sample that was unique. Given the sample size, 19 tasters (p<0.05) would have had to correctly identify the beer as being different in order to reach statistical significance. In the end, only 15 participants (p=0.38) accurately identified the unique sample, indicating in inability to reliably distinguish a beer bottled from a keg using methods to reduce oxygen from the same beer bottled with no effort taken to reduce oxygen.
Arguably meaningless since the xBmt failed to achieve statistical significance, I figured I'd share the preference data to satisfy curious minds. Still blind to the variable in question, the 15 people who accurately selected the unique sample in the triangle test were further instructed to compare only the two different beers then asked about their preference. In all, 8 tasters reported preferring the beer bottled with the BeerGun, 3 said they liked the beer bottled with a picnic tap more, 2 had no preference despite noting a difference, and 2 reported noticing no difference between the beers.
My Impressions: I attempted 3 semi-blind triangle tests a few days after bottling out of which I selected the odd-beer-out twice, meaning the difference was not stark enough for me to nail it every time. To my palate, the beer bottled with the picnic tap seemed to take on a slight vinous note that I believe assisted my choice, and the fact my wife picked the unique sample the one time she tried was validating. Then, I tried again 3 weeks later in preparation for data collection and was unable to reliably differentiate the beers, to the point ended up guessing and was wrong 3 out of 4 times. The fresh corny sweetness I perceived when fresh had changed into a cooked honey character with the same vinous note I detected a few weeks earlier, only this time it was present in both beers.
| DISCUSSION |
Oxidation is a known phenomenon that is objectively measurable, there's no arguing this fact. However, the extent to which its impact on beer is perceivable is, well…
Screw it, I'm just gonna come out and say it– I am truly perplexed by these results, they go against everything I know to be true about oxygen and packaging. And I'm not just relying on the data from the blind participants here, I couldn't tell the damn beers apart myself, which has really got my head spinning! We know oxygen during packaging negatively impacts beer, it's why commercial breweries spend oodles of money on equipment to keep it to a minimum. We also know, based on objective measurements with an orbisphere, the beer bottled using the BeerGun contained notably less oxygen than the beer bottled straight from a picnic tap. So why the hell didn't they taste different enough for people to tell them apart?!
I'm so baffled, I've found myself inventing potential reasons for these results, for example, perhaps the period of warm storage led to a convergence of oxidation such that both beers were affected to the point of being indistinguishable. Then again, if this is true, what about the efforts made by many to reduce oxygen when bottling beers that then get placed in warm boxes and bumped around for days on their way to a competition? It's also possible certain people aren't as sensitive to oxidation character as others, which might help explain the data showing a rather strong general preference for the low oxygen beer among those who were correct on the triangle test. Or maybe the beer had some other fault that caused both to be equally oxidized regardless of packaging method. I really don't know, but combined with findings from the recent oxidized kegging xBmt, I've found myself with far more questions than answers.
I absolutely plan to continue exploring oxidation during packaging, admittedly in hopes of confirming my own biases, though open to having them chipped away at as well. Has this xBmt inspired me start filling bottles from kegs with a teaspoon and funnel because it obviously doesn't matter? Nope! I recently sent some beers to the National Homebrew Competition that were packaged with every effort made to eliminate oxygen pickup, and that's what I'll continue to do if only for the sake of insurance.

The release notes for the first beta of tvOS 9.2 reveal that Bluetooth keyboard support is now baked into the operating system. tvOS 9.2 is currently available to developers for testing ahead of a public release.The notes accompanying tvOS 9.2 also reveal that users will be able to group apps in folders on the home screen. Though the new Apple TV shipped without support for folders, developers found evidence in the tvOS code that app folders were in the works.tvOS 9.2 also includes support for MapKit, allowing developers to utilize Apple's mapping tools for their third-party Apple TV apps.Apple has also changed the user interface of its app switcher feature in tvOS 9.2. Users can invoke the app switcher by double-pressing the home button on the Siri remote.With tvOS 9.2, Siri voice support has also been added for U.S. Spanish and French Canadian. In the U.K., Siri support for U.K. English, Australian English, and U.S. English are also available.
The crisis for Google over advertisers boycotting YouTube because of ads placed next to hate-speech videos that first set off a storm in the U.K. has now crossed to the U.S.: AT&T on Wednesday said it will not advertise on YouTube until the telco has a guarantee the internet giant has fixed the problem.
“We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,” AT&T said in a statement. “Until Google can ensure this won't happen again, we are removing our ads from Google's non-search platforms.”
[UPDATE, 4:10 p.m. ET: Verizon also said it has pulled ads from YouTube and Google's non-search ad networks over the issue. “We take careful measure to ensure our brand is not impacted negatively,” Verizon said in a statement. “Once we were notified that our ads were appearing on non-sanctioned websites, we took immediate action to suspend this type of ad placement and launched an investigation. We are working with all of our digital advertising partners to understand the weak links so we can prevent this from happening in the future.” AT&T and Verizon are two of the biggest advertisers in the U.S.]
[According to the Times of London, which initially reported the AT&T move to suspend ads from YouTube, other American advertisers pulling business from YouTube include car-rental company Enterprise and pharmaceutical firm GSK. More than 250 companies and organizations in the U.K. have already suspended ads on YouTube, the paper reported.]
In a statement, a Google rep said: “We don't comment on individual customers but as announced, we've begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear. We're also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers' brands.”
The backlash against ads placed in extremist YouTube videos began last week in the U.K., when it came to light that some ads were appearing against YouTube videos posted by American white nationalists, anti-gay preachers and radical Islamic groups. British advertisers that have said they are pulling ads from YouTube include McDonald's, the BBC, L'Oréal, Marks & Spencer, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, the Guardian, Audi, Channel 4 and Havas' British unit.
In response to the chorus of complaints from the U.K. ad community, Google chief business officer Philipp Schindler earlier this week outlined a series of steps the company is taking to allay advertisers' concerns. “We know advertisers don't want their ads next to content that doesn't align with their values,” Schindler wrote in a blog post. “So starting today, we're taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content.”
Schindler also said the YouTube team is taking a “hard look” at its guidelines for what content is permitted on the service, beyond what is considered acceptable for ad monetization.
YouTube's community guidelines already broadly forbid users from posting hate speech, as well as other content like pornography. But how the policy applies to individual videos requires a judgment call. YouTube's policies define hate speech as content “that promotes or condones violence against individuals or groups based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, nationality, veteran status, or sexual orientation/gender identity,” or whose primary purpose is “inciting hatred” on the basis of those attributes.
As the Senate moves toward getting rid of the ability of 41 senators to block Supreme Court nominees, moderates could see their profiles rise in any post “nuclear option” reality with a renewed emphasis on party unity.
Conventional wisdom is that presidents would be able to pick more stridently partisan nominees for the high court if the risk of a super majority filibuster is eliminated. But such a procedural change would also put a bigger target on moderate members of the majority.
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said he has the votes to move ahead with the process of changing the chamber's precedents by allowing a simple majority to break the Democratic filibuster of Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill a vacant Supreme Court seat.
The result might be something like what happened this year with the efforts to repeal and replace the 2010 health care law, according to filibuster expert Sarah Binder of George Washington University and the Brookings Institution. When the chambers consider legislation where a simple majority is required, such as the budget reconciliation process, all the focus is on various factions of GOP lawmakers.
“That 60 vote threshold takes the spotlight off of the majority, as we've seen with Gorsuch. Moving to simple majority cloture would make every Republican vote pivotal to confirmation,” Binder said. “There's no minority party to blame for blocking a nominee.”
Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican known for moderate stances particularly on social policy, said she was well aware that the “nuclear option” vote will change the calculation going forward.
“One of my concerns is it makes it more likely that presidents will submit more ideological choices. And I don't think that's good for the court,” Collins said. “But unfortunately the Democrats put us in this position by making it clear that they will block an imminently well-qualified individual.”
Should President Donald Trump get a second Supreme Court nomination with the same 52 seats in Republican hands, Collins and her colleagues would be sure to face more outside lobbying and advertising.
End Citizens United, a group opposed to Gorsuch and dedicated to trying to overturn the Supreme Court Citizens United decision that deregulated most campaign spending, has already worked against potentially vulnerable Republicans like Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada, who is up for re-election in 2018, but that would only ramp up with an effective simple majority threshold.
“We will evaluate future nominees based on their record on money in politics and if, like Judge Gorsuch, they are bad on the issue we'll oppose them. That means pushing all senators — targeting Republicans as well as Democrats to ensure they don't get to 50 votes,” said End Citizens United spokesman Adam Bozzi. “If Mitch McConnell takes the unprecedented step of destroying the Senate's filibuster, there will be an extraordinary amount of pressure on Republicans like Collins, Murkowski, Heller and others to do the right thing.”
Democratic Sen. Christopher S. Murphy said that in his view the Gorsuch example makes the case that more moderate Republicans would be unlikely to rebel in the future.
“I think this is an extreme judge. Just because Gorsuch has a nice disposition doesn't mean his judicial philosophy isn't extreme,” the Connecticut Democrat said. “So I think you're watching — you're getting the answer to your question right now.”
Binder made that point, noting that Gorsuch is poised for confirmation with a very narrow Republican majority.
“If it's a Harriet Miers nominee, there could be safety in numbers to derail the nominee long before a vote. If it's an extremely conservative, pro-life nominee, well, we've got that in Judge Gorsuch, and Collins and [Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski] seem poised to vote to confirm him,” Binder said.
The nomination of Miers to the high court by President George W. Bush was withdrawn before she could face what was increasingly seen as a likely defeat by a Senate controlled by Republicans.
Conservative and liberal groups for and against nominees will be putting particular pressure on the edges of the majority particularly if a seat opens up when the future of decisions like the landmark Roe v. Wade abortion case appear to be in the balance.
“I think you'll have much more extreme nominees now. I'm not sure you'll ever get a moderate voice on the courts. As little as the pressure to find a moderate nominee is, it's completely gone,” Murphy said. “Republican presidents can pick very conservative nominees and Democratic presidents can pick very progressive nominees.”
Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, suggested the only real consultation with the opposite party would take place when there's a division of power.
“It depends on the president and the makeup of Congress. When the president is in the majority in the Senate, it gives them a pretty strong [incentive] to push through a nominee,” Durbin said.
Collins said it would hard to make predictions about future choices for the highest court by Trump or any other future president with a majority in the Senate.
“For my part, what I would try to do is to exercise the advice and consent provision of the Constitution by giving advice to the White House on which nominees I believe would serve our country well,” Collins said. “And I give Vice President [Mike Pence] a great deal of credit for reaching out to members like me in the selection process that led to Neil Gorsuch.”
Sen. Roger Wicker noted that outside spending and pressure on the majority is not new, even when the idea of filibustering a Supreme Court nomination was not really on the table.
“I think it will be focused where the whip count says votes are gettable, you know there was a lot of outside advertising on Bork,” the Mississippi Republican said of the failed nomination of Robert Bork in 1987. “So there'll still be that, it's just that we won't have the threat of a partisan filibuster.”

We need to stop telling people to ‘go for a run' to fix their depression
We need to stop telling people to ‘go for a run' to fix their depression
Anyone with any form of mental illness has heard it.
An entirely well-meaning bit of advice. A genuine attempt to help.
‘You should go for a run'.*
*Or ‘you should try exercising', or ‘you should get outside more', or ‘you don't need medication, you just need to get those endorphins going'.
The advice is its own brand of extremely irritating.
Not just because this handy tip completely dismisses the severity of someone's mental illness (medication can help, therapy is often necessary, and running isn't always enough to ‘fix' things), but because I know that, in some small way, the person saying it is right.
I know that, while exercising won't make me completely better, going for a run would help.
When I started experiencing depression in my teens, I sunk into it for years.
Then, one day, I started going to the gym.
I started doing regular workouts. I felt my mood lift.
(Picture: Liberty Antonia Sadler)
Through university, I noticed that as long as I got enough sleep and did pilates a few times a week, I felt a lot better. I still had low moods and worries, but I wouldn't let myself fall too deeply into that pit.
Advertisement

Then I graduated, started work, and out of nowhere, depression hit me harder than it had before – along with a fun new side of anxiety and obsessive worries.
Suddenly I couldn't find the energy to get out of bed at the weekend. I would try to do pilates – something I used to love – and find myself slumping down mid-lunge and lying back on the mat, staring at the ceiling.
When getting up and getting dressed just felt like the hardest thing in the world, going for a run or hitting the gym felt impossible.
I moved house, cancelled my gym membership, and lost the motivation to sign up for a new one.
I let my trainers gather dust.
(Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)
The simplest things grew huge and insurmountable in my mind. My anxiety made me scared to leave the house, worrying about all the dangerous things outside and all the things that could go wrong.
On the days when my depression eased and I managed to lace up my trainers, my anxiety would jump in and tell me all the ways that going for a run outdoors was a terrible idea.
I lost any excitement about getting healthy or feeling stronger.
I hated how my body was turning soft, how I struggled to catch my breath as I walked upstairs.
But instead of that serving as motivation to start working out again, it just sent me spiraling into self-hatred.
I hated my body. I hated myself for not being able to do something so simple. I hated my brain for stopping me from doing something I knew would help.
(Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)
It's now been two years since I went to the gym. It's been months since I last attempted pilates, and a year since I actually made my way through a session without giving up.

It's frustrating, because I know that working out would help.
I feel like I've lost my old self, the one who loved pilates and running, who was learning to do the splits and training to do pull-ups.
I know that while exercise wouldn't fix things (because endorphins, while brilliant, are a mood-booster, not a magical fix for mental illness), it'd lift my mood and make me feel a little better. It'd distract me from the niggling doubt in my mind that the boiler's about to explode and my phone will set itself alight.
And that's why when my dad, my friends, strangers on the internet tell me to ‘go for a run' to fix my mental illness, it's more than irritating, it hurts.
(Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)
It's a reminder that I'm failing to do something everyone else finds simple, that I can't do something that could help.
It's just a reminder that something's going wrong in my brain. And that's the opposite of helpful.
I can't tell people that, obviously.
To every person telling me I don't ‘need' medication, that fresh air and working up a sweat is the natural cure, I've never said ‘hey, please don't bash medication that's helping me' or ‘I know, but working up a sweat is pretty f***ing hard when you can't get out of bed.'
I've smiled. I've thanked them for caring. Because what else can you do? They don't mean any harm, they're just genuinely trying to help – by recommending something that's helped them.
(Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)
But what a people need to understand is that depression is more than a bad mood. It's more than just the everyday, occasional low feelings that everyone has.

Exercising helps everyone to feel a little better. But when your base mood is low enough to be suicidal, going for a run isn't enough – and suggesting that it can be a replacement for medication or therapy just shows a profound misunderstanding of just how serious someone's mental health issues can be.
Positioning exercise and getting outside as the ‘better' fix than medication and therapy isn't helpful to anyone – all it does is make people feel rubbish about needing to take meds.
So this is me, calmly, kindly asking people to please, please stop telling me that going for a run will make me feel better.
(Picture: Mmuffin for metro.co.uk)
Yes, it will. But it won't make me entirely okay. It won't fix everything. And even if it would, it's not as simple as getting up, putting on my trainers, and going.
Try to be a little more understanding. Don't make me feel rubbish about being unable to do something that seems like such an obvious fix – I already feel rubbish enough.
If you can see that someone's struggling and reckon that exercise would help, or remember how much they loved doing something before their mental illness became overwhelming, don't judge them for being unable to do it alone.

Offer to go with them. Set up a plan. Give them motivation.
Help me get out of bed and put on my trainers instead of shaming me for finding it too hard to do something that seems so simple.
And remember that antidepressants and therapy will help me do that, too.

Remember just Tuesday morning, when we were discussing how Republican senators in purplish states were taking a big gamble if they agreed to stonewall the president's constitutional duty to appoint a replacement for Antonin Scalia?
Remember this scene from the most underrated American film of all time, Little Big Man?
Well, you go down there, if you got the nerve, Senator.
"We believe the American people need to decide who is going to make this appointment rather than a lame duck president," said Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TN). When asked if they would start the process after the new president took office or if they would consider doing it in the lame duck session, Cornyn replied "No, after the next president is selected. That way the American people have a voice in the process." The Republican members of the Judiciary Commitee were unanimous in agreeing not to move forward with any Obama nominee for the Supreme Court, said Cornyn, who was in the meeting. Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), who was not in the meeting, later said that GOP senators were told at their weekly lunch that the Judiciary Committee Republicans were in unanimous agreement on the strategy. Meanwhile, Judiciary Committee Chair Charles Grassley (R-IA) and the rest of the committee Republicans sent a letter to McConnell outlining their plan to block any Obama nominee for Scalia's seat. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said that "there's no use starting a process that's not going to go anywhere and we are going to let the next president decide," when asked why there would be no hearings. When TPM asked if he had political concerns about the decision not to move forward with a nominee, Graham responded."I have zero concerns politically." "I think this is what they would do," Graham said referring to Senate Democrats. "For them to say they wouldn't do this is a lie."
The president's next move is obvious.
He finds the most ridiculously qualified candidate he can find among whatever demographic or social group is most disadvantageous to the Republicans, and he puts that candidate up as quickly as possible. He does event after event, with the candidate by his side. He campaigns for Senate candidates in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Illinois, all places with vulnerable Republican incumbents, and he brings the nominee along with him.
To elect a Democratic president in the fall is to elect this wonderfully qualified person, a credit to the American dream and to our greatness as a people, to the Supreme Court as well. Could it be that the Republican Party's capacity to walk in lockstep off a cliff–known to medical science as The Schiavo Syndrome–has now surpassed the Democratic Party's capacity to step on its own dick when presented with a political opportunity? If the president has brought about that turn of events, his whole two terms have been worth electing him in the first place.
The latest Keurig K-Cup machines have a dirty secret: built into the little ground coffee pods that so many knows and love is a nefarious form of DRM. A special ink found only on real cups (and damaged by use) ensures that you can only use “real” K-Cups, thereby preventing you from making your own pirate cups.
But freedom's just another word for sticking it to the man, and the Rogers Family Company, owners of Gourmet-Coffee.com, is fighting back with the Freedom Clip.
Their Freedom Clip fits inside of your Keurig and tricks the DRM sensor into thinking every cup is authorized. The family writes:
￼It does this by visually identifying a special ink on the lidding. Any cup without this “special” ink is rejected by the machine thus ensuring Keurig's® marketplace dominance. While other companies are quickly working to adopt this special ink to their cups we at Rogers Family Company® believe that your right to choose any option is imperative. That's why we have developed this easily installed “Freedom Clip” for Keurig 2.0® brewers. Just place the clip in your new brewer and it will see all k-cup type pods as “Authorized K-Cups®” . This clip is our gift to you. Now go forth and brew with freedom.
Brew with freedom! It's silly for Keurig to force DRM on their machines and cracks like this are an obvious reaction to their decision to restrict users. The pods, which are immensely wasteful in the first place, have been a target for hackers for a few years now. Videos have appeared telling you how to refill your own cups and now tools like the Freedom Clip ensure that draconian coffee DRM shall not stand.
The K-Cup patent expired in 2012, leaving Keurig in a bind. Rather than embracing manufacturers and offering lower-priced licenses, the company decided to treat customers like criminals. This never works and it's especially tough to implement when your customers are all jacked up on Starbucks. You can get your Freedom Clip for free from the folks at Gourmet-Coffee.com and, once again, stick it to the man.
Manchester United's interim manager Ryan Giggs got off to a winning start against Norwich (Picture: AP Photo)
Ryan Giggs chances of being appointed the next Manchester United manager on a full-time basis have been dealt a blow as his own father admitted he wouldn't trust him to run the club.
The 40-year-old, who was appointed interim manager at Old Trafford last week following the sacking of David Moyes, got his managerial career off to the perfect start with a 4-0 thrashing of Norwich.
A poll on Match of the Day revealed that almost 70 per cent of United fans are keen for him to get the job permanently.
But it seems that not everyone is so keen for him to land the role.
The former Wales international's own dad, Danny Wilson, dismissed his son's chances, telling the Sun on Sunday: ‘I wouldn't trust him to run a bath — let alone Manchester United.'
According to the newspaper, the pair haven't spoken since allegations about Giggs' private life were exposed in the media – and the latest outburst is unlikely to improve relations.
Metacrap: Putting the torch to seven straw-men of the meta-utopia
Version 1.3: 26 August 2001
BACK TO TOP
0.1. Version History
Version 1.2, May 23 2001. Tweaked intro (Thanks, Fred).
Version 1.1, May 18 2001. Changed section orders for better organization. (Thanks, Raffi). Clarified "metrics" in 2.6 (Thanks, Andy).

BACK TO TOP
1. Introduction
If everyone subscribed to such a system and create good metadata for the purposes of describing their goods, services and information, it would be a trivial matter to search the Internet for highly qualified, context-sensitive results: a fan could find all the downloadable music in a given genre, a manufacturer could efficiently discover suppliers, travelers could easily choose a hotel room for an upcoming trip.
A world of exhaustive, reliable metadata would be a utopia. It's also a pipe-dream, founded on self-delusion, nerd hubris and hysterically inflated market opportunities.
BACK TO TOP
2. The problems
BACK TO TOP
2.1 People lie
That's why:
A search for any commonly referenced term at a search-engine like Altavista will often turn up at least one porn link in the first ten results.
Your mailbox is full of spam with subject lines like "Re: The information you requested."
Publisher's Clearing House sends out advertisements that holler "You may already be a winner!"
Press-releases have gargantuan lists of empty buzzwords attached to them.
BACK TO TOP
2.2 People are lazy
But info-civilians are remarkably cavalier about their information. Your clueless aunt sends you email with no subject line, half the pages on Geocities are called "Please title this page" and your boss stores all of his files on his desktop with helpful titles like "UNTITLED.DOC."
This laziness is bottomless. No amount of ease-of-use will end it. To understand the true depths of meta-laziness, download ten random MP3 files from Napster. Chances are, at least one will have no title, artist or track information -- this despite the fact that adding in this info merely requires clicking the "Fetch Track Info from CDDB" button on every MP3-ripping application.
Short of breaking fingers or sending out squads of vengeful info-ninjas to add metadata to the average user's files, we're never gonna get there.
BACK TO TOP
2.3 People are stupid
Take eBay: every seller there has a damned good reason for double-checking their listings for typos and misspellings. Try searching for "plam" on eBay. Right now, that turns up nine typoed listings for "Plam Pilots." Misspelled listings don't show up in correctly-spelled searches and hence garner fewer bids and lower sale-prices. You can almost always get a bargain on a Plam Pilot at eBay.
The fine (and gross) points of literacy -- spelling, punctuation, grammar -- elude the vast majority of the Internet's users. To believe that J. Random Users will suddenly and en masse learn to spell and punctuate -- let alone accurately categorize their information according to whatever hierarchy they're supposed to be using -- is self-delusion of the first water.
BACK TO TOP
2.4 Mission: Impossible -- know thyself
Simple observation demonstrates the fallacy of this assumption. When Nielsen used log-books to gather information on the viewing habits of their sample families, the results were heavily skewed to Masterpiece Theater and Sesame Street. Replacing the journals with set-top boxes that reported what the set was actually tuned to showed what the average American family was really watching: naked midget wrestling, America's Funniest Botched Cosmetic Surgeries and Jerry Springer presents: "My daughter dresses like a slut!"
Ask a programmer how long it'll take to write a given module, or a contractor how long it'll take to fix your roof. Ask a laconic Southerner how far it is to the creek. Better yet, throw darts -- the answer's likely to be just as reliable.
People are lousy observers of their own behaviors. Entire religions are formed with the goal of helping people understand themselves better; therapists rake in billions working for this very end.
Why should we believe that using metadata will help J. Random User get in touch with her Buddha nature?
BACK TO TOP
2.5 Schemas aren't neutral
Nothing: Black holes Everything: Matter: Earth: Planets Washing Machines Wind: Oxygen Poo-gas Fire: Nuclear fission Nuclear fusion "Mean Devil Woman" Louisiana Hot-Sauce
This presumes that there is a "correct" way of categorizing ideas, and that reasonable people, given enough time and incentive, can agree on the proper means for building a hierarchy.
Nothing could be farther from the truth. Any hierarchy of ideas necessarily implies the importance of some axes over others. A manufacturer of small, environmentally conscious washing machines would draw a hierarchy that looks like this:
Energy consumption: Water consumption: Size: Capacity: Reliability
Color: Size: Programmability: Reliability
BACK TO TOP
2.6 Metrics influence results
Ranking axes are mutually exclusive: software that scores high for security scores low for convenience, desserts that score high for decadence score low for healthiness. Every player in a metadata standards body wants to emphasize their high-scoring axes and de-emphasize (or, if possible, ignore altogether) their low-scoring axes.
It's wishful thinking to believe that a group of people competing to advance their agendas will be universally pleased with any hierarchy of knowledge. The best that we can hope for is a detente in which everyone is equally miserable.
BACK TO TOP
2.7 There's more than one way to describe something
"No, I'm not watching cartoons! It's cultural anthropology."
"This isn't smut, it's art."
"It's not a bald spot, it's a solar panel for a sex-machine."
Reasonable people can disagree forever on how to describe something. Arguably, your Self is the collection of associations and descriptors you ascribe to ideas. Requiring everyone to use the same vocabulary to describe their material denudes the cognitive landscape, enforces homogeneity in ideas.
And that's just not right.
BACK TO TOP
3. Reliable metadata
Of course not. Metadata can be quite useful, if taken with a sufficiently large pinch of salt. The meta-utopia will never come into being, but metadata is often a good means of making rough assumptions about the information that floats through the Internet.
Certain kinds of implicit metadata is awfully useful, in fact. Google exploits metadata about the structure of the World Wide Web: by examining the number of links pointing at a page (and the number of links pointing at each linker), Google can derive statistics about the number of Web-authors who believe that that page is important enough to link to, and hence make extremely reliable guesses about how reputable the information on that page is.
This sort of observational metadata is far more reliable than the stuff that human beings create for the purposes of having their documents found. It cuts through the marketing bullshit, the self-delusion, and the vocabulary collisions.
Taken more broadly, this kind of metadata can be thought of as a pedigree: who thinks that this document is valuable? How closely correlated have this person's value judgments been with mine in times gone by? This kind of implicit endorsement of information is a far better candidate for an information-retrieval panacea than all the world's schema combined.
Story highlights West previously said that had he voted, he would have voted for Trump
West met with Trump at Trump Tower in December
Washington (CNN) Kanye West deleted all of his tweets defending his meeting with President Donald Trump sometime between Sunday night and Monday morning.
West, who met with Trump at Trump Tower in December, explained his meeting with the then-President-elect in the series of now-deleted tweets amid intense backlash from fans and friends like John Legend.
"I wanted to meet with Trump today to discuss multicultural issues," West tweeted on December 13.
"These issues included bullying, supporting teachers, modernizing curriculums, and violence in Chicago," he added.
"I feel it is important to have a direct line of communication with our future President if we truly want change," he continued in a third tweet.
A top official at the Republican National Committee, Sean Spicer, bragged about launching a "Willie Horton-Style" attack ad against Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine one day before the vice presidential debate.
After being criticized for praising a style of attack ad that was considered too ugly even for politics, Spicer deleted the Tweet about two hours after it was published.
The new anti-Kaine digital ad he was referring to says that Kaine "consistently protected" the "worst kinds of people," pointing to his legal defense of convicted violent felons.
The now-infamous Willie Horton ad was used against Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis by challenger George H.W. Bush in the 1988 campaign.
When Dukakis was governor of Massachusetts, Horton, who was serving a life sentence for murder, raped a woman during a weekend furlough from prison.
The ad played into racial fears and is credited for costing Dukakis the election. But it was also widely condemned and Lee Atwater, the former chair of the Republican National Committee who approved the ad, later apologized for it.
Spicer tried to defend his Tweet, saying he was just quoting the headline of an article reporting on the ad.
to be clear (I know facts are not a strong suit of yours) we/I never used the term - your fellow journalists @rollcall did https://t.co/bSSoqcPXnt — Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) October 3, 2016
Here's a picture of the original tweet:
Titanfall publisher Electronic Arts sold 925,000 copies of the multiplayer shooter during the month of March, said Peter Moore, EA's chief operating officer, during an investor call today.
EA launched Titanfall on Windows PC and Xbox One on March 11, so those sales came during the last three weeks of the month. Moore cited sales numbers from the NPD Group, so the 925,000 figures only includes sales of retail disc copies of Titanfall in the U.S. — not any copies sold outside the U.S., or digital copies sold through Xbox Live and Origin. According to the NPD Group, Titanfall was the best-selling game during March 2014.
Moore added that sales of the Xbox 360 version of Titanfall, which was released April 8, are "off to a great start as well." Earlier in the call, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said that the publisher has signed a new publishing agreement with Titanfall developer Respawn Entertainment under which EA will be "working with Respawn to bring new Titanfall experiences to players worldwide."
Gin is one of my favorite spirits and I have spent the best part of my time over the past 10 years teaching people about its history, production, virtues and cocktails. I have spoken about the spirit at events such as the International Association of Culinary Professionals and Tales of the Cocktail. When my good friend Allen Katz first started to develop his own gin recipes, I jumped at the opportunity to help. He spent over a year perfecting his recipes and the result was two amazing and unique gins that are being produced in Brooklyn. I believe gin to be the quintessential cocktail spirit, and Allen's work has inspired me to begin working on my own gin. Here are 10 things you might not know about the spirit, along with distillery tour information and a cocktail recipe:
1. Gin is for cocktails – not on its own
You can drink tequila and mescal as shots, and vodka is served chilled with food (zakuski) in its native land. Bourbon, rye and whiskey drinkers might add some ice or a splash of water. Gin is meant to be mixed, however, as the botanicals (herbs, spices etc.) come to life in cocktails and add complexity to the drink. This is why so many classic cocktails call for gin.
2. There are more classic cocktails made with gin than with any other spirit
Negroni, Ramos Gin Fizz, Martinez, Gin Rickey, Red Snapper, Tom Collins, White Lady, Hanky Panky, Clover Club, Alexander, French 75, Gimlet, Vesper, Singapore Sling, Silver Bronx, Pegu Club, Bee's Knees, Southside. And that is just scratching the surface!
3. Holland made gin first
Gin is England's national spirit and there are few things more English than a refreshing gin & tonic. Most of the most famous gins you see around the world hail from the UK, so it is forgivable to think that the spirit first came from here. The English actually discovered gin when they were fighting the Thirty Years' War in the 17th century in Holland and saw Dutch soldiers drinking Jenever to boost morale before heading into battle. The term “Dutch Courage” was born, and the English brought the idea of making and drinking gin back with them. It would take another 150 years before they would have their own version.
4. London dry gin is not always from London
Gin does not have the same geographical restrictions as spirits such as cognac, scotch or tequila. Only a tiny handful of London dry gins are actually made in the city. There are, however, 13 gins that have a “geographical indication.” The most famous of these is Plymouth gin, which has been made in Plymouth, England since 1793.
5. One man deserves recognition
Desmond Payne is currently the master distiller at Beefeater and has been there for more than 17 years. He formerly held the same position at Plymouth, giving him more experience making fine gin than anyone else. He also created Beefeater 24, which incorporates tea into the distillation process and is a great ingredient for punches.
6. A martini means gin
A martini consists of gin, dry vermouth and optional bitters. When the golden age of the martini was in full swing, most people in cocktail drinking nations had not yet tried vodka. During the era of the three-martini lunch, Smirnoff released a very clever campaign, “Vodka leaves you breathless,” that combined with the cool of James Bond to help vodka hijack gin's place in the iconic drink.
7. Gin can be used for medicinal purposes
In 1269, the first major mention of juniper-based health-related tonics appeared in a Dutch publication. Ever since, gin has had a history of being used “for medicinal purposes.” The Royal Navy mixed gin with lime cordial to stop scurvy, and angostura settled the stomach at sea. Tonic water with quinine was anti-malarial, giving them a great excuse to drink more gin and tonics.
8. Gin is flavored vodka
The most usual production method for gin is to distill botanicals, such as juniper, coriander, citrus peel, cinnamon, almond or liquorice, with neutral grain alcohol. Making gin is like flavoring vodka, except that botanicals are always natural. A skilled gin distiller knows how to balance the botanical flavors to make a quality product.
9. The Philippines drinks the most gin
The global sale of the spirit is nearly 60 million cases, and almost half of this is consumed in the Philippines. The country drinks over 22 million cases of Ginebra San Miguel, and while this gin accounts for 43% of the gin market, most people outside the Philippines have never heard of it. Other big gin drinking nations are Spain — where gin and tonics are popular — the U.S and, of course, the UK.
10. Saying you don't like gin is like saying you don't like sauce
All gin uses juniper as its main ingredient. After that, however, there are very few limits to the hundreds of ingredients a distillery can use. Some gins have as few as three or four botanical flavors, while the Scottish gin Botanist has 31! The flavors in gin range from cucumber and rose (Hendricks) to lavender (Aviation) to lemongrass and black pepper (Bombay Sapphire East). No two gins are alike, making the spirit very diverse in flavor and exciting for the budding bartender.
Visit a gin distillery and learn more:
In the U.S – Visit the New York Distilling Company in Williamsburg and meet founder Allen Katz. Be sure to drink Commodore Perry's Navy Strength gin in The Shanty, a lovely bar located next door.
In the UK – Visit the oldest working distillery in the world in Plymouth. The building has been around since 1430 as a monastery, and every drop of Plymouth Gin has been made there since 1793.
Finally, a recipe to enjoy at home:
The Last Word Cocktail (created circa. 1922 at the Detroit Athletics Club)
3/4 ounce Dorothy Parker gin
3/4 ounce green chartreuse
3/4 ounce Maraschino liquor
3/4 ounce fresh squeezed lime juice
Shake ingredients and strain into a chilled cocktail coupe

During the Sony Pictures Animation slate presentation, additional 'Smurfs' casting was announced and 'Hotel Translyvania 3' was touted.
Patrick Stewart is joining Sony Pictures Animation's The Emoji Movie as Poop.
The Emoji Movie follows Gene (T.J. Miller), an emoji born with multiple expressions, who teams up with the notorious code-breaker Jailbreak (Ilana Glazer) on an adventure through a teenager's phone.
Other new voices in the feature include Jennifer Coolidge as Gene's mother, Mary Meh, and Saturday Night Live grad Maya Rudolph as Smiler. Jake T. Austin will be playing Emoji's resident teen, Alex. They are joining previously announced stars James Corden, Steven Wright and Rob Riggle.
The new castings were announced Wednesday morning as part of SPA's upcoming features presentation.
As director Tony Leondis was introduced, Miller, who was on hand for the presentation, pretended to misunderstand the introduction, taking the stage to laughs before giving up the mic to the actual director. "I know what you're thinking — WTF,” Leondis said of the movie. “What is their story? Emoji are expected to be one thing their whole lives. So I thought, what if one was born with not one, but lots of expressions ... and how would that affect the status quo? Everyone has felt different — it's everyone's story."
Leondis wrote the script with Mike White and Eric Siegel. Michelle Raimo is producing the pic.
Stewart is reped by ICM and Anonymous, Coolidge is repped by UTA. Rudolph is repped by WME and 3 Arts.
The Emoji Movie, which is set to hit theaters Aug. 4, will be preceded by a new animated short, Puppy, a Hotel Transylvania-themed short in which toddler Dennis gets a pet.
Hotel Transylvania director Genndy Tartakovsky was on hand Wednesday to discuss SPA's third installment of the franchise, which is slated to open Sept. 21, 2018. “I thought I was done,” he joked, adding that he found himself on a family cruise that “was horrible, but I thought, what a great setting for the characters.” He revealed that in the story, the characters would take an ocean voyage and Drac (Adam Sandler) would fall in love with the Captain, Erika, who turns out to be a descendant of Van Helsing.
During the presentation, SPA also debuted several clips from the upcoming Smurfs: The Lost Village and announced additional voice castmembers including Julia Roberts as SmurfWillow, Michelle Rodriguez as SmurfStorm, Ellie Kemper as SmurfBlossom and Ariel Winter as SmurfLily.
Providing cameos will be Gordon Ramsay as Baker; Gabriel Inglesias as Jokey; Tituss Burgess as Vanity; Jeff Dunham as Farmer; Jake Johnson as Grouchy, and director Kelly Asbury as Nosey.
Previously announced castmember Demi Lovato (Smurfette), who was in attendance along with Joe Manganiello (Hefty), said she prepped for the role by watching Smurfs on YouTube, “my New Age homework.”
Clips from the April 7 release included the Smurfs being attacked by yellow flowers in an enchanted forest and being lost and separated from one another in a dark cave.
SPA president Kristine Belson emphasized that the studio has upped its output from one film every 18 months to having five planned theatrical releases over the next two years. She added that SPA doesn't have just one style: “Each [film] is tremendously different.”
MIAMI -- Giancarlo Stanton has one game left to get to 60 home runs.
The All-Star slugger went 1-for-5 with an RBI single in the Miami Marlins' 10-2 victory over the Atlanta Braves on Saturday night. Manager Don Mattingly plans to move him to the leadoff spot for Sunday's season finale to try to get him more plate appearances.
Editor's Picks The where, when and WOW of Giancarlo Stanton's season He hit nearly five miles of home runs in 12 ballparks off 51 different pitchers in 2017. We take a look at Giancarlo Stanton's smashing year when it comes to home runs.
"I told him I was going to lead him off after the game," Mattingly said. "First I wanted to make sure he wanted to play. You never know, so he did, and then I told him I wanted him to lead off. He was good [with the decision]. He was fine."
Stanton is trying to become the first player to hit 60 home runs in a season since 2001, when Barry Bonds connected for 73 and Sammy Sosa finished with 64. There have been five players in history to hit at least 60 in a season.
"I know he's going to get it," Marlins second baseman Dee Gordon said. "I'm pretty sure. I'm pretty confident he's going to get it. ... He's going to make some noise tomorrow."
There was a lively crowd of 25,264 cheering on Stanton's every at-bat.
"It was actually loud out there tonight," Mattingly said. "That was kind of nice. Just kind of tells you what this building can be if you get it -- and it's still not really full, but it is a loud building. The more games we get like that, the better off we'll be."
Gordon had three hits and stole two bases, becoming the first player with at least 200 hits and 60 steals in a season since former Marlins outfielder Juan Pierre in 2003.
"It's a good feeling," Gordon said. "There's not too many true leadoff hitters anymore. Charlie Blackmon is setting the tone, him and (Jose) Altuve, George Springer, those guys are setting a different tone for a leadoff guy so for me to be able to do it with guys who are prototypical leadoff guys and continue to do that 40, 50 years later when the game is going in a different direction means a lot."
Derek Dietrich homered for Miami and drove in three runs. Miguel Rojas had four hits, and Odrisamer Despaigne (2-3) pitched seven innings of two-run ball.
"Sometimes you can get those runs early, but I'll take it like today," Despaigne said. "It's great to have that support."
Dansby Swanson and Matt Adams each drove in a run for the Braves, who have lost six straight and 11 of 15. Lucas Sims (3-6) gave up six runs in two innings.
"Wheels have fallen off," Braves manager Brian Snitker said. "Hopefully we can come out tomorrow and end the season on a winning note."
ELLIS IN CHARGE
Mattingly has decided to let veteran catcher A.J. Ellis handle the managerial duties in Sunday's finale.
"He's already nervous," Mattingly said. "I told him during the game, and he told me I shouldn't have told him until after the game because he got nervous during the game."
SHORT START FOR SIMS
Sims gave up seven hits, walked four and struck out one in the shortest of his 10 starts during his first season in the majors.
"I would have liked to end on a better note, but it sticks a little bit going into the off season," Sims said. "But I learn from it and try to be better in 2018."
UP NEXT
Braves: RHP Max Fried (1-1, 3.74 ERA) takes the mound for the finale. Fried has allowed a home run to Stanton in two plate appearances.
Marlins: RHP Jose Urena (14-7, 3.77 ERA) will pitch the finale looking to end his breakout season on a positive after allowing six runs in a loss at Colorado in his last start.
Early births pose new health risks for newborns PREGNANCY
Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Early births pose new health risks for newborns 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
The number of women giving birth early - often for no medical reason - has increased dramatically during the past two decades, altering the way we bear children and posing new health risks, experts say.
The average time a fetus spends in the womb has decreased by seven days in the United States since 1992, according to researchers and data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Researchers say shorter pregnancies coincide with a large number of women and doctors now scheduling childbirth for convenience. One study of nearly 18,000 deliveries in 2007 showed that 9.6 percent were early births - through scheduled inductions or C-sections - for nonmedical reasons.
Shortening a pregnancy could affect a baby's lung development, vision, weight and some fine-tuning of the brain, experts say. Babies born too early often sleep longer than normal and have trouble learning how to breast-feed, causing dehydration and jaundice.
"For every day and every week before 39 weeks, it's an increasing risk to the baby," said Dr. Bryan Oshiro, vice chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Loma Linda University. "The vast majority of early-term babies do fine, but it's like playing Russian roulette."
California Watch reported in September that women are significantly more likely to experience C-sections at for-profit hospitals across the state. In February, California Watch reported that the number of women who die each year from causes directly related to childbirth had more than doubled in California since 1996.
The rise in deaths during childbirth is an indicator that obstetric health has deteriorated in many important ways, according to the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative, a task force of medical researchers.
Normal pregnancies are 40 weeks long, although researchers believe induced delivery at a full 39 weeks is probably safe. Women often naturally give birth earlier than this, and in some cases, medical problems require an early delivery. The problems come when babies are born before they are ready.
Of all births between 1990 and 2006, the number of babies born at 36 weeks increased by about 30 percent, and babies born at 37 and 38 weeks rose more than 40 percent, according to national vital statistics.
Unmistakable trend
There was a corresponding drop in the number of babies born in later weeks. There are now more babies born at 39 weeks than at full-term. The data examined is considered fresh by academic standards and covers such a long period of time - 16 years - that experts say the trend is unmistakable.
"The entire bell curve has shifted," said Dr. Jeanne Conry, California district chairwoman of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
Some early births are scheduled for the convenience of the mother or doctor; some are judgment calls that require weighing relative risks.
A California Watch inquiry through the Public Insight Network, which solicits observations from people around the nation, asked mothers about their experiences with early deliveries. The questionnaire elicited responses from more than 300 women and produced several cases in which mothers said their doctors had pushed for early births.
One mother, Michelle Van Norman, gave birth to her second child, Christian, 11 days early in 2006, despite no urgency noted on her medical records. The doctor wrote on her chart: "This is a pleasant white female in no apparent distress."
Van Norman, 31, of Las Vegas, said her doctor didn't seem worried about the date.
"There were no medical reasons for the delivery being early," Van Norman said. "He told me the week he could do it and asked me to choose which day was best for us."
After his birth by C-section, one of Christian's lungs collapsed. He spent three weeks in intensive care and 10 days on a ventilator with six tubes going into his chest. It's unclear what caused Christian's lung to collapse but the condition is strongly associated with early childbirth.
"The whole experience was horrific," Van Norman said. "It didn't end with the birth, it continued for the first year of his life, and we still don't know if the oxygen deprivation has had any effect on him."
When Van Norman's surgeon cut the cord, Christian seemed robust. The doctor declined to comment about the case.
"The doctor came in the day after and asked where the baby was," Van Norman said. "When I told him, he asked me if I was joking. ... I swore from that day on I would never put another baby through that kind of torture for any reason."
Raising awareness
In California, the state Department of Public Health, March of Dimes and California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative have released what its authors call the "Toolkit." The authors note that deliveries at 37 and 38 weeks account for about 17.5 percent of total births in the United States.
Babies born early through induction or C-section without a medical reason are nearly twice as likely to spend time in the neonatal intensive care unit, researchers say. They also are more likely to contract infections and need the assistance of breathing machines, according to a 2009 study in the New England Journal of Medicine and a number of other reports.
"We are finding out that the last weeks of pregnancy really do count," said Leslie Kowalewski, an associate state director for the March of Dimes. "At 35 weeks, the brain is only two-thirds of what it will weigh at 40 weeks."
Many organizations are responding with programs designed to eliminate early elective deliveries. Most significantly, chapters of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have begun to notify doctors about the serious consequences of performing early elective births.
Authors of the "Toolkit" argue that cesarean sections and artificial induction of labor before full gestation should be eliminated, unless they are medically necessary.
The state chapter of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has thrown its weight behind this recommendation and is taking measures to see that it is carried out, holding teaching sessions and reaching out to obstetrics leaders at every hospital in the state.
"Nothing on this scale has ever been done before in California," Conry said. At the same time, physicians groups are rolling out the "Toolkit's" guidelines in New York, Florida, Illinois and Texas.
Medical interventions
The authors of the "Toolkit" note that rates of medically induced labor more than doubled between 1989 and 2004. The increase in deliveries between 37 and 39 weeks "has been associated with an increase in obstetrical interventions such as induction of labor and cesarean sections," the "Toolkit" authors said.
Lack of knowledge among clinicians and patients seems to have driven this trend.
To complicate matters, doctors start the pregnancy clock at a woman's last menstrual period before becoming pregnant, which is usually about two weeks before conception. All this is confusing enough that when doctors tell women they are at 36 weeks gestation and must wait at least a month before starting labor, they can grow impatient, Conry said.
"We call it tired of being pregnant," she said. "Some women have 36 weeks in their heads as the end point."
Societal changes also push women to seek an early delivery. Some women schedule births before their due date so they can better plan for taking time off work and flying in family members, Kowalewski said.
Little information can change this.
"I haven't met a woman who wasn't willing to continue her pregnancy if given information," said Debra Bingham, an author of the "Toolkit" and vice president of the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric & Neonatal Nurses in Washington, D.C.
"I've had experience with women who clearly didn't understand the risks of an elective induction, but it's also fair to say that there are a lot of doctors, nurses and childbirth educators who aren't aware of the risks."

Architect of Record Zhejiang University Urban Research & Design Institute More Specs Fewer Specs
Text description provided by the architects. The project for the TianTai No.2 Primary School strives for a unique design that will serve as a model school which provides a beautiful environment for the cultivation of knowledge, culture, physical fitness, art and ethics for elementary school children. The project effectively solving the problem of land shortage in the old city.
The 200m running track calls for 40% of the land if we put the playground on the ground as the normal way, then the space of the campus will be very cramped. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure students a playground to have sports and activities. With land scarce, the 200m running track was projected onto the roof level, giving an additional 3000+ sqm of usable area on the ground as well as the oval shape of the school building, creating a sense of inwardness and security for the students.
Lifting the running track also allows for a total project height of 4 floors instead of 5 as originally required, creating a more harmonious relationship between the new school and the surrounding urban context. In order to create more available green courtyard spaces, the building is twisted about 15 degrees, creating smaller pockets of space between the site wall and the exterior envelope.
The rooftop track has 3 layers of guardrail to guarantee the safety of students. The exterior layer is 1.8m high tempered glass wall, the middle layer is 50cm wide green belt, the interior layer is 1.2m high stainless steel guardrail. For the issue of noise, the spring cushions are put every 50x 50cm under the plastic track, thus reducing the further kinetic noise by means of the double-layer structure.
Hello Steemit! My name is Randy Clemens. I'm the author of three books—The Sriracha Cookbook, The Veggie-Lover's Sriracha Cookbook, and The Craft of Stone Brewing Co.: Liquid Lore, Epic Recipes, and Unabashed Arrogance. I'm excited to explore what I can bring to the Steemit community and what new ideas I might take away from it! What a friggin cool idea for a social media & blogging platform! Cryptocoins and blockchains continue to amaze me and I can't wait to see what kind of other tools come out in the next five years!
I actually didn't know the first thing about Bitcoin or any other digital currency until early 2015, when I packed up my entire life and moved from Los Angeles to Manchester, New Hampshire to participate in something called the Free State Project.
“The Free State Project is an agreement among 20,000 pro-liberty activists to move to New Hampshire, where they will exert the fullest practical effort toward the creation of a society in which the maximum role of government is the protection of life, liberty, and property. The success of the Project would likely entail reductions in taxation and regulation, reforms at all levels of government to expand individual rights and free markets, and a restoration of constitutional federalism, demonstrating the benefits of liberty to the rest of the nation and the world.” ­—Free State Project mission statement
This Free State Project idea started as an essay that was posted online in July 2001... a proposal to see what kind of political change could be brought about if 20,000 libertarians / voluntaryists relocated to a low-population state to make a push for minimal government and maximum personal freedoms. Not feeling comfortable at ALL with the growing size of the U.S. government, their ever-increasing taxation theft, wars murders, regulatory laws racketeering scams, or mass surveillance spying... I saw this as an opportunity to be part of a historic peaceful human evolution that doesn't rely on force and coercion to function.
Just a few months ago, the Free State Project reached its goal of 20,000 signers, who all pledged to move within five years of reaching that 20k milestone. New movers are coming every week, though there are around 2,000 of us who moved here early that are already making some big changes in our communities and in the state legislature.
Being around so many forward-thinking individuals is quite an incredible feeling. It's inspired me to become involved in my community, and to grow as an individual.
Here are the few of the things I've been up to since buying my first home and moving to NH:
Growing some of my own food!
I LOVE food. I'm a culinary school graduate, have worked in restaurants, and have been writing about food & drink for the past 10 years, but I've never really taken on a big gardening project, especially not in a colder climate that requires starting seedlings indoors and transplanting them, but I've gotten some great guidance from other folks who moved here a few years ago and that's been very helpful. And when it came time to build raised beds, I made an event on Facebook to see if anybody wanted to come out and help while learning how it's done. A group of about eight people—who I'd only known for a few months—came over and helped put FOURTEEN raised beds together and filled them with soil over the course of a beautiful Saturday & Sunday!
There's a pool at the house, but there's a big crack running down the side of it. What to do? Grow potatoes of course! There will be a couple hundred pounds of spuds in there come harvest time! Squash, lemon cucumbers, celery root, onions, watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, lemongrass, chocolate mint, habanero peppers, and more! Chickens and bees will be coming next year!
I really like cooking and sharing food with people. Even as a kid, I was always curious to know where my food came from, how different cultures prepared different ingredients, and I really wanted to find out why the government makes certain foods illegal, like raw milk and raw almonds. I'm looking forward to sharing more food photos and recipes on Steem; I've got lots to choose from between my three cookbooks, plus some recipes I've written up for my personal blog over the years.
Lots of protests and demonstrations!
When the government wants to take away individual rights and liberties, I don't want to sit idly by. Here are some of the activities I've participated in over the last 15 months:
On 4/20, I smoked pot on the State Capitol steps to protest the destructive, wasteful, and horribly unjust War on Drugs
Stood outside of courthouses to inform potential jurors of Jury Nullification -- “the term given to the process where the jury of a criminal case acquits the defendant regardless if he has broken the law in question. The jury would do this in a case where they judge the law to be unjust, therefore the jury can vote to find the defendant innocent since the jury found the law itself to be immoral, unfair, unjustly applied, or unconstitutional.” No victim? No crime. Otherwise, you're just policing for profit and that ain't cool.
Spoken out against illegal, warrantless police searches & seizures of private property
Protested and spoke out at City Hall against increased police militarization after an Orwellian city-wide lockdown was issued, greatly endangering our community.
After the FBI director basically pardoned Hillary Clinton for something anyone else would have been put in prison for, I got a giant print-out of a great Edward Snowden tweet, and I held it outside the local FBI office one day and at the Hillary Clinton rally in Portsmouth the next day. A pic of it got back to Snowden, who then tweeted the pic of me holding his tweet. Totally meta, man. Ha!
Media production -- building a video / podcast studio
I've done my share of writing over the last decade, but I've wanted to get more into video production, even though I don't know the first thing about video editing. Thankfully, I've made some great friends who are quite skilled with these things, and together we started a website called FSPmovers.com, and together we've produced several videos about some of the great networks here for Free Staters, like:
Porc Family Connection—a social group for families that want to learn and explore NH together,
Community Market Day—an agorist marketplace for people to buy/sell/trade their goods & services,
and the Welcome Wagon / Porc Buddy programs—volunteers help you unpack after your move and help you get acquainted with your new area!
We just got some new A/V equipment here to record podcasts and more videos. JJ just finished building a teleprompter -- only cost us about $25-30 to make thanks to this video from Griffin Hammond, who directed the Sriracha documentary, which I'm proud to be in! (Small world, eh?) We painted a green screen on a wall, had a friend make us some custom LED lights.
Our latest video is an interview I did with Dr. Jason Sorens, the founder of the Free State Project. Last week was the 15th anniversary of his original essay that started the whole movement. We got some of his reflections on the first 15 years, and his predictions about its future. We also discuss the benefits of limited/small government, why he's so passionate about sharing libertarian ideals, and whether New Hampshire might be poised to peacefully declare its independence from the United States within the next decade.
Cryptocurrencies! Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more!
As I learned more and more about cryptocurrencies, I felt compelled to start working on the video we're currently producing: an in-depth explanation of Bitcoin and blockchains for someone who knows nothing about them. I also began mining Ethereum and am excited to watch it grow. I couldn't have done any of this without the help of my buddy JJ Epic, who co-hosts the Neocash Radio podcast with Dr. Darren Tapp—where they “discuss the future of money today!” They've been doing that weekly show for over three years now... a long time in the crypto world!
Opening up my home to my community
We've been hosting weekly potlucks and bonfires here at the house. It's a great way to connect with friends and meet new movers, as well as people in town visiting to see if NH is right for them.
I was also hosting the Community Market Day agorist marketplace twice a month here for a while, which was a roaring success. Sort of like a community swap meet... with local produce, organic soaps, prepared foods, donation-based yoga, handmade jewelry… it was a lot of fun. Unfortunately, the main organizer stole some items of mine and doesn't seem to want to repay a $4,500 loan I'd made to her… so she no longer holds the market here unfortunately. (We'll see if she makes right.) Thankfully, several other folks who also didn't care for her business practices have started up their own little swap meets in their homes. The idea lives on!
What's next? What opportunities does Steem present?
I really want to keep writing and making art and creating new content that encourages critical thinking, deep reflection, and independent analysis. (I also like to make jokes sometimes, too.) It's refreshing to think that Steem presents a platform that can actually monetize my continued journey, enabling me to continue supporting causes I care about while not needing to rely on the dying, parasitic, spammy advertising industry.
My personal blog has been something I've been able to post to whenever I wanted or needed to, and I love that. Mixed in among recipes and anti-government rants, you'll also find moments of very personal streams of consciousness, like “Loving Myself & Saying Goodbye to Fear and Shame”... or what I wrote the day my father passed away (a little angsty in retrospect, but it captured my feelings in that moment) and during my mom's unsuccessful cancer treatments. I also wrote about scattering my parent's ashes in Squam Lake. I never expected any of those posts would resonate with people as they did; it was just an outlet for me to share what was on my mind and in my heart… the support was almost unbelievable.
I want to keep writing. I want to share more of my pictures from my travels. I want to share more recipes. Explore my feelings and share them openly. Present important ideas about self-ownership, self-governance, voluntaryism, etc. Who knows? I might even have another book in me, though not about food this time. It's exciting to think Steem can benefit content creators and help bring cryptocurrencies into more mainstream conversations.
I look forward to connecting with the community here. If you have any questions about the Free State Project or anything else I've posted, please don't hesitate to reach out. Peace! ✌️
A massive fire destroyed a large RoomPlace furniture warehouse in southwest suburban Woodridge. Thick, black smoke could be seen from as far as Plainfield, nearly 20 miles from the scene.Thirty-five fire departments responded to the fire in the 2500-block of Internationale Parkway that began around 6 p.m. Thursday. Some nearby buildings were evacuated and power is out in the area."Everybody started running out the back door, talking about, 'Get out!'" said Ken LeFlore, who was inside when he saw fellow employees head for the exits. "Being OK is important, I made it out to my family and my son and my girl, so that's what's important," Leflore said.Firefighters said more than 700,000 square feet went up in flames. Some flammable material also ignited."We had some - what I would call smaller explosions - and I'm going to say that those were probably from some of the forklifts in there perhaps, they're run by propane," said Chief George Rimbo, Lemont Fire Protection District."All of the sudden we just heard the fire alarm go off, so we went outside," said Cesar Posada, who was also inside when the fire started.He said at first, there was thick black smoke, but that quickly changed."I was able to get in my car and get away. My car is parked over there, because the cops said it was going to be a big one," Posada said.Although no one was injured, Leflore now has no job. He's one of hundreds who worked in this huge building."My first thought is where I'm gonna get a job at. That's my first thought," Leflore said.Officials have not given any details about a possible cause for the fire.
And the looks on the faces of their guests when they see a newborn baby trailing behind the bride kind of says it all.
After the media storm, Shona, who has another daughter, took to her Facebook to defend her decision to strap her baby to the back of her wedding dress, claiming that Aubrey was "awake and well secured" and that she was "covered by Christ."
Here is her full post about the negative reaction to her wedding day:
"People questioning what we do, commenting all negative, and just doing the most. We good though we covered by the Blood which never loose its power. So to the media, radio, news, and whomever else wanting to talk about what WE do here you go: Media Media I see how it works regardless the situation or purpose people gone have something negative to say! The answer is we do what we want when we want long as Jesus on our side everything worked out fine and gone continue to be fine. Our 1 month old was awake and well secured on my train.

Who paid yall for yall comments, none so watch us as we do us! Too bless for mess!! Thank God we aint no celebrities oops got fans, guess we are!"
You know about the Space Needle, Starbucks and its distinction as the birthplace of grunge. But did you know it's built atop the ruins of a city center that burned down more than a hundred years ago? Or that it's the hometown of Kenny G.? Here for your tasting pleasure: a cup of freshly brewed facts about Seattle.
1. The first European to visit the area, which had been inhabited by native tribes for more than 4,000 years, was a man named Vancouver. That's George Vancouver, the renowned British explorer, who stopped by in 1792 during his voyage to chart the Pacific coast of North America.
2. It was originally called New York. Why, exactly, is unclear, though several members of the Denny party, a ragtag group that first settled Alki Point in 1851, in what's today known as West Seattle, hailed from New York State. After the party moved across Elliott Bay, they renamed the territory “Seattle” after a Duwamish Indian chief who befriended them.
3. The entire central business district burned down in 1889, in what's today known as The Great Seattle Fire. It started with a woodworker who mishandled hot glue, and resulted in 116 acres reduced to ash. City residents decided to rebuild atop the rubble rather than relocate, raising streets up to 22 feet in the process and using brick and steel to erect buildings instead of wood (smart move).
4. Long before the likes of Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, Seattle's first millionaire was a sawmill operator named Henry Yesler. A native of Hagerstown, Maryland, Yesler came to Seattle shortly after it was settled and built what became the country's first steam-powered sawmill. He also, oddly, served as Seattle's 7th and 15th mayor.
5. Seattle became a boomtown during the Yukon Gold Rush, outfitting the hordes of prospectors heading north to strike it rich. Merchants in Pioneer Square filled their stores and sidewalks with merchandise, and some even offered classes to wide-eyed greenhorns on panning and sluicing for gold.
6. It was the first major American city to have a female mayor. Bertha Knight Landes held the office from 1926 to 1928, and was notable for taking a hard line against corruption (she fired the chief of police, for starters). The city hasn't had another female mayor since.
8. Airplane manufacturer Boeing opened in 1916 [PDF] in a former shipyard on the shores of Lake Union. World War I kickstarted the business, but the following years were lean ones, and Boeing began turning out furniture, phonograph cases, and corset frames to offset the decline. The rise of commercial aviation, World War II, and the jet age would eventually propel the company into the stratosphere. And though it's no longer is based in Seattle, Boeing still manufacturers several airplanes, including the 747, the 767 and the giant 787 Dreamliner, at the company's Everett plant just north of Seattle.
9. The 600-foot-tall Space Needle was the brainchild of artist Edward E. Carlson, who sketched a design for the tower that would loom over the 1962 World's Fair on a cocktail napkin. The structure, which was built in just 400 days, can withstand winds of up to 200 mph and a 9.1 magnitude earthquake (more on that later), thanks in part to its foundation, which extends 30 feet underground.
10. The iconic Pike Place Market started because of overpriced onions. Between 1906 and 1907, the price of produce, and onions in particular, skyrocketed, and consumers as well as civic leaders believed price-gouging wholesalers were to blame. So the city proposed a public market where customers could buy directly from farmers. In August 1907, Pike Place Market opened for business. Today, it's the oldest continually operating farmer's market in America.

11. It's one of the fastest growing big cities in the U.S.—number three, to be exact—with 15,000 residents added over the past year. Only Denver and Austin grew more.
12. Despite its rainy image, Seattle gets less annual rainfall than New York, Houston, Boston, and Atlanta. It does, however, have quite a few cloudy days and days with light precipitation, particularly in the wintertime.
13. It has the second most glass-blowing studios of any city in the world, behind Murano, Italy.
14. There are more dogs living there than children, according to Census data, and many of their owners (the dogs, that is) are sci-fi/fantasy geeks. There are numerous Frodos, a smattering of Xenas, and a pitbull in West Seattle named Daenarys. Cat lovers are pretty creative, too, like the owner of “Mr. Meowgi”.
15. It's home to the country's first gas station—a Standard Oil outpost that opened in 1907 at Holgate Street and Western Avenue.
16. Seattlites are a cultured bunch. Around 80 percent of adults hold Seattle Public Library cards, while the Seattle-based Pacific Northwest Ballet is said to have the highest per capita attendance of any ballet in America.
17. There's an eerie Underground Tour that takes visitors along the sidewalks and storefronts that existed before the Great Fire. It begins and ends, thankfully, in a refurbished saloon.
18. The next big hipster trend currently on display there: pinball. There's a museum, league play, and numerous bars stuffed with machines.
19. It has the largest houseboat population in the country, with plenty of folks willing to pay big bucks to live on the water. Last year, the houseboat from Sleepless in Seattle sold for more than $2 million.

20. Seattle City Light—a public-owned utility which powers 90 percent of Seattle via hydroelectricity—has a zero carbon footprint. The entire city has pledged to go carbon neutral by 2050.
21. A real-life superhero named Phoenix Jones roams the streets of Seattle. And lest you think he's an out-of-shape fanboy, think again. He's mixed martial arts fighter Ben Fodor, and he's been stabbed, shot, hit with a bat, and had his nose broken in the line of duty.
22. It's due for a major earthquake. The Cascadia fault line, which runs along the entire northwest coast, last shook the area sometime around 1700. Seismologists say there's an 80 percent chance of a 6.8-magnitude quake hitting in the next fifty years, and a 10 to 15% chance that a really big one—9.0 or higher—could hit in the same time frame.
23. In the meantime, any tremors you may feel could very well just mean there's a Seahawks game going on. Fans of Seattle's pro football team are known for their enthusiasm (read: volume), earning them a 2013 Guinness World Record for "loudest crowd roar at a sports stadium" (137.6 decibels!). The energy of their collective movement is enough to occasionally register on the Richter scale, most notably after Marshawn Lynch's 67-yard touchdown in a 2011 playoff game, which one seismologist said was "probably" the equivalent of a magnitude one earthquake.
23. It's well known as the incubator for rock bands like Nirvana and Soundgarden, but it's also where Kenny G. and Sir Mix-A-Lot got their starts. And don't forget Macklemore. And Heart. And Kenny Loggins.
24. There's a giant drill named Bertha trying to dig its way under the city. It's part of a controversial project to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct, an elevated section of State Highway 99 that runs along the west side of downtown Seattle. Digging on the new underground tunnel began in 2013, but then Bertha got stuck after completing only 10 percent of its 1.7-mile journey (and on a steel pipe, of all things). Crews recently removed Bertha's enormous cutterhead—all 4 million pounds of it—for repairs, and plan to resume drilling this November.
25. A giant, Volkswagen-crushing troll lives under one of its bridges.

On Monday night, Theresa May revealed the "naughtiest thing she's ever done".
It was ITV's Julie Etchingham who asked the Prime Minister, to which she replied: "Oh, goodness me. Well, I suppose… gosh. Do you know, I'm not quite sure. I can't think what the naughtiest thing."
But Julie didn't allow May to swerve talking about her darkest moment. And it was soon made apparent that May had quite an unsavoury past.
"Well, nobody is ever perfectly behaved, are they? I mean, you know, there are times when… I have to confess, when me and my friend, sort of, used to run through the fields of wheat, the farmers weren't too pleased about that," May told Julie.
Goodness.
The question led to other political leaders being asked the same. Tim Farron's is boring – something about 'breaking into a music studio'. But not.
What about Corbyn?
(Image: AFP)
A member of the public asked the Labour leader about Corbyn's naughtiest moment while on the campaign trail.
Twitter user @sadcat786 quizzed: "Jeremy, what's the naughtiest thing you've ever done?"
Corbyn joked: "It's far too naughty to say". He then marched off with a cheeky grin.
Lots of people admired Corbyn's attitude. Some even compared him to Barack Obama. Indeed, he's somehow come out looking good without even answering the question.
2. How unmoored from reality do you have to be to even suggest that this might be possible? The superdelegates didn't abandon the winner in 2008 despite the repeated pleas of Clinton—a paragon of the Democratic establishment. Why would they abandon the winner now for the paragon of the anti-establishment?
Sanders has built a very effective campaign by running against the party, even going so far as suing the party. So after trashing it for about a year, why would the party stalwarts who make up the ranks of the superdelegates suddenly abandon the winner for him? It defies all comprehension! This has nothing to do with the merits of his attacks, and everything to do with relationship building. You don't shit on someone and then beg for their help. You don't see me running to Joe Lieberman or Harold Ford and asking them for favors. You burn bridges knowing that you won't get to cross them later.
3. Isn't Sanders the candidate of consistency, honesty, and integrity? Here's his top strategist, Tad Devine, in 2008:
"If a perception develops that somehow this decision has been made not by voters participating in primaries or caucuses, but by politicians in some mythical backroom, I think that the public could react strongly against that," Devine said. "The problem is [if] people perceive that voters have not made the decision -- instead, insiders have made the decision -- then all of these new people who are being attracted to the process, particularly the young people who are voting for the first time, will feel disenfranchised or in some way alienated," he said.
Square that away with Devine today, in that Washington Post interview:
“I think we have to see where we are,” Devine said, adding that if Sanders were just behind Clinton in the pledged delegate count and had lost the popular vote, “we're going to make an argument that you should nominate Bernie Sanders.” Devine said the campaign would argue that such an end result was partly because Sanders didn't contest certain states. “I do think it's important to take a look at states where candidates have competed with each other,” he said.
See? Now it doesn't matter to him if he's behind the popular vote or delegate count, even if voters end up feeling disenfranchised and alienated.
Why? Because the only states that matter now are the ones that Sanders deigned to contest, like Illinois, Missouri, Ohio, Massachusetts, Nevada, and Arizona (which Clinton won, by the way). I mean, both candidates have made strategic decisions on where to contest. Clinton didn't spend a dime on last weekend's contests or caucuses beyond Iowa. She knew she would get blown out. Sanders didn't spend money in the South. He knew he'd get blown out.
Is the Sanders campaign argument going to be that Southern African-American voters don't count because they didn't bother to contest for their votes? Dear god! Do they not realize how ugly that argument is? And while it's bad enough that Devine is making this argument, it's even more distressing seeing Sanders himself repeat it.
Sanders supporters have obviously been very vocal in their criticisms of the superdelegate system, and again, deservedly so. To their credit, I'm not sensing any shift in opinions on the matter. I think Devine and Sanders are alone on that limb making this argument.
Which is evidence to me that as torn as we might be over the primary, certain principles continue to bind us together. In this case, the people should speak. And whether we like the end results, we have to respect the will of the voters.
(And can we also agree to fix this farce of a primary process while we're at it?)
This week in the war, on 19 April 1943, the eve of Passover, German troops entered the Jewish ghetto in Warsaw. Many Jews had already been taken from the ghetto and deported to the east, supposedly to work camps. But by April 1943, the Jews remaining in the ghetto had finally realized that the deportations were to extermination camps, and they decided to resist.
Armed with Molotov cocktails and a few handguns plus some weapons captured from the Germans, the Jews of the Warsaw ghetto put up a fierce resistance. The Germans sent in crack troops, equipped with artillery and armour.
Resistance continued well into May, although the end was inevitable. Over 10,000 Jews died in the fighting. The remaining inhabitants of the ghetto, some 50,000, were captured and deported to extermination camps such as Treblinka.
The photograph above is one of the most famous pictures of World War II. It was taken by the Germans and originally used for propaganda purposes. Notice that the soldiers have eagles on their left sleeves, clear indication that the troops are SS.

Fernando Alonso has been speaking in Madrid today at a press event organised by Ferrari sponsor Santander. The 28 year old said that he was relatively pleased to have got through the opening four races with the points he has and believes his title challenge is on target.
Alonso lies third in the championship with 49 points after one win and two fourth places, behind Rosberg on 50 points and championship leader Button on 60 points.
More importantly his competitive instincts have been revived after an uncompetitive 2009 season with Renault, where he could not contemplate winning, even in the most topsy turvy race.
"Being third in the championship, very few points away from the leader, I believe is a very good situation, " he told reporters.
"With the potential that we have, with the super team that I have, this is just the beginning and I have a real chance to fight for the world championship.
"I'm enjoying it again, and I've felt that bug from winning a race or winning the championship again, and that's the most positive thing about the start to this year.
"We can't forget that last year during the final part of the season Ferrari was very far from the leaders, so there were a lot of things to confirm and many wishes to grant and they have been granted."
Alonso believes that the opening races merely served to prove initial thoughts from testing on the relative performance of the cars. But as we saw last year with McLaren, when the development race kicks in for real at the start of the European season, things can change.
"In Europe it is time to show who is going to fight for the title and who isn't, " he said.
He didn't say much about the controversial overtaking move on his teammate Felipe Massa into the pit lane in China. It will be very interesting to see how Massa reacts to this on the track in the next race in Spain and from now on. He needed to raise his game after the opening races to match Alonso and this is likely to have roused him. He now knows what he is up against.
Interestingly Alonso had a pop at the stories in circulation over the weekend that Ferrari had traced its engine problems to the air valve system and would be applying to the FIA to make a change to the engine in the interests of reliability.
"As for the engines, we have found the problems that we had," he said. "I know there have been things written about the valves and the air consumption system of the engine, which are completely untrue, as it usually happens."
Both Ferraris had permitted changes to the engines air valve systems in parc ferme, before the start of the race in Malaysia.
Alonso has lost two engines so far this season, giving rise to concerns that he may not have enough to get him through the season, from his original allocation of eight for the year. If he is forced to take a ninth engine at any stage he will start that race ten places back on the grid.
Here is Ferrari's engine usage plan to date, as I understand it:
Engine 1 - Friday and Saturday in Bahrain, plus Melbourne Friday and Malaysia Friday. Massa used his Engine 1 in China on Friday. Alonso's failed on Friday morning in China.
Engine 2 - Bahrain race. Alonso used his for Friday pm, Saturday and Sunday in China. Massa used his for Saturday and Sunday in China
- Melbourne Saturday and Sunday. Also the Malaysia engine on Saturday and Sunday, which failed for Alonso.
15 Reasons Moderators at the Next GOP Debate Should Ask About Money in Politics
| Adam Smith
The Republican presidential debate on December 15th will be held at the Venetian Hotel, a casino owned by billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who along with his wife Miriam, are top donors to the Republican Party.
The debate comes as there's growing public anger about the influence of big donors like the Adelsons in our political process. Eighty percent of Republicans say money has too much influence in politics and 81 percent believe our current system needs fundamental changes or completely rebuilt, the New York Times found in June. In August, 91 percent of likely Republican caucus-goers in Iowa said they were disappointed or “mad as hell” about the amount of money in politics. And, from Donald Trump to Jeb Bush, nearly every GOP candidate has talked about the issue in some way on the campaign trail.
But so far, aside from instigating a brief fight between Trump and Bush at the CNN debate in September about whether Bush is a “puppet” of his big donors, moderators have not brought up the issue of money's role in our political system and voter anger about it.
With the next debate literally being hosted by the party's top donor, who could very well be in attendance, the moderators must address the issue.
Here are 15 reasons the moderators—Dana Bash, Wolf Blitzer, and Hugh Hewitt—should ask candidates about money's influence in politics and how the candidates will work to ensure everyday people can be heard in the political process.
In our current political system in which candidates are forced to travel the country hat-in-hand schmoozing with the wealthiest Americans, people like Sheldon Adelson get a lot more influence than everyday Americans.
With so much public anger about Washington politicians and people's belief that their elected officials no longer work for them, this debate is the perfect opportunity to quiz candidates on the influence of big donors in politics and what they plan to do about it.

There is a proverb in Timbuktu, the legendary medieval city in Mali's desert, that says: "The ink of a scholar is more precious than the blood of a martyr."
What Ahmed Baba, the 16th-century intellectual who said it, would make of recent developments is hard to imagine. At the multimillion-dollar Timbuktu institute bearing his name, fragments of ancient texts litter the corridors. The charred remains of not just scholarly ink, but the antique leather-bound covers that protected them against the harsh desert elements are blown by the hot Saharan wind.
During the last days of the Islamist occupation of northern Mali, the al-Qaida-linked groups who seized control of the territory for almost nine months turned on the Ahmed Baba Institute. In what many people believe was a final act of revenge, and a senseless crime against some of Islam's greatest treasures, they set the manuscripts alight.
"When the French started bombing, [the Islamists] set the manuscripts on fire as they were leaving," said Abdoulaye Cissé, interim director of the institute. "Even after most had fled the town, a small group of jihadists returned to make sure that the fire was still burning."
"We are all Muslims, and in Timbuktu our practical version of Islam has existed for centuries," added Cissé, a native of the city who remained there throughout the occupation.
"But they practise an archaic Islam and do not consider these writings as the authentic Qur'an because they cover not only religion but science, astronomy, history and literature. That's their ideology and we don't support it."
Cissé, who wears a distinctive silver ring engraved with an Islamic blessing that he had to remove under Islamist rule, foresaw that Timbuktu's occupiers could target his precious charge. He and colleagues in Bamako, along with guards at the institute, th e nightwatchman and his son, and numerous co-operative drivers and boatmen, worked for months by night, carefully packing most of the institute's 45,000 manuscripts and ferreting them away by road or pirogue boat to the capital in the south.
"It was a dangerous thing to do, we would have been punished if we had been caught," said Cissé.
"But people really came together to help us. Every time we told them what they were carrying, they all kept it secret and kept them hidden until they left the occupied area."
These ancient manuscripts, which could number up to 400,000 across the region, are a source of pride in Mali – and across sub-Saharan Africa. As Africa gained independence from European colonial powers, the texts – the oldest of which date from the ninth century – became a means for the pan-African movement to refute racist notions of a primitive, unlettered continent with no written history.

"People think that African history is oral, that the blacks were not writing until the white man arrived in Africa," said Cissé. "But we know written literature. That is our mission – to one day recreate the history of Africa through the knowledge contained in those manuscripts."
Timbuktu, which is now a Unesco world heritage site, was founded in about AD1103 and flourished as a commercial hub of the caravan trade between black Africa and the Maghreb, Mediterranean and Middle East. The Ahmed Baba Institute, opened with much fanfare by the former South African president Thabo Mbeki in 2009, has just received about £65,000 in funding from Saudi Arabia to digitise its manuscripts.
"We want to digitally secure all the manuscripts before they are brought back to Timbuktu," said Cissé. "But then they must be brought back. The manuscripts are meaningless if they're not in Timbuktu."
An unintended consequence of the Islamist occupation of the city has been a renewed global focus on the priceless manuscripts, which although mostly written in Arabic also include centuries-old writings in Greek, Latin, French, English and German.
But while the Ahmed Baba Institute is painstakingly working to preserve this history, other manuscripts in Timbuktu are faring less well.
In a narrow, sandy street in the central Badjinde quarter, Kunta Sidi Bouya climbs a steep flight of cracked, mud-cement stairs to a special prayer room on his roof. He lifts half a dozen worn, fraying books from a shelf in the corner, bound exquisitely in antique and decaying leather, and lays them out on the rug on the floor.
Bouya's home contains one of Timbuktu's thousands of private manuscript collections, texts written by the family's ancestors and handed down through the generations.
"My ancestor, Sheikh Sidi al-Bekaye, was a scholar who lived hundreds of years ago, he wrote these," Bouya said proudly. "It feels special when you read something your own grandfathers have written. These are part of our family and they are private.
"You are only allowed to handle them when you have attained a certain level of Qur'anic education. Being able to read Arabic is not enough – you have to learn to understand them completely."
Bouya, 35, a teacher at a Qur'anic school in Timbuktu, said he feared for the safety of his family's manuscripts during the occupation.
"The jihadists attacked and destroyed the shrine to one of my ancestors and we feared they would come for the manuscripts," he said. "But in the end they never came door to door looking for them."
Life was complicated under Islamist rule, Bouya said, and they were happy when the French liberated the town. But now his manuscripts face another, older challenge.
"We fear for their survival. They are old and they are suffering from the elements here," Bouya admitted. "We try to touch them as little as possible and when people come here asking to see them to do research, we hide them to protect them."
Unesco said the plethora of private family manuscripts posed a huge challenge to efforts to conserve Mali's cultural heritage.
"Something has gone wrong with Mali's documentary heritage," said David Stehl of Unesco. "There have been various programmes for their conservation but they have not created the conditions to adequately protect the manuscripts. They have lacked transparency and co-ordination.
"Even the legal question of who owns these private manuscripts is unclear. You have hundreds and thousands of them right across Mali and they are very much tied to families and private owners. We are concerned about the degree to which they were handled during the Islamist occupation – people started touching them, dispersing them and, especially for those that were moved to Bamako, they've now been exposed to completely different climatic conditions.
"Something has to be done to protect these collections, but it is a huge task – monstrous actually."
Preserving the manuscripts is crucial, experts in Mali say, not just to learn about the past, but also the future.
"We have not even begun to exploit the knowledge included in these manuscripts," said Cissé.
"Translation is not enough – we need specialists to analyse and interpret them. They are full of parables, hidden messages, images – all of which take specialists to understand. Only then can we understand the practical value of this wisdom that was written down hundreds of years ago."
A Room in Chelsea Square by Michael Nelson was first published anonymously in 1958. It was reprinted in 1986 by Gay Modern Classics and is now being re-introduced by Gregory Woods in a very recent—and very handsome!—reprint from Valancourt Books. All in all, a nice package: a contemporary gay poet who hails from across the pond introducing a novel by a bygone gay Brit.
Woods takes great pains to be even-handed, pointing out, in paragraph one of his brief introduction, that A Room in Chelsea Square “is a book that excites very different responses. To some, it is a camp tour de force.” To others, “especially in the decade or so after its publication, it is a parade of negative representations of homosexual men….”
You almost have to read between the lines of Wood's oh-so-polite prose to glean which of the two views of the novel he takes. Myself, I think he takes the positive view, especially when he writes:
And yet one might argue, it is the very lack of an affirmative or apologetic theme that is so impressive about [A Room in Chelsea Square]. Its main virtue is that it takes homosexuality completely for granted. There is anguish aplenty, but not about being gay. Most is about being unloved or unmoneyed.
Is A Room in Chelsea Square a camp tour de force? Oh God, yes. Told mostly through dialogue, the story brims with camp bitchiness—witty repartee that makes you laugh at the same time that it makes you cringe. Patrick, the middle-aged gay man who is one of the novel's main characters, and who is rich—“very, very rich,”—is shopping in the opening scenes of the novel. When a shop assistant approaches him with a “Wonderful morning, isn't it?,” Patrick's response is “I always feel like buying something when the weather's fine, so I suppose it must be.” A bit later, when he bumps into frenemy and ex-lover, Ronnie Gras, Patrick begins to harangue Ronnie.
“'If you're going to insult me, Patrick, I've no intention of staying here,' Ronnie [says], ‘It's a morning in a million. I do think on a day like this you might try to be kind to people.'”
This time Patrick's response is, “But I am being kind, my dear. Don't be so huffy.”
Is A Room in Chelsea Square a parade of negative images of gay men? Oh, God, yes. But is that necessarily a bad thing? I mean, haven't you known men, both gay and straight, as flimsy and fickle as Patrick—middle-aged men with money who, like Patrick, are obsessed with youth and who use their money to entice the young (take, for example, the recent HBO movie Beneath the Candelabra, in which the character of Liberace uses wealth and influence to rope in a younger man). And if you haven't known such men, wouldn't you at least agree they're stock characters? So that while A Room in Chelsea Square may not be “positive,” it's not entirely inaccurate about human beings (or at least, not about make-believe human beings).
(By the way, I'd never ask a writer with demographics other than my own—a straight writer, say, or a black writer—to write about their own in only positive ways. I'd know the product of such writing to be disingenuous. Why then, I ask you, would I ask a gay man to write about other gay men in only positive ways?)
And besides, A Room in Chelsea's Square's negativity has the higher purpose of satire. Here Woods disagrees with me. He feels because Patrick is only loosely based on literati like Peter Watson, who co-founded a literary magazine with the writer Cyril Connolly, and because Ronnie is only loosely based on Connolly, that the novel is not a satire. And yet, if we accept a satire to be “a literary composition, in verse or prose, in which human folly and vice are held up to scorn, derision, or ridicule,” then it would seem to me that the novel is a satire. What, to answer Wood's question, does A Room in Chelsea Square satirize? Greed and consumerism, boredom and ennui, self-indulgence and …. Well, the list goes on.
And what about the fact that a straight character kept by an older gay man dies? Is that death not, as Woods suggests, the requisite death that has to take place in all negative representations of gay men? No, in this case—and we should take such matters on a case by case basis, no?—in this case, it isn't. The character in question is the young WWII-vet Michael, who is kept by Christopher, a character based on the gay writer Stephen Spender, and we are told by Michael himself that he's bought a gun just to find out if he's as suicidal as Christopher thinks he is. Michael, in short, is somewhat mentally unstable, a risk-taker toying with self-destruction. And it is Christopher himself who, despite all his flightiness of character, summarizes Michael's dilemma: “You see,” Christopher tells Michael, “war, whatever else it may do, makes us forget ourselves. It gives purpose to our lives. It's a wicked thing to say, but true. Living in the peaceful welfare state is terribly frustrating. We're not equipped to deal with it. We grow bored.” It's not Christopher or Patrick or Ronnie, in other words, which leads to Michael's demise, but mental instability and boredom, a sense of uselessness.
Boredom, anyway, is one thing you definitely won't experience reading A Room in Chelsea Square. You might even be enlightened. The goal of satire after all is to foster change.
“Better a good wine of a bad year,” the snobbish Ronnie says, “than a bad wine of a good one.”
I'm too young, and the wrong nationality, to say whether post-World War II England was “of” a bad time or good one, but I will go out a limb far enough to say that, no matter what time you find yourself in, A Room in Chelsea Square is a good book. It promotes good living by showing what good living is not.

Two Aussie inventors have enticed investors like bees to a honeypot with their new beehive creation.
Father and son duo Stuart and Cedar Anderson have created a contraption that allows for honey on tap straight from the backyard hive.
The Flow Hive is billed as "a revolution" — because it allows for beekeepers to extract honey without opening the hive or disturbing the bees.
See also: First ever public jetpack company zooms onto Australian Stock Exchange
The Flow Hive has already received more than $2 million in funding from more than 5,000 investors on crowdsourcing platform Indiegogo since the project listed on Feb. 22. The men were hoping to raise $70,000 by April, a goal they have exceeded by 3,135%.
“This really is a revolution. You can see into the hive, see when the honey is ready and take it away in such a gentle way," the pair wrote on the campaign's site.
In regular beekeeping, the beekeeper would have to dress in protective gear, use a smoker to sedate the bees, then crack the hive open before manually processing the honey. It was a dangerous and time-consuming process.
Honey from one Flow frame comes out of the hive. Image: Flow
The Flow Hive's frames consist of partly-formed honeycomb cells, allowing the bees to complete the comb with their wax before filling the cells with honey. To retrieve the honey from the cells, you turn a handle that causes the cells to spit vertically, creating a channel where the honey can drip down to the base of the frame and out of the hive.
The Flow frames can be used instead of existing frames; they can even replace the entire hive. The Flow Hive is clear so that you can watch the bees at work, turning nectar into honey.
The Andersons, from Byron Bay in northern New South Wales, who have spent 10 years developing the design, have been blown away by the response. "It's gone nuts, I can't keep up," Stuart told Good Food. "Clearly we underestimated the interest."
For $600 you can get the complete Flow Hive, which comes with everything you need other than the actual bees. The frames alone will set you back between $230 and $460.
The pair is thrilled that their invention has generated so much buzz.
"We hoped it would work, our tests showed it should work and we turned the handle and waited," Stuart told the ABC about their first success with the product.
"When the first pour of fresh honey came out filling the jar, that was a moment."
Utterly heartbreaking and gracefully raw, A24's latest gem is not to be missed.
RATING: ★★★★ (out of four stars)
At one point during The Florida Project, the lead character Moonee (a six-year-old girl played by Brooklynn Kimberly Prince) and her new friend look outward at a rainbow that arches over the extended-stay motel where they live. This scene where Moonee and her friend look at one of nature's most beautiful sights is the perfect metaphor for Sean Baker's latest film. Moonee and her friends muster up illusions of happiness and joy as they break through the light in such colorful ways to overcome the reality of a welfare-dense area within walking distance of Disney World, which has been called the happiest place on earth.
As captivatingly radiant as it is saddening, The Florida Project follows Moonee and her friends during the summer days in and around The Magic Castle Motel, which managed by Bobby Hicks (Willem Dafoe). Sure, the story in Florida Project isn't groundbreaking, but that's not what makes it so wondrous and harrowing. Watching kids make the best of a down-on-their-luck scenario they can't fully comprehend, all while their parents struggle to provide for them feels so relatable – especially when you think about all the other areas in the country where poverty is high. As someone who has a special place in their heart for children who live in such unfortunate situations, one scene near the end of the film, had me tearing up. At times, The Florida Project is not an easy watch, where you might find your heart sinking to the floor as you wish you could help the characters with the struggles they go through. But at the same time, it's as authentic as any movie you'll see this year, with the scenarios presented are either delightful or heart-rending.
Authenticity in The Florida Project comes largely from the movie's memorable characters that result in heartfelt performances that are sure to garner plenty of awards talk throughout the fall. Front and center for most of The Florida Project is Brooklyn Kimberly Prince as Moonee, who is hard not to fall in love with as soon as we see her on the screen for the first time. Full of sass, energy, and wit, Prince arguably gives the best performance as a child actor in a movie since Abigail Breslin in Little Miss Sunshine. Parenting (when she's there) Moonee is her mother Halley, played by Bria Vinaite. You might wind up hating Halley, but you ultimately understand that she is only trying to do what's best in order for her and her daughter to survive week after week. And finally, veteran (and beloved) actor Willem Dafoe plays Bobby, the manager of the motel where Moonee and Halley stay. Acting like an angel in the shadows or a surrogate father of sorts, Dafoe's sensitive, yet graceful performance is one of the best of his career; and right now, I'd say he's a shoo-in for Best Supporting Actor at next year's Oscars.
The Florida Project feels like this year's Moonlight (which also happens to be an A24 release); it's a bittersweet story that's not often told on film, but it's certainly an important one that's worth your time. Baker, who made the 2015 stylistic Tangerine, gives us a clear reminder of the vivid society we live in now with The Florida Project. Sure, we might live within walking distance of what we deem as “happiness,” but we also live in a world where there's enough adventure to let our imagination run wild, and where in the end, any bleak situation can be outshined by the warmth and radiance we give off, just like Florida Project's flawed, yet empathetic characters do in the film's sunshine state setting.
The Florida Project is now playing at The Belcourt Theatre here in Nashville. You can purchase your tickets here.

“Follow the money!” might have become the now-iconic line from Jerry Maguire had Tom Cruise's character been an investment advisor rather than a sports agent.
Following the money of insiders can often point to potentially good stock investments (as well as uncover unethical behavior, but that's another topic).
Center for Responsive Politics
The Center for Responsive Politics–a non-profit, non-partisan research group that tracks money in politics–analyses the finances of the members of the U.S. Congress each year. The analysis is based upon the annual financial disclosures the members are required to submit. These disclosures do not list an exact value for each holding, but a range of values.
High-Yielding Stocks Owned by Congress Members
Are you an investor who likes dividend paying stocks? If so, maybe you'll find a stock you like among Congress members' holdings.
Of the 10 stocks most widely held by Congress, six have a dividend yield higher than the 2.6% average for dividend-payers on the S&P 500.
The relatively high-yielding stocks owned by Congress members are:
AT&T (T): 5.8% General Electric (GE): 3.8% Pfizer (PFE): 3.7% Intel (INTC): 3.5% Microsoft (MSFT): 3.1% Proctor & Gamble (PG): 3.1%
AT&T is the #8 highest yielding stock of the S&P 500 (Frontier Communications, sporting a yield of 14.6%, is #1).
Top 10 Stocks of U.S. Congress: 2011 Returns
Wondering if Congress members can invest their own money better than they can the government's–or your–money? Let's take a look at how the top 10 stocks of Congress members fared in 2011:
Excluding Bank of America (it imploded due to the financial crisis of 2008, and is considered a one-off thing), the average total return of Congress' top stocks was 5.7%. This is very good on a relative basis as the market, as represented by the S&P 500 index, had a 0.9% total return.
(Note: Jane Harman, D-CA, was included in this analysis, as she was in Congress when the Center for Responsive Politics conducted its annual analysis–she has since resigned).

It appears that following the money of members of Congress should give you an edge in helping to increase your bottom line.
The economy may be struggling to recover, but by one closely watched measure the fear that not long ago paralyzed the markets has lifted.
The oldest and most popular gauge of the stock market on Tuesday surged past the nominal high it last reached more than five years ago, before the financial crisis hit with full force.
In the past, such a recovery would have led to celebrations on Wall Street and spread optimism about the economy. But the gain by the Dow Jones industrial average — the stocks of 30 American corporate giants like Coca-Cola, ExxonMobil and Microsoft — was a more downbeat event.
Wall Street executives were not dismissing the rally out of hand, but after several years of turbulence they were not cracking open the Champagne either.

Superman: The Movie Blu-ray Review
Too Much Man of Steel?
Reviewed by Michael Reuben, October 3, 2017
Superman is as joyous and affirming a blockbuster adventure as the latest Pirates of the Caribbean is dispiriting and bland. Nowadays, it's hard to imagine a time when comic-book movies didn't dominate the theatrical landscape, but it was Donner who legitimized the genre in ways no one had imagined. . . . Donner's true masterstroke [was] casting a young, virtually unknown Christopher Reeve as adult Clark Kent/Superman. . . . We're looking at a movie star, period, and the definitive live-action interpretation of the character.

Singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran is leading the charge at this year's Brit Awards, with four nominations.
The 20-year-old is up for best male, breakthrough act, best single for The A Team, and best album for his debut record, which is called +.
Pop star Jessie J is up for three awards - the best female, breakthrough act and best single for her hit Price Tag.
Organisers have also announced that Adele will perform live at this year's ceremony next month.
It is her first confirmed live performance since recovering from throat surgery.
The singer is also nominated in three categories - the best female, the best single for Someone Like You and best album for 21.
Sheeran told the BBC he was "ecstatic, really happy and pleased" to be recognised at this year's awards.
Image caption Jessie J is up for three awards this year
He will go up against James Blake, James Morrison, Professor Green and Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds in the best male category.
Professor Green, who has received his first Brit nomination, told the BBC: "I've been sat at a [Brits] table three times. This will be my fourth time, so it's nice to be nominated."
The best album category will see Sheeran and Adele compete with Coldplay for Mylo Xyloto, Florence and the Machine for Ceremonials and PJ Harvey's Mercury Prize-winning Let England Shake.
Sheeran said: "I think any artist would really want to win the best album award - but to be honest I think Adele will win that one.
"This exact time last year, I was signing my record deal. So I think it's been a good year."
Jessie J, who was awarded the Brits Critics' Choice prize for 2011 told the BBC she "would never have imagined this last year".
"I remember sitting at the table and thinking, next year I want to be voted the best female. Even if I don't win, it's just being nominated and the feeling of that."
Also in the best female category are Adele, Florence and the Machine, Kate Bush and last year's winner Laura Marling.
The star, whose real name is Jessica Cornish, admitted she would be facing stiff competition in some of the categories.
"Award ceremonies aren't fun if the competition isn't tough," she said. "The standard of British music is so big right now that whoever wins deserves it."
Image caption The Vaccines told the BBC their nomination was proof rock bands can break into today's market
Coldplay has a second nomination for best group, along with Chase and Status, Arctic Monkeys, Elbow and Kasabian.
Ten tracks are up for best single, including Example's Changed The Way You Kissed Me, One Direction's What Makes You Beautiful and The Military Wives' number one, Wherever You Are.
Four of the Military Wives - who scored the Christmas number one single - attended the launch and admitted the attention was still a bit overwhelming: "It's complete bonkers, we've been really fortunate and privileged to have had the experiences we've had.
"We were very lucky that Gareth (choirmaster Gareth Malone) came and chose us out of all the military camps across England and we're just on the ride of our lives."
The four international categories also see two nominations for Aloe Blacc as well as nods for Bruno Mars, Beyonce, Rihanna, Foo Fighters and Maroon 5.
Scottish singer-songwriter Emeli Sande has already been announced as the recipient of this year's Critics Choice award, which recognises up-and-coming talent.
She was presented with her Brit trophy - designed by Sir Peter Blake - by Jessie J at Thursday's nominations launch event at London's Savoy Hotel.
The singer is also nominated for the breakthrough act award along with Sheeran, Jessie J, Anna Calvi and The Vaccines.
In a year when the music press has bemoaned the lack of new British rock bands breaking into the mainstream, The Vaccines told the BBC their nomination was proof it was possible for guitar bands.
"We've connected with people on a vast mainstream level," said singer Justin Young.
"Just to be included in this and to be recognised as a band who have had a successful year is vindication."
The main prizes - including a lifetime achievement prize for Britpop band Blur - will be handed out at the O2 Arena on 21 February.

Two ships cut across the vast, empty blackness of space… they had run a silent chase which had lasted more than half a standard day, and spanned more than a light year.
There was something distinctively camel-like about the lead ship, which was the smaller one. Its main body consisted of two large segments joined by a slightly narrower one that was also appreciably shorter from top to bottom. The canopied forward command deck which protruded from midway up the front of it only aided the resemblance to a desert pack animal.
If the pursuing ship looked like anything, it would have to be something out of a nightmare. It was shaped like a dodecahedron, a sphere-like construct of twelve faces. Each of these faces was a slightly concave pentagon, with a gun emplacement near each point. Various antennae and parabolic dishes protruded from the depression between each of guns. The whole thing was made of some dark metal that could only be distinguished from the surrounding void at extremely close range.
Those onboard the camel-shaped transport ship could see it very well, indeed.
If you had been presented with this tableau, your eye probably would have been first drawn to the immense black juggernaut, wider across any axis than the transport ship was from stem to stern.
Thus, you could be forgiven if your eye did not immediately pick out the tiny dark figure standing on the rear “hump” of the camel, especially as the surface on which the figure stood was itself quite dark. The top of each of the two towering compartments were actually transparent flattened domes which could be opaqued for tactical purposes.
Once you had spotted the figure, of course, you would have wondered how you could have missed so striking a sight as a person in a sleek black vacuum suit, playing zero gravity baseball.
There were a number of balls–softballs, when you looked closely enough–suspended within arm's reach of the figure, who reached out, grabbed one, and released it at a suitable height and distance, then swung a regulation wooden bat.
There was no audible crack in the vacuum, of course, but the ball went sailing with considerable force in the direction of the dreadnought. The ball seemed to vanish shortly after passing the stern of the ship, only to instantly reappear a short distance in front of the pursuer, where it slammed into the nearest face, exploding into a plasma spray.
Those unfamiliar with the realities of interstellar travel might be puzzled by many elements of the scene. Therefore, some explanations may be in order:
Firstly, the spare balls appeared to float motionlessly alongside the hitter because all motion is relative to the frame of movement… so long as nothing imparted momentum to them, they would continue to move at the exact same speed as the figure and the ship itself, and thus, appear motionless. The same would be true for an object released by a figure standing on an earthbound vehicle, if not for gravity and friction.
Secondly, the reason the unorthodox projectile seemed to “blip” instantly from one ship to another was that both vessels were traveling at over eight hundred times the speed of light. The means by which a ship accomplishes this otherwise impossible feat involves a field which extends a certain distance from the surface of the vessel in every direction. Any object leaving that field is instantly shunted to a speed slightly below that of the speed of light. While the ball lost more than ninety-nine percent of its velocity when it left the transport ship's field, the pursuing ship caught up to it in almost literally no time.
Thirdly, the reason the flying fortress had not cut loose with its obviously superior firepower was closely related: as soon as the projectiles left its field, they would slow down to sub-light speed and the ship's field would then catch up with them, over and over again, until the two ships were close enough for the fields to overlap each other.
As for why the ball exploded on impact, that was readily enough explained by the simple fact that the balls, like almost everything else owned by the bat-wielding figure, were packed full of sophisticated explosives.
Of course, given that it was all but impossible for an object even gently tossed to the rear of the ship to fail to hit the massive target which metaphorically plowed through their notional wake, there was still one question remaining:
“What in space is she using the bat for?”
Online communities of white nationalists and other alt-right groups are advertising plans to suppress voter turnout in Philadelphia next Tuesday, according to a Wednesday report in Politico.
Their proposed tactics include handing out liquor and marijuana on Election Day, hidden cameras and rogue poll watchers, according to the website.
Per Politico:
Neo-Nazi leader Andrew Anglin plans to muster thousands of poll-watchers across all 50 states. His partners at the alt-right website “the Right Stuff” are touting plans to set up hidden cameras at polling places in Philadelphia and hand out liquor and marijuana in the city's “ghetto” on Election Day to induce residents to stay home. The National Socialist Movement, various factions of the Ku Klux Klan and the white nationalist American Freedom Party all are deploying members to watch polls, either “informally” or, they say, through the Trump campaign.
The report comes after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's repeated claims that the election is rigged and calls for his supporters to watch the polls in urban areas like Philadelphia that are largely black and mainly Democratic. While Trump's requests have been awfully vague, poll watchers are volunteers who are governed by a strict set of rules and regulations.
Pennsylvania's Republican Party filed a federal lawsuit in October in an attempt to relax some of those rules, specifically the requirement that limits poll watchers to serve in the county in which they're registered to vote.
Despite those laws, Politico.com's report claims some of the groups plan to conduct their own Election Day monitoring. A representative of the website RightStuffBiz.com wrote in an email obtained by Politico.com that the surveillance includes hidden cameras in Philly:
“We are organizing poll watchers in urban areas to cut down on the most traditional type of voter fraud. We also will have stationary cameras hidden at polling locations in Philadelphia, to monitor anyone that comes in to vote and make sure that the same people are not voting at multiple locations. If we see people voting in multiple locations the footage will be submitted to the FEC as well as put out on social media to undermine the legitimacy of Clinton should she steal the election.”
Trump supports his claim about a rigged election with allegations of voter fraud in Philly and elsewhere. Philadelphia City Commissioner Al Schmidt, a Republican, has said that while voter fraud does exist, it is neither systematic nor widespread. The claim that voter fraud is rampant in the city has been widely debunked.
The Pennsylvania Department of State has reminded voters to be aware of their rights at the polls on Nov. 8, including the right not to be intimidated or harassed. Voters who face problems at the polls can contact the state department at 1-877-VOTESPA (1-877-868-3662) or the U.S. Department of Justice's Voting Section at 1-800-253-3931.
The proportion of young people smoking in England regularly is the lowest on record, according to new figures.
But there are signs that falls in recent years are levelling off, with the proportion of young people who have ever tried a cigarette similar to figures in 2014.
“We urge the government to prioritise tobacco control so we can achieve the goal of a ‘smokefree generation'.” - Alyssa Best, Cancer Research UK
Around 1 in 5 (19%) 11-15 year olds surveyed said they had ever smoked, a similar level to survey data from 2014. Around 3% of young people said they were regular smokers, down slightly from 2014.
This follows a period of sharper decline since 1996 when around half (49%) of young people surveyed said they had ever smoked.
Alyssa Best, tobacco policy advisor at Cancer Research UK, said that efforts to reduce smoking rates need to continue.
“We urge the government to prioritise tobacco control so we can achieve the goal of a ‘smokefree generation',” she said.
The figures come from a survey of secondary pupils in England, carried out regularly since 1982. More than 12,000 pupils in 177 schools completed questionnaires in the autumn term of 2016.
Around half of pupils who had ever smoked said that they had only tried smoking. The remaining half was split fairly evenly between regular, occasional and previous smokers.
The proportion of pupils who had ever smoked increased with age, from 4% of 11 year olds to 36% of 15 year olds. Girls (20%) were more likely to have tried smoking than boys (18%).
“This continued decline in regular youth smoking has been made possible by effective tobacco control measures over the years, such as tax rises to make tobacco less affordable, and standard packs to make cigarettes less desirable,” said Best.
Since the survey began, the minimum age to buy tobacco products was raised from 16 to 18 in 2007. A ban on smoking in public places, on the display of tobacco products in shops, and the mandatory inclusion of large health warnings on packaging were introduced.
Deborah Arnott, chief executive of campaign group Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), said that while the figures are positive more needs to be done.
“The Tobacco Control Plan must be fully implemented and adequately funded if we are to succeed in tackling the burning injustice that those born poor die on average nine years earlier,” she said.
The survey found that regular youth smokers consumed around 26 cigarettes on average, down from around 44 in 2007.
The proportion of pupils saying they had ever used e-cigarettes increased from 22% in 2014 to 25%. 2014 was the first year this information was first recorded in the survey.
Levels of current and regular e-cigarette use remain low but have increased from 4% to 6%, and from 1% to 2% respectively since 2014.
Arnott said it was reassuring that experimentation with electronic cigarettes remains low and doesn't appear to be leading to regular use.
Some have expressed concern over the possibility that e-cigarettes will lead to people taking up smoking conventional cigarettes. Recent research has shown that while teens who vape might be more likely to try cigarettes, most young people who try e-cigarettes don't become regular users.
It's perfect, isn't it, Christmas Day?
Your little brothers and sisters wake you up early; they're excited, Santa has been. You have your first beer as you watch them open their presents. You remember what it used to be like for you back when you were their age. It's not like that now, is it? But, still, Shakin' Stevens is playing on the radio and you're in the mood to quietly settle into a day of inebriation.
You do the normal stuff, the stuff you've always done: visiting relatives you haven't seen in a year, all you family falling out and then making up, putting Top of the Pops on and the Queen's Speech. And then it's time for dinner.

It's a bit different, though, this year. Your mum is in the kitchen, but she hasn't been knocking up the trimmings. Instead, she's on the phone. You listen through and hear her. Yule tide is truly here:
"Yeh, alright, mate, yeh can I have some food for delivery please? Yeh, Kebab meal four. Can I get that with four cans of coke and... hold on a sec - any of you lot want chips? - yeh, a couple of portions of chips as well. Yeh, shit load of chilli sauce on all of them. Fucking hell, we're gonna be shitting tomorrow. The chilli runs, I call it. Tell me about it, talking about a proper a 'shite Christmas' - harharhar. Yeh, nice one mate. Innabit."
Maybe it's not quite like the ones you used to know, but if one kebab house has its way it might be the future.
A Leeds kebab house and winner of the Just Eat Best Delivery Award at the British Kebab Awards 2017, I Am Dönner, is putting its own twist on the classic Christmas dinner.

This guest article is by Mark Cooper, senior fellow for economic analysis at Vermont Law School's Institute for Energy and the Environment.
From 2011 through 2013, as the overwhelming majority of the new reactors that had been proposed as part of the “Nuclear Renaissance” were abandoned or delayed, the industry blamed low natural gas prices. In 2013, when five old reactors were retired early, and today with many old reactors being considered for early retirement, the industry blames low wholesale prices that result from a market that is distorted by the entry of subsidized wind power.
The irony in these complaints is that for fifty years the selection of generating capacity has been rigged in favor of nuclear power with socialized accident insurance and waste management costs, forced purchase of overpriced power, and advanced recovery of construction costs. Nuclear advocates complaining about policies that balance things out a bit to give other generation resources a decent chance of delivering electricity would be laughably hypocritical, if it weren't so important. In fact, if the playing field were actually level, nuclear would be in even more trouble than it is.
The nuclear hypocrisy does not stop with complaints about subsidies. The nuclear utilities continue to complain about the challenges of the safety and licensing requirements imposed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, even after they convinced Congress to streamline and reform the process in the 2005. Yet, these challenges are matched by the obstacles utilities put in the path of alternatives at the public utility commissions, with hostile interconnection requirements, unfair contract conditions and uneconomic tariffs.
The fifty year failure of nuclear power to be economically competitive compels nuclear advocates to label every pro-consumer analysis as anti-nuclear. The anti-nuclear label is used to avoid the inconvenient truth about nuclear: it is and has been unable to compete economically with the alternatives available. More importantly, it is not likely to be able to compete for the foreseeable future.
The economic reality is that efficiency and natural gas can keep the lights on and computers running at a fraction of the cost of nuclear power and the cost of wind and solar have been declining dramatically. Utility scale solar with storage is entering the market, as is utility scale battery storage. The decision to give them a boost, is paying off. These alternatives have exhibited the one characteristic that has always eluded nuclear, declining costs driven by innovation, learning, and economies of scale.
In contrast to the success of the alternatives, the projected cost of nuclear power has increased five-fold since technology vendors and academic boosters declared the “Nuclear Renaissance” in the mid-2000s. If the industry had been able to deliver on the hype of a decade ago, it would not be in such dire straits. Having failed miserably a second time, the industry is demanding another round of massive subsidies, relaxed oversight, and pampered treatment for a third bite at the apple.
The buzz surrounding small modular reactors among nuclear advocates over the past couple of years is another example of the nuclear hype cycle. The industry is demanding massive subsidies and further relaxation of licensing and safety requirements. Independent analysts think the cost per kilowatt hour will not be less than the cost for the current crop of large reactors and is likely to be more for a significant period. The economic traits that are supposed to make small reactors attractive—small size, short construction periods, flexible deployment—are exhibited by many of the other alternatives. Westinghouse, one of the leading U.S. vendors, has recently nixed further investment in small reactors, even though its partner in Missouri, Ameren , had extracted $40 million in support from the state. The reason Westinghouse gave – “no customers” – was a quintessential real world market answer.
The hope that concerns about climate change would revive the prospects of nuclear power has also not panned out and the problem is not that most nations have refused to impose heavy costs on carbon. The problem is that most of the alternatives are low carbon resource and get exactly the same boost from climate policy as nuclear does. Even natural gas, which emits about half the carbon as coal, remains less costly unless the carbon price is quite high. Even then, nuclear has become so costly that it has trouble competing with natural gas facilities that add carbon capture and storage.
The most important impact of the nuclear hypocrisy lies in the fact that nuclear utilities are wedded to the mid-20th century concept of massive base load facilities that require huge investments on which they can earn large profits. While they build and maintain electricity grids to serve the needs of those facilities, the decentralized, smaller scale generation technologies that have become less costly require a different approach, using intensive information and control technologies to manage the grid. Given the expense of nuclear power, a commitment to nuclear crowds out the alternatives. In the current context, it will slow or prevent that transition to a 21st century industrial structure.
The ultimate irony is that small modular reactors and large scale carbon capture and storage are both hypothetical resources that are a decade or more away. In the meantime, the other alternatives are advancing like a freight train. By the time the new base load technologies reach their cost floor, it is very likely they too will be unable to compete.
Unable to compete today and unready to even attempt to compete for a decade or more, nuclear advocates would like to have a hundred year debate, declaring that the alternatives will be unable to achieve the decarbonization goal set for the end of the century, a claim that is hotly contested. Given the history of failed nuclear promises, the recent dramatic success of the alternatives, and the fact that currently available renewable technologies and efficiency can meet the demand for low carbon electricity for the foreseeable future, the path that a prudent decision maker would take is to maximize their contribution. The biggest mistake policymakers could make is to allow the search for yet another nuclear holy grail to delay the transition to a 21st century electricity grid.
Waterloo Valley Road
(Click on the photo for a larger image.)
“Rain” was not the only four-letter word uttered this morning at approximately 6:30 AM when the latest barrage of precipitation pelted Morris County. Those expecting to greet a new influx of migrating birds were instead welcomed with an increasing crescendo of falling rain.
But…when the rain stopped an hour or so later, something magical happened. The woods this observer was in exploded with birds and bird song. Warblers, Tanagers, Grosbeaks, et al, were flying from branch-to-branch moving in and out of view so quickly it was hard to get an accurate tally of species.
Bird migration fallout conditions were experienced in much of New Jersey this morning. One hopes that all who are reading this were able to get out and bask in the May migration experience. It does not happen often. Even blue skies and the sun finally reappeared:
Waterloo Valley Road in Mt. Olive Township was the scene of this writer's migration adventure – five miles from International Drive to the Stephens State Park bridge over the Musconetcong River. Another trip was made to neighboring Tilcon Lake.
Waterloo Valley Road is a pothole-ridden, mostly dirt and gravel road that is notorious for its lack of upkeep – a good thing because it keeps the traffic down. Actually, one will rarely see a car on this road at all. High clearance vehicles are preferred although a certain Prius has navigated this road many times.
17 species of warblers were heard and seen, a modest amount compared to other well-known spring migrant traps, but a nice haul for a little known spot in Morris County (and for a birder who is more than 50% deaf!).
Cerulean Warblers are the stars on this road. Two were seen and heard today southwest of Tilcon Lake, between the railroad tracks and the beginning of the Saxton Falls Sand and Gravel operation (see the photo at the top of this page).
American Redstarts dominate the road's edge while Ovenbirds and Wood Thrushes sing from the woods. Chestnut-sided Warblers, Black-throated Green and Blue Warblers, Hooded, Magnolia and Canada Warblers were part of the action this morning.
Sandhill Crane in the Great Swamp NWR
Matthew Zeitler was in the right place at the right time and captured a photograph of a Sandhill Crane flying over the Great Swamp NWR on May 7, 2016. This is the 7th known record of this species in Morris County. The most recent was a number of sightings in March of 2014.

Ahead of an expected House vote Wednesday, Republicans have bristled at the idea that Democrats outplayed them in negotiations over the spending resolution to fund the government through September. But on Tuesday, local media in West Virginia provided a clear example of how Democrats think they benefited from negotiations. Republicans signed off on language that would save health benefits for an estimated 22,000 miners whose insurance was running out; Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who had campaigned for the money and is up for reelection next year, got the credit.
[Republicans argue they won plenty in spending deal, too]
Morgantown's newspaper quoted Manchin before mentioning any of the Republican support, essentially handing him credit for the user fees that Manchin had wanted.
Charleston's newspaper illustrated its report with a photo of the United Mine Workers of America's president, but Manchin was the first lawmaker quoted and got a pullout interview to talk up the bill.
And the Clarksburg-area Times illustrated the deal with a photo from an unrelated bill signing, where Manchin was pictured leaning in to speak to a happy President Trump. Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito was also pictured, though less directly.
The positive coverage was not a surprise; Manchin had worked nonstop on the issue, held town hall meetings to talk about what was needed to move the deal through, and teamed up with UMWA members as they lobbied in Washington. But it was not preordained that he get the credit.
Some Democrats were surprised that Republicans did not find a way to announce the bill with a prominent place for Rep. Evan Jenkins (R-W.Va.), who is considered a likely Manchin challenger in 2018. Instead, Jenkins was hard to spot in the coverage; Manchin, meanwhile, is touring his state this weekend to talk up the wins he got for miners.
Welcome back to Top Shelf Prospects, the column looking at Hockey's Stars. Over the next few days we will be previewing the 2014 NHL Draft by ranking our top 30 prospects and honourable mentions. As always, you can check out the previous Top Shelf Prospects articles here.
With the CHL season now 2 months old, a month or so of NCAA hockey, plenty of games for the USNTDP and a few international tournaments (Ivan Hlinka, 4 Nations, first three games of the Subway Super Series) in the books, we have gotten a decent overview of what some of the biggest prospects for the draft are doing this year. That said, myself and the rest of the LWOS staff haven't seen everyone yet… It's quite simply not possible at this point in the season, so if there is someone you feel is an obvious name that has been left out, we'll do our best to get a look before our final ranks come out in April, May, and June. At this point the group we haven't seen a lot of are those European prospects who for whatever reason haven't had much exposure on the international stage. With the World Juniors, the five Nations, and the Under 18 all to come later in the year, we should get a better look at most. For now, this is what we have, we hope you enjoy the early preview.
For Ranks 1-10 Click Here
11) Ivan Barbashev, LW, Moncton Wildcats, (6'1″, 185 lbs): Barbashe, the 1st overall pick in the 2012 CHL Import Draft, is a pure sniper, he has a great arsenal of shots with a terrific wrister, slapshot, snapshot, backhand and one-timer. These shots also feature an excellent release which can fool goalkeepers and the puck will be in the back of the net before he knows it. Barbashev also has good stickhandling skills, and the creativity and vision to make passes which surprise opponents and set up teammates for easy goals. He'll have scouts headed to Moncton all season long. He needs to find more consistency in his defensive effort level, and defensive game to crack the top 10. With 11 goals and 31 points in 21 games to start the season, he's leading the Wildcats offence this year. A Moskva, Russia native, he may face questions about the “KHL factor” even though he is currently playing in the CHL.
12) Sam Bennett, C, Kingston Frontenacs, (6'0″, 170 lbs): Put up a point per game pace with 7 points in 7 games in helping Canada to Under 18 gold last spring. Added 4 points in 5 games in helping Canada to another gold at the Ivan Hlinka tournament. Slightly undersized, Bennett is extremely thin and needs to put on weight. Still that size hasn't slowed Bennett down as he has excellent hockey sense, and always seems to be in the right place, and make the right play. Good skating, and excellent agility and acceleration make Bennett a menace off the rush, or in cycling the puck as he seems to slip by defenders who can't keep up with him when he quickly changes speeds. He has very good vision and can pass the puck through small openings and tape to tape for a teammate. A hard-worker, Bennett is fearless, and always involved in the corners, in front of the net and at the middle of the after the whistle scrums. A player to watch, he's a potential top 10 pick come June. He's put up 13 goals and 30 points in 22 games for the Frontenacs this season.
13) Brycen Martin, D, Swift Current Broncos, (6'1″ 180 lbs): At 6'2″ already this 17-year-old has ideal NHL size. He is a solid two-way player, who does good work in both ends of the ice. He is a very good skater with speed in both directions and has the pivots and edgework necessary to be extremely mobile at the back-end. He makes strong passes on the breakout and on the power play, and has a decent point shot. Defensively, he's a smart player who is good positionally and works hard in battles along the boards and in front of the net. Has 14 points in 23 games to start the year in Swift Current. His 9 points in 5 games at last winter's Under 17 World Hockey Challenge really opened eyes for his offensive potential.
14) Jared McCann, C, Sault Ste Marie Greyhounds, (6'0″ 180 lbs): Another member of Team Canada's Hlinka winning squad, McCann is a very good skater, with great acceleration and very good top end speed. He combines this with good agility and edgework, along with top notch stick-handling which makes him incredibly dangerous off the rush. He has excellent vision and passing skills, making his linemates better. He also has a quick shot, and cna get it off very quickly. McCann has already developed a strong-two way game and has beoame a penalty killer for the Greyhounds. He brings his non-stop work ethic in all three zones. He is a very well-rounded and complete player already. He has 12 goals and 28 points in 22 games.
15) Nikolay Goldobin, RW, Sarnia Sting, (6'0″, 175 lbs): With Charles Sarault, and Reid Boucher gone; Goldobin has been given big responsibilities for the rebuilding Sarnia Sting club. He's a strong skater, with the ability to stickhandle in a phone booth. He also has a killer wrist shot, and an outstanding release. Add to that incredible passing skills and Goldobin can do it all in the offensive end of the ice. He'll need to improve his two way game and his intensity going forward. If he does that and can bring more consistency night in and night out, the sky is the limit on how high he could be taken come draft day. Like Barbashev he'll face questions about the Russian factor. Has put up 15 goals and 32 points in 24 games this season.
16) Anton Karlsson, RW, Modo, (6'1″, 190 lbs): The younger brother of Erik Karlsson, (not the Senators Superstar, the Canes 4th rounder in 2012), he's been a star for Sweden at the International stage putting up 5 points in 4 games at the Ivan Hlinka, and 4 points in 5 games at last seasons Under 18 (and he's eligible for that tournament again this year, so he was playing against the age group ahead of him). He has excellent skating ability, but what is most impressive is his ability to stickhandle and control the puck and make slick moves at top speed. Couple this with a decent shot, and excellent vision and passing skills and you have a winger who is deadly off the rush.
17) Conner Bleackley, RW, Red Deer Rebels (6'1″, 195 lbs): With 10 goals and 22 points to start the year, Bleackley has started the season strongly in Red Deer. He is learning to use his size and speed this season to get in quickly on the forecheck and play a physical game. Bleackley has a very good wrist shot and a quick release. He shows the ability to drive hard to the net, and has good balance on his skates to fight through checks and battle in the dirty areas of the ice. Is becoming a true power forward prospect with 10 goals and 22 points in 21 games this season.
18) Joshua Ho-Sang, C, Windsor Spitfires (5'10”, 160 lbs): Ho-Sang is incredibly skilled. He is a lightning fast skater with incredible agility and edgework. He also has quick, soft hands, and incredible puck control. When he's on his game, he is a joy to watch as he can do things with the puck that other players only dream of. He can play the role of playmaker with good vision and passing skills, and has a decent release on his wrist shot but could use more power. That may come as he bulks up, which is something that Ho-Sang will need to do. He still gets knocked off the puck a little bit too often. He has put up 12 goals and 27 points in 22 games this year.
19) Brendan Perlini, LW, Niagara Ice Dogs (6'3″, 195 lbs): Has exploded onto the scene this year with 14 goals and 36 points in 24 games. Has excellent height but could stand to put on muscle and play a more physical game. However he is a very good skater, with excellent speed and acceleration, which he couples with very good agility, and strong balance to be deadly off the rush. Possesses very good hockey sense, good creativity and excellent vision to be a dynamic playmaker with the puck on his stick. Has good stickhandling, and a decent shot and release. Perlini has really shown great improvement from last season to this. If it continues, his spot on lists will continue to rise. He's been sensational this season, but after a very mediocre year last year, I need to see him continue this level of play before moving him up. If he continues at this pace though, the sky is the limit.
20) Nikita Lyamkin, D, Chicoutimi Sagueneens, (6'3″ 175 lbs): A tall and lanky defensive defenceman, playing for Chicoutimi in the QMJHL after he was a first round pick in the CHL Import draft this past summer. Another player who will face the Russian Question, he has shown great ability at the defensive end of the ice. Willing to use his size and long stick to cut down on passing and shooting lanes, he intercepts passes and blocks a lot of shots. Is quickly adjusting to the North American game and showing better defensive positioning as time goes on. He doesn't put up big offensive numbers, but thats not the part of the game that will get him drafted. Needs to add weight.

For a sign of how healthy the business of international education in China is, take a look at the share price of China Maple Leaf Educational Systems: it has more than doubled since its Hong Kong listing in November 2014 while the Hang Seng Index has lost 13 per cent in the same period.
Supported by strong demand from China's growing number of middle-class families who want to prepare their children for overseas studies at prestigious universities, international education providers are seeing robust growth. Total revenue of all international schools operating in China grew at a compound rate of 23 per cent per year between 2009 and 2013, and amounted to 18.4 billion yuan (HK$21.7 billion) in 2013.
“Compared to switching directly from domestic non-international schools to overseas schools, students who attend an international school may find they experience a smoother transition to an overseas school, given their greater exposure to the English language and overseas education systems,” said Albert Yip, an analyst at GF Securities, in a research report.
The number of Chinese students studying overseas rose at a compound rate of 17.5 per cent a year between 2007 and 2015, and amounted to 523,700 students last year, GF said.
That will translate into strong demand for schools like those run by Maple Leaf, the only Hong Kong-listed operator of international schools in the mainland. Graduates from its high schools obtain both a graduation diploma from Canada's British Columbia state and China's national diploma, giving them an advantage in applying to schools overseas.
Its shares have jumped from the listing price of HK$2.88 to HK$6.76 as of June 15, while on Wednesday brokerage CLSA raised its target price for the stock to HK$8.4, up from a target of HK$4.3 it set in January. It maintained a “buy” rating.
Last week, investment bank CICC added Maple Leaf to its coverage and gave it a target price of HK$9.
Maple Leaf's net profit for the six months ended February 29 reached 125 million yuan, up 121 per cent from a year earlier. Total revenue rose 26.7 per cent to 380 million yuan.
CLSA expects the company's revenue to rise 29 per cent year on year for the second half of its financial year. In 2017, the company's student enrolment may increase 13 per cent, CLSA said.
[The number of Chinese students studying overseas rose at an annual compound rate of 17.5 per cent between 2007 and 2015. Photo: Xinhua] Private international schools are not bound by the policies of local, provincial or national governments and China's public education system, making it much easier for operators to expand, CICC said.
A decision in 2013 by the Chinese government to lower the weight of English in the gaokao – the nationwide university entrance exam – in an effort to promote the Chinese language and reduce the educational inequality between rural and urban areas, would also help international schools.
“The policy would force public schools to cut the hours of English classes, and in turn increase the attractiveness of private schools for parents who aspire to a bilingual education,” CICC said.
Public high schools which had built up franchises offering international curricula are also facing a tightening of government policy due to concerns over educational equality.
The independence of private schools allows them to have broader and more diverse curricula as well as greater flexibility in funding options in terms of tuition fees and the number of English classes per week, GF's Yip said.
The comparatively cheaper fees of domestic operators make them attractive. In Shanghai, the high school fee for Maple Leaf is 81,000 yuan a year, much lower than the 290,000 yuan a year at Nord Anglia, a British company with schools in 15 countries.
The number of international schools in China reached 597 last year, surpassing the United Arab Emirates to rank first worldwide, according to research by NewSchool Insight Media, a mainland think tank focusing on the international school industry.
Given the growth of high net worth families and the middle-class population, at least 1,000 private international schools will be needed in the coming years, the survey said.
Such demand is bringing other players into the market, and increasing competition. Property developers such as Vanke and Country Garden are expanding their international school networks.
“The demand is certainly huge and there is brand effect there,” said Kevin Tam, analyst at Core Pacific-Yamaichi. Maple Leaf is likely to maintain its market share as it is now an established brand after 20 years, Tam said.
In the coming two to three years, more private operators will seek initial public offerings, NewSchool Insight Media said.
This story was amended to correct the name of the brokerage to CLSA from CSLA in paragraph six and eight.

Nanotechnology researchers discover temporary violation of Second Law of Thermodynamics
(Nanowerk News) Objects with sizes in the nanometer range, such as the molecular building blocks of living cells or nanotechnological devices, are continuously exposed to random collisions with surrounding molecules. In such fluctuating environments the fundamental laws of thermodynamics that govern our macroscopic world need to be rewritten. An international team of researchers from Barcelona, Zurich and Vienna found that a nanoparticle trapped with laser light temporarily violates the famous second law of thermodynamics, something that is impossible on human time and length scale.
They report about their results in the latest issue of the prestigious scientific journal Nature Nanotechnology ("Dynamic relaxation of a levitated nanoparticle from a non-equilibrium steady state").

Surprises at the nanoscale
Watching a movie played in reverse often makes us laugh because unexpected and mysterious things seem to happen: glass shards lying on the floor slowly start to move towards each other, magically assemble and suddenly an intact glass jumps on the table where it gently gets to a halt. Or snow starts to from a water puddle in the sun, steadily growing until an entire snowman appears as if molded by an invisible hand. When we see such scenes, we immediately realize that according to our everyday experience something is out of the ordinary. Indeed, there are many processes in nature that can never be reversed. The physical law that captures this behavior is the celebrated second law of thermodynamics, which posits that the entropy of a system  a measure for the disorder of a system  never decreases spontaneously, thus favoring disorder (high entropy) over order (low entropy).
However, when we zoom into the microscopic world of atoms and molecules, this law softens up and looses its absolute strictness. Indeed, at the nanoscale the second law can be fleetingly violated. On rare occasions, one may observe events that never happen on the macroscopic scale such as, for example heat transfer from cold to hot which is unheard of in our daily lives. Although on average the second law of thermodynamics remains valid even in nanoscale systems, scientists are intrigued by these rare events and are investigating the meaning of irreversibility at the nanoscale.
Nanoparticles in laser traps
Recently, a team of physicists of the University of Vienna, the Institute of Photonic Sciences in Barcelona and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich succeeded in accurately predicting the likelihood of events transiently violating the second law of thermodynamics. They immediately put the mathematical fluctuation theorem they derived to the test using a tiny glass sphere with a diameter of less than 100 nm levitated in a trap of laser light.
Their experimental set-up allowed the research team to capture the nano-sphere and hold it in place, and, furthermore, to measure its position in all three spatial directions with exquisite precision. In the trap, the nano-sphere rattles around due to collisions with surrounding gas molecules.
By a clever manipulation of the laser trap the scientists cooled the nano-sphere below the temperature of the surrounding gas and, thereby, put it into a non-equilibrium state. They then turned off the cooling and watched the particle relaxing to the higher temperature through energy transfer from the gas molecules.
The researchers observed that the tiny glass sphere sometimes, although rarely, does not behave as one would expect according to the second law: the nano-sphere effectively releases heat to the hotter surroundings rather than absorbing the heat.
The theory derived by the researchers to analyze the experiment confirms the emerging picture on the limitations of the second law on the nanoscale.
Nanomachines out of equilibrium
The experimental and theoretical framework presented by the international research team in the renowned scientific journal Nature Nanotechnology has a wide range of applications. Objects with sizes in the nanometer range, such as the molecular building blocks of living cells or nanotechnological devices, are continuously exposed to a random buffeting due to the thermal motion of the molecules around them. As miniaturization proceeds to smaller and smaller scales nanomachines will experience increasingly random conditions.
A new poll by the Fox News house pollsters, Rasmussen, shows that President Obama has gained on Mitt Romney since the announcement of Paul Ryan as Romney's vice-presidential running mate. That's a striking achievement for Obama considering the notorious right-wing bias of Rasmussen. But first, a little background…
Last week I reported that Fox News was feverishly hyping pro-Romney polls while ignoring those that show President Obama in the lead. I noted that Fox Nation had posted an article showing the results of a Rasmussen poll with a headline that beamed “Romney Opens Up Lead Over Obama.” However they neglected to report any news of all the other polls that showed Obama ahead, including a poll conducted by Fox News itself:
This week Rasmussen's presidential daily tracking poll shows a significant five point swing in Obama's favor. Last Friday, Romney led Obama 47% to 43%. Today he's trailing Obama, 46% to 45%. That shift took place since the announcement last Saturday of Paul Ryan to join Mitt Romney's campaign. So apparently Ryan's addition to Romney's team has not yielded any benefit in the polling by the GOP's favorite pollster.
But What's most notable about this news is that Fox News, who were quick to post the Rasmussen poll results last week, have blackballed Rasmussen this week. As of this writing there has been no coverage whatsoever of Rasmussen's most recent poll results. Obviously Fox is afraid of presenting any information to their dimwitted audience that might cause them to fret about a socialist Kenyan being reelected. And they certainly don't want their glassy-eyed viewers to get wind of the fact that Ryan is being received as a dud. As I noted last week, this is…
“…the sort of biased cherry-picking that is the hallmark of Fox's “news” charade. […It's] a crystal clear message to pollsters from Fox: If you want to be covered, you better say what we like.”
Last week Rasmussen's results pleased Fox and they were rewarded with front page coverage. This week Rasmussen's results upset Fox and they were given the silent treatment. This is further evidence of why Fox viewers are repeatedly shown to be more ill-informed than all other news consumers.
At the Nashville Predators first preseason game on Sept. 20, if the colors of the players' jerseys seem brighter or if the definition of the puck against the ice looks crisper, your eyes won't be romanticizing the situation after a long layoff, it'll be reality.
Over the next two weeks, Bridgestone Arena will become the sixth NHL venue to install a light-emitting diode (LED) lighting system, replacing the 247 metal halide fixtures used for the past 18 years with less than 120 LED fixtures from Ephesus Lighting . The upgraded lighting structure will offer a laundry list of benefits to the arena and patrons, including: enhanced in-game presentation, energy savings, greater climate control which will lead to better ice conditions, truer color temperatures broadcast on television and even increased clarity for fans attending a hockey game or show.
“Everything will look better and crisper,” Predators Senior Director of Broadcasting and Entertainment Bob Kohl said. “The LEDs give you a more natural light color, so at the arena or on TV, the colors pop more, there aren't shadows on the ice and we have a lot more control over the lighting.”
Unlike the old, metal halide lighting system, which takes time to fully power on and lacks dimming control, the LEDs at Bridgestone Arena can be powered on in an instant, are dimmable from zero to 100 percent and feature an array of color options.
“They're all DMX compatible, which means we can plug them into a lighting board and create scenes, we can create chases, we can create virtually anything we want with these lights,” Predators Vice President of Facility Operations Tim Friedenberger said. “They'll be incorporated into our pregame show and intermissions. You name it.”
“What this allows us to do is take game presentation to a new level, simply because we can now instantly turn on or turn off the lights,” said Kohl. “If you want the whole arena dark with a special light on the band stage, now you can accentuate that person while the Zamboni is doing its thing, and really make it special, and still have the lights come instantly on as soon as the players are taking the ice.”
Kohl says to imagine the ice painted with purple light during the intermission of a Hockey Fights Cancer game or a much more dazzling national anthem ceremony - now with the LED lighting system - it's all possible. LEDs won't only be in the bowl either, they'll also be placed outside on the front lip of the building in order to turn the arena gold on a Golden Saturday, for example.
While the Predators will continue to get more creative in utilizing the new lighting structure over the coming days and weeks, the immediate and practical payoffs will be perhaps the most exciting elements of the upgrade.
“[LED] makes everything brighter, the ice whiter and the colors pop out more,” Julien BriseBois, assistant general manager of the Tampa Bay Lightning, told SI.com in July . “It is easier to track the puck and easier to track it in the air.”
“That's true for fans sitting in mid-level seats as well as players digging it out of corners that are no longer shrouded in shadow,” the article goes on to say.
Consistent (unflickering) light from the LEDs, as well as easily adjusted color temperatures, are the primary reasons LED lights can be seen by the naked eye as the superior option over the metal halide fixtures still used in the majority of sporting venues. Combine that with the benefits to the environment and lower operating costs and Friedenberger said it was an easy choice to add the LED lights to list of upgrades at Bridgestone Arena completed this summer. Rare are the features that benefit fans, players and arena, but the Predators and Bridgestone Arena have found another one, and that's pretty easy to see.
“These lights are a huge addition on top of all the things we've done this summer for arena upgrades,” Bridgestone Arena Senior Vice President of Booking David Kells said. “From the new seats, bathroom renovations and the lights, these are tactile things that fans can sit in, wash their hands with and they'll be able to see the in-game difference that the new lighting will make. That's pretty exciting right there.”
The last loose thread of the Miami Heat dynasty, short lived as it was, has been stitched into the end of things quilts. First up. Ray Allen and the Hall of Fame. Allen will be remembered as a member of the Heat team, an iconic collection of talent that triggered fanaticism, hate, love, exceptionalism and brotherhood. No team ever had to endure as much, had to fight through rage, perception, cliche and general dislike.
The Celtics title team in 2008, a perfect shape of talent, dominance, exceptionalism and competitiveness, presented Allen with his first title and that was special. But Allen's contribution to Miami added more lore to his legacy and to the legacy of LeBron James.
In spite of all the outside noise, as teams go, the Heat were a special group, one for the ages. As teams go, they were a little bit less than advertised. They only won two championships. They didn't live up to what was promised when they came together in that now legendary press conference. They expected the NBA earth to submit in the face of their exceptionalism. That didn't happen.
The last Heat title was possible because of Chris Bosh and then Ray Allen; that was, in itself, a grand irony. The team that was all about LeBron James and Dwyane Wade was suddenly all about Chris Bosh and Ray Allen and Game 6. Just as Metta World Peace saved the legacy of Kobe Bryant with his 3-point shot in Game 7 of the 2010 NBA Finals, Ray Allen secured the legacy of LeBron James.
It was, in hindsight, a wonderful miraculous moment of destiny- what other explanation is there for the basketball gods having their hands in the middle of stuff- that brought everyone to their separate realities. Eventually. LeBron went to Cleveland. Dwyane to Chicago, Cleveland Miami. Ray Allen is a Hall of Famer. Chris Bosh is thinking about what-if. What was a story of high expectations fizzled out in the end.
Being humiliated by the Spurs the year after Ray Allen's miracle doesn't tell the whole story about Ray Allen nor about the Miami Heat and what they accomplished that one glorious year and what they failed at the next year. It was billed as a happy ending in 2013. And then a miserable ending in 2014. And now in 2018, that entire team is dispersed, dismantled, disappeared.
Ray Allen bristles and rightly so at the description that his shot that saved Miami's season was a lucky shot. In that piece of linguistic miscue, he has company. Eleven years earlier, Robert Horry got a pass at the top of the key, the result of a missed shot that was batted out to him. He was standing alone. He drained the three to win the game which tied the Western Conference Finals at 2-2. Vlade Divac of the Sacramento Kings said afterwards, it was a “lucky shot.” To which Horry replied he had been making “lucky shots” all his career. Horry responded, if you don't know, “you better ask somebody.”
You better ask somebody before you call Ray Allen's shot lucky.
In the 2008 NBA Finals, in game four, Ray Allen sealed the game for the Celtics with a drive straight to the rim, a blow-by. He played the entire game. He had 19 points and 9 rebounds. The Celtics went up 3-1.
It made sense that Ray Allen would be a NBA Finals hero in 2008 and five years later in 2013. Ray Allen has always been consistently lethal if open for a jumper. When Allen was in Milwaukee, he beat the Nets by going right, stopping and draining a jumper for the win. When he was in Seattle, in a double overtime game, Allen drained a Steph Curry like 3-pointer to beat Phoenix. He had 42 points. In his second game as a Celtic, in Toronto, he buried the Raptors with a corner three with 2.6 seconds to go in overtime. He had 33 points. Three weeks later, a deflection bounced his way and at the buzzer he drained a three to demoralize the Bobcats. Against the 76ers, he got a pass from Pierce and drained a three for the win. In double overtime, in Boston, in the playoffs, he drained a three over Joakim Noah to beat the Bulls and a young Derrick Rose.
Ray Allen had a famous feud with Kobe Bryant who he considered selfish and arrogant. It was a throwback to when players disliked each other, particularly when they played the same position.
Bryant beat Allen in a one-on-one matchup in a regular season game in Boston, February 2010. With 7 seconds left, Kobe drained a fall away jumper, guarded by Allen. A few months later, Kobe would demoralize the Celtics with a game 7 victory in the NBA Finals. It was a brutal memory, up by thirteen and losing, so close but so far away. Allen had a nightmare of a game, missing most of his shots (as did Bryant). But Bryant had the luxury of title number five while Allen left the Celtics which caused a lot of animus.
Former Celtics such as Pierce and Rondo have spoken about Allen not attending their personal and private functions while they were always at his. Ray is a mysterious no-show friend off the court, they implied.
Pierce was especially stung when Allen left for Miami and didn't get his calls returned. “We were brothers. We came in together. We just wanted a heads-up or what's on your mind or something like that. Then, all of a sudden he left. That was the biggest disappointment on my end. Not even getting a callback at that moment.”
Of his loner lifestyle criticism, Allen responded in a Players Tribune article. “When you get to the NBA, you won't always play cards with the boys. Some people will assume you're not being a good teammate.”
Of course, he wouldn't be Rajon Rondo if he didn't throw shade Ray Allen's way. The two had a rocky relationship. “I thought he already was retired”, Rondo tweeted after Allen announced he was done playing in the NBA.
But that mattered to no one in Game 6, hurt feelings and relationships fraying. Ray being Ray was about shot making. When the Heat were trailing and Chris Bosh secured a rebound and instinctively passed it to Allen, breaths held and then exploded. It wasn't lucky. It was Ray Allen, the all-time leading 3-point shot maker. He drilled the open three as the Spurs were scrambling. He had done it so many, many times before. Then in overtime, he stole a pass from Manu Ginobli and made two free throws. But it was that game tying three etched in the memory. It was his only three of the game.
His last NBA year, the end was coming. You could tell. He wasn't the same. He looked old. As if that three point shot was his walk off legacy. In half the games he played, he scored less than 9 points. In 14 games, he didn't make one three pointers. The best 3-point shooter had been betrayed by his body. After 18 years, his legs were exhausted. His last game in the NBA, Game 5 of the NBA Finals, Ray Allen made 1 out of 8 shots. Of course, that one was a three. He went to the line twice. He had one offensive rebound and four rebounds total. He had two assists, a steal and four turnovers. He scored 5 points in a San Antonio 17 point slaughter. He ended his career quietly, the way most players do, although he would wait for two years to announce it, to have peace.
In Ray Allen's first game, 22 years ago, he played 28 minutes and missed 7 out of 10 shots. But he drained 66.7% from the three point line. He had two rebounds and three steals and 13 points. He was going up against Allen Iverson (he had 30 points in his NBA debut), also drafted in 1996. Both are retired now. As is Kobe Bryant. And Steve Nash.
The great 1996 draft class is closed, a page in history. There was Kobe, the maniacal scorer-competitor. There was Nash the brilliant passer and leader. There was Iverson, the fearless one and cultural icon. And there was Ray Allen, the perimeter clutch scorer and surprising dunker. He brought a long awaited title to Boston against their hated nemesis, so they could celebrate twice. He cemented the Miami Big 3 legacy. He saved a city and franchise.
He made one shot everyone will remember. The shot heard around the world. He didn't walk away then. Perhaps that would have been fairy tale. When the lights in Miami are dim and the mood is about rebuilding, Ray Allen is in the Hall of Fame. He saved a lot with one game tying three. Miami and the NBA will forever be in his debt.
EA, the game maker in the midst of a big transition from the console era of gaming to the free-to-play world, confirmed widespread reports of layoffs today. The company did not disclose the size of the layoffs, but several other outlets are reporting either hundreds of layoffs or figures that are as high as 10 percent.
The downsizing, which comes on the heels of other layoffs in Montreal and Los Angeles earlier this year, is happening as EA is expected to have a weak earnings report on May 7. EA CEO John Riccitiello recently stepped down over “shortcomings” in the company's financial performance for the most recent quarter after a six-year stint at the helm of the company.
We have an internal memo from executive chairman Larry Probst, which sheds light on some of the changes.
Core marketing functions, which were spread out between EA's five different labels, are getting consolidated under COO Peter Moore. Origin, EA's online distribution platform, is moving under EA's President of Labels, Frank Gibeau, who is considered one of the few plausible internal candidates for taking EA's helm once the CEO search is over.
Here's Probst:
If there are any common issues upon which the low-information, swing-able, independent-to-moderate voters can likely agree, I'd reckon that “too much partisanship and gridlock” is one of them. Congress is pretty deeply unpopular, and after their recent low-output performance, it makes sense that a message about bipartisanship, working together, and getting things done would resonate with a lot of people. In that light, I think this is probably a pretty smart ad:
It's positive, it's encouraging, and it points out one of President Obama's most glaring failures: As much as Obama likes to hem and haw about how Republicans are blocking his agenda items just to be spiteful, he's the president of the United States, for goodness' sake. People want to see some leadership, and that excuse only gets you so far for so long. You can accuse the GOP of being unyielding as much as you want, but in our democracy it takes two to tango, and everybody knows it.
In the past couple of presidential debates, I thought Mitt Romney skillfully navigated a few tricky areas by reverting to a “I worked with the other side and we passed legislation on a bipartisan basis during my Massachusetts governorship” line. As Dick Morris pointed out, people seemed to respond positively to the idea — and it highlights yet another of President “If you're looking for just a bunch of partisan rhetoric, I'm probably not your guy” Obama's promises gone awry.
Tomorrow, on April 29, something amazing is coming to Firefox.
It's not an interface adjustment or tweak. It's not a bug fix. It's a complete re-envisioning of Firefox's user experience, and it's been brewing for the past five years.
Good to Great
This new Firefox, Firefox 29, was borne out of a series of incredible, detail-obsessed designers and engineers understanding that taking products from good to great requires more than a series of incremental improvements.
Good can be achieved through incrementalism. Great requires, at times, overhaul.
Firefox 29 contains extensive improvements that were planned back when Alex Faaborg, Madhava Enros, and myself were the only designers at Mozilla. Back then, Firefox was beginning to buckle under the weight of its inconsistent code and interface.
Realizing the Need for Overhaul
It's common enough for large codebases maintained across years to develop inconsistencies. But, Firefox's nature as an open-source community project contributed to idiosyncratic user experiences. Menus and dialogs used different tenses and tones. Add-ons behaved unpredictably. Customization was handled differently throughout the browser. Over the past few years, we've been working to improve many instances of inconsistent behavior, such as replacing modal dialogs for tab-modal ones, standardizing notifications, and using a uniform tone-of-voice.
Making improvements here and there is often what user experience designers at an organization are expected to do: fix what's broken, slightly improve what isn't, and generally don't get in the way of engineering effort. But, this method can only make an existing product slightly better, and the gaps it causes reveal themselves in time.
A sinking ship can't be patched endlessly when it needs a new hull. This is when user experience design is most effective: when it envisions the system as a whole. When it steps away from the trees and sees the forest holistically.
Firefox needed a new hull, and the bulk of that hull is arriving on Tuesday.
Others have been blogging about Firefox 29's beautiful redesign, so I'll just mention the highlights.
Consistent Customization
Customizing Firefox is now entirely predictable and much more fun. Rather than digging into Preferences windows and dialogs, you can make Firefox the way you like via dragging-and-dropping buttons wherever you want them.
A Customize panel – itself customizable – displays the tools you want available in a single click but don't want to clutter your interface.
Simple and Streamlined
Gone are the bulky angles and edges of tabs and menus. In Firefox 29, you'll see streamlined, almost aerodynamic, curves giving emphasis to your current tab and subtly understating the rest.
Themes and Personalization
Making Firefox visually your own is not only easy, but gorgeous. Lightweight themes look fantastic in 29 with a light interface overlay on whatever image inspires you while you browse.
Obsession with Details
It'd be hard to describe all the changes coming to Firefox in a single post, but I hope you'll find that we left no stone unturned. Firefox 29 is all about details: the glows, the colors, the animations all reflect our desire to make the entire experience seamless. A special hat tip to our visual designer, Stephen Horlander, for his painstaking eye for detail.
Tomorrow's launch day will, perhaps, be our biggest yet. It's certainly an emotional day for myself and the others who have worked on this release for years. I can't wait. I hope you love it.

SALT LAKE CITY – The Utah Jazz are not accepting the Miami Heat beat them fair and square Thursday.
The Jazz found two reasons to dispute the Heat's 111-110 win that was secured when Gordon Hayward's 12-foot pull up bounced off the rim.
The team believes it should have had more than 3.9 seconds on its last possession, which was the time on the clock when Miami lost the ball and Utah called a 20 second time out. The timing becomes an issue because Hayward's shot came with 1.0 second remaining, according to the official stat sheet, and was rebounded by Jazz center Rudy Gobert, who scored on the put back but just after the buzzer.
Also, the Jazz are claiming forward Joe Johnson was fouled away from the ball by Tyler Johnson. They say the contact occurred after Hayward released the shot but before the buzzer, or during that one-second window.
Jazz coach Quin Snyder had to be restrained by two assistants as he approached official Ed Malloy following the game.
Snyder, though, was careful with his words when he spoke to local reporters after the game.
“There were a number of things late in the game that were a little bit confusing,” he said. “We got a shot. Rudy got a put back that was after the buzzer.”
Gobert was more critical … not when asked by the media but on Twitter:
“It still amazes me that this kind of things happen in the best league in the world…” he tweeted.
It still amazes me that this kind of things happen in the best league in the world… — Rudy Gobert (@rudygobert27) December 2, 2016
The controversies were not addressed in the Heat locker room because when reports were speaking to coach Erik Spoelstra and the players nobody even knew there was an issue.
According to the official play-by-play, Hayward missed a potential go-ahead three-point shot with 29.9 seconds to play and James Johnson was credited with the rebound with 27.9 seconds remaining. That would mean the possession ends at 3.9 seconds, which is exactly what the clock showed when Utah gained possession and called a 20 second time out.
But, when Miami took a timeout with 13.2 seconds to play, the 24 second clock showed 8.0 seconds remaining. If the possession started at 27.9 seconds the 24 second clock should have read 9.3 seconds when the Heat took the time out, not 8.0 seconds.
Somehow, the Heat lost 1.3 seconds on the possession.
But since a 24 second violation was not called and Goran Dragic was credited with a turnover in the final seconds, that allows the Jazz to complain that more than 3.9 seconds should have been on the clock when they called the time out.
Except for now they are throwing their own timekeeper under the bus.
Malloy was interviewed by a pool reporter following the game and said the officials had no recourse.
“Yeah, we don't have a trigger that allows us to look to see if a timeout occurs prior to the expiration of a shot clock,” he said.
As for complaining a foul was overlooked that happened away from the ball with less than a second to play. …
Malloy was asked about it but would not answer.
The NBA will review the final seconds in its Last Two Minute Report.

Nal_Ra who worked as a starcraft commentator that enlisted in the army will come back to the scene in a new game.
Nal_Ra will officially debut commentating on July 3rd for the OGN Azubu League of Legends: The Champions 2012 Round of 16.
Nal_Ra is a starcraft progamer who debuted his commentating for MBCGame back in October 2009. In 2010 he enlisted for his military service and after 2 years, he will come back as a commentator not for starcraft, but for League of Legends.
Nal_Ra played quite a bit of League of Legends during his service and is known to have played many games. He was split between Starcraft Brood War, Starcraft2, and League of Legends but he took OGN's offer to try a new scene in League of Legends.
Nal_Ra will return as a commentator for OGN by commentating for Azubu LoL:The Champions 2012 Summer alongside Caster Jun Yong Joon and Kim Dong Joon. Kim Dong Joon and Nal_Ra have been friends since the days of GO (BW Team) but they never showed teamwork in commentating before. Nal_Ra filled in the spot for Kim Dong Joon when he enlisted in the military as a commentator of MBCGames. By the time Nal_Ra enlisted Kim Dong Joon was done with his service so this will be the first time the two commentators will work alongside each other in the Azubu LoL: The Champions 2012 Summer.
After a honorary discharge from the military, Nal_Ra participated in the OSL Legends Match but most of his times have been focused into League of Legends. He even visited the participating team's training houses to learn more about the players and their play styles so he can prepare himself better for commentating League of Legends.
Nal_Ra stated "It's not easy to just change into a new scene but I'll trust in Kim Dong Joon and Jun Yong Joon and follow their footstep." He continued by saying "There might be some awkward moments during my commentating but I will try my best so I hope people can understand."

강민은 공익근무요원으로 활동하는 동안 틈틈이 리그오브레전드를 플레이했고 경기 수도 상당히 많은 것으로 알려졌다. 스타크래프트와 스타크래프트2, 리그오브레전드를 놓고 고민했지만 온게임넷이 새로운 종목에 도전하는 것은 어떠냐고 제안했고 받아들인 것으로 전해졌다.
강민이 리그오브레전드 해설자로 복귀하면서 아주부 리그오브레전드 더 챔피언스 2012 섬머의 중계진은 전용준 캐스터와 김동준, 강민으로 꾸려졌다. 김동준과 강민은 GO 시절부터 친분을 갖고 있었지만 해설자로 호흡을 맞춘 적은 없다. 김동준이 군에 입대하면서 생긴 공백을 강민이 메우기 위해 MBC게임이 해설자로 영입했고 김동준이 전역한 이후에는 강민이 공익근무요원으로 활동했기에 처음으로 리그를 준비하는 것.
강민은 소집해제를 명 받은 이후 스타크래프트 레전드 매치에 출전하기도 했지만 모든 시간을 리그오브레전드에 보내고 있다. 이번 대회에 참가하는 팀들의 연습실과 숙소를 직접 찾아다니면서 선수들에 대한 정보와 스타일 등을 확인하고 있고 발로 뛰는 해설을 준비하고 있다.
강민은 "종목을 바꾼다는 것이 쉽지 않은 일이지만 전용준, 김동준을 믿고 따르겠다"며 "다소 어색한 부분도 있겠지만 최선의 노력을 다할테니 좋게 봐주셨으면 좋겠다"라고 말했다.

A visit to the dentist may soon involve a lot less drilling and filling. A brand-new technology could eliminate the need to have cavities drilled or filled. A new peptide is placed in a soft gel or flexible film and inserted next to a cavity. This peptide encourages the cells to regenerate within about a month, the ACS Nano reports.
Unlike toothpaste which can be used to prevent cavities, this development is to control the cavities after they occur. Nadia Benikrane-Jessel is a scientist at the Institut National de la Sane et de la Recherché Medicale, says “This new research could make a trip to the dentist's office more pleasant.”Instead of a drill the dentist will just have to place a dab of gel or a thin film against the infected tooth to promote healing from the inside.
The causes of cavities vary; they can be caused by certain foods, sugary drinks or lack of dental hygiene. But the resulting pain is all the same. Bacteria and pus filled holes in or on your tooth that lead to discomfort, bad breath, and pain. Similarly until now the treatment of cavities has been the same. Drill out the damaged tooth to remove the decay and fill the hole to keep the cavity from growing.
Doctor Benikrane-Jessel cautions people that the films or gels only treat existing cavities, they do not prevent cavities from forming and that people will still need to use good dental hygiene to prevent cavities to begin with.
The peptide contained in the gel or films is known as MSH or melanocyte-stimulating hormone.
Studies conducted and reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed that MSH stimulates and encourages bone regeneration. Because bones and teeth are so similar, scientists reasoned that if the MSH were applied to damaged teeth it should also promote the healing.
Hom-Lay Wang a dentist at the University of Michigan said” Treating cavities without drilling would have its advantages”. Cavities and drilling can cause nerve damage and even destroy nerves and blood vessels inside the tooth making it more fragile and brittle. By regenerating a tooth, people could avoid needing crowns after a cavity has been filled or repaired.

A seminar scheduled for October 25 called, “Is society letting transgender children down?” has been cancelled after complaints from trans activists. The Dare to Debate session had been set to feature feminist writer, Sarah Ditum, and Kellie Maloney, a boxing promoter formerly known as Frank who transitioned in 2014. On her website, Ditum writes:
“Maloney's past includes the expression of homophobic sentiments (now repudiated), and a 2005 attack on Tracey Maloney when the two were married (Maloney has attributed this in part to the strain of living with a suppressed gender identity).”
According to a statement on the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) website, “Dare to Debate seminars are designed to provoke debate about serious issues facing children today — child protection issues that might not otherwise get the focus that they deserve.”
This particular debate, hosted by NSPCC, aimed “to shine a light on the difficulties and problems that trans children face in the UK, to ask whether society is doing enough to help them and discuss what more can and should be done.”
Rather than protest the presence of a wife-beater, trans activists, according to Pink News, “vowed to shun the session over the invitation to Sarah Ditum,” who is a writer Nick Duffy claims, “has a history of extreme comments about trans people.” Complaints online engaged in further slander about Ditum's perspectives and work, misrepresenting her feminist analysis of gender as “bigotry.”
(1)NSPCC is supposed to protect & support children not encourage more abuse from a"conversion therapy " bigot. This debate will yet again https://t.co/GyPy1c1ZWR — Parents LincsLGBT (@LGBTLincs) October 13, 2016
A petition against the debate (erroneously) claims Ditum “actively campaigns against supporting trans children with anything but conversion therapy.” In truth, pushing children towards medical and social transition as a first approach is more accurately defined as “conversion therapy,” as compared with the more nuanced approach many feminists like Ditum advocate for. The notion that we might consider “support” for children who believe they are struggling with “gender identity” beyond a medicalized, single-minded approach, rooted in regressive gender stereotypes, is not a bigoted one, but a progressive one.
While the petition itself acknowledges Maloney's history of domestic violence, the vast majority of signees as well as complaints online focused on Ditum's attendance, rather than Maloney's.
Nonetheless, Maloney elected to pull out of the debate, complaining that the session had become a “social media circus” and a “personal attack.”
Numerous feminists and other interested parties have come out in support of Ditum, opposing the slander leveled at her, expressing disappointment that the event has been shut down.
.@sarahditum @NSPCC I have emailed this complaint. Was looking forward to an informed, respectful and balanced debate. One that is needed. pic.twitter.com/xmxsxThgDK — Euro Bo (@bo_novak) October 13, 2016
@NSPCC as someone who regrets her gender transition, I am so disappointed to hear the #daretodebate event with @sarahditum was cancelled — (Carey) Maria Catt (@catt_bear) October 13, 2016
@sarahditum @NSPCC this is disappointing. We need informed, intelligent public debate on this issue. Sarah would have been an ideal speaker — Julie Smith (@lazyjoolz) October 13, 2016
@sarahditum @NSPCC so, this is a thing an organisation supporting children doesn't 'dare to debate'. Disappointing. — Debbie Cameron (@wordspinster) October 13, 2016
While the NPSCC's statement acknowledges that “many trans children have felt that they aren't getting the support that they need,” opposition to the event appears to be rooted in a fear of exploring what “support” means. The NPSCC explains:
“… The trans community have raised concerns and told us that they don't support the NSPCC hosting this discussion. We have listened, and following the withdrawal of a keynote speaker, we are no longer hosting this event.”
The notion that transitioning children is unequivocally the best way to support kids who don't fit into stereotypical gender roles is highly contested and should be of concern to anyone who claims to have the best interests of children in mind. That questioning this approach and the quickly growing industry surrounding gender transition is being positioned as “bigotry” or “transphobia” is telling. When it becomes impermissible to question ideas, those ideas become dogma, not progress.
As Ditum put it, “they don't actually ‘dare to debate' if there is a risk that the conversation might challenge the current conventions around transgender children.”

For the 1949 season, the caretakers of the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree decided to go fantastically over the top.
Just a few years earlier, New Yorkers were served up a plainly adorned tree with no electric lights, a reminder of the war in Europe and a nod to energy preservation. But the war was over now; it was time to get delightfully gaudy.
Perhaps knowing the mild temperatures that awaited that season — it would only snow two inches between November 1949 and January 1950 — the Rockefeller Center holiday designers decided to spray paint the gigantic 75-foot tree in hundreds of gallons of whimsical silver paint. It was then engulfed in 7,500 electric lights in pastel colors — pink, blue, yellow, green and orange, described as “plucked from a sky in fairyland.”
This Easter-like hue, bouncing off the silver-painted branches, reflected out from behind dozens of glass ornaments, leading up to the brilliant white star on top, which, according to the New York Times, “seemed to send glints of fire almost to the top of the seventy-seventh floor RCA Building in back of the tree.”
As if that didn't grab your attention, the promenade leading up to the tree and the skating rink was adorned with a most dizzying decoration — rapidly whirling plastic snowflakes, 576 of them, illuminated for hypnotic effect.
At right: An ad for the Rockefeller Center ice skating pond, from a December 1949 issue of the New Yorker
Is it any surprise then that this insane display would later create, on December 19, 1949, “one of the worst traffic jams Fifth Avenue traffic jams in recent years“?
Due to shocked motorists trying to catch a glimpse at this electric wonderland, Fifth Avenue became a rush hour nightmare for several hours. “Cars were pinned bumper to bumper from 72nd south to 41st Street along Fifth Avenue, making cross-traffic an impossibility and imprisoning automobiles in side streets.”
Even through police were called out to enforce emergency traffic rules, Midtown was essentially in a state of vehicular trauma until 10 pm that evening.

Nimb is a wearable that does just that — it's a smart ring that will alert specific contacts and local authorities with your GPS location in the event of an emergency. Just press and hold the button on the underside of the ring for three seconds and an alert will go out with your location. You can press it with just one hand, but thankfully it's hard to press the button accidentally, Nimb co-founder Kathy Roma tells Digital Trends. It's concealed in the ring's design, and there's a 20-second window that lets you cancel the alert just in case.
To cancel the alert, you need to use the Nimb app and enter your password — so not just anyone can cancel your alert. You can do this outside of the 20-second window, to let everyone know you're alright.
“Just in case the attacker forces you to cancel the alert, you can use a special password for forced cancellation,” Roma said. “Your trusted contacts will immediately know that someone forced you to cancel the alert.”
Your location will be tracked in real-time, and there's even an audio recording functionality built in that collects evidence through the user's phone when an alert is triggered. Once an alert is sent out, your emergency contacts will be notified in a variety of different formats, depending on what you chose during the initial setup: texts, push notifications, vibrations, calls, and emails — contacts who also use Nimb will feel a vibration from the ring to let them know that someone is in danger.
What's neat is that when you're setting up Nimb for the first time, you can choose who you want your emergency contacts to be, and whether or not you want to include 911. If you do add 911 to the list, Nimb creates a robotic call option that goes to the closest 911 dispatch center based on your GPS coordinates. The message tells the operator the sender's name, gender, and location.
One of your emergency contacts can also alert 911 via the Nimb app. The company is also working on a way to integrate the audio-recording feature into the 911 IT system, so that messages from Nimb are sent “directly to the 911 dashboard.”
Nimb isn't exclusive to the U.S. in terms of reaching out to emergency services, as Roma says “there are several ways to make a reliable connection with existing institutions which provide public safety services. It will vary from country to country, and our job is to choose the best one: technology can do this already.”
The device isn't just for contacting people in the event of an emergency — it also vibrates on your finger when you walk away from your phone. Unfortunately you will have to recharge your ring, but it'll last for two weeks on a single charge.
The company is launching its Kickstarter campaign on June 21, and the ring will be available for as low as $75 — it's retail price will cost $150. You'll be able to get two Nimb rings for $150 as a special Kickstarter deal. You'll also be able to choose from a wide range of colors and U.S. ring sizes.
Contacting emergency services is getting easier and easier — in the upcoming watchOS 3 update, the Apple Watch will soon be able to prove useful in emergency situations as well, thanks to a new SOS function and a digital card with your emergency contact information. All you have to do is press and hold the side button to activate a countdown to call a local emergency number.
China has a so-called “ghost driver” problem, with Uber passengers being scammed out of rides and money, fearful of being picked up by what looks like a zombie.
According to local reports, pick-up requests are being met by Uber drivers using zombie-like profile shots to scare would-be passengers into cancelling their rides, which means the driver is paid a small cancellation fee.
When the passenger books the ride they are shown a profile photo, numberplate and other bits of information about the driver. Given fears over the safety of so-called ride-sharing systems such as Uber, its understandable that when a creepy-looking profile of the driver pops up to confirm their pickup that many passengers simply cancel the request.
Should the passenger carry on with the journey regardless of the deathly face staring at them on their phone, the ghost drivers will also claim that the passenger has entered the vehicle and cancel it a short time after, again charging the customer a small fee.
According to a statement given to Chinese media, Uber is aware of the problem and is in the process of collecting evidence and user reports.
The company said that it has a “zero-tolerance attitude to scamming behaviour” and that it was refunding those scammed and was using technology to try to combat the scammers. It recently introduced facial-recognition technology in an attempt to reduce driver fraud in China, which confirms that the driver's face matches the one the company has on file.
“We have taken immediate actions and banned these reported individual fraud accounts while continuing to investigate and crack down on any fraudulent behavior to protect rider and driver interests,” an Uber spokesperson told Quartz.
Uber and local rival Didi Chuxing merged at the start of August, leaving the new Uber-branded service with control of the new app-assisted taxi industry in the country. The merger saw Uber hand over its branding, operations and data to Didi in exchange for a 20% stake of the company.
All 12 clubs in the Championship are fully-professional
The Rugby Football Union has agreed to an increase in the amount of money it pays to clubs in the Championship.
The new agreement between English rugby's governing body and second-tier clubs runs until the summer of 2020.
Funds will also go towards player medical insurance, while clubs will be expected to invest in their facilities.
It comes just weeks after discussions to expand the Premiership and scrap promotion and relegation to the Championship began.
The new central funding deal is the first since the Championship was formed in 2009 from the old National League One. The amount of money which clubs will receive has not been revealed.
A number of the 12 teams in the division have called for extra funding from the RFU for the division, which is seen as a key breeding ground for future English talent.
Clubs in the Championship Worcester Jersey Plymouth Albion Doncaster Rotherham London Scottish Bristol Cornish Pirates Yorkshire Carnegie Nottingham Bedford Moseley
Earlier this year bottom-of-the-table Plymouth Albion almost entered administration, with the club saying the
Nottingham, London Welsh and Plymouth, in 2010 and have come close to folding since the league was formed. Plans for the formation of the Championship at the time were described as "financial suicide" by First Division Rugby, the body that represented clubs in the competition.
"The Greene King IPA Championship Clubs were unanimous in their agreement to the new funding deal with the RFU," said Bedford chairman Geoff Irvine, who is chairman of the group that represents the 12 second-tier club.
"Of course we would have liked more but the RFU were very professional in the negotiations and the clubs understand the demands that the Union has in terms of funding from all areas of the game.
"The five year deal should provide some stability and enable clubs to undertake long term planning for the future."
The Episcopal Church and the United Church of Christ also allow gay ministers. And the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)'s general assembly voted at its convention earlier this month to do so, though the vote will become church law only if is ratified by a majority of the church's 173 regional presbyteries. Two smaller Lutheran denominations, the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod, do not ordain ministers in same-sex relationships.
The seven ministers welcomed at the ceremony on Sunday had already been ordained and have been serving at churches or outreach ministries in the San Francisco Bay Area, but they had not been officially recognized on the clergy roster.

“The effect of them being brought onto our roster is they will now be part of our national database of pastors who are available for service in any of our 10,500 churches,” said Bishop Mark W. Holmerud, who leads the Sierra Pacific Synod, which includes San Francisco. He noted that while some congregations were open to consider hiring openly gay ministers, others were not — and each congregation is free to choose.
The Evangelical Lutherans designed Sunday's special “rite of reception” to mark the formal inclusion of gay ministers who were ordained in “extraordinary rites” that were not recognized by the church but were conducted by a group called Extraordinary Lutheran Ministries. Three more gay pastors will be welcomed at ceremonies in September and October, two in the St. Paul-Minneapolis area and one in Chicago, Ms. Cooper said.
Amalia Vagts, executive director of Extraordinary Lutheran Ministries, said, “It's been a long and hard journey for a lot of people, and it feels like this is a new beginning in the history of the E.L.C.A.”

She said that all together, there were 46 openly gay ministers who had previously been excluded from the church's clergy roster and would now be accepted.
The change was made possible after the Churchwide Assembly, the Evangelical Lutherans' chief legislative body, voted at its meeting in 2009 to allow the ordination of noncelibate gay pastors who are in monogamous relationships. The denomination appointed a task force to study the issue in 2001, and spent the next eight years in debate. In the end, the proposal to permit openly gay clergy members won just two-thirds of the votes, the minimum required for passage.
Some who opposed it are now poised to leave. The Rev. Mark Chavez, director of Lutheran CORE, a coalition of theologically conservative Lutheran churches, said his group expected to form a new denomination, the North American Lutheran Church, in August.

He said of the ceremony on Sunday, “It's just another steady step taken by the E.L.C.A. to move the denomination further and further away from most Lutheran churches around the world and from the whole Christian church, unfortunately.”
Before the ceremony, one of the gay pastors, the Rev. Megan M. Rohrer, said it had been a long journey from her home in South Dakota — where fellow Lutherans regarded her sexuality as a demon to be exorcised — to being finally welcomed as a minister in the Lutheran church.
“It's an invitation,” she said of the ceremony, “to join us in the pews every single Sunday, where not a single one of these pastors will care if you agree with us or if you think our families are appropriate. We'll serve you communion, we'll pray with you and we'll visit you in the hospital.”
Skeleton of a Python package
Mapbox Blocked Unblock Follow Oct 30, 2014
By Sean Gillies
You've written a directory full of Python scripts on your laptop and now you want to deploy them elsewhere and share them with other developers. Turning them into a proper package at this stage can be a nightmare. In hindsight, beginning your work within the framework of a package would have been better! Introducing Mapbox Pyskel, a skeleton Python package repo that you can clone and make your own. A test suite and command line interface are included.
Pyskel emerged out of our internal experience in building Python tools. Our designers and developers utilize an array of python modules — Rasterio, Fiona, and Shapely to name a few — and needed a better way to build and share these tools. Recently, we've been building tools that enable vectorization of raster weather data into formats optimized for styling in Mapbox Studio Classic, and we are using the Mapbox Pyskel framework to create a shareable package.
Pyskel aims to embody wisdoms written down in various sources, including:
I've been a long time user of paster create from Paste Script, but a skeleton repo is a better fit for the programming teams I work with these days. You will find other skeletons (some named “pyskel”) on GitHub, but I've made a few different choices for Mapbox Pyskel that you may appreciate. A Pyskel-based package entails the installation of Click for command line interface development and Pytest for testing. Each of these reduce development friction and make Mapbox Pyskel a good choice for a developer looking to increase their productivity.
Mapbox Pyskel is open source. Give it a try and let us know if there are features you'd like to see!
Writing a successful Ruby gem
Want to write a successful Ruby gem? Here's how in THREE EASY STEPS!
Step 1: Invent a catchy moniker
Choose something either intrinsically cool (e.g. skycrane) or ironically cool (e.g. unibrow). If you get the name right, every Ruby developer will want to use your gem and be disappointed if it isn't relevant to their current projects.
Step 2: Decide what it should do
It doesn't matter. Sure, ideally your gem's name will give some clue as to its function. But if the name is awesome enough, no one will mind if it's obtuse or even misleading. And don't worry if it's already a solved problem. In fact, don't even bother checking. Your awesome name will make it superior.
If you've wracked your brain and come up empty, an HTTP client is always a good choice.
Step 3: Design your API
Ruby devs have a fever, and the only prescription is more DSL! Also, puns. And I don't mean that pun; I mean code puns. Here are two examples of a library that sends files over any network protocol. You tell me which will be preferred.
FileSender::send_file file, :protocol => :sftp, :host => 'example.com', :username => 'jimmy_jimmy', :password => 'my_cats_name', :path => '/some/dir' # vs SkyCrane.lift! file do sftp do host 'example.com' username 'jimmy_jimmy' password 'my_cats_name' path '/some/dir' end end
I can't think of an example use case for Unibrow, but I know you'll want to use it anyway.
Unibrow.join left, right
See? How much more awesomer would your code be if that was sprinkled throughout?
Why all the hate, bro?
It isn't. It's merely a few observations I've made during my years as both a user and creator of Ruby Gems. I love using well-designed APIs as much as the next; some are even a joy. I'm only noting that occasionally we risk becoming a little silly. Obviously this isn't unique to the Ruby community. If I was a Java developer, this post may have been about Factory Factories, and Factory Factory Factories.
The more I look at it, the more I like the SkyCrane idea…
NEW YORK (JTA) – Jews are the most warmly regarded religious group in America, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center.
The survey of 3,217 adults conducted in June asked respondents to rate their feelings toward various religious groups on a scale of 1 to 100, with 1 being coldest, 100 warmest and 50 meaning they have neither positive nor negative feelings.
Jews rated 63, slightly ahead of Catholics (62) and evangelicals (61). Buddhists, Hindus and Mormons prompted neutral ratings, from 48 to 53. Muslims were given the worst rating, at 40. Atheists rated 41.
Respondents rated their own faith groups highest, the survey said, explaining that evangelicals and Catholics are so fondly viewed in the United States because they are the country's largest religious groups (the survey counted Protestants as evangelicals). Together, Catholics and evangelicals represented 52 percent of respondents.
Jews gave themselves an 89 rating. For other faith groups, Jews gave Catholics a 58 rating, Buddhists 61, Hindus 57, atheists 55, Mormons 48, Muslims 35 and evangelicals 34.
Evangelicals in the survey rated Jews positively with a rating of 69.
Sixty-one percent of respondents said they know someone who is Jewish; Jews constitute approximately 2 percent of the U.S. population.
The survey showed a divide between older and younger Americans. Older Americans view Jews, evangelicals and Catholics most favorably. Younger Americans gave higher ratings to atheists and Muslims than older Americans did — ratings of 49 each by Americans aged 18-29.
Jews were viewed most favorably by whites, at 66. Blacks and Hispanics each gave Jews a 58. Blacks gave evangelicals and Muslims more favorable ratings than whites.
The survey had a margin of error of 2.2 percentage points.
Easy chocolate and whipped cream cupcake recipe A fluffy chocolate sponge topped with a light, fresh whipped cream frosting. Prep Time: 10 minutes Cook Time: 20 minutes Yield: 10
I don't know if you have tried any recipes with fresh cream frostings rather than buttercream? I haven't looked back since to be honest! It makes the cake taste so much lighter and is definitely not so sickly!
So when I was asked to make some birthday cupcakes for a training group at work, I knew they had to have a whipped cream frosting. I decided to keep them simple as I haven't made a plain cupcake for a while.
This recipe certainly doesn't disappoint. Everyone loved them and it's even one that I would go as far to say I personally loved.
What I will say, is that this only made around 10 cupcakes, but the frosting could top more than 10. I suppose this just means you can top it with more cream – the best part is it won't overpower the taste of the cake like some butter creams can.
Chocolate sponge recipe taken from the Hummingbird Bakery.
Ingredients for the sponge: 100g plain flour
2 1/2 tbs unsweetened cocoa powder
140g caster sugar
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
a pinch of salt
40g unsalted butter – at room temperature
120ml milk
1 egg
1/4 tsp vanilla extract
Method:
Preheat the oven to 170C and line a cupcake tin with paper cases
Put the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, salt and butter in a freestanding electric mixer with a paddle attachment and beat on a slow speed until you get a sandy consistency
Whisk the milk, egg and vanilla extract in a bowl
Slowly pour about half into the flour mixture, beat to combine
Turn the mixer up high to get rid of any lumps
Turn the mixer down to a slow speed and slowly pour in the remaining milk mixture
Continue mixing for a couple of minutes until the mixture is smooth
Spoon the mixture into the paper cases until two-thirds full
Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes
Ingredients for the Whipped cream frosting: 300ml whipping cream
1 tbs granulated sugar
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
Method:
Pour the cream into a bowl and whisk on medium-high speed until it just starts to thicken.
Slow the speed down to medium and gradually pour in the sugar.
Continue to whisk until soft peaks form.
Add the vanilla extract and continue to whisk by hand until the cream is smooth, and stiff peaks form (the cream will stand up straight when the whisk is raised).
Once the cupcakes are completely cooled, pipe the frosting onto the cake. I topped with a quarter of a cadbury flake.
So simple yet so good!
Is Chris Ivory capable of becoming a feature back for the New York Jets, or does the team need to consider drafting a running back?
Rome wasn't built in a day, Mike Maccagnan.
Still, Maccagnan has been busy since being anointed the New York Jets' new general manager. Since coming on board, he's been signing, trading, and re-signing players to help his vision for this roster come to fruition.
He's already starting to leave his thumbprints all over the roster of this New York Jets team, but even after bringing back Bilal Powell on a one-year deal and signing Daryl Richardson to a reserve/futures contract, did Maccagnan do enough to help his team's run game?
Chris Ivory is set to lead the backfield following the departure of "I don't even be in the game" Chris Johnson after Maccagnan decided to decline Johnson's contract option. Should the Jets feel comfortable entering 2015 with this current backfield arrangement?
Ivory has now been with New York for two years after leaving the New Orleans Saints but has yet to be featured in a prominent role. After playing in a timeshare with both Chris Johnson and Bilal Powell the past two years, can Ivory take the leap and breakout in 2015 as a feature back?
Unearthing a Gem
Undrafted out of small-school Tiffin University in 2010 -- partly due to a knee injury -- Chris Ivory was quickly picked up by the New Orleans Saints following the draft.
Even among a crowded backfield, Ivory stood out for his brash, tough running style and was able to showcase that talent when injuries affected others ahead of him on the depth chart. In his rookie season, Ivory tied for the third highest yards per carry in the league at 5.2 yards per carry. As for advanced measures, his Rushing Net Expected Points (NEP) of 11.38 placed him sixth out of the 45 running backs that eclipsed 100 carries that year.
NEP contextualizes on-field production and factors in score, down-and-distance, and other variables to look deeper than simple yardage or touchdowns. You can read more about NEP in our glossary here.
In fact, out of all rookie running backs dating back to 2000 that had at least the same amount of carries as Ivory in his rookie season (137 carries), Ivory's impressive 5.2 yards per carry trailed only Maurice Jones-Drew, Adrian Peterson, Clinton Portis, DeMarco Murray, and Ben Tate. Pretty impressive company.
While the beginning of his career was undoubtedly off to a good start, depth chart battles and injuries prevented Ivory from seeing significant playing time during the rest of his tenure as a Saint. The New Orleans offense often showcased a mix of running backs, subsequently preventing Ivory from getting consistent carries. Ivory was unable to get the lion's share of carries that he -- and many other running backs -- need in order to get into a grove dictating the rushing attack, which may have played a determining factor in his relocation after his rookie contract.
When Ivory became a restricted free agent in 2012, he found the New York Jets interested in his services. After being traded in exchange for a fourth round pick, Ivory left for New York to start the next chapter of his career.
Were the Lights too Bright in New York?
While Ivory did bring his same style of running to New York, he found less success running, and his efficiency plummeted. Out of the running backs to eclipse 100 or more carries the past two years, the numbers haven't exactly been in Ivory's favor.
Year Carries Rushing NEP / Carry Total NEP Chris Ivory 2014 199 -8.51 (26th/43) -0.04 (23rd/43) -2.03 (26th/43) Chris Johnson 2014 155 -7.4 (22nd/43) -0.05 (26th/43) 0.42 (23rd/43) Chris Ivory 2013 182 -1.90 (19th/47) -0.01 (19th/47) -2.38 (28th/47) Bilal Powell 2013 176 -13.98 (35th/47) -0.08 (34th/47) -3.35 (29th/47)
As evidenced in the table above, Chris Ivory hasn't set the world on fire since moving to the Big Apple. Falling in the middle of the pack or worse during his time as Jet isn't necessarily a ringing endorsement for new head coach Todd Bowles and Maccagnan as they continue evaluating the roster they've adopted and players that aren't one of "their guys."
Ivory's lack of production from a receiving standpoint also limits their starter's potential output. Ivory had a career high 18 receptions in 2014, but prior to that he boasted a mere five career receptions over four years. New offensive coordinator Chan Gailey's spread-style offense will likely need a more capable receiving back. Ivory's lack of career receptions is certainly a red flag projecting into 2015.
Another Option on the Depth Chart?
Enter Bilal Powell into the equation -- a former fourth-round pick from Louisville -- who accumulated more receptions (36) in 2013 than Ivory has had in his entire career (23). Is Powell capable of filling in for third-down capabilities or another timeshare similar to what the Jets used in 2013?
To put it bluntly -- the Jets could do much better. When Powell was utilized in that role in 2013, he posted some of the lowest scores based on our various NEP metrics. Out of the 32 running backs who posted 30 or more receptions in 2013, Powell fell towards the bottom of the rankings.
Year Receptions Reception NEP Target NEP Catch Rate Total NEP Bilal Powell 2013 36 8.18 (27th/32) -7.32 (29th/32) 63.16% (31st/32) -3.35 (26th/32)
The outlook for 2015 with using Powell as New York's primary receiving back should make fans uneasy.
The Jets are essentially entering 2015 with the same backfield they had two years ago after a disastrous one-year trial run at revitalizing Chris Johnson's career. By the looks of things, 2015 is a disaster in the making.
While the Jets are installing a new offense and could have a new signal caller under center in Ryan Fitzpatrick that could open up running lanes, adding a running back in one of the most efficient classes in years would undoubtedly benefit the franchise in the immediate future and beyond.
With Ivory, Powell, and Daryl Richardson's contracts all set to expire next year, investing a Day 2 draft pick on a rookie running back could help put the Jets' rushing woes at ease.
Draft Reinforcements
This draft has immense quality and depth for pass rushers, and the Jets are in a prime position to land one of the top prospects that hits both value and need with the sixth overall pick.
While they've also been rumored to be in the mix for Marcus Mariota -- not to mention the fact that they have brought in both Mariota and Jameis Winston for team visits -- it will be interesting to see how the new staff values incumbent Geno Smith and newcomer Fitzpatrick compared to the two rookies.
After an active start to free agency and building a revamped secondary, Mike Maccagnan has mitigated the need for any draft "reaches." Staying put at the sixth spot, the Jets could likely pick up one of this class's premiere pass rushers in either Clemson's Vic Beasley or Florida's Dante Fowler, depending on how the board shakes out, or find themselves with a new face of the franchise in a young quarterback.
Using their second round pick on an offensive linemen could certainly aid their running game -- the Jets have already had three linemen in to visit to date -- but there could also be some quality value at that juncture before a run on running backs inevitably occurs later in the second round. Below are some talented running backs that could likely be available in either the second or third rounds that bring a receiving element to their game that the Jets desperately need.
Projected 2nd-Round Running Backs
Jay Ajayi 6â€™0â€, 221 Pounds (Draft Age: 21) | Boise State
Our own Joseph Juan took an in-depth look at Boise State's Jay Ajayi and broke down every aspect of Ajayi's game, concluding his stock is on the rise and will likely have his name called before the end of the second round. Bringing 50 receptions and 347 carries to the table after a blockbuster junior year where he had 43.2% market share of his team's offensive touches, Ajayi has shown he's a versatile weapon that can attack defenses in a plethora of ways.
Ameer Abdullah 5'9", 205 Pounds (Draft Age: 21) | Nebraska
Nebraska running back Ameer Abdullah has all the tools that you look for in a running back. He is one of the more impressive running backs in the draft, according to Mock Draftable, posting exceptional agility and explosion scores. After an incredible senior year where he scored a combined 22 touchdowns and had rushed for more than 200 yards on four separate occasions -- trailing only Wisconsin's Melvin Gordon -- Abduallah would be an outstanding addition to any team.
Projected 3rd-Round Running Backs
Duke Johnson 5'9â€, 207 Pounds (Draft Age: 21) | Miami (FL)
If the Jets decide to fill other needs earlier in the draft, Miami's Duke Johnson could be a tremendous pickup if still available in the third round. While he may not be as much of a "complete" back as the two previously mentioned rookies, his receiving prowess would make him an extraordinary addition to Gailey's offense. Johnson displayed he could seamlessly adjust to passes even in traffic and has the quickness to be a mismatch against linebackers at the next level. Johnson also has a knack for finding creases and exploiting them in productive runs and could help the Jets immediately in 2015.
Mike Davis 5'9", 217 Pounds (Draft Age: 22) | South Carolina
While there are injury concerns around South Carolina's Mike Davis that may cause him to slide in the draft, one team will get very lucky if Davis can make a full recovery and get back to his 2013 elite-playing self. Davis has shown soft hands out of the backfield when adjusting for screen passes and sees the field well to pick up real estate in a hurry. He has the potential to develop into an NFL-caliber starter but injury and conditioning concerns may cause some teams to hesitate on draft day.
The Jets could still take a look through the free agent pile to see if there's anything left over. It seems Maccagnan was poking around there earlier last week as the Jets reportedly had former Patriots running back Stevan Ridley in for a visit. While Stevan Ridley may be a short-term complementary weapon to add to offensive coordinator Chan Gailey's arsenal, picking up one of the better receiving running backs may help the team more in the long term.
We've already seen that Maccagnan is not afraid to mix it up with the signings and roster moves he's made to date. Adding a long term solution with a rookie running back would be a wise investment to help his team in 2015 and beyond.
I've never done a process post before, probably because I usually want to hide my process from the world in shame and figure those types of things are better left to more impressive folks like Ryan Lang. But hey, everyone is at a different level and I used to not be at this level, so maybe this will be of some help or interest to some people. Plus, I love drawing Kuvira's Giant Mech, which I designed and am proud of, so this seemed like a good piece to highlight. I am reasonably happy with the final version, at least for now… but the more I look at it the more things I see that I would tweak now… so I better get this out there before I change my mind! (This is for an international DVD cover coming out this fall.)
Tiburon Rum is the latest release from Traveller's Liquors of Belize. Rum from Traveller's Liquors is not readily available in the UK. I have previously tried only one of Traveller's offerings One Barrel Rum. Which despite favourable reviews from other sites and a few “awards” was not appraised to well by myself.
It would appear that Traveller's are trying to break into the “Premium” market with this offering. It will also be released in the UK and imported by Gentoo Spirits Limited. As with my last Traveller's rum review I obtained this botlle via Master of Malt. The rum cost £36 (the UK retail price when released will be £34.99, I understand). I am pretty certain the bottle I have received is not the commercial UK release as the bottle is 750ml rather than 700ml (70cl). For reasons I have never researched the US (which is where this bottle seems to originate) have slightly larger bottles. Still, before I get anyone into trouble the bottle does have a HMRC pink import sticker on it so Speciality Drinks have paid all appropriate duty etc. NB I have been contacted by the UK distributors for Tiburon rum who state I am misinformed regarding the bottle size and the RRP. Below is an extract from an email I received from them
” Regarding the review I would just like to point out a few things
1. You are correct that it is distilled by Travellers Liquors but it is for an American based company called Shark Bait. Apart from the actual distilling of the rum Travellers Liquor has no input into the design or marketing of the product.
2. In relation to the bottle sizing it will be staying the 750ml bottles and all UK duty has been paid.
3. In regards to the small batch comments only 9,000 bottles were produced in the first run of the product. As it has been successful in the US they next batch is expected to be a few thousand more.
4. As for RRP we haven't set one yet as we are waiting to see how many cases we can bring in going forward. We brought in a few cases to test the water and the price has been set by the retailers. As you can see it varies between them all. We are expecting the RRP to below £30. As the number of bottle made are limited and the rum isn't mass produced it does have an effect on the price. Couple that with the extortionate UK Duty and VAT and it makes a massive difference to the price. As production increases the price will fall accordingly.”
For those familiar with Traveller's previous offerings, presentation can lead a lot to be desired and in some instances has been very gawdy and overall pretty poor. Certainly not that of a Premium product. Shark Bait have tried to address this and from a distance the rum does look very impressive. However on closer inspection, the front of the bottle in particular is a little basic. On the neck of the bottle is a little plastic sharks tooth, which looks a little like a tribal necklace. Tiburon is Spanish for Shark. The Shark picture on the front is actually on the inside of the rear of the bottle and when the rum is full looks fairly impressive.
The rear of the bottle gives the marketing story with regard Tiburon Rum. It also re-iterates from the front of the bottle the “small batch” and “craft” which has gone into the making of the rum. It's kind of like marketing by numbers. I doubt the person paid to put this piece together spent longer than half an hour writing it. It's very standard. The rum is finished off with a plastic topped synthetic topper. It gives a satisfying pop when the rum is opened.
To date, Tiburon Rum has captured eight awards: Platinum at the SIP Awards: Packaging (2014), Gold at Craft Spirit Awards (2014), The Best Aged Rum (2014) and Spirits of the Americas (2014), Silver at the International Wine & Spirit Competition (2014), SIP Awards Rum (2014) and San Diego Spirits Festival Bottle Competition (2014) and Bronze at the San Francisco World Spirit (2014). It has also received many very favourable online reviews.
Tiburon Rum is a “Small Batch Premium Crafted Aged Rum”. Traveller's Liquors distill their spirits using a Triple Column Continuous Still. Now that does not strike me as small batch production. Surely the very minimum definition of Small Batch production would be produced (at least partly) in a Pot Still?
I'll now move onto the ageing claims. I have no problem with young rums. A four year old rum can be as good as something aged much longer. The skill is often in the blender and the care and quality of the ingredients used. I have noted that in some sources it states that Tiburon is a blend of rums aged a minimum of 4 years but upto 8 years. Marketing releases from Traveller's state that the 4 year old claim relates to the youngest rum in the blend and there are older rums contained within, they do not get any more specific than that. I'll do a very simple comparison based on perceived value. Appleton Reserve contains rum which is all aged AT LEAST 8 years and retails for around £25 in the UK. By putting itself in the £35 market Tiburon is pitching itself in with some very healthy and longstanding competitors. RL Seales 10 Year Old, Appleton 12 and El Dorado 12 Year Old are just three of the rums which immediately spring to mind in the £30-35 market. Now that is some competition.
So on with the tasting. I hope you don't feel my pre-conceptions will cloud my judgement on this. However, it is a perhaps something that the producers should consider. Don't big up your products too much.
Anyway on with the tasting. The bottle advises that the “tannins” help colour the spirit and impart subtle hints of vanilla and oaky accents. The rum is a nice golden brown colour, in keeping I feel with the age of the spirit. When poured in the glass it is slightly lighter an almost straw colour.
The nose of the Tiburon (unlike I suspect its Spanish namesake) is very muted. I'm pleasantly surprised that it smells like rum first and foremost. The One Barrel was one of the most altered rums I have ever had the misfortune to try. I had suspected the worst with Tiburon but it does seem that Traveller's have attempted to produce a more rum like experience with Tiburon. There is a little sweet brown sugar on the nose and faint touches of vanilla. I'm not really getting a nose that I would expect from an aged Premium rum. More of a younger mixing rum. It's not bad it's just quite bland and inoffensive.
The rum is very smooth and easy to sip, minimal burn. I detect possibly a little added sugar but whilst it might be rounding out the rough edges of the spirit I am not being overwhelmed with sugary flavour. There is a certain amount of oakiness in the profile. Which suggests honest ageing. Vanilla is present after an initial very short burst of sweetness. It's not prominent so it doesn't offend my tastebuds too much. Although this a marketed as a Premium rum I am going to mix the rum as I am finding a lot in its profile which would suggest it would work best as that.
Mixed with cola Tiburon makes a perfectly acceptable rum and cola. A squeeze of lime adds much needed fruit flavour, but the drink is reasonably well balanced and the spirit does not exhibit any alcohol burn. It's smooth and inoffensive.
If Tiburon Rum was being sold for say around £20 and as more of a mixer than a Premium product (I'd cut some of the marketing as well) then I could probably cut it a little more slack. It would probably find itself in my bar more often at this pricepoint. However, with so many really great rums available at the £35 pricepoint (and below) recommending buying Tiburon over a lot of those rums would be madness really.
Tiburon has a lot in common with Bajan rum. However, the best comparison I feel I can make is to that of Cruzan Single Barrel Estate. Cruzan is slightly better as it offers a few more flavours but both are quite “safe” so-so rums. Both have something missing. Bajan rums such as Doorlys XO and Cockspur 12 offer more fruit flavours in the profile and as sippers or mixers offer a more complex taste experience.
Tiburon Rum is a million times better than One Barrel and fair play to Traveller's for laying off the additives. However, trying to place a product aged for around 4 years in the £35 price market is madness. Even an 8 year old rum at that price is pushing it a bit. I'm not a double digit rum snob but if Traveller's are serious about entering the Premium rum market then the answer is really simple.
Age this longer and maybe introduce a finish which will make it stand out from the crowd.
The aspiring Queensland politician filmed slapping his toddler across the head in a restaurant has withdrawn his candidacy from tomorrow's election.
Jason Deller, an independent candidate for Kawana, read a tearful statement apologising to his family and the electorate for his actions today.
For all Queensland election coverage, visit our Queensland Decides minisite.
Video obtained by 9NEWS shows Mr Deller throwing cold water on his baby boy and swiftly slapping his other son, three, when the youngster reaches for nearby table decorations.
"Unfortunately I reacted inappropriately,” an emotional Mr Deller said.
“I sincerely apologise to my son, my wife, and those who witnessed the event."
He said the incident was part of a series of “challenging events” he and his wife faced on Sunday morning.
Mr Deller added his son has behavioural issues and that the family had sought support.
“As a father I work hard to provide the support people need to grow up as healthy and happy adults," Mr Deller said.
“I am completely devastated at how this event has been presented in public but fully understand my responsibilities as a male and as a father to ensure the safety and care of my children and family.
Mr Deller was captured on CCTV pouring water on his young son. (Supplied) ()
“I entered this campaign to make a difference in the community, however out of respect for the community reception and wellbeing of my family, I intend to withdraw my candidacy as the independent for Kawana at the election tomorrow.
"I will devote my time to continuing to nurture my beautiful family and regain our strength.”
Earlier, Mr Deller reportedly claimed police told him no further action would be taken over the incident.
"It will be a note on my record, that's all," he told News Corp.
Mr Deller is campaigning against Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie. (9NEWS) ()
Mr Deller said his wife, who was filmed sitting by during the incident, had been "upset" by the public attention.
"My wife's very upset and said that if this is what being in public life's like, then perhaps I shouldn't pursue it," he said.
A number of voters in the Kawana electorate, where Mr Deller will take on Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie in the polls tomorrow, told 9NEWS the footage would influence their vote.
The incident occurred during a family meal at a busy Sunshine Coast café.
The independent candidate for Kawana recently took to Facebook to praise politicians with children. (9NEWS) ()
After being slapped, the older boy is left to wipe away his tears as his baby brother is ripped from his high chair by Mr Deller, who storms out.
Mr Deller's wife then finishes her meal and heads straight for the front door.
On his website, Mr Deller attributes his decision to run to his “amazing wife and four beautiful children … who inspire him to be a better man and help make this world a better place”.
Meanwhile, on Facebook earlier this week he said he applauded electoral candidates with children.
“I'm looking after mine today rather than campaigning. Choices,” the post read.
Queensland treasurer Tim Nicholls said the video was "unbecoming" and "unlawful".
Mr Deller said the incident had been taken out of context and said it would be surprised if it did not happen in other households.
The footage has been passed onto Queensland police and no charges have been laid.

When you think of a cryptocurrency mining rig, it's easy to associate it with large rigs featuring multiple GPUs in some type of air-cooled room. While that may be true, not every cryptocurrency needs hulking GPUs and rigs designed specifically with mining in mind. In fact, thanks to a handy app called MobileMiner, it's even possible to mine certain cryptocurrency from a device as diminutive as the iPhone in your pocket.
Synology RT2600ac: The AirPort Extreme replacement.
What is MobileMiner?
MobileMiner is a CPU miner for ARM64 iOS devices created by Elias Limneos, a jailbreak developer known for popular jailbreak tweaks like CallBar. I've been testing MobileMiner for the last few hours, and wanted to show you how it works.
What makes MobileMiner so interesting is that it's extremely easy to configure and start mining directly from your iPhone, no jailbreak needed. All you need to do is build and deploy the project using Xcode (or download and install a precompiled build), obtain a wallet address, and start mining.
MobileMiner is a fork of LucasJones' cpuminer-multi, which has been compiled with ARM64 iOS devices in mind. You can obtain MobileMiner directly from GitHub, and use it to build a project within Xcode for deploying to an iOS device of your choice.
Limneos recommends using more recent iOS devices — iPhone 7, iPhone 8, and iPhone X — because their powerful CPUs produce the best hash rates.

Disclaimer: If you're a developer, feel free to head over to MobileMiner's GitHub page for the open source code that can be inspected, and compiled to run on your iOS device.
If you're not a developer, and simply want a prepackaged IPA that can be easily installed via Xcode and iOS App Signer, then there is a precompiled IPA available on MobileMiner's GitHub page as well.
Obviously there is a level of trust required for those who are willing to install precompiled code on a production iOS device, but I feel comfortable about it considering that I've known Elias for years. That said, proceed at your own risk.
Like some automated mining solutions, 1% of all mining profits go back to the developer — in this case, Elias Limneos. Of course, one could always alter the source to change this, but I think leaving it in is a nice gesture to help support his efforts.
MobileMiner is capable of mining CryptoNote currencies, which is best done on a CPU rather than GPU, making it well-suited for ARM64 iOS devices. CryptoNote currencies include Bytecoin, Monero, Electroneum, and many others.
In this particular test I opted to mine Electroneum. In order to do so, you'll need to visit the official Electroneum website and set up an account to obtain a wallet address and Pool URL. These values are then inserted into MobileMiner, which allows you to commence mining Electroneum. All other CryptoNote-based currencies work in a similar manner.
Installing MobileMiner
If you're a developer, then you can use the open source project to download, build, and deploy MobileMiner to your iOS device. For those who just want to take it for a spin on a test device, you can use Xcode + iOS App Signer in order to do. Be sure to read the disclaimer mentioned above before proceeding.
Step 1: You'll need an Apple Developer-enabled Apple ID to get started. Read up on our tutorial for creating one here.
(Note that Apple enforces a 7-day expiration period for free developer account app installs. When this period elapses, you must connect your iOS device back to your Mac and resign the app.)
Step 2: Install Xcode from the Mac App Store, and log in with your registered Apple ID.
Step 3: Connect your iOS device to your Mac, and be sure that you have it set as a trusted device.
Step 4: Download iOS App Signer and the MobileMiner.ipa.
Step 5: Create a new Xcode Project using parameters similar to the ones listed below:
Step 6: Open iOS App Signer, and select the MobileMiner.ipa input file, Signing Certificate, and Provisioning Profile from the Xcode project. Click Start and save the resulting IPA file to your desktop. (Alternatively you can use Cydia Impactor to sign the app).
Step 7: Open Xcode and select Window → Devices & Simulators in the menu bar. On the Devices & Simulators page, select your iPhone, click the ‘+' sign under installed apps, and select the MobileMiner.ipa file created in Step 7. If successful, the Mobile Miner app should appear on your iPhone's Home screen.
Step 8: Go to Settings → General → Profiles & Device Management and select your profile under Developer App. Tap the Trust button to enable MobileMiner to run on your device.
MobileMiner should now launch when you tap its icon on the Home screen, allowing you to proceed with configuration.
Configuring MobileMiner
From there it's just a matter of setting some of the options inside the MobileMiner app, and there are quite a few pertinent ones. Let's explore each setting now:
Active Configuration
Once you have a configuration (wallet address) established from the currency of your choice, you can use the Active Configuration option to quickly switch between active configs.
For example, if you are mining both Electroneum and Monero, you can use the Active Configuration option to switch between which is being currently mined.
As noted, I've opted to use Electroneum. A Username/wallet address can be obtained by simply signing up for an Electroneum account. The same principle applies for most other cryptocurrencies.
Edit Configuration
Here is where you can add, edit, and delete current configurations. To add a new configuration, tap the Edit button in the upper right-hand corner, followed by the Add New Button in the upper left-hand corner.
From there you can add a configuration name, Pool URL, Username/Address, Password, and the number of threads. The default number of threads is two, but on modern devices like the iPhone 8 and iPhone X, you can bump the amount of threads to higher amounts.
Keep Alive in Background
This is the setting that makes MobileMiner such a useful app. Beside the fact that you can mine in the foreground, MobileMiner allows for perpetual mining via background keep alive.
In order to make this work, Limneos employed the use of a known workaround to take advantage of a privilege normally available for apps like Music apps that play audio in the background. The workaround resets the expiration timer, a trick that's not allowed in the App Store, to keep the app running in the background perpetually.
This allows MobileMiner to keep running in the background indefinitely, otherwise it would be suspended while in the background after a few minutes. It's also one of the reasons why you'll never see a mining application like MobileMiner appear in the App Store.
Allow Notifications
While MobileMiner is backgrounded, you can enable status updates via notifications.
Live Currency Rates
MobileMiner can display two sets of live currency rates in the bottom-left and bottom right-hand corner. Currently you can choose between four types of cryptocurrencies — Electroneum, Monero, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, translating those currencies into current USD or EUR values.
Mining Cryptocurrency with MobileMiner on iPhone
As noted earlier, I've opted to mine Electroneum. It also helps that when adding a new configuration that MobileMiner defaults to the Electroneum Pool, which is one less step you have to manage if you opt to mine Electroneum. That said, switching pool addresses is as easy as copying and pasting the address, so any valid pool can be easily configured.
The Username/Address is a public value, and serves as your virtual wallet. The password, which simply defaults to ‘X' is unimportant for most pools unless the pool requires a registered user.
In effect, you could change the password value to whatever, and you will still be able to start mining.
Once you've settled on a configuration, you'll see your current mining configuration displayed on MobileMiner's main screen. From there it's just a matter of pressing the Start Mining! button to commence mining.
If your configuration is valid, mining should begin successfully. You'll see the current hash rate, accepted percentage, and pool difficulty. MobileMiner also keeps tabs on how long you've been mining, and displays a one line stream of data from the log to keep you abreast on the current status.
Speaking of the log, you can also view the current miner log by tapping the Log button near the bottom right-hand corner. this provides users with a real-time stream of current mining data.
Background cryptocurrency mining on iOS
As I alluded to earlier, perhaps the most remarkable thing about MobileMiner, beside the fact that you're mining crypto from an iPhone, is that all of this can be done in the background. This means that you can use other apps, go to the Home screen, or simply put your iPhone to sleep, and MobileMiner will keep working diligently in the background.
You'll even receive handy notification updates, if you opt to keep notifications enabled, to keep you abreast of MobileMiner's status while in the background.
Stop Mining
To stop mining, simply tap the Stop Mining button at the bottom of MobileMiner's main page. You can always restart mining at a later time.
The battery life conundrum
Cryptocurrency mining in general has received criticism for the amount of energy that it uses, and rightfully so. Unsurprisingly, MobileMiner is absolutely not battery friendly — my iPhone died after just a few hours with MobileMiner running in the background. If you're going to use MobileMiner, you probably want to have your iOS device plugged into a wall.
Making money
So can you make money by mining cryptocurrency on an iPhone? Temper your expectations accordingly. For example, right now Electroneum is only paying about $0.09 per unit, and it takes a considerable amount of time to mine a single unit.
Rough estimates put payout around $12 a month when mining 24/7, and that's not considering power usage. In other words, don't necessarily look to this as a way to strike it rich. I view it more as a fun learning experiencing and proof of concept.
Conclusion
There have been other attempts at mobile mining, but MobileMiner is the first polished solution that doesn't rely on a browser, and uses the power of the iPhone's powerful CPU via an internal process. Best of all, it doesn't require a jailbreak in order to side load on to your iOS device.
Needless to say, I'm very impressed with MobileMiner. It's a quick and easy way to start mining cryptocurrency on a device that fits in your pocket. What are your thoughts on the matter?
Referendums have become a central feature of our politics, writes Will Brett. In this extract from the Electoral Reform Society‘s report on the lessons learned from the Brexit vote, he sets out the shortcomings of the EU referendum and proposes how to improve the quality of debate next time – including intervention when campaigners make misleading claims, a ‘toolkit' for voters and more deliberative, less confrontational media debates.
Those committed to improving our democracy can no longer ignore the elephant in the room. Referendums have become a central feature of our politics. Since 2011 we have had two UK-wide referendums (on voting reform and membership of the European Union), a Scottish independence referendum, and a Welsh referendum on further devolution of powers.
That represents a significant acceleration from previous years – there was only one prior UK-wide referendum (on membership of the European Community in 1975), and other referendums on devolution to the nations are mainly concentrated into the two years after the 1997 Labour government came to power with its promises of devolution.
The UK is in an extended period of constitutional flux, and is showing few signs of coming out the other side any time soon. The terms of Brexit must be decided, and conceivably ratified by Parliament, the public or both; Scotland looks ever closer to independence; devolution of power to more local levels of government than Westminster is widely supported, but the path is unclear; the question of English governance remains live; and so on. Given this state of uncertainty about our constitution, it is a fairly safe bet that we will see referendums again in the near future.
Referendums are a rich source of learning about public attitudes to politics and democracy. They expose views and feelings that are not given true expression or representation at general elections, given our distorted electoral system. At the Electoral Reform Society we have heard time and again from members of the public for whom 23 June was the first time their vote had truly counted.
But there are also serious questions to be asked about the place of referendums in our politics. How do they sit alongside other aspects of our democracy, particularly our parliamentary system? Should there be an agreed trigger for referendums? How should they be conducted and regulated so as to ensure they are more of a positive contribution to our democracy than a negative one? Do we accept that constitutional issues are principally a matter for governing parties (acting on manifesto commitments or coalition deals) or should we consistently seek a citizen-led approach? And when referendums happen, how do we ensure high quality public information and debate before people actually get to the polling booth? Finally, what are the wider conditions in our political culture which would provide the best foundations for referendums to take place in the future?
Our report is an initial attempt at addressing some of these questions. It does so through a detailed analysis of this year's EU referendum, focusing particularly on how the campaigns were received by the public and on alternative methods and platforms for public engagement. Our main findings are:
Information People felt consistently ill-informed – yet this was not for lack of interest: voters expressed high levels of interest throughout the campaign. This shows a need for action in future to ensure that rates of interest are matched by extensive public information campaigns and a vibrant deliberative debate, including the possibility of holding official Citizens' Assemblies during the campaign. Personalities The ‘big beasts' largely failed to engage or convince voters to their side, with many voters appearing switched off by the ‘usual suspects'. This suggests that far more important than major political figures being wheeled out is having a strong narrative based on policies not personalities, which inspires people to debate the issues for themselves. Negative campaigning As the race wore on, the public viewed both sides as increasingly negative. It is not clear that either side gained from this approach. The need for real deliberation There is an appetite for informed, face-to-face discussion about the issues, but this can only be nurtured within the context of a longer campaign.
Above all, our analysis has demonstrated the need for a much greater level of citizen involvement and deliberation, not only during referendums themselves but throughout the workings of our wider democracy. An informed and engaged electorate is the first step towards a political system that can tolerate the divisive aspects of a binary referendum debate. We should therefore do everything we can to foster higher levels of deliberation and engagement, both during referendum campaigns and in our wider political culture.
Given our findings, we are calling for a root and branch inquiry into the conduct of referendums in the UK. Within that inquiry, we would like to see the following specific recommendations to be considered:
Laying the groundwork
There should be mandatory pre-legislative scrutiny for any parliamentary Bill introducing a referendum, lasting at least three months. This should include real citizen involvement through a randomly selected Citizens' Select Committee and/or a wider consultation process. This would give citizens and all parties an opportunity to shape the referendum process and rules in order to maximise the chances for an informed and engaged campaign.

This should include real citizen involvement through a randomly selected Citizens' Select Committee and/or a wider consultation process. This would give citizens and all parties an opportunity to shape the referendum process and rules in order to maximise the chances for an informed and engaged campaign. All referendums should have a minimum six-month regulated campaign period . This will allow the public enough time to get to grips with the issues and make a low-information, low-deliberation referendum campaign less likely.
. This will allow the public enough time to get to grips with the issues and make a low-information, low-deliberation referendum campaign less likely. As soon as possible after a referendum Bill has been passed, The Electoral Commission should publish an official ‘rulebook' setting out the timetable, rules for campaigners and all other technical aspects of the vote. This should be the ‘bible' for the referendum, to minimise controversy around the administration of the vote.
Better information
Citizenship education should be extended in primary and secondary schools, alongside the extension of votes at 16 to all public elections and referendums, and accompanied by a key role for schools in voter registration. This would lay the groundwork for a more informed and engaged electorate better equipped to deliberate on the issues around a referendum.

This would lay the groundwork for a more informed and engaged electorate better equipped to deliberate on the issues around a referendum. At the start of the regulated period the Electoral Commission, or a specially commissioned independent body, should publish a website with a ‘minimum data set' containing the basic data relevant to the vote in one convenient place. A major source of complaint about the conduct of the referendum was the supposed lack of independent information available about the vote. While there are real difficulties in separating out fact from political argument in these cases, a minimum data set ought to be possible.

A major source of complaint about the conduct of the referendum was the supposed lack of independent information available about the vote. While there are real difficulties in separating out fact from political argument in these cases, a minimum data set ought to be possible. An official body – either the Electoral Commission or an appropriate alternative – should be empowered to intervene when overtly misleading information is disseminated by the official campaigns. Misleading claims by the official campaigns in the EU referendum were widely seen as disrupting people's ability to make informed and deliberate choices. Other countries including New Zealand have successfully regulated campaign claims – the UK should follow suit.
More deliberation
There should be an official, publicly funded resource for stimulating deliberative discussion and debate about the referendum. Initiatives which equip people with the information and platforms needed to deliberate on the issues around the referendum should receive official support.

The Electoral Commission or an appropriate alternative should provide a toolkit for members of the public to host their own deliberative discussions about the referendum. Our ‘Better Referendum' intervention demonstrated a widespread appetite for members of the public to get together in a high-information environment to discuss the issues. Similar deliberative tools should be rolled out as part of any public engagement initiative.

Our ‘Better Referendum' intervention demonstrated a widespread appetite for members of the public to get together in a high-information environment to discuss the issues. Similar deliberative tools should be rolled out as part of any public engagement initiative. Public broadcasters should consider more deliberative – rather than combative – formats for referendum-related programming. And Ofcom should conduct a review into the appropriate role for broadcasters in referendums. While there is clearly a place in our politics for TV debates and traditional political journalism, the binary nature of referendums demands more space to be made for more reflective and discursive formats.
The EU referendum result was decisive, formally unchallenged and with a relatively high turnout. The public's decision was clear. But there are many concerns about the way the campaigns conducted themselves, the nature of the question being put to the British people, and the relationship between the result of the referendum and the ongoing proceedings of Britain's parliamentary democracy. These doubts have raised serious questions about the place of referendums in our politics. Our report sets out the conditions for helping ensure that referendums are a positive aspect of our democracy. Given the increasing frequency of their use in the UK, it is more important than ever that we look at the EU vote and ask: how do we ensure future referendums in the UK are the best they can be?

What is Deserialization?
To understand deserialization, it is useful to first understand the opposite process, serialization. Serialization is the process of converting an in-memory instance of an object into a string representation of that object. This is typically done to transfer this object (as a string) across a network or to persist it somewhere, such as to a database or to the file system. Deserialization, as you may have guessed, is the process of converting a string into an in-memory instance of an object.
Serialized objects and deserialized objects are a bit like eggs and chickens.
Similar to an egg, a serialized object (i.e., a string) is motionless and has the potential to go through a process to become a chicken. Much like the chicken and the egg, it is typically the serialization that comes first, followed later by deserialization. That is, an object is created in memory somehow, then it is serialized so that it can be persisted to the "egg" (i.e., the string). Some time later, that egg gets hatched back into the "chicken" (i.e., the in-memory object). What, you weren't aware that the egg came first? Now you know.
This article will talk about one part of the deserialization process that is particularly challenging. That is, the process of converting from a string into an in-memory object instance of an interface.
Deserialization is Hard
Serializing a class that implements an interface is simple. Deserializing JSON to one of many possible classes that implement an interface can be tricky business. Json.NET (otherwise known as Newtonsoft Json) provides an easy option to handle this situation, but this option is not as robust as may sometimes be necessary. Here's an example:
public class Person { public IProfession Profession { get; set; } } public interface IProfession { string JobTitle { get; } } public class Programming : IProfession { public string JobTitle => "Software Developer"; public string FavoriteLanguage { get; set; } }
public class Writing : IProfession { public string JobTitle => "Copywriter"; public string FavoriteWord { get; set; } } public class Samples { public static Person GetProgrammer() { return new Person() { Profession = new Programming() { FavoriteLanguage = "C#" } }; } }
If you attempt to serialize the sample programmer person, you'll get some JSON that looks like this:
{ "Profession": { "JobTitle": "Software Developer", "FavoriteLanguage": "C#" } }
Looking at that JSON, you as a person can easily tell that this serialized person is a programmer. However, the deserializer would throw an exception, as it wouldn't know which profession (programming or writing) to deserialize the person's profession to.
Simple Interface Deserialization
Luckily, Json.NET provides a simple setting to solve the problem of deserializing a property that is an interface with multiple implementing classes:
private Person SerializeAndDeserialize(Person person) { var indented = Formatting.Indented; var settings = new JsonSerializerSettings() { TypeNameHandling = TypeNameHandling.All }; var serialized = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(person, indented, settings); var deserialized = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(serialized, settings); return deserialized; }
By specifying that all type names should be included in the serialized JSON, you give the deserializer enough context to know what specific type to deserialize the profession to. In the above example, the serialized JSON would look like this:
{ "$type": "SampleApp.Types.Person, SampleApp", "Profession": { "$type": "SampleApp.Types.Programming, SampleApp", "JobTitle": "Software Developer", "FavoriteLanguage": "C#" } }
Note that each JSON object now includes the full type (e.g., "Programming"), namespace (e.g., "SampleApp.Types"), and assembly (e.g., "SampleApp"). Armed with that information, the deserializer knows exactly the type to instantiate when creating one of the IProfession implementations. However, this causes another problem.
Serializing Type Metadata is Brittle
Suppose you want to rename your app from "SampleApp" to "ExampleApp". Or maybe you want to rename the "Types" namespace to "Models". Or perhaps you want to change the "Programming" class to be the "Coding" class. You could do any of those and the serialization and deserialization would still work just fine going forward. However, any people that were serialized and persisted to, say, a file system, would later not deserialize with the refactored code. This is because the type information in the serialized version would no longer match the type information in the updated code base. There is a way to avoid this problem, though the solution is a little more involved than the prior Json.NET setting.
Bulletproof Deserialization
If we backtrack to our original implementation, we'd have some JSON that doesn't contain any type metadata:
{ "Profession": { "JobTitle": "Software Developer", "FavoriteLanguage": "C#" } }
For our bulletproof deserialization, we can use this original serialized version, as it contains enough information for the computer to know that the profession in this instance is programming. The trick is to use a custom JSON converter:
public class ProfessionConverter : JsonConverter { public override bool CanWrite => false; public override bool CanRead => true; public override bool CanConvert(Type objectType) { return objectType == typeof(IProfession); } public override void WriteJson(JsonWriter writer, object value, JsonSerializer serializer) { throw new InvalidOperationException("Use default serialization."); } public override object ReadJson(JsonReader reader, Type objectType, object existingValue, JsonSerializer serializer) { var jsonObject = JObject.Load(reader); var profession = default(IProfession); switch (jsonObject["JobTitle"].Value()) { case "Software Developer": profession = new Programming(); break; case "Copywriter": profession = new Writing(); break; } serializer.Populate(jsonObject.CreateReader(), profession); return profession; } }
What's happening in this converter is that the job title is inspected to figure out which profession to deserialize to. First, the data is deserialized to a JObject, which makes it easy to read the properties of the object. Next, the job title is read from the deserialized object and an instance of a particular profession is created based on that job title. Finally, that profession is populated from the serialized data. To get all of this working, you will need to decorate the "Profession" property with a JsonConverter attribute to let it know to use your custom converter:
public class Person { [JsonConverter(typeof(ProfessionConverter))] public IProfession Profession { get; set; } }
In this converter, the type ID (a GUID) is used to infer the class to deserialize. What's notable about this implementation is that the types to deserialize to aren't referred to in the converter. Instead, the converter uses reflection to find all field types, then compares the type ID from the serialized string to the type ID of each field type to find the right one to instantiate.
Formulate, A Practical Example
This technique was actually used in a major open source project, Formulate (an Umbraco form builder plugin I built for Rhythm Agency). The problem it solved was that Formulate stores much of its data as JSON, and it is currently in the early stages of development. That means that Formulate has the potential to undergo a large amount of refactoring. If the JSON files contained type information, Formulate would constantly break when users upgrade. This bulletproof deserialization technique ensures that never happens.
Let's take a look at an example here: FieldsJsonConverter.ReadJson
/// /// Deserializes JSON into an array of IFormField. /// /// /// An array of IFormField. /// public override object ReadJson(JsonReader reader, Type objectType, object existingValue, JsonSerializer serializer) { // Variables. var fields = new List(); var jsonArray = JArray.Load(reader); // Deserialize each form field. foreach (var item in jsonArray) { // Create a form field instance by the field type ID. var jsonObject = item as JObject; var strTypeId = jsonObject["TypeId"].Value(); var typeId = Guid.Parse(strTypeId); var instance = InstantiateFieldByTypeId(typeId); // Populate the form field instance. serializer.Populate(jsonObject.CreateReader(), instance); fields.Add(instance); } // Return array of form fields. return fields.ToArray(); }
And here's a sample of the JSON this code deserializes (we are only interested in the "Fields" array):
{ "Name": "Contact Us", "Fields": [ { "Id": "fb638ef8-939f-4c0e-8772-8a9c7bc7716b", "Name": "Your Name", "TypeId": "17906580-86ea-440b-bc30-9e1b099f803b" }, { "Id": "42f15080-d3b9-4247-9615-7a93a2d24697", "Name": "Message", "TypeId": "9da84359-4d0b-4944-9144-9f8ccae7a4da" } ] }
This code is doing two passes of deserialization. First, it is deserializing a collection of form fields (e.g., a textbox or a checkbox) into an array. Next, it enumerates that array to fetch the "TypeId" (a GUID) from each deserialized object. Once it has the GUID type identifier, it uses that information to construct an instance of the form field class identified by that GUID. It does this with a bit of reflection (not shown) that creates an instance of each form field type to ask them for their GUID type identifier, and it finds the instance that matches the deserialized GUID type identifier. Finally, it essentially runs a second pass of deserialization to populate the form field instance with the data from the first deserialized object. This second pass is necessary because it is converting a very general object (i.e., a JObject) to an instance of one of the form field classes (e.g., TextField or CheckboxField).
Now, if I ever decided to move any of the form field classes, rename them, or refactor them in some other way, I can still deserialize old versions of those form fields. This ability to be agile over time is exactly the right reason to use bulletproof deserialization.
How Can You Use Bulletproof Deserialization?
If you've read this far, chances are you're eager to try out this technique yourself. If so, here are the basic steps you'll need to follow:
Interface. Write some classes that implement an interface. Ensure they have some property data to uniquely identify them.
Write some classes that implement an interface. Ensure they have some property data to uniquely identify them. Converter. Write a class that implements JsonConverter.
Write a class that implements JsonConverter. Attribute. Decorate the property you want to deserialize with the JsonConverter attribute (passing it your JsonConverter implementation).
Decorate the property you want to deserialize with the JsonConverter attribute (passing it your JsonConverter implementation). Deserialize. Call the JsonConvert.DeserializeObject method.
And that's it! That's all you need to do to make sure your deserialization is bulletproof. With those few short steps, you'll make your serialized data super resilient. Happy coding!
If you had any doubts about the Republicans rigging elections, a recent report released by the Republican State Leadership Committee should lay all doubts to rest. Unfortunately, we can't complain to any of the election monitoring organizations that observe elections in third world countries like ours: The GOP's massive gerrymandering of congressional districts back in 2010 is perfectly legal, albeit ridiculously over-the-top and transparently manipulative.
Entitled How a Strategy of Targeting State Legislative Rages in 2010 Led to a Republican U.S. House Majority in 2013, the report — described in Scott Keyes' Think Progress article as “shockingly candid” — the document describes in lurid detail how the RSLC spent “$30 million in the 2010 election cycle to sweep up low-cost state legislature races in blue states like Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.” This strategy enabled the Republicans to seize control of the legislatures in 25 states, enabling them to draw new district boundaries in their favor.
The report triumphantly commends the new district maps in these crucial swing states for enabling GOP candidates to “win” 12 out of 16 congressional races even though 1.1 million more American citizens voted for Democrats than for Republicans. Key adds, “Though party officials typically dance around the unseemly issue of gerrymandering, this report is surprisingly candid and unabashed. The RSLC, after all, is tasked with winning control of state legislatures in large part so they can redraw congressional maps to the GOP's benefit after redistricting.” Data from Think Progress‘ 2012 House Popular Vote Tracker shows an even more egregious gap, with totals of 59,646,195 Democratic votes and 58,283,047 GOP votes — a difference of over 1.3 million (1,363,148).
While political parties on both sides of the aisle have historically redrawn district boundaries to their advantage, the GOP has gone above and beyond in abusing our Democratic institutions to gain power. Although their agenda clearly does not have the support of the American people, they have repeatedly demonstrated that they will stop at nothing to get their way. Think Progress‘ Ian Millhiser bleakly reports that because of gerrymandering, Democrats “would need to win the popular vote by over 7% to take back the house.”The madness has already started in the aforementioned Ohio, Wisconsin, and Michigan.
On her December 22nd, 2012 show, Rachel Maddow explains how gerrymandering has enabled Michigan Republicans to “steam ahead” with its platform of shockingly conservative laws, even though Michigan is more of a blue state than a red state. 54.3% of Michiganders voted to re-elect Barack Obama and only 44.8% voted for the GOP Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney — a 10 point lead. Although much has been said and written on the subject, Maddow's report remains one of the best explanations of the effects on GOP-led redistricting in swing states.
Here's the video:
An article by my AI colleague, Rika Christensen explains how the hyper-partisan districts created by the GOP's gerrymandering contributes to the intractable gridlock in Congress, at the expense of our country's economy and its reputation. Because the most obstructive GOP legislators in Washington come from freshly-minted districts jam-packed with Tea Partiers, they won't have to bear any consequences for their destructive agenda. Their safe districts will keep voting them in.
But wait! Things might get even worse. Enraged by Obama's 2008 and 2012 wins, the Republicans have come up with a new way to mess around with electoral votes to make it harder for Democrats to win presidential elections. Christensen also wrote about how bills introduced in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsyvania would award electoral votes proportionally by districts, instead of giving an entire state's votes to the candidate that wins the popular vote there. These dubious reforms — which supposedly represent rural areas more fairly — are already in effect in Maine and Nebraska. According to this logic, Mitt Romney should be our president, because he won 222 congressional districts and Obama ‘only' won 206. There's just one problem: Representing American votes only by district fails to account for population density. The majority of Americans live in cities, and the majority of urban voters vote Democratic. Our laws and system of government are designed to balance the interests and rights of legislative minorities against the will of the majority, but the swiftly fading conservatives are determined to tilt this precarious balance overwhelmingly in their favor.
While redistricting is often necessary to account for population shifts, gerrymandering has gotten out of control. A possible solution may be the one that ended the interminable gridlock and dysfunction of California's State Legislature. Spooked by a $25 billion deficit, cuts in services, the recession, and the collapsed real estate bubble, fed up Californians voted for Proposition 11 in 2008. The legislation created a non-partisan California Citizens Redistricting Commission to redraw State district boundaries. In 2010, Proposition 20 charged the CCRC with redrawing congressional district boundaries as well. The legislation's language insists that districts must be delineated as “communities of interest,” very specifically defined as:
“a contiguous population which shares common social and economic interests that should be included within a single district for purposes of its effective and fair representation. Examples of such shared interests are those common to an urban area, an industrial area, or an agricultural area, and those common to areas in which the people share similar living standards, use the same transportation facilities, have similar work opportunities, or have access to the same media of communication relevant to the election process.”
Such language will make it difficult for future partisans to devise bizarrely-shaped and oddly attenuated congressional districts like the ones in Ohio and Pennsylvania, as shown below:
Four years later — despite passing bills to fund major infrastructure upgrades and educational improvements — The State of California now has a modest but significant surplus and its economy is growing. Californians were able to break through the gridlock with a ballot proposition. Propositions enable citizens to put legislation on the ballot for a direct yes/no vote, for a modest $200 submission and enough signatures (5% of registered voters, or 8% to change a constitutional amendment). As Californians familiar with the notorious Proposition 13 are well aware, propositions also sometimes enable voters to pass laws that seem good at the time and wind up having terrible long-term consequences. But in this case, Propositions 11 and Propositions 20 have worked as intended to create fairer and more sensible districts.

Supporters and opponents of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump have clashed in the city of San Diego in California.
Police declared a gathering outside the city's convention centre unlawful and made 35 arrests, as stones and water bottles were thrown.
Mr Trump was in the city near the Mexican border to hold a rally ahead of the 7 June California primary.
He has pledged to build a border wall to keep out illegal immigrants.
'Fantastic job'
The skirmishes flared as the convention centre emptied following Mr Trump's rally, and supporters and opponents met in the streets, jeering and heckling each other
Dozens of police officers in riot gear had been deployed to separate them.
Some protesters scaled a wall of the centre to throw water bottles at police.
After ordering the crowds to disperse, police then moved them away from the city's Gaslamp Quarter.

San Diego's population is about one-third Latino and hundreds of thousands of people cross the border with Mexico legally each day.
One San Diego protester, Martha McPhail, told the local City News Service: "I am opposed to the hateful, bigoted, racist language of Donald Trump and his arrogance and intolerance.
"I'm for all of our people - all races, sexes, genders, military veterans - and he's divisive."
But Trump supporter Riley Hansen defended the controversial businessman.

"My Dad always told me you need a businessman as president. I like his policies," he told CNS.
The San Diego Police Department said that 35 arrests had been made and there was no damage to property and no injuries reported.
Mr Trump tweeted to the police after the event: "Fantastic job on handling the thugs who tried to disrupt our very peaceful and well attended rally."
Mr Trump told an earlier rally in Fresno that California had "no drought", despite the state seeing its driest ever four-year period.
After speaking to farmers who complained of a lack of water for crops, he said: "They don't understand, nobody understands it. There is no drought. They turn the water out into the ocean."
The reference appeared to be about water discharged from the Sacramento River into the San Francisco Bay, partly to protect endangered species.
Mr Trump said that if he came to power he would "start opening up the water" and ensure farmers had enough for crops.
The comments sparked some mockery on social media - a number of tweets carried links to Charlton Heston in his role as Moses parting the Red Sea in the 1956 film The Ten Commandments.
Image copyright Twitter Image caption A number of tweets mocked Mr Trump on his drought comments
Mr Trump is running unopposed in California after his Republican rivals pulled out and he reached the number of delegates needed to secure the nomination. It has yet to be formalised.
'Bully'
Earlier on Friday, Mr Trump backed out of an offer to debate with Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders.
"As much as I want to debate Bernie Sanders - and it would be an easy payday - I will wait to debate the first place finisher in the Democratic Party, probably Crooked Hillary Clinton, or whoever it may be," the Trump campaign said in a statement.
Mr Sanders told reporters on the campaign trail that he hoped Mr Trump would change his mind.
"Well Mr Trump, what are you afraid of?" he said, calling the Republican nominee a "bully".
Mr Trump said the Democratic nominating process was "rigged" - and that Mrs Clinton and Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Deborah Wasserman Schultz would not allow Mr Sanders to win the nomination.
In fact, Mrs Clinton has a substantial lead among pledged delegates - those apportioned to candidates based on the results in each state - as well as the party representatives called superdelegates. She has received around 2.9m more votes than Mr Sanders during the primary season.
The latest opinion polls suggest Mrs Clinton leads Mr Trump by about four percentage points.
Code Golf is the art of writing the shortest program possible. The fewer bytes the better. And the competition is just ridiculously strong! Head over to Anarchy Golf if you want to see more!
A good beginner's problem is printing out Pascal's Triangle: Spend a few days to get to 45 bytes. Spend a few months to get to 43 bytes!
10 Ruby Tricks You'll Learn by Playing Code Golf
While code golfing does not necessarily make you a better programmer, you can learn a lot about the programming language you are using. Here are some things that were new to me:
Dirty Interpolation
String interpolation ( #{} ) is sometimes possible without using curlies:
"You can directly interpolate #@instance variables, " \ "#@@class variables, and #$global variables!"
I must admit, this can confuse newcomers, but it looks fantastic!
Constant Assignment in Modifiers
It is perfectly legit to use assignments in conditions:
if a = 42 p a end # => 42
However, this won't work with the shorter modifier syntax:
p b if b = 42 # NameError: undefined local variable or method `b'...
Unless… you use constants:
p C if C = 42 # => 42
Shebang require
What could possibly be shorter than:
require'json'; require 'yaml' p JSON,YAML
It's inlined command-line options:
#!ruby -rjson -ryaml p JSON,YAML
Iterating Input Lines
Finding the shortest way to read user input is a common problem for golfers and solutions vary, depending on how to process the input. My favorite one is to iterate over the input's lines:
$<.each{|e|p e}
Appending Output
puts and p are already good candidates to output content. However, sometimes, using << on STDOUT is a tiny bit (or byte) more efficient:
?a.upto(?z){|o|$><<o}
Regex Always Wins
This is one of the golden rules of golfing. Especially, combining the block syntax of gsub with the perlish regex variables can be very expressive!
"some_string".gsub(/(^|_)(\w)/){$2.upcase}
String#tr
However, it's not true - regexes do not always win. If you need to perform some simple character substitutions, tr is an extremely short (and also clean) way to do so:
# ROT13 Cipher "Vqvbflapengvp Ehol".tr'a-zA-Z','n-za-mN-ZA-M' # => "Idiosyncratic Ruby"
One More or Less
In some instances, you cannot use i+1 or i-1 without wrapping them in parenthesis. No problem, unary complement to the rescue:
-~42 # => 43 ~-42 # => 41
Flexible Precedence
This is one of my favorites: Explicitly call ( . ) operators for alternative precedence semantics:
3*(2+1) #=> 9 3.*2+1 #=> 9
Quick Quit
What's a shorter way to quit a Ruby script than the 4 bytes long exit method?
1/0
Although this is longer than z (calling an undefined method), it's often easier to trigger programmatically.
More Idiosyncratic Ruby

With three seconds on the LP Field clock, the Titans tried to take a knee to end the first-half misery.
They couldn't even do that without screwing up.
Center Chris Spencer was flagged for an illegal snap, forcing the Titans to run another play before the half mercifully ended.
That's the Titans' season in a nutshell. This team can't get out of its own way. It is utterly hopeless. Even when they're trying to wave the white flag, they drop it.
As such, it is now safe to proclaim this the worst Titans team since the franchise moved operations to Tennessee in 1997. And it's not even close.
The previous low was the 2005 Titans, who checked in at 4-12. But that team had a little star power with Steve McNair at quarterback. And there was always rookie Pacman Jones to keep things interesting — on and off the field.
In theory, these Titans could win out and finish the season with a better record than the '05 team. But when you get beat 36-7 by the Giants, a team that arrived with a seven-game losing streak, it doesn't hint of an impending turnaround.
There's losing football and there's bad football. This is bad football.
"You can't run away from our record," guard Chance Warmack said. "It is what it is."
This is a fragile team. And I'm not talking about the injury situation, which is significant. Rookie quarterback Zach Mettenberger, whose injured shoulder may need considerable time to heal, suggested that the media "is trying to tear us apart."
Come again?
"Guys can interpret something that's said in the newspaper probably the wrong way and take it negative," he said.
With that in mind, I don't want anything to be misinterpreted. Let me be completely clear: This team is horrible.
At various points during the game Sunday, some of those at LP Field offered a lusty chorus of boos in response to some particularly awful football. At least those that were booing were still paying attention. They're emotionally invested in the Titans at a time when others have checked out.
"It's disheartening and embarrassing to come out here in your home stadium and perform like that," veteran wide receiver Nate Washington said.
The season is shot. Since a surprising win at Kansas City in Week 1, the Titans have lost 11 of 12 games, eight of them by two touchdowns or more. They're not even competitive.
"It's too late," tight end Delanie Walker said. "If we do turn it around, at this point it doesn't matter. … We've only won two games and we're still playing the same way. We always say we're going to change and nothing changes."

Just when we think it could not possibly get any worse, the Titans prove us wrong. They fell behind the woeful Giants 17-0 at the end of the first quarter. The Titans scored their only touchdown on an interception return by rookie Marqueston Huff.
It was an across-the-board meltdown. New York held the ball 7:01 on the first possession of the game, an indication of what lay ahead for the Titans defense. The offense, which was woefully short-handed in the line and at wide receiver, didn't break the 100-yard barrier until the fourth period.
Mettenberger took a step backward. With the offensive line's injury situation and obvious shortcomings, the immobile rookie was an easy target. He was sacked five times.
Adding injury to insult, Mettenberger got knocked out of the game with 10½ minutes remaining on a sack by Devon Kennard.
It's the second straight game Mettenberger has required a relief pitcher. Remember the perception that his predecessor as starting quarterback, Jake Locker, couldn't stay healthy? I'm starting to wonder if the same reputation won't be attached to Mettenberger.
The hits keep right on coming.

"It's hard to believe," said Washington, who had three catches for 56 yards. "This season is blindsiding. Training camp, OTAs — we never would've seen this coming. It's very difficult going through a time like this."
A terrible season just keeps getting worse.
The good news: There are only three games remaining.
The bad news: There are still three games remaining.

If the founders of a new face recognition app get their way, anonymity in public could soon be a thing of the past. FindFace, launched two months ago and currently taking Russia by storm, allows users to photograph people in a crowd and work out their identities, with 70% reliability.
It works by comparing photographs to profile pictures on Vkontakte, a social network popular in Russia and the former Soviet Union, with more than 200 million accounts. In future, the designers imagine a world where people walking past you on the street could find your social network profile by sneaking a photograph of you, and shops, advertisers and the police could pick your face out of crowds and track you down via social networks.
In the short time since the launch, Findface has amassed 500,000 users and processed nearly 3m searches, according to its founders, 26-year-old Artem Kukharenko, and 29-year-old Alexander Kabakov.
Kukharenko is a lanky, quietly spoken computer nerd who has come up with the algorithm that makes FindFace such an impressive piece of technology, while Kabakov is the garrulous money and marketing man, who does all of the talking when the pair meet the Guardian.
Unlike other face recognition technology, their algorithm allows quick searches in big data sets. “Three million searches in a database of nearly 1bn photographs: that's hundreds of trillions of comparisons, and all on four normal servers. With this algorithm, you can search through a billion photographs in less than a second from a normal computer,” said Kabakov, during an interview at the company's modest central Moscow office. The app will give you the most likely match to the face that is uploaded, as well as 10 people it thinks look similar.
Kabakov says the app could revolutionise dating: “If you see someone you like, you can photograph them, find their identity, and then send them a friend request.” The interaction doesn't always have to involve the rather creepy opening gambit of clandestine street photography, he added: “It also looks for similar people. So you could just upload a photo of a movie star you like, or your ex, and then find 10 girls who look similar to her and send them messages.”
Some have sounded the alarm about the potentially disturbing implications. Already the app has been used by a St Petersburg photographer to snap and identify people on the city's metro, as well as by online vigilantes to uncover the social media profiles of female porn actors and harass them.
The technology can work with any photographic database, though it currently cannot use Facebook, because even the public photographs are stored in a way that is harder to access than Vkontakte, the app's creators say.
But the FindFace app is really just a shop window for the technology, the founders said. There is a paid function for those who want to make more than 30 searches a month, but this is more to regulate the servers from overload rather than to make money. They believe the real money-spinner from their face-recognition technology will come from law enforcement and retail.
Kukharenko and Kabakov have recently returned from the US, and Kabakov was due to travel to Macau and present the technology to a casino chain. The pair claim they have been contacted by police in Russian regions, who told them they started loading suspect or witness photographs into FindFace and came up with results. “It's nuts: there were cases that had seen no movement for years, and now they are being solved,” said Kabakov.
The startup is in the final stages of signing a contract with Moscow city government to work with the city's network of 150,000 CCTV cameras. If a crime is committed, the mugshots of anyone in the area can be fed into the system and matched with photographs of wanted lists, court records, and even social networks.
It does not take a wild imagination to come up with sinister applications in this field too; for example authoritarian regimes able to tag and identify participants in street protests. Kabakov and Kukharenko said they had not received an approach from Russia's FSB security service, but “if the FSB were to get in touch, of course we'd listen to any offers they had”.
The pair also have big plans for the retail sector. Kabakov imagines a world where cameras fix you looking at, say, a stereo in a shop, the retailer finds your identity, and then targets you with marketing for stereos in the subsequent days.
Again, it sounds a little disturbing. But Kabakov said, as a philosophy graduate, he believes we cannot stop technological progress so must work with it and make sure it stays open and transparent.
“In today's world we are surrounded by gadgets. Our phones, televisions, fridges, everything around us is sending real-time information about us. Already we have full data on people's movements, their interests and so on. A person should understand that in the modern world he is under the spotlight of technology. You just have to live with that.”
Nils Erik Adam Jeremy Larsson (born 12 November 1992) is a Swedish professional ice hockey defenceman and an alternate captain of the Edmonton Oilers of the National Hockey League (NHL).
He was selected fourth overall by the New Jersey Devils in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft.[1] The youngest player on the Skellefteå AIK squad at the time of his draft, Larsson was the first defenceman and first European-trained player to be drafted in 2011.[2]
Professional career [ edit ]
Skellefteå AIK [ edit ]
The 2009–10 Elitserien season turned out to be a spectacular breakthrough season for Larsson. He scored two goals in an Elitserien game against Timrå IK on 15 October 2009.[3] By the end of the season, Larsson had tied the single-season record for amount of points in Elitserien among defencemen under the age of 18, 17 points, a record that was set by Tomas Jonsson in 1977–78, who compiled eight goals and nine assists in 35 games.
Larsson fought Timrå IK forward Daniel Corso in a game on 2 November 2010, receiving a cut eyebrow during the altercation. Larsson commented that he kept his gloves on because removing them during a fight in Elitserien leads to an automatic one-game suspension.[4] Although Larsson didn't remove his gloves, both he and Corso were suspended for two games and received fines as a result of the fight.[5][6]
Larsson's play in the 2010–11 season earned him a nomination for the Elitserien Rookie of the Year award,[7] but Mattias Ekholm would eventually win the award.
New Jersey Devils [ edit ]
Larsson was selected in the first round, fourth overall,[1] by the New Jersey Devils during the 2011 NHL Entry Draft. Seen as a move towards rebuilding the Devils defence corps, Larsson was rated by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau as the top European prospect available in the 2011 Draft.[8] Larsson, who has been compared to the Detroit Red Wings' defenceman Nicklas Lidström, signed a three-year, entry-level contract with no bonuses at the NHL maximum of US$925,000 per year with the Devils on 15 July 2011, due to general manager Lou Lamoriello's disapproval of performance bonuses. He made the team in training camp and became the first 18-year-old defenceman to dress for the Devils in the regular season since Scott Niedermayer in the 1991–92 season, only the sixth under-20 defenceman to play for the Devils, and the first 18-year-old defenceman in the NHL since 2008, when Drew Doughty, Zach Bogosian and Luke Schenn all made their NHL debuts.
Larsson's first NHL goal was scored on 11 November 2011, on a slapshot from the right slot against Tomáš Vokoun of the Washington Capitals.[9] He was selected to the NHL All-Star Rookie SuperSkills Competition on 12 January 2012, along with teammate Adam Henrique; however, he chose to pull out due to a minor injury.[10] He was replaced by Montreal Canadiens rookie defenceman Raphael Diaz.[11][10] On 1 May 2012, Larsson scored his first Stanley Cup playoff goal against the Philadelphia Flyers in Philadelphia in his first career playoff game, becoming the first Devils rookie defenceman to score a goal in his first playoff game.[12]
Following the 2014–15 NHL season Larsson became a restricted free agent under the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement. The New Jersey Devils made him a qualifying offer to retain his NHL rights and, on 5 July 2015, Larsson filed for Salary Arbitration.[13]
On 25 July 2015, the Devils re-signed Larsson to a six-year extension, worth US$25,000,000.[14]
Edmonton Oilers [ edit ]
On 29 June 2016, Larsson was traded to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Taylor Hall.[15] Larsson was named an alternate captain for the Oilers in the 2017–18 NHL season.[16][17]
International play [ edit ]
Larsson represented Sweden at the 2010 World Junior Championships, held in Saskatoon and Regina, Saskatchewan. At the 2010 World U18 Championships, he was selected as the best defenceman of the tournament.[18] When Larsson played for Sweden at the 2011 World Junior Championships, he repeated his scoring of one goal and three assists from the previous tournament, which earned him the distinction of being Sweden's highest scoring defenceman at the tournament.[19] He is currently representing Sweden at the 2018 World Championships in Denmark.[20]
Personal life [ edit ]
Larsson's father, Robert Larsson, played 249 games with Skellefteå from 1985 to 1995. Robert Larsson was drafted in the sixth round, 112th overall, by the Los Angeles Kings during the 1988 NHL Entry Draft, but never played in North America.[21]
In the 2008–09 season, Adam Larsson played with his older brother Hampus in the junior league J20 SuperElit.[22]

According to the German National Statistics bureau, in 2014, around 99,700 abortions occurred Germany - some 3 percent less than the previous year, and the lowest figure since the revision of the abortion law in 1996. A decade ago, some 129,650 pregnancy terminations were registered.
According to the latest figures, abortion rate also dropped significantly. In 2004, it stood 66 abortions among every 10,000 women. In 2013, this fell to 57 and, according to preliminary figures, this figure decreased again in 2014 to 55.
Financial dilemma
Regine Wlassitschau, spokeswoman for the sexual advice organization Pro Familia, believes that a combination of sex education and comprehensive counseling services have played a part in the decline.
Many women and couples on low incomes are still struggling to afford contraceptives, however.
"This is a growing problem," Wlassitschau said. Pro Familia is pushing for women on low incomes - such as those on state benefits - to have the cost of their contraception funded.
Over-the-counter emergency pill
The latest figures from Germany's statistics bureau also showed that almost three quarters of the women who terminated a pregnancy in 2014 were between 18 and 34 years old. About eight percent were at least 40 years old, and almost 4 percent were under the age of 18.
Whether the abortion numbers will continue to decline, when the morning after pill becomes available without prescription in Germany on March 15, remains to be seen.
Ninety-six percent of the abortions recorded in 2014 were carried out according to standard protocol with required counseling. The remaining four percent were carried out in cases in which there was danger to the mother's life or which were the result of criminal acts such as abuse or rape.

The actions of NFL players kneeling or sitting or raising their fist during the National Anthem are untenable.
The refusal of some players to join in solidarity with their teammates and fans in honor of the country responsible for every one of their freedoms is nothing short of disgraceful. The stated excuse of a call for social justice is both lame and ill-founded and honestly, rings unbelievably hollow. For months, football fans have languished over the continued divisiveness and disrespect exhibited by these players and the further insult from the league in not putting a stop to this despicable behavior.
The conflict finally came to a head Friday when President Trump called out those players while at a rally in Alabama.
But instead of acknowledging the problem, the NFL has decided to double down on its position.
In a statement, NFL Commissioner, Roger Gooddell, said, “The NFL and our players are at our best when we help create a sense of unity in our country and our culture. There is no better example than the amazing response from our clubs and players to the terrible natural disasters we've experienced over the last month. Divisive comments like [those of President Trump] demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL, our great game and all of our players, and a failure to understand the overwhelming force for good our clubs and players represent in our communities.”
Only problem is that from day one of this issue the NFL has refused to be a force for good. On the contrary, by refusing to demand that its players stand for the National Anthem, the NFL has fostered only strife and divisiveness — which it ironically claims to want to create — and continued to disrupt any fragile sense of unity our nation presently has. Indeed, it is Gooddell and the NFL that refuse to understand the overwhelming force for good that honoring our flag and our history is for our nation and our community. And, of course, in doubling down on its position, the NFL now finds itself in the untenable position of having to continue to defend an indefensible act.
Like any business, the NFL lives or dies by its income, and their continued disrespect for these sacred American symbols will continue to hurt it. A 2016 leaked memo expressed the NFL's concern of its 11% drop in viewership. The same memo dismissed any association with the revolting behavior of its players, but a similarly timed Rasmussen poll seemed to indicate otherwise.
This brings us to today. For those of us who care about our flag, our nation, our history, and our National Anthem, it will be a day when we will have no choice but to turn the TV off on Sunday afternoon, or better yet, spend some extra time at church. For others, the opportunity to leave the stadium immediately following the playing of the National Anthem if just one of those players kneels during its playing (which they undoubtedly will in record numbers) will be well worth the price of admission.
Unfortunately, neither the NFL nor the players care for anything other than the continued fiscal stability of its mammoth conglomerate. Today, it's time to let them know, that none of us, including overpaid employees of the National Football League, is greater than our nation's flag, its Anthem, or the Country. And the best way to communicate that message is with our wallets and by directing our attentions elsewhere.

That vacant lot across from the L.A. Times building — on First between Broadway and Spring in downtown Los Angeles — is no ordinary vacant lot. As Robert Petersen, host and producer of The Hidden History of Los Angeles, tells us, it's the site of at least two bombings and two famous tent cities, and was the site of a huge colony of feral cats.
Robert Petersen, host of The Hidden History of Los Angeles podcast, at First and Spring in downtown Los Angeles — a very historic vacant lot. John Rabe
We talked with our backs to the chain link fence that surrounds the site now. “If you go back 100 years, Los Angeles was in a much different political situation,” Petersen says. “Terrorism was actually on the minds of a lot of people … but back then you would think about anarchists or labor activists. At the time there was a big struggle between big business and organized labor. At the heart of that struggle was Harrison Gray Otis, the publisher of the L.A. Times, who was notoriously anti-union.”
And the vacant lot was the home of the former L.A. Times building. The current L.A. Times building we know today is actually its third building, which opened in 1935.
On Oct. 1, 1910, two brothers decided to plant a bomb at this former building site on the northeast corner of Broadway Avenue and First Street. Their suitcase bomb held about 17 sticks of dynamite. The bomb was set off shortly after 1 a.m. — with a little over 100 people still in the building.
“What the bombers didn't know is that there were gas lines underneath the building,” Petersen says. “A huge fire engulfed the building and 20 people died, most of them burned alive.”
The L.A. Times immediately blamed the bombing on the unions, but brothers John and James McNamara were not arrested until April 14, 1911 in the Oxford Hotel in Detroit. It wasn't until then that it was discovered that one of the men involved in the bombing did in fact have connections to the labor union known as the International Association of Bridge and Structural Iron Workers.
The lot became home of the State Building in 1932 — the same year as the first L.A. Olympics. The opening ceremony for the building featured guest speaker Amelia Earhart. In 1974, the Weather Underground bombed the building, but it stood until 1976 when earthquake damage caused it to be closed and demolished. But they didn't get rid of the foundation or underground parking lot for 39 years.
The area then took on a different life. In 1984, homeless activist decided to create a tent city, which created a space for hundreds of homeless people to camp out. In 1986 they did it again, but this time they got a 5,000-square-foot circus tent, and it covered 200 homeless people.
More recently, the parking structure underneath the old state building became home to a colony of feral cats. Last year, when the parking structure was demolished, workers had to remove all of the cats before work could continue.
If you have one of those cats, or know someone who does, we'd love to hear from you.
Rudy Giuliani, former mayor of New York City and squirrelly, chattering sycophant, is president-elect Donald Trump's primary pick for Secretary of State.
This news comes to the Associate Press from an anonymous senior Trump official. Apparently there are no other contenders for this Cabinet position. If Giuliani wants it, he can take it.
On Monday night, at a Washington event sponsored by the Wall Street Journal, Giuliani confirmed that he would not be Attorney General; however, he did not explicitly say that he was in the running for Secretary of State. According to the Chicago Tribune, he also remarked that John Bolton, former United States ambassador to the United Nations, “would make a very good choice” for the position. But when pressed to divulge whether there was someone else better suited for the job, he grinned and said, “Maybe me, I don't know.”
Oh Rudy, you card.
To refresh your memory, Giuliani served as one of Trump's most ardent supporters over the course of his campaign. In the past, he has made racist remarks about President Obama and claimed to have saved more black people than Beyoncé (he's not a fan of Bey). He went on the record as saying that Hillary Clinton was “too stupid to be president” and, before admitting his error, claimed that she had lied about being in New York City on September 11.

Most recently, he has denounced the spark of protests inspired by Trump's win and called for President Obama and Secretary Clinton to put a stop to them. Despite the virulent racism and misogyny that characterized Trump's campaign—and that has swelled in the past week—Giuliani asserts that protesters are “exaggerating the fears” because they're disappointed to have lost. No need worry, says Rudy G. Those threats of deportation and repealing Roe v. Wade? The appointment of an anti-Semitic white nationalist to the position of Chief Strategist? Mere trifles!
So, this sounds great.

Apparently, all those protests by Walmart workers over pay and benefits aren't getting through to CEO Mike Duke.
At a recent event, Bloomberg LP President Dan Doctoroff pointed out to the Walmart chief executive that even though his company paints itself as "serving an emerging middle class," many of its employees aren't paid enough to lead a normal life and some even resort to food stamps to make ends meet, as previously reported by The Huffington Post. This is what Duke had to say in response:
"Retailing is the most competitive industry out there, and we do pay competitive wages," Duke told Doctoroff, according to Business Insider, noting that around 165,000 Walmart employees were promoted from entry-level positions last year. “Our associates are a great source of pride and personal inspiration for me," he added.
Sheila Jackson Lee posts rebuttal to Paul Ryan's DC intern selfie How will Ryan counter SJL's response?
There seems to be a rivalry brewing in Washington, D.C. between Speaker Paul Ryan and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee concerning what appears to be the ethnic diversity of their party's interns.

There seems to be a rivalry brewing in Washington, D.C., between House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Houston) over the perceived ethnic diversity among their respective parties' interns.
On Sunday, Ryan posted a photo on his official Instagram account of the newest group of Republican interns on Capitol Hill.
It's a smiley group for sure, but pundits also noticed the lack of diversity in the photo of staffers.
RELATED: For House Speaker Ryan, opportunity, and risk, at convention
Yes, it's a mighty light-skinned crew. A few other prominent Democrats commented in their own way.
Meanwhile on Wednesday, Lee's official Twitter page posted a photo of the latest batch of Democratic House interns and it appears that the more diverse interns in the crowd were pushed farther up to the front. The photo was taken by Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Dallas) and her staff, showing the group extending up the Capitol steps.

It's important to the Democrats that the diversity narrative is pushed, of course, to counter the Republicans' perceived lack thereof, but now we wonder how Ryan will counter Lee's photo.
Maybe he'll show off his collection of Coldplay vinyl.
The public process for vetting these important projects will affect conservation, hurricane protection, and land loss over the next five years
Louisiana's coast is a dynamic landscape of swamps, marsh lands, barrier islands, bayous, rivers, lakes and bays surrounding coastal towns and cities—and all of this is linked by a unique culture of food, music, fishing, hunting, and other outdoor activities that rely on our abundant natural resources.
Unfortunately, for the last 80 years, this ever-changing system has been shrinking faster than any other landscape on earth, threatening world-class fishing and hunting opportunities, domestic energy development, commercial seafood harvest, the country's largest port system, and the homes of hundreds of thousands of residents.
The impacts to the nearly 2 million people living south of Interstate 10 (and arguably the entire state and nation) can be devastating, but there are solutions in the works and a public process for Louisianans to be heard. This week and last, concerned sportsmen and women had the chance to ask questions and challenge the folks in charge of planning for the next five years of coastal protection and restoration projects designed to reverse devastating land loss, while boosting fish and wildlife habitat.
Here's what they learned.
A Plan for Louisiana's Future
For the last decade, the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority has been tasked with trying to slow coastal land loss, protect coastal communities, and safeguard our infrastructure, including the kind that supports fisheries and wildlife. The blueprint for this effort has been a detailed list of projects and initiatives aimed at ensuring Louisianans don't face the catastrophic losses we experienced during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.
The Coastal Master Plan, by law, must be reviewed by the public every five years and then approved by the state's legislature. As wonky as it sounds, this is a critical opportunity for everyday sportsmen and women to get involved with shaping the future of conservation in our state.
Where Funding Will Flow
The 2017 plan, like the 2012 plan before it, calls for funding to be split roughly in half between building community resiliency—using levees and floodwalls and elevating homes and businesses—and habitat restoration—through marsh and barrier island creation, diversions, and limiting saltwater intrusion.
Thanks mostly to the nearly $8 billion the state has received, or will receive, in fines from BP and others responsible for the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil disaster, some coastal wetlands, barrier islands and vital ridges and other geographic features can be created, restored, and protected in the long term. The agency proposes to accomplish this by diverting sediment from the Mississippi River below New Orleans, diverting freshwater from the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers to wetlands threatened by saltwater intrusion, and various dredging projects.
Diversions are the cornerstone of efforts to restore and sustain the marshes adjacent to the Mississippi River. A single diversion on the west side of the river south of New Orleans called the Mid-Barataria Diversion, will move as much as 75,000 cubic feet per second of sediment-laden river water into shallow bays and lakes to help re-establish marshes that have been lost over the last century to erosion and subsidence. East of the river, the Mid-Breton Diversion will move water at about 35,000 cubic feet per second.
Impact to Fish and Wildlife
The 2017 plan is the first Master Plan for our area with detailed models that predict the future of coastal habitat for species like speckled trout, brown and white shrimp, largemouth bass, and crawfish—fisheries that are vital to commercial and recreational fishermen. It also projects what changes we can expect for habitat important to gadwall and teal, the ducks most targeted by coastal waterfowl hunters.
And If We Do Nothing?
Unfortunately, the latest models also paint a grimmer picture of what can realistically be saved and protected and what will, ultimately, be claimed by the Gulf of Mexico. The worst-case scenario from 2012 was a one- to two-foot rise in sea level—these are now the best-case scenarios in the 2017 plan.
If we do nothing, projections show that as much as 4,000 square miles of land will sink or be inundated by rising seas (yes, both of these things are happening at once) over the coming century—that's more than twice the land loss predicted in 2012.
More than 25,000 homes and businesses across Louisiana's coast will have to be elevated and made more storm-resilient over the next half century so as not to succumb to coastal flooding from tropical storms, hurricanes, and other extreme weather events. Some communities may have to be relocated altogether. Presenting this worst-case scenario isn't the easiest task for state coastal planners, but it's absolutely essential that coastal residents understand the difficult future that lies ahead in an ever-changing landscape.

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Authorities say a Saudi border guard has been killed in an exchange of fire with Shiite rebels in Yemen.
Interior Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Mansour al-Turki said in a statement carried Sunday by the official Saudi Press Agency that the clashes took place on Saturday.
Al-Turki blamed Yemen's Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, for launching the attack and said the soldier died before reaching the hospital.
Cross-border fire has killed repeatedly killed Saudi security agents and civilians since a Saudi-led coalition launched a campaign in Yemen against the rebels in March 2015.
Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country, has been at war since the Houthis swept into the capital, Sanaa, in 2014.
Some 10,000 people in Yemen have been killed or wounded in the conflict.
When the Raiders heading to Dallas for their third preseason game on Saturday, their round two pick safety Obi Melifonwu will take the field for the first time. He had missed the bulk of training camp with an undisclosed injury.
“I thought Obi had a good week of practice and we look forward to seeing him Saturday,” said head coach Jack Del Rio.
Melifonwu had suited up for the team's second preseason game but did not play.
It wasn't expected that he would be taking the field in that game. He had returned to practice for the final few days of training camp, but did very minimal work. As of the final day of practice, he was still not working at 100% and wasn't participating in team sessions, but his participation in drills was a very good sign.
Now, after three days of practice back at the team's Alameda facility, it sounds like he is healthy and ready to see game action.
The return of the 6-4, 224-pounder will be a welcome sight for the Raiders' struggling secondary. They have been hoping he could contribute early on as a ‘moneybacker' which is a hybrid safety/linebacker. His primary duties would involve covering the tight end, with which the Raiders have also continued to have difficulty.
Prior to his injury Melifonwu had some reps with the first team, but played mostly with the second team. It will be interesting to see when he enters the game Saturday and how much playing time he sees.
Now if they can just get top pick Gareon Conley back as well. He is looking like he could return soon as well.
MORE people have died by suicide in the past 17 years than were killed during 30 years of conflict in Northern Ireland, shock figures show.
Statistics also reveal that suicides in Northern Ireland since 1998, when the Good Friday Agreement was signed, have been almost double the number of deaths caused by road crashes in the same period.
More than three quarters of those who have died by suicide were men.
During the north's bloody conflict between 1969 and 1997 it is estimated that around 3,600 people were killed.
But the latest official statistics show suicides in the years since have now surpassed this Troubles death toll.
A total of 3,859 deaths due to suicide were registered in Northern Ireland from the beginning of 1998 to the end of 2014.
In the same period 1,961 were killed due to traffic collisions the north's roads.
Suicides were most common among people aged 25-34, making up 22.7 per cent of the deaths. This was followed closely by those aged 35-44 (21.9 per cent), 45-54 (19.2 per cent) and 15-24 (17.5 per cent).
The Belfast area had the most suicides at 843, while the fewest were recorded in the Moyle area at 39.
The latest figures are from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA). They show the year suicides were registered rather than the year the tragic deaths occurred.
All suspected suicides are referred to a coroner and take time to be investigated, meaning there can be a significant delay between a suicide taking place and it being registered.
For instance of the 313 suicides registered in 2010, only 141 actually occurred in 2010 with the remainder happening in earlier years.
Back in 1998 when the Good Friday Agreement was signed, 150 suicides were registered.
The figure has generally increased in the years since, passing the 200 mark for the first time in 2005 and in 2014 it reached 268.
In an attempt to address the north's growing suicide problem, the Programme for Government 2008-11 set a target of an average annual death rate of 10.7 per 100,000 of population for 2010-12.
But the Stormont executive failed to meet this target, according to an analysis in 2014 by news website The Detail.
It found the average annual suicide registration rate per 100,000 of the population in Northern Ireland for 2010-12 was 16 deaths.
Last year, Teddy Kremer was a Reds batboy for a day. He asked for a few home runs and the Reds gave him seven. It's a great story that we loved to re-tell and many of us will never forget it.
Now, Topps, is making sure Teddy Kramer will always be remembered. The Major League Baseball card company has featured him on a trading card in their updated set released earlier this month:
The Cincinnati Enquirer first reported the story of Topps immortalizing Kramer with his own trading card.
Article continues below ...
The Update set features players who switched teams, rookies, memorable moments and All-Stars. There are also variant cards, one of which features Kremer. The regular card No. US268 features Reds first baseman Joey Votto at the 2013 All-Star Game at New York's Citi Field. There are two variations, one that has a picture of Votto and teammates Aroldis Chapman and Brandon Phillips at the All-Star Game, and another with former manager Dusty Baker and Kremer.
First, a batboy for a Major League Baseball team and now his very own Topps baseball card. Looks like it's been a pretty good year for Teddy Kremer.
Future of Portuguese language debated
The future of the Portuguese language was this week debated by more than 200 representatives from the eight countries with Portuguese as an official language, at an event being held at the University of Lisbon.
One new aspect of this second International Conference on the Future of the Portuguese Language in the World System was the focus on Portuguese as a language of science and innovation. The president of the Camões Institute of Cooperation and Language, Ana Paula Laborinho, also promised concrete proposals to promote Portuguese as a research medium.
Linguistic diversity, teaching and training, and internationalisation and the cultural industries were three other major themes in the panel discussions held over the two days, along with dozens of lectures.
Tuesday's opening session was addressed by Portugal's Foreign Minister, Rui Machete, and the executive secretary of the Community of Portuguese-Language Countries (CPLP), Murade Murargy.
The first conference took place in Brasilia in 2010, and ended with the adoption of a plan of action to promote the language.
On Thursday, after the Lisbon conference had ended, representatives of CPLP member states met to draw up a new action plan, aimed at “orienting the language policies of the eight countries in the next three years”, according to the official programme.
The plan is then to be approved by CPLP members' foreign ministers at a meeting at its Lisbon headquarters on 4 November, before being endorsed at the CPLP's next summit in July next year, in Dili.
Portuguese is currently the fifth most used language on the internet, and the third on popular social networks such as Twitter and Facebook.
The Lisbon conference is to be broadcast via the internet and questions will be taken via Twitter. TPN/Lusa
The conditions of John Hinckley Jr.'s full-time release from a psychiatric hospital after a three-decade long commitment are a laundry list of dos and don'ts meant to help him assimilate into society — he can't own a gun, he must work or volunteer three days a week, and he can't have any overnight guests while staying alone at his mother's home in Williamsburg, Virginia.
But one privilege that won't be curtailed any longer is his right to vote — meaning that come November, the only living man to have shot a U.S. president could register to be among the millions of Americans eligible to cast a ballot in the presidential election.
Prior attempts to vote haven't gone so well for Ronald Reagan's would-be assassin. Mr. Hinckley tried to register to vote in Washington, D.C., at least three times during his commitment at St. Elizabeths Hospital, where he was sent for mental health treatment after he shot and injured Reagan and three other men in 1981.
The D.C. Board of Elections denied his repeated attempts to register in the 1980s and 1990s, and a D.C. Superior Court judge upheld the board's decision in 1992, ruling that Mr. Hinckley could not establish legal residency in the District because he was involuntarily confined to a mental hospital.
But pending release from the facility, Mr. Hinckley plans to establish residency in Virginia, and as long as he meets the commonwealth's residency requirements, the 61-year-old should be eligible to vote on Nov. 8, said Mr. Hinckley's longtime attorney Barry W. Levine.
“Surely nothing about this case will keep that from happening,” Mr. Levine said. “I suspect he'll register to vote.”

Virginia restricts the right to vote for individuals deemed mentally incompetent by a court and felons who have not had their right restored by the governor. Mr. Hinckley is neither — despite being found not guilty by reason of insanity of the 1981 shooting.
The restoration of voting rights for felons has become a contentious issue this year in Virginia.
Gov. Terry McAuliffe promised to sign individual orders one by one to grant the right to ex-offenders who have served their sentences and completed probation after the Virginia Supreme Court ruled that the governor didn't have the authority to restore the right en masse.
But because he was never convicted of a felony, Mr. Hinckley has never had his right to vote revoked on those grounds.
“He was, in the plainest words, found not guilty,” Mr. Levine said. “Now he was found not guilty on a mental health defense but he was acquitted.”
Regarding the matter of mental competency, the attorney said it was never at issue in Mr. Hinckley's case.
“Unlike sanity, competency is the ability to understand the charges against you and to cooperate with counsel in the defense,” Mr. Levine said. “He's never been deemed incompetent.”
U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman ruled last month that Mr. Hinckley could leave St. Elizabeths as soon as Aug. 5 to begin living full time at his 90-year-old mother's home.
As of Tuesday, Mr. Levine said his client remains at the facility while several administrative tasks are resolved. An official departure date has not been confirmed.
Mr. Hinckley was sent to St. Elizabeths after the shooting, which he carried out in an attempt to impress actress Jodie Foster, to be treated for depression and a psychotic disorder.
During the last 10 years, his progress has led doctors to permit him to leave the hospital for multiple days to visit his family at least 80 times.
Throughout his time at the hospital, it doesn't appear Mr. Hinckley has ever had the opportunity to vote.
While D.C. law indicates a person admitted or committed to a facility for mental health treatment retains the right to vote unless a court has specifically declared that person mentally incompetent, the D.C. Board of Elections denied Mr. Hinckley's efforts to register to vote in the 1984, 1986 and 1990 city elections with the registrar ruling that he was not qualified to do so because he was an unwilling resident of the District. The closest he ever came appears to be in the 1990 elections, when according to a report published in The Washington Times, Mr. Hinckley was mistakenly issued a voter registration card but had it revoked after he requested an absentee ballot and “mailed in a Democratic voter registration from St. Elizabeths Hospital.”
Mr. Hinckley had previously lamented not being able to obtain an absentee ballot from Colorado, where his parents lived, in a letter sent to the Washington Post in 1984.
“In the past two years I have become much more politically aware and I can now see what's going on in this country. But I can't speak out or vote to try to change the system because the hospital and government won't let me,” he wrote.
States have adopted a series of protections to prevent those with mental illness from losing their right to vote simply because they are placed in a nursing home or mental hospital, said Dania Douglas, the manager of policy and state outreach at the National Alliance on Mental Illness.
“The right to vote is pretty fundamental, so trying to take it away from someone based on mental incompetence, it's a pretty big step and it usually has to be adjudicated by a court,” Ms. Douglas said. “If they can indicate they want to vote and understand the process, it's really important to allow them to be able to.”
Mr. Hinckley's former attorney David Dupree, who represented him in a legal case challenging the board's 1990 decision, said in an interview that the city's arguments against allowing him to vote centered on residency not mental competency.
“The only place he had a connection with was the District of Columbia but they determined because he was not placed there under his own volition that he could not establish residency,” Mr. Dupree said. “If they said he wasn't a resident of the District, where was he a resident of? That was the issue to me.”
D.C. Board of Elections spokeswoman Margarita Mikhaylova confirmed there is no current voter record on file for Mr. Hinckley.
Virginia Department of Elections spokesman Martin Mash said the agency does not confirm or publicly release individuals' voter registration status. But according to Mr. Levine, Mr. Hinckley has not established residency in Virginia yet so it is unlikely he would have been registered to vote there.
Virginia law does not explicitly address commitment to a mental hospital — state law only indicates that “no person adjudicated to be mentally incompetent shall be qualified to vote until his competency has been re-established.”
A relatively small number of voters are disqualified from voting each year in Virginia as a result of mental incompetence rulings by a court.
According to the Virginia Department of Elections' last annual maintenance report, 483 voters had registrations canceled between July 2014 and June 2015 after a mentally incapacitated adjudication was reported. During the same period, 6,428 voters had registrations canceled after felony convictions were reported.
While some states take away the right to vote from individuals living under guardianship, Ms. Douglas said she was not aware of any state laws that would prevent a person from voting based on a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity.
As long as Mr. Hinckley meets the requirements and registers by the state's deadline of Oct. 17, Mr. Mash said he would be able to cast a ballot in the Nov. 8 presidential election.
Of course, if Mr. Hinckley were to vote in the election, it's unclear whether he might throw support behind Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Republican nominee Donald Trump or a third-party candidate.
A 1990 Washington Times article states Mr. Hinckley mailed in a Democratic registration to the D.C. Board of Elections, but Mr. Hinckley is barred from speaking to the media and so hasn't been able to publicly discuss party affiliations or thoughts on the current contentious election. Mr. Levine said the subject hasn't come up with his client.
“We haven't discussed his politics in that regard or whether he has an interest,” Mr. Levine said. “I would suspect every American has an interest in this election.”
He noted that although Mr. Hinckley shot a Republican president, his actions had nothing to do with Reagan's politics and instead were motivated by his mental illness and a desire to impress an actress.
“No aspect of John's crime had anything to do with politics,” Mr. Levine said. “To understand what happened here is to understand it had nothing to do with Ronald Reagan or a political point of view.”
But if Mr. Hinckley were to cast a ballot, he might want to do some research on where the candidates stand, not only on immigration, Obamacare, or the economy but also on the topic of his own freedom.
The day the order approving Mr. Hinckley's full-time leave from the hospital was granted, Mr. Trump told reporters he didn't think Mr. Hinckley should have ever been freed.
Judge Friedman, who ruled that Mr. Hinckley is no longer a danger and could be granted convalescent leave, was appointed to the bench by former President Bill Clinton.

An artist impression of the 72 virgins. The 72 virgins or 72 houri (/ˈhʊəriz/[1]; from Persian: حُـورِی‎, ḥūrī; plural of 'ḥaurāʾ' or'ḥūrīyah'; Arabic: حُـورِيَّـة‎) refers to a celestial being that is an aspect of Heaven or jannah (Arabic: جنّة‎ 'Jannah'; plural: Jannat). This concept is mentioned in Qur'anic text as a reward to believing men after death. According to the Quran, once in jannah, believers are wed to virgins with "full grown", "swelling" or "pears-shaped" breasts.[2][3][4] The Quran provides a physical and personal description of the houri and denotes them as awards to believers. Sahih (authentic) hadith detail the amount if houris and what they are for.[5] Orthodox Muslim theologians such as Al-Ghazali (1058 - 1111 CE) and Al-Ash'ari (874 - 935 CE) have discussed the rewards and pleasures found in heaven. Often scholars refer to hadiths that describe heaven as a slave market where there will be "no buy and sale, but... If any man wish to have sexual intercourse with a woman, he will do at once."[6][7] It is quoted by Ibn Kathir, in his Qur'anic Commentary, the Tafsir ibn Kathir,[8] and they are graphically described by Qur'anic commentator and polymath, Al-Suyuti (died 1505), who, echoing a Sahih hadith[9] from Ibn Majah,[10] wrote that the perpetual virgins will all "have appetizing vaginas", and that the "penis of the Elected never softens. The erection is eternal."[11] The sensual nature of the houri awarded to believers are also confirmed by the two Sahih collections of hadith, namely Sahih Bukhari[12] and Sahih Muslim,[13] where we read that they will be virgins who are so beautiful, pure and transparent that "the marrow of the bones of their legs will be seen through the bones and the flesh",[14] and that "the believers will visit and enjoy them".[15] Contents
Authenticity
The concept of houri can be found in major Islamic scriptures. The Quran, states believing males will be rewarded with virgins.[16] Often put under question is the authenticity of the hadiths regarding houri.[5] A common misconception is that there is only one da`if (weak) hadith that refers to the exact number of houri awarded. These narrations are in fact found in many hadith collections with varying levels of authenticity, ranging from hasan (good) to sahih (authentic).[5] For example, in the Sunan Ibn Majah, one of the six major hadith collections,[17] it states in a hasan (good)[9] narration that every male admitted into heaven will be given eternal erections and wed to 72 wives, all with libidinous sex organs.[10] Similarly in another hadith with multiple narrators that has been graded hasan (good), it states that the shahid (martyr) will be married to seventy-two of al-hoor al-‘iyn.[18][19] Sunan al-Tirmidhi, another of the six major hadith collections,[17] states that the smallest reward for the people of heaven is an abode with seventy-two houri.[20] Note that this is not a da'if (weak) hadith and has sanad (a chain of narrators)", contrary to common misconception.[21] It has been graded hasan sahih,[9] meaning this hadith is hasan (good) since it has several chains of transmitters, it is also sahih (authentic) as the chains are all declared authentic delivered by Imam Tirmidhi.[22] Also reported in Sunan Al-Kubra and Musnad Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, and declared sahih (authentic)[9] by Ibn Abi Shayba, Ibn Hibban, and Al-Hakim is the hadith that states that [God's] servants will be married in heaven with seventy wives and that they'll be given the sexual strength for a hundred.[23] Orthodox Muslim theologians have related further hadith that give us the exact number of 72, such as al-Ghazali who wrote, "[The Prophet said] the lowest rank of an inmate of heaven will have eighty thousand servants and seventy two wives."[24]
Descriptions
There are several descriptions related to houri that are found in various Islamic references. Some include: Physical Attributes: voluptuous[25], Sahih International translates it as "full-breasted [companions] of equal age". Tafsir al-Jalalayn says "and buxom maidens (kawā‘ib is the plural of kā‘ib) of equal age (atrāb is the plural of tirb)". Several Islamic scholars explain that they will have "large, round breasts which are not inclined to hang".[26]
In addition to Quranic translations of 78:33 specifying the virgins will be, Sahih International translates it as. Tafsir al-Jalalayn says. Several Islamic scholars explain that they will have Wide and beautiful/lovely eyes [27] [28] [29]
White skinned [30]
Like pearls [31]
Hairless except the eyebrows and the head [32]
60 cubits [27.5 meters] tall [33] [30]
7 cubits [3.2 meters] in width [30]
Transparent to the marrow of their bones [26] [14]
Eternally young [32]
Companions of equal age [25][34] Sexual Attributes: Untouched / with hymen unbroken by sexual intercourse [35] [36]
Virgins [37]
Voluptuous/full-breasted [25] The word used is كواعب ( kawaa'ib ), which is a plural of كاعب ( kaa'ib ) and the meaning accordig to the dictionary is نَاهِدَةُ الثَّدْيِ ( naahida thadee ), "buxom breast" [38] .
With large, round breasts which are not inclined to hang [26] [4]
Appetizing vaginas [11] Personality Attributes: Chaste [27]
Restraining their glances [27] [35]
Modest gaze [39] Other Attributes: Splendid [40]
Pure [14]
Non-menstruating / non-urinating/ non-defecating and childfree [26] [41]
Never dissatisfied [41]
Will sing praise [7]
Association with Terrorism
Suicide is clearly forbidden in Islam[42], but the permissibility of Istishhad (martyrdom) has scholars split on the issue. Notable scholars and apologists such as Shaykh Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, the world's most quoted independent Islamic jurist,[43] and Dr. Zakir Naik, known for his advocacy of "Qur'anic science", have justified the use of suicide bombing in Islam.[44][45][46] Opinion polls have further shown that an extremely large number of Muslims from around the world support the practice.[43][47][48][49] The Quran states that all Muslim males, not only martyrs, will be rewarded with virgins.[37] However, the Quran does also mention that those who fight in the way of Allah (jihad) and get killed will be given a "great reward",[50] and there are also hasan (good) hadith[19] which refer to 72 virgins as one of the "seven blessings from Allah" to the martyr.[18] This has lead to the 72 virgins concept being widely used as a way to entice martyrdom. These phenomena can be witnessed in Palestine, where the actions of a mother who sends her son to die as a martyr is sometimes seen as "marrying him off",[51] and where the concept is used in Friday sermons and music videos, both airing on official television.[52][53] It has even been used in the United Kingdom, where, in one event, Muslim teens were told to train with Kalashnikov rifles with the promise that they would receive 72 virgins in heaven if they died as religious martyrs.[54]

They meant by this that the breasts of these girls will be fully rounded and not sagging, because they will be virgins, equal in age.

al-Ghazzali, Ihya Uloom Ed-Din, vol.4 p.4. “According to Prophet Muhammad (SW), the Hurs of Paradise will be pure women, free of menstruation, urine, stool, cough and children. The Hurs will sing in Paradise on divine purity and praise—we are most beautiful Hurs and we are for the honored husbands. Muhammad said that an inmate of Paradise will have the sexual strength of 70 men. Muhammad said, “An inmate of Paradise will have 500 Hurs, 4,000 unmarried women and 8,000 widowed women. Each of them will keep embracing him for the duration of his whole worldly life.”
Apologetic Arguments
White Rasins This claim originated from Christoph Luxenberg, a modern author writing under a pseudonym.[55] It suggests that the term houri actually meant to describe "white raisins." His previous literature,[56] which has been accused of having a "Christian apologetic agenda",[57] is that the Quran was drawn from Christian Syro-Aramaic texts in the early 8th century, in order to evangelize the Arabs,[58] and that the Aramaic word 'hur' (white raisin) had been mistranslated by later Arab commentators into the Arabic word 'houri' (virgin).[59] The Quran describes the physical characteristics of the houri in many places, such as, large eyes,[29] big breasts,[25] chaste,[35] and restraining their glances.[35] The Quran further states that men will be wed to this houri.[2] These relevant verses suggest that Luxenberg's "white rasins" theory is in error. Virgins only mentioned in hadith not Quran Although the Quran does not mention the exact number of virgins, it does state that Muslim men will be awarded with (multiple) virgins in heaven.[37] The Quran describes some of their physical attributes and personality traits[29][25][35]. The number of houri is confirmed in multiple hadiths.[5] Also worth noting is that hadiths are a crucial part of Islam but can be ignored by certain Muslims who disagree with hadiths on details about Islam. The 72 virgins hadith has been classified as Da'if (weak) or Maudu (fabricated) The hadith from Sunan al-Tirmidhi has been graded hasan sahih gharib (a “fair, sound, single-chained hadith”).[9] Additionally there is not only one "72 virgins" hadith. There are many quoted narrations that have been graded both hasan (good) and sahih (authentic)[5] Houri are only servants and not for sexual purposes The Quran details that houri are chaste virgins that have big breasts.[37] While the Quran does not explicitly state they are for sexual purposes this is mentioned in other Islamic sources . One such hadith states "The believer will be given such and such strength in heaven for sexual intercourse". Other sources state that "the penis of the elected never softens" and that men in heaven will have the sexual strength of 100 men.[60][61] Hour are for both men and women The Quran indicates that houris will be "untouched before them by both man and jinni" [62] Implying that they are females that are awarded to men.

Following our post on IoT platforms, Spark guys reached out and asked if we can do a full interview. Given the unique position Spak is currently in (post-successful Kickstarter, betting heavily on Open Hardware and Open Software...) - we were more than happy to do it. And were pleasantly surprised by all the things we have learned along the way. Here we give a full (uncut) transcript of our interview with Zach Supalla, CEO of Spark.
Hackaday: Tell us a little bit of a backstory behind Spark
Zach: OK, to rewind all the way back.. in January 2012 I started working on connected lighting product. The inspiration for this was - my dad is deaf and he has lights that flash when someone is at the door, when he gets a phone call on his tty etc. He and my mom had this problem that when he takes his phone from his pocket, he is completely unreachable and I wanted lights to flash when he got a text message. So that is really where all this started - I had a problem that was very real to me, which was my parents communicating and I saw a way to solve this problem with connectivity. If we make our lights Internet-connected, then I can figure out a way to get the signal that this behavior happened to his lights. But then of course, that grew into a larger concept of, well, why should it just be limited to the deaf? lights should be a source of information.. what if lights were more than just lights? what if lights conveyed information about the world and they did things automatically, not like... "I have a remote control on my phone", but like... "the sun went down and lights automatically turn on"-kind of home automation. All to do with lights connected to the Internet.
So we launched this product which eventually took the form of a little plastic thing that sits between your lightbulb socket and the light, that was wifi-connected, sort of WiFi-connected light dimmer switch integrated into light socket, called SparkSocket. It launched in November 2012 and failed. We had a goal of $250,000, we raised $125,000. And so we felt like there was something there, we still had 6-digit raise and 1600 backers but it wasn't enough to cover our manufacturing cost. And so, it took us a while to realize that we needed to change. The feedback that we had received from the market was that our product was not good enough and so over the course of the next few months we struggled to figure out what we should be doing and so we have joined the incubator program called HAXLR8R that was based in Shenzhen and moved there for 4 months during this process.
it is wrong and does not help the sex life of teenager since this can give you a false idea of sex, what your penis size is supposed to be like, women like it hard and aggressive, it warps the reality of a normal sexual life and messes the mind of any teenagers so avoid it otherwise you just might mess up your future relationship.
Some guys become so freaking addicted to it that they lose focus of their reality--(remeber that guy that was paying$3000.00 on porn even when his wife is Cheryl Thiggs--a hot model?) start to develop a relationship with it (paying to see it) and this will become an issue in the marriage; trust me stop it if you are watching it; it gives you nothing but an excuse to certain activities. Temptation is so easy to accept for now you can get it on the net.

Last year we had an amazing new coffee, one that blew my mind how good it was. So much so I nearly gave up my house and all my worldly possessions to get it.
I first got to meet a guy called Carlos at my Costa Rican exporter's office on the last day of my time in Costa Rica last year. He arrived around 10 minuets after I had cupped the first table of coffees, where I had found one lot that was making me sing. It just had to be his.
Here ensued the worst negotiation for buying coffee ever. I start “How much do you want?” He replies “How much do you like it?” I reply “A lot” he replies “I'd like a lot then please” to which I replied “OK”. Luckily at this point a grown up from the exporters stepped in and made sure I didn't give Carlos my house and my car and my pension plan, and agreed a price that rewarded Carlos more than he had ever gotten before and left me with a home to return to.
Back then this coffee was just called Carlos Arietta, as this is all we knew about it.
This year on my return visit I got to spend some time with the family, stop for some lunches hang out and ask lots of questions. There is the mill first of all called Arbar. At Arbar which is very close to the house they have drying tables and a small nursery. They don't have a deplulper, but more about this later. This is new, as before they would just sell their coffee to the local coop so have no interaction with the coffee.
Also on this year's visit, we have build on the relationship, not only getting the Finca Oasis (I found out the name finally) but also we bought his other farms coffee called El Manatial.
You may notice that this coffee is priced differently. Our normal nicely rounded down prices are not there. This years coffee should sell for £7.50 (we negotiated a small price drop this year as we bought everything from both farms, and this works out thats theres some economies of scale compared to the £10.00 of last year). But were charging £7.88. Well this is so we (by we I mean you) can buy Carlos and his family a depulper for next years harvest. So he doesn't have to pay someone to pulp it, and can get more and more control of his amazing coffee, and improve quality even more.
You can go see what your generosity has bought as I leant the money to Carlos as I promised you would pay it back at the in the photos below (I hope your good for it).
So drink amazing coffee, and feel good that your making someones life happier in every cup.
There is no definitive estimate as to the number of illegal aliens who live in California. The conservative estimate is three million souls. It is very likely to be much higher. With heavy rains this year across most of the state, the near collapse of the Oroville Dam highlighted the urgent need for infrastructure funding.
Yet, the state's legislature is focused on battling Donald Trump over sanctuary cities. In fact, in retaliation for the threat against its sanctuary counties and cities, the California legislature is advancing Senate Bill 54 on a fast-track to passage. The idea is to make California the first ever sanctuary state. If that sounds incredible, it is only the tip of the iceberg.
Organizations such as the Federation for American Immigration Reform estimates the cost to California's taxpayers each year as it relates to social services for these individuals and their children to be a whopping $25 billion dollars.
According to a study released by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) it finds that providing education, health care, law enforcement, and social and government services to illegal aliens and their dependents costs Californians $25.3 billion per year. Outlined in FAIR's report The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on California Taxpayers the state's “3 million illegal aliens and their 1.1 million U.S.–born children cost the average California household — headed by a U.S. citizen – $2,370 annually.”
The report finds that taxes collected from illegal aliens amounts to about $3.5 billion annually. Some economists estimate that illegal aliens add $10 billion to California's economy in productive labor.
Even if that were the case, it leaves the state with a total net loss of over $12 billion dollars a year. Dan Stein, the president of FAIR, has stated “Despite overwhelming evidence that illegal immigration represents an unsustainable fiscal burden to the state, the California
Legislature and local governments across the state continue to provide new benefits, new services, and new privileges to illegal aliens, even as the state neglects the needs and concerns of other Californians. The costs will continue to grow so long as the state continues to reward illegal immigration and impedes immigration enforcement.”
The World Bank estimates that illegal aliens send an incredible $120 billion dollars a year back to their home countries. The Daily Mail cites the bank as contending that “In the United States last year, more than $120 billion was sent by workers to families abroad – making it the largest sender of remittances in the world.
More than $23 billion went to Mexico, $13.45 billion to China, $10.84 billion to India and $10 billion to the Philippines, among other recipients.” These are no small sums, and getting on the California gravy train has now become normalized and mainstream.
With the audacity of the who feels that they are above reproach, Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León admitted publicly that he forged documents when he himself was illegally in the United States.
De León casually described in a radio interview with KPCC 89.3's Air Talk with Larry Mantle his feelings on the matter. When asked about what he meant the politician replied:
“… I can tell you half of my family would be eligible for deportation under [President Donald Trump's] executive order, because if they got a false Social Security card, if they got a false identification, if they got a false driver's license prior to us passing AB60, if they got a false green card, and anyone who has family members, you know, who are undocumented knows that almost entirely everybody has secured some sort of false identification. That's what you need to survive, to work. They are eligible for massive deportation.”
This kind of caviler attitude is now the norm in California where Governor Jerry Brown, who works closely with Mr. de León, has chosen to afford illegal aliens with all the social amenities of those who are citizens of the state, along with other perks such as driver´s licenses and college scholarships.
Released on Monday, Campus Reform, a university watchdog group, announced “California Governor Jerry Brown is proposing cuts to higher education scholarships for middle-class students while increasing scholarship funding for illegal immigrant students. Brown projects that the cut will save $115 million per year by 2021, but the Legislative Analyst's Office estimates that the cost of financial aid for DREAMers will grow from $67 million last year to $88.6 million this year.”
With this proposal, it is hard not to argue that residents of California are being discriminated against by the governor in favor of illegal alien students. California schools, especially those of the universities, were started as a way of creating affordable education options that moved away from private colleges so that almost any resident who could achieve it, would receive a quality education.
How times have changed! As the cost of college tuitions continue to rise, the already overburdened middle-class of California are now going to be stripped of funds to assist them financially so that illegal aliens can receive their cut. This, of course, is a double blow considering that those same middle-class families contribute in taxes to the state coffers year-over-year.
This kind of reckless behavior on the part of California's leadership is not en vogue with the voters. Most California residents are against “sanctuary cities.”
Upwards of 74% of California's oppose support for these cities yet people like Brown, de León, and others continue to push the narrative that it is only just and fair to allow illegal aliens to be protected, even if that means undermining native members of the populace who were born there. Nationally, the numbers are roughly the same.
A survey from Harvard–Harris Poll found that 80 percent of voters say local authorities should have to comply with the law by reporting to federal agents any criminal activities committed by illegal immigrants. Such views are disproportionately in line with Donald Trump's tactic of deporting criminal illegal aliens via the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.
Data compiled from the FBI and Government Accountability Office suggests that illegal aliens commit murder at rates starkly different to native born citizens. Criminal and illegal aliens commit murder at much higher rates than all inhabitants of the U.S. – at least 3 to 10 times higher. Given numbers like these it leaves one to wonder, if the will of the general populace is to end sanctuary cities, why is Governor Brown open to making the entirety of California the first “sanctuary state?”
The National Bureau of Economic Research estimates nearly 20% of all agricultural labor in the United States is performed by illegal aliens while 13% of construction jobs are filled by illegal aliens as well. Americans are constantly told that people who are US citizens will not do these jobs. Whether that is true or not remains to be seen. One thing is certain, if illegal aliens are able to continue apace, we will never know the outcome. What we do know is that taxpayers are subsidizing cheap immigrant labor to the tune of $25 billion a year. Is that worth the price?
A new opinion poll has found little change in support for the Government parties despite the controversy over some of the measures in Budget 2014.
The Sunday Business Post/Red C poll, to be published tomorrow, also found that a majority of voters think the Budget was unfair.
The poll, in which over 1,000 voters were questioned, was conducted between Monday and Wednesday last, a few days after the announcement of the Budget.
The main findings on party support are: Fine Gael are at 29%, up two points, Labour is at 9%, down one point, Fianna Fáil are unchanged at 23%, Sinn Féin are also unchanged at 17%, while
Independents and Others are down one point to 22%.
Asked was the Budget fair, 59% said it wasn't, with 39% saying it was.
The hunger strikes that began last year at Pelican Bay State Prison continue in Georgia and North Carolina
The hunger strike of nine Georgia prisoners which began on June 11th has now entered its 43rd day. The hunger strikers are demanding “decent food, medical care, educational opportunities, humane visiting policies, transparency in proceedings against inmates and wages for work.” Additionally, prisoners throughout North Carolina have begun a similar hunger strike with similar demands. These hunger strikes are a continuation of the resistance that began last July at the Pelican Bay State Prison in northern California. Three dozen prisoners began a strike at Pelican Bay last year over the:
widespread use of solitary confinement in California…approximately three thousand inmates are held in one of California's three Security Housing Units, where inmates determined to be gang members are sentenced to indefinite terms in solitary confinement. Quote:
Over 6,000 prisoners from across California soon joined the Pelican Bay hunger strikers, demanding an end to the practice of solitary confinement, access to decent food and medical care, as well as more education opportunities for inmates. The hunger strike lasted three weeks before it was called off. However, since then a wave of hunger strikes at prisons across the country have taken place with inmates demanding basic human rights. For their courage, inmates who choose to participate in the hunger strikes often face intense harassment from prison authorities, sometimes in the form of savage assaults.

With the backlash the Denver defense has received over the last week from their helmet-to-helmet hits on Panthers quarterback Cam Newton, it was inevitable that someone was getting fined.
According to ESPN's Adam Caplan, Darian Stewart was the first to receive his bill from the NFL.
#Broncos S Darian Stewart has been fined $18,231 for his hit in last week's game on Cam Newton, source said. — Adam Caplan (@caplannfl) September 14, 2016
While that may seem like a steep price to pay for one infraction, Stewart actually got off easy.
The NFL gave Stewart the standard first-offense fine for roughing the passer ($18,231), as opposed to the standard first-offense fine for a helmet-to-helmet hit ($24,309), according to NFL rules. The league easily could have categorized Stewart's hit as a helmet-to-helmet hit, even if it wasn't called so on the field. Likewise, given that the NFL's fines are clearly listed as minimums, the league could have upped the standard fine as well, just to prove a point.
They didn't.
ESPN's Ed Werder says this is because the NFL understands that players like Cam Newton and Russell Wilson aren't your run-of-the-mill quarterback, which makes them more susceptible to such hits.

According to Jeff Legwold, though, the Broncos aren't off the hook yet. Brandon Marshall, Von Miller and Bradley Roby are all being reviewed by the NFL for their hits on Thursday night.

We'll keep you updated on any more fines from the NFL.
(UPDATE 9:20 a.m.) As expected, Brandon Marshall has been fined by the NFL, too.
BREAKING: #Broncos Brandon Marshall fined $24k for hit on Newton, according to source. @DenverChannel — Troy Renck (@TroyRenck) September 14, 2016
Marshall didn't get called for a penalty on the field, but his fine is larger than Stewart's because the league deemed that his hit on Newton was a helmet-to-helmet hit.
With Stewart, the NFL apparently believed that he led with, and first made contact with, his shoulder.

BENTO RODRIGUES, Brazil (Reuters) - From when the first warnings were heard, the Brazilian village of Bento Rodrigues had about 25 minutes to escape.
The water from a broken dam holding waste water from the nearby Samarco mine in Minas Gerais state moved fast down the valley. A flood believed to be some 20 meters (65 feet) high swept through the village of 600, destroying homes and livelihoods within minutes.
Apart from a few houses spared by being on higher ground, homes are little more than bare walls now. A thick sludge of water and iron ore tore off the roofs and settled over the village like hardening wax, leaving twisted cars perched awkwardly in its wake. Helicopters buzzed overhead, searching for the lost 24 hours after the deluge.
One person has been confirmed dead, 13 are reported missing and many more remain unaccounted for after two tailings dams burst on Thursday at the Samarco mine owned by two of the world's largest miners, Vale SA VALE5.SA and BHP Billiton BLT.L.
A school in the line of the advancing water was hastily evacuated by teachers, an act which is thought to have saved dozens of lives. “There are heroes in this tragedy,” the local mayor Duarte Júnior said in acknowledgement of their actions.
Six villages were hit by the flood as 60 million cubic meters of waste water swamped the region. Residents were evacuated to a gymnasium in the nearby town of Mariana, where hundreds of mattresses lined the floor and medical staff bustled in white coats attending to the injured. Donations of water, clothes and blankets poured in from well-wishers with many taking the day off work to help those who have lost everything.
“There's nothing left in my village. Just memories,” Soraia Souza, 24, from the village of Paracatu de Baixo, told Reuters while holding an 18-month-old baby wearing just a diaper.
At the site of the worst devastation, twenty rescue workers sweated in the humid Brazilian heat, trying to rescue a horse trapped in the thick, heavy mud. With a rope wrapped around it, twenty men and women tugged to exhaustion, but the animal wouldn't budge. As dusk turned to dark, hopes the horse could be saved wavered.
“We've tried everything, there's nothing more we can do,” said Maximiliano Inacio, a local firefighter.
“So far, we haven't had a lot of takers,” said Josh Boyd, director of undergraduate studies in the Brian Lamb School of Communication at Purdue. “When we speak to parents, they tend to be more excited about it than the students.”
Indeed, many American students take six years to graduate from college.
Ashley Korkeakoski-Sears, an N.Y.U. English major who is on track to graduate this May after just three years, said that she did not regret speeding through. While she had to skip some fun classes, like hip-hop dance, she has had time for plenty of experiences. She interned at the International Rescue Committee, she has worked as an office assistant and an executive assistant, and she studied abroad in Madrid.
Ms. Korkeakoski-Sears said she decided to hustle through to save money. She expected to receive less financial aid her senior year because her mother planned to go back to work.
But this track is not for everyone, she said. Ms. Korkeakoski-Sears, who describes herself as a planner, said she knew she wanted to be an English major when she was a junior in high school. Students who need time to to figure that out, as most do, would be better served taking their time, she said.
“I definitely think this is a way to ease the burden for now, but I don't think it's a long-term solution” to the cost of college, Ms. Korkeakoski-Sears said. “It doesn't take into account every type of student, and every type of student should have the ability to make college affordable to themselves.”
Professor Schall agreed that this solution was not for everyone, nor did it suffice on its own. The affordability committee, which was convened by N.Y.U.'s president, Andrew Hamilton, is experimenting with a variety of ways to cut down on costs and give students a financial lift. There are small-ticket items — Facebook can alert students if there is food left over after staff meetings — and those that are much larger. The university froze the cost of room and board this school year for the first time in decades. Tuition increased this year, but Professor Schall said it was the lowest percentage increase in 20 years.
Couldn't N.Y.U. and other colleges solve the problem just by cutting how much they charge? Professor Schall said there was a constant pressure on universities to increase their capacity to teach and do research, “and those things are expensive.”
“There is no silver bullet,” she continued. “If we could triple our endowment, that would be lovely, but short of that, we're looking at everything from the price of books to the use of temporary employees,” she said. “We're trying to be as creative as we can.”
WASHINGTON -- NSA leaker Edward Snowden is defending his disclosure of top-secret U.S. spying programs in an online chat Monday with The Guardian, in which he rejected allegations that he is spying for the Chinese and attacked U.S. officials for calling him a traitor.
"No. I have had no contact with the Chinese government. Just like with the Guardian and the Washington Post, I only work with journalists," he said in response to a question from The Guardian's Spencer Ackerman.
Responding to a similar query, Snowden painted the spy allegations as an attempt to destroy his character:
This is a predictable smear that I anticipated before going public, as the US media has a knee-jerk "RED CHINA!" reaction to anything involving HK or the PRC, and is intended to distract from the issue of US government misconduct. Ask yourself: if I were a Chinese spy, why wouldn't I have flown directly into Beijing? I could be living in a palace petting a phoenix by now.
Snowden also appeared defiant in the face of calls for his prosecution.
"The U.S. government is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me. Truth is coming, and it cannot be stopped," he said. He added the government "immediately and predictably destroyed any possibility of a fair trial at home," by labeling him a traitor, and indicated he would not return to the U.S. voluntarily.
Congressional leaders have called Snowden a traitor for revealing once-secret surveillance programs two weeks ago in the Guardian and The Washington Post. The National Security Agency programs collect records of millions of Americans' telephone calls and Internet usage as a counterterror tool. The disclosures revealed the scope of the collections, which surprised many Americans and have sparked debate about how much privacy the government can take away in the name of national security.
"It would be foolish to volunteer yourself to" possible arrest and criminal charges "if you can do more good outside of prison than in it," he said.
The Guardian announced its website was hosting an online chat with Snowden, in hiding in Hong Kong, with reporter Glenn Greenwald receiving and posting his questions. The Associated Press couldn't independently verify that the man answering the questions was indeed Snowden.
Snowden was working as a contractor for NSA at the time he had access to the then-secret programs. He defended his actions and said he considered what to reveal and what not to, saying he did not reveal any U.S. operations against what he called legitimate military targets, but instead showed the NSA is hacking civilian infrastructure like universities and private businesses.
"These nakedly, aggressively criminal acts are wrong no matter the target. Not only that, when NSA makes a technical mistake during an exploitation operation, critical systems crash," he said, though he gave no examples of what systems have crashed or in which countries.
"Congress hasn't declared war on the countries – the majority of them are our allies – but without asking for public permission, NSA is running network operations against them that affect millions of innocent people," he said. "And for what? So we can have secret access to a computer in a country we're not even fighting?"
Snowden was referring to PRISM, one of the programs he disclosed. The program sweeps up Internet usage data from all over the world that goes through nine major U.S.-based Internet providers. The NSA can look at foreign usage without any warrants, and says the program doesn't target Americans.
U.S. officials say the data-gathering programs are legal and operated under secret court supervision.
Snowden explained his claim that from his desk, he could "wiretap" any phone call or email – a claim top intelligence officials have denied. "If an NSA, FBI, CIA, DIA, etc. analyst has access to query raw SIGINT (signals intelligence) databases, they can enter and get results for anything they want," he wrote in the answer posted on the Guardian site. "Phone number, email, user id, cell phone handset id (IMEI), and so on – it's all the same."
The NSA did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. But Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has said that the kind of data that can be accessed and who can access it is severely limited.
Snowden said the restrictions on what could be seen by an individual analyst vary according to policy changes, which can happen "at any time," and said that a technical "filter" on NSA data gathering meant to filter out U.S. communications is "weak," such that U.S. communications often get ingested.
Snowden defended U.S. Army Private Bradley Manning for his disclosures of documents to Wikileaks, which he called a "legitimate journalistic outlet," which "carefully redacted all of their releases in accordance with a judgment of public interest." He said the Wikileaks release of unredacted material was "due to the failure of a partner journalist to control a passphrase," which led to the charge against Manning that he dumped the documents, which Snowden called an attempt to smear Manning.
Manning is currently on trial at Fort Meade – the same Army base where the NSA is headquartered – on charges of aiding the enemy for releasing documents to Wikileaks.
Snowden defended his description of his salary as being $200,000 a year, calling that a "career high," but saying he did take a pay cut to take the job at Booz Allen Hamilton, where he worked as a contractor at an NSA facility in Hawaii. When Booz Allen fired him, they said his salary was $122,000.

On the web:
It's been more than a year since a DC circuit court ordered TSA to hold public "notice-and-comment" rulemaking hearings for its Whole Body Imaging "nude" scanners, but the transportation authority still hasn't complied. Now, the US Circuit Court of Appeals is issuing another order, this time demanding that the Department of Homeland Security (which oversees the TSA) explain within the month why it hasn't obeyed the original order, reports Wired.
Passengers have had no chance to participate in the TSA's rulemaking
The new order comes in response to a petition filed by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) on July 17th, asking the court to compel the TSA to abide by the July, 2011 ruling. The petition was supported by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, Electronic Frontier Foundation, and others, which filed an amicus brief in support. The parties argue that despite the scanners' far-reaching effects, citizens haven't participated at all in the rulemaking governing their use.
Despite both mounting legal pressure and public concerns surrounding safety and privacy, rather than slowing down its adoption of the controversial security technology, the TSA is accelerating it. The brief mentioned above notes that "the TSA's purchase of hundreds of new scanners after this Court's July 2011 decision in EPIC suggests the agency intends to continue doing as it pleases without regard to public input or duly enacted laws."
It's not just Bitcoin anymore. Digital currencies have another big winner now, Ethereum (ether), and as Lombardi Letter's Benjamin Smith explains below, it's more than just good news for early investors.

The Ethereum price explosion ultimately signals digital currencies aren't just flash-in-the-pans; they are morphing into legitimate alternative assets nudging their way into the mainstream.
Arguably, the biggest proof of cryptocurrency transcendence has been the upswing in institutional involvement. This is the “smart” money that generally calls trends correctly. It's one thing for mom & pops investors to move the needle higher in a limited way, as was the case with early adopters. It's quite another for price and volume to skyrocket in unmistakable fashion due to billions in cash infusions by institutions investors. Beyond the obvious price appreciation, institutional participation also signals a deeper confirmation of the long term viability of the asset. It tells us all those multinational and governmental pilot projects worldwide are yielding positive results.
Our bitcoin price forecast foresaw the growing sector institutional interest gathering on the periphery. And aside from the conservative nature of the forecast, our prophecy was dead-on.
Frequent CNBC cryptocurrency analyst Brian Kelly has recently suggested Bitcoin's May 2017 surge past $1,500 was the result of greater institutional demand – particularly from Japan. “The biggest driver right now is you're starting to see institutional investors take a keen interest in the entire sector,” said Kelly, who himself has launched a digital asset fund for outside investors. Likewise, CoinDesk research analyst Alex Sunnarborg attributed Bitcoin's price explosion to a spike in global trading volume, particularly from Japan. (Source: Bitcoin jumps to a record, nears $1,500 on a spike in demand from Japan, CNBC, May 2, 2017)
It's now quite apparent the same institutional interest dynamics buttressing Bitcoin prices have migrated to Ethereum. In hindsight, the reason seems obvious: if you believe in the long-term viability of cryptocurrency sector, it stands to reason multiple “winners” will emerge, as opposed to just one. With a maximum of 21 million Bitcoins that could ever be in circulation, it's clear the market could support other alternatives. Clearly, institutional investors have crowned Ethereum next in line.
Early indications of a powerful surge in capital flows could be seen back in March 2017. Vice president for Genesis Global Trading, Martin Garcia, noted that they “started to see institutional investor interest pick up in ethereum, something we hadn't really seen before.” While other industry gatekeepers noted high-net worth trading in ethereum has picked up considerably. (Source: Ethereum's Price Surge is Sparking Institutional Investor Interest, coindesk, March 17, 2017)
To demonstrate how powerful institutional-infused investment capital has elevated the Ethereum price, one only has to glean a 2017 daily chart. Prices have entered full mania mode, jumping from just over $8 at the beginning of 2017 to over $300 as of this writing In percentage terms, that's an increase of 3,650% in only half a year!
Bitcoin's percentage gain is more modest due to the law of large numbers, but impressive nonetheless. It began 2017 trading around $1,000 in USD terms, but has jumped to $2,820 as of this writing. That's an increase of 282% which makes it hands-down the top appreciating recognized “currency” in the world.
The last time investors witnessed these types of frenzied moves was during the late 1990's Tech Bubble. Once institutional money got involved, “modest” moves in equities (pennies to single digits) turned into a full-blown mania (single digits to triple digits; quadruple digits in some cases). A considerable washout of excesses occurred, but the internet winners went on to soar in price to new heights.
We expect the same dynamics are at play with cryptocurrencies today.
Ethereum price up Is? Is It Still A Good Investment 2017?
At these nosebleed levels, investing in ether is not for the faint of heart. As mentioned, prices have increased over 3,100% year-to-date and show no signs of abating. In terms of timing, the low-hanging fruit has already been plucked. I would imagine it's almost impossible to stake a significant position at these levels, no matter how bullish your long terms sentiments are.
But that doesn't mean you should forget about it either. Rather than focusing on incredible short term price movements, mindsets towards ethereum future value predictions should instead shift to a long term perspective. While the “easy” early-adopter money is gone, we may be only entering the third inning in terms of overall ethereum price outlook.
Why? Because even after this incredible run, total market capitalization is only around $23 billion. For perspective, if Ethereum was a stock, it's overall value would barely crack the top 300 issues in the S&P 500. With all the business and transaction potential amassing down the pike, ethereum will deservedly command higher valuations than many obscure companies ahead of it should its potential be fulfilled. The last part of that sentence will ultimately tell the story.
Ethereum vs Bitcoin
The Ethereum vs bitcoin debate really comes down to which cryptocurrency is perceived to hold the longest term value. Strong arguments can be made either way, but from our perspective, ethereum has some important characteristics which give it a competitive advantage.
The first of which relates to transaction times. It currently takes about 12 minutes on average to confirm a Bitcoin transaction, while it takes Ethereum is only around 12–15 seconds to do so. Ethereum's “GHOST” protocol can process greater data loads and in greater speeds than Bitcoin's peer-to-peer cryptographic protocol. This advantage cannot be understated.
Secondly, Ethereum has the ability to run “smart contracts,” which are code functions which can handle legal functions, data storage, information processes and more. Bitcoin, not so much (although this may be changing soon). This gives Ethereum the prime advantage of added utility over just being a currency. Should Bitcoin not keep pace with Ethereum in this arms race, Ethereum could see better adoption rates.
Looking forward, our ethereum price prediction 2017 is $150, tempered by the unsustainable gains it has achieved thus far. Obviously, we would exercise extreme caution here, as short term prices have jumped ahead of fundamentals. Mean regression could easily take Ethereum price back towards $100 (or firm support at $50) once the mania dies down; similar to the consolidation phase experienced in Bitcoin during its first two bubble runs.
However, we are staunch longer term bulls who truly believe in the transcendent qualities Ethereum and other select cryptocurrencies possess. The sky's the limit, but we believe investors should now focus on long term accumulation strategies at select price points. Employing this method should yield the best long term results, while avoiding painful “stop out” which can jiggle investors out of positions and tie up capital.
Virgil van Dijk is the best centre-back in the Premier League, says Jamie Redknapp
Virgil van Dijk is the Premier League's best centre-back, according to Jamie Redknapp
Southampton's "immense" Virgil van Dijk is the best centre-back in the Premier League, says Jamie Redknapp.
Van Dijk helped Saints to a 1-0 victory over Liverpool in the EFL Cup semi-final first leg on Wednesday with an assured display, following a fine first half to season.
He has been linked with a move away from the club in the summer, and Redknapp told Sky Sports after the game that the 25-year-old Dutchman is getting "better and better".
Van Dijk kept Daniel Sturridge at bay on Wednesday night
"He's immense, I say it every time I watch him. He gets better and better. It was like watching a man play against a little boy in Daniel Sturridge, he bullied him all game.
"He never gave him a sniff. He's got the after-burners, he's so comfortable on the ball. Whoever decides to buy him, he is a fantastic player.
"There's not a better centre-back in the Premier League."

Former Southampton striker Matt Le Tisier echoed Redknapp's words, saying he is the best central defender in the division alongside Tottenham's Toby Alderweireld.
Also speaking on Sky Sports, Le Tissier does not believe Van Dijk will be sold by Southampton this January, and added that Jose Fonte's transfer request meant he could not be expected to play alongside Van Dijk on Wednesday evening.
"I like Alderweireld, and those two are the best two centre-backs in the Premier League.
Nathan Redmond and Van Dijk spoke to Sky Sports after the game Nathan Redmond and Van Dijk spoke to Sky Sports after the game
"Jose will be missed, he's been a terrific servant for the club, but once you've put in a transfer request I don't think he can be expected to play tonight."
Asked if they will keep hold of Van Dijk in January, Le Tissier said: "I think so, I think when you look back at all the players we have sold, I can't remember one of them going in January.
"I thought they organised themselves really well. I watched the last round up at the Emirates and they did the same thing there, a terrific defensive performance."
The recipe for a record-breaking guacamole? 25,000 avocados and 1,000 people to mash them.
That is what avocado growers in Mexico's Jalisco state mobilized on Sunday to break the world record for the biggest guacamole, a whopping 3 tonnes (6,600 lbs) of delicious dip made from “green gold.” The mass mash-up was part entertainment and part politicking, as growers and Mexico make the point that they – and the guacamole loving Americans – have benefited from the North American Free Trade Agreement that is now under threat from U.S. President Donald Trump.
Negotiators from Canada, Mexico and the United States were meeting in the Mexican capital this weekend to revamp the 23-year-old NAFTA accord that Trump has threatened to end if he does not get concessions to curb a trade deficit with Mexico.
Some 80% of U.S. avocado consumption comes from Mexico's growing expanse of orchards. Jalisco has become the second biggest producer of the Hass variety in Mexico behind Michoacan state, according to producers.
More than 600 student chefs and 400 people from the rural town of Concepcion de Buenos Aires prepared the traditional dish for thousands people, many of whom came from the Jalisco state capital of Guadalajara.
The state's governor was on hand to receive recognition from a representative of the Guinness Book of World Records.
U.S. negotiators have said they want to include provisions to make it easier for U.S. seasonal produce growers to be able to file anti-dumping cases against Mexico.
That idea has been criticized by U.S. restaurants and retailers, who say it would drive up prices.
Mexican growers of the fruit say U.S. production of avocado could not meet demand.
“The imports of avocados from Mexico have not cost one single job to the domestic industry [in the United States],” said Ramon Paz, the spokesman for Michoacan's growers.
FOXBOROUGH -- Bill Belichick dropped a surprising line in an otherwise humdrum radio interview earlier this week, telling WEEI hosts Christian Arcand and Andy Hart that Patriots wide receiver Chris Hogan is "one of our best players."
This is rare praise from Belichick, who is usually happy to list off adjectives when describing a player -- "smart, tough, instinctive," -- but hesitant to dish out superlatives.
A Google search of "'Bill Belichick'" and 'one of our best players'" yields quotes about Devin McCourty (2015), McCourty again in 2011, Logan Mankins (2011), Randy Moss (2009), and Adam Vinatieri (2004).
There may have been others, of course, but those are the five mentions that popped up online. All four of the above players have been Pro Bowlers. At least two are surefire Hall of Famers.
The timing of Belichick's comment was especially curious. Generally, Belichick is not in the business of inflating expectations, which is precisely what a line like that about a player like Hogan will do.
But here are the facts: Hogan is an incredibly gifted athlete. He can run past any secondary. He can dropkick field goals from 45 yards out. As Jimmy Garoppolo said last year, "I saw him punt last week or so, and he punted the sh-- out of the ball."
Chris Hogan is a freak athlete
Hogan is an ascending talent who has enjoyed an excellent training camp, capped by a four-catch, 70-yard, two-touchdown performance against the Lions. He is, in Belichick's words, "way ahead" of where he was a season ago, his first with the Patriots.
Chris Hogan will play a major role in a 2017 Patriots offense that can no longer lean on Julian Edelman.
The question is, what exactly will that role entail?
Let's examine what he did for the Pats in 2016.
Hogan saw 80 targets -- 54 from a perimeter position (X or Z) and 26 from the slot (Y). He caught 20 of 26 targets, or 76.9 percent, from that position. From outside locations, he caught 35 of 54 targets (64.8 percent). And he produced a number of big plays in the slot; nine of his 20 catches went for 20+ yards.
On post routes or go routes run out of the slot, the Tom Brady-Chris Hogan connection was unbelievably efficient, completing 8-of-9 passes for 307 yards (34.1 yards per pass attempt) and two touchdowns.
This represents a small sample size, but the ridiculous success rate could lead the Pats to expand Hogan's downfield opportunities from the slot position.
Hogan also proved effective on quick-hitting routes. The Patriots made an effort to get the ball in his hands immediately. Fifteen of his targets were on wide receiver screens or quick flat routes (plays that typically develop in less than two seconds). Another 10 targets were on short slants or drags, the chain-moving plays that have long defined the Patriots' offense.
This is where Julian Edelman has thrived. Truly replacing him will be impossible. Neither Hogan nor Brandin Cooks can match Edelman after the catch. Edelman's greatest asset is his innate ability to dodge the first tackler -- almost regardless of where he is on the field and how his body is contorted at the moment. Edelman can always make the first guy miss and gain a handful of extra yards, often finishing the play with a forward dive.
Hogan and Cooks will not be able to replicate that skill. But based on the type of routes Hogan ran in 2016, and based on Cooks' elite quickness, both players (along with Danny Amendola) can get open quickly and allow Tom Brady to throw before the pass rush becomes a factor. These short routes can put the Patriots in favorable second-down and third-down situations. Sometimes, they help set up big play opportunities down the field.
"Nothing good happens when I've got the ball in my hands," Brady said earlier this month. "So the faster I can get it out of my hands, the better it is, which means we've got to have a lot of trust."
It's easy to spot the trust Hogan has earned from Brady. And, after a terrific training camp, it's reasonable to project a huge year from Hogan.
Consider: Hogan had one catch for three yards in two games with Jacoby Brissett a year ago. He also missed a Week 11 game at San Francisco due to a back injury. If we sub out those three games and insert the three playoff games, Hogan had 54 receptions for 1,009 yards and six touchdowns over 16 games.
The receptions should increase in 2017, even if Hogan is the No. 3 option behind Cooks and Rob Gronkowski. In 2014, Brandon LaFell, the clear No. 3 behind Edelman and Gronkowski, pulled in 74 catches for 953 yards and seven scores.
LaFell was a solid possession receiver. Hogan offers better deep speed and more versatility.
Traditionally an offense that has operated horizontally, the Patriots have three key pass-catchers that can push the defense vertically in Cooks, Gronkowski, and Hogan. They have all five starters returning along the offensive line, a group that should be able to pass-protect well enough to allow deep routes to develop.
There's no question that the Patriots must now tweak their offense to suit the strengths of their top three receivers.
As Belichick said Tuesday, "I think you always have to be ready to go with what you've got."
Down the catalyst of their 2016 offense, they've still got Cooks, Gronkowski, and Hogan, two proven 1,000-yard receivers and a third who is likely on the verge of a breakout season.
Electronic Arts had news to boast about for Star Wars: Battlefront during its fiscal year 2016 financial results. The PS4, Xbox One, and PC shooter bested already raised sales expectations to hit the 14 million units sold mark and a sequel is on the way in 2017.
The publisher originally targeted 10 million copies of Star Wars: Battlefront being sold. It then upped the ante to 13 million units during an investors conference call in October 2015.
“We feel very good about 13 million units,” EA chief operating officer Peter Moore said at the time.
Obviously, not good enough as the publisher reported 14 million copies of Star Wars: Battlefront were “sold-in.” This is the number of copies sold to retailers, not to consumers. The game also expanded the number of new players in the EA ecosystem by more than 15 percent.
The tie-in with the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens obviously benefited Battlefront greatly. Electronic Arts is going to continue this pairing in 2017. The publisher announced a sequel to the shooter is coming in 2017 during its earnings call with investors. The game will feature content from the new movies. Star Wars: Episode VIII is set to release on December 15, 2017.
Obviously, DICE is going to be extremely busy with this announcement. It is currently supporting the current Battlefront release with DLC early into 2017. Additionally, the developer just announced Battlefield 1 for October 2016 and has Mirror's Edge Catalyst set for release in June.
It will be interesting to see how the studio addresses complaints about its first effort on the Star Wars: Batlefront franchise. The lack of space battles was a sore point among fans along with a missing single-player campaign. Sparse content at launch was also a common touch point. A mix of free and paid DLC has beefed up the in-game activities and maps, but some good will has been lost with fans of the original entries published by LucasArts.
Astounding preliminary research suggests psychedelics may yet revolutionize mental health care. But the researchers involved must be careful in all their conclusions and promotions, 50 years ago, one of them had the whole field shut down.
In only half a century, psychedelics have embodied the highest highs and the lowest lows of the American consciousness – from a revolution in therapy to a reputation for drug-addled lunacy. Unwittingly, when Harvard psychologist Timothy Leary signaled springtime for the "Summer of Love," promoting LSD as a means to achieve cosmic connection, he also drew closed the curtain on academic research into a class of substances which held massive promise.
Since then, society, politics, and culture have firmly kept psychedelics in the "vices" category, found at music festivals instead of clinics. But today, studies into these drugs have rediscovered their lost potential, riveting researchers and raising hopes for treatment of PTSD, addiction, cluster headaches, and other ills. But convincing an anti-drug society to accept such a radical new viewpoint, and to do so with evidence, ethics, and scientific backing, will take work for scientists and citizens alike.
A history of controversy
Our culture was not always so opposed to the medical use of psychedelics. In the 1950s and 60s, research into psychedelics, then an entirely novel class of drugs, was rapidly accelerating. Researchers examined each drug's effects from every psychotherapeutic angle, offering insights from the lab, the patient's couch, and the doctor's chair. Studies such as the Concord Prison Experiment sought to reduce prisoner recidivism rates through psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, while the Good Friday Experiment investigated the power of its subjectively mystical effects on a receptive group of divinity students.
Although promising, the results from these studies were massively overshadowed by the social upheaval brought throughout the US by their principal investigators, Leary and colleague Richard Alpert. Although the pair began as respected researchers at Harvard, their firing coincided with their choice to promote hallucinogens in unique, and distinctly non-academic, ways.
Leary encouraged LSD use across the country, popularizing the phrase "turn on, tune in, drop out," and raised enough of a ruckus to be deemed "the most dangerous man in America" by then President Richard Nixon. Alpert continued his psychology experiments until he was fired by Harvard, at which point he went on a spiritual quest to India and changed his name to Ram Dass, culminating in the bestselling book, Be Here Now.
The rest is history: the government outlawed all hallucinogens in 1968 and universally squashed research on the substances. In the early 1980s, there was a brief period of psychotherapeutic research into MDMA as it first became known, but recreational use quickly captured the spotlight, and MDMA was classified as a Schedule 1 drug (alongside the likes of heroin) in 1985. Despite this 40-year moratorium on scientific investigation, advocates, researchers, and disciples remained hopeful that psychedelics could help answer many of modern man's ills.
The renaissance begins
It was in this spirit that Rick Doblin founded MAPS, a nonprofit research, education, and advocacy group dedicated to overcoming the obstacles, scientific and legal, that stand between psychedelics and medical acceptance. By any measure, MAPS has been a resounding success; they are the main driver behind what many experts are now calling the “Psychedelic Renaissance.” And we are indeed in a psychedelic renaissance, rediscovering vital knowledge which was criminalized before it could be formalized. MAPS has raised and distributed $20 million dollars to initiate new, scientifically rigorous psychedelic research, and on the back of their promising preliminary results, many additional studies are being funded by a mix of private and public grants.
If you are a proponent of psychedelic medicine, then nearly every major finding, newspaper headline, and governmental reevaluation of recent years has been music to your ears. Initial results from studies have been breathtakingly positive. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy so effectively ameliorates PTSD symptoms in Phase II clinical trials, where drug efficacy and safety is tested, that the FDA has labeled the practice a “breakthrough therapy” and accelerated its movement through their approval process. This combination therapy also appears to help treat social anxiety in adults with autism, a population frustratingly resistant to psychiatric medication.
The classical hallucinogens, Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin, best known as the active ingredient in "magic" mushrooms, can reduce anxiety associated with terminal diseases such as cancer, and they being tested for efficacy in treating both alcohol and nicotine addictions. A strong community of cluster-headache-sufferers swears LSD is the only substance that can break the savagely painful cycles.
Additionally, a group of researchers is hailing ketamine, the dissociative anesthetic, as the biggest breakthrough in depression treatments since SSRIs, now the world's most common antidepressants. Ibogaine, a hallucinogenic substance found in plants native to Africa and the Amazon, seems to almost miraculously relieve people struggling with opioid addictions and may serve as an invaluable tool for overcoming the current crisis. And, of course, marijuana research continues to produce a compelling body of evidence to utilize the drug as a less toxic alternative to pharmaceuticals for a myriad of diseases and disorders.
So why is there such intense skepticism about this group of “drugs” in particular?
Although many of these studies are still in their early phases, the preliminary data overwhelmingly supports the use of psychedelics as targeted medicines, specifically in conjunction with psychotherapy. So why is there such intense skepticism about this group of “drugs” in particular? Why is it that cancer chemotherapies with significant mortality rates and harsh side-effects will readily move through the clinical trial phases and directly into use, but LSD, which has nearly zero recorded overdoses, rarely even achieves study approval?
Cultural war on drugs
The answer is likely buried under 50-plus years of drug prohibition and abstinence-only education in the United States and around the world, a culture that has shaped the negative stigma of all psychedelics. Instead of re-litigating this past, though, researchers in the field are posed at the precipice of progressing forward with revolutionary studies, and may conscientiously move our culture forward with them. But moving the culture will require awareness and action from scientists and citizens.
People on both sides need to be aware of the pre-conceived notions we bring to the debate
First, people on both sides need to be aware of the pre-conceived notions we bring to the debate. Sometimes biases can be instructive – the researchers who first forged this path followed their belief that psychedelics are important and useful, even before they had rigorous evidence to back up their claims. But this faith is a double-edged sword, and we must remain truly willing to reconsider beliefs in light of new evidence, or it will be impossible to convince the broader public to do the same.
Second, researchers in this field have a remarkable opportunity, and responsibility, to properly communicate their findings and recommendations with the public, a task that will be vital for psychedelics to achieve not only medical, but cultural, integration. It is important to remember psychedelics are not the ultimate panacea for treating mental health concerns.
However, with time, and reams of further research, they may become invaluable components of the medical and mental health toolkit at a time when the need for these tools is rising.
Max Planck, the quantum physicist and Nobel laureate, once quipped an apparent law of progress, that “science advances one funeral at a time.” But if we are all able to borrow a page out of the psychedelic playbook, and open our minds to new evidence, ideas, and each other, we might yet revolutionize the relationship between science, society and our daily lives.
CLEVELAND – The Cleveland Cavaliers have signed guard Jordan McRae to a 10-day contract, Cavaliers General Manager David Griffin announced today. The signing of McRae also marks the 22nd GATORADE Call-Up of the NBA's 2015-16 season.
McRae (6-6, 185) was a 2016 NBA Development League All-Star this year after appearing in 29 games (all starts) for the Delaware 87ers and averaging 23.3 points, 4.6 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 1.7 steals in 35.5 minutes per game. Against the Canton Charge on Jan. 26, he scored a D-League record 61 points on 21-34 (.618) shooting from the field, to go along with 11 rebounds and seven assists in 46 minutes. McRae also had two 10-day stints with the Phoenix Suns this season, appearing in seven games with averages of 5.3 points and 1.4 assists in 11.7 minutes.
Originally selected as the 58th overall pick out of the University of Tennessee by the San Antonio Spurs in the 2014 NBA Draft and traded to the Philadelphia 76ers on draft night, McRae played professionally in Australia in 2014-15 before joining Delaware for the season's final 13 games. McRae will be available for today's contest at Washington and will wear jersey number 12.
Rochus Misch (29 July 1917 – 5 September 2013) was a German Oberscharführer (sergeant) in the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH). He was badly wounded during the Polish campaign during the first month of World War II in Europe. After recovering, from 1940 to April 1945, he served in the Führerbegleitkommando (Führer Escort Command; FBK) as a bodyguard, courier, and telephone operator for German dictator Adolf Hitler. He was widely reported in the media as being the last surviving occupant of the Führerbunker when he died in September 2013.
Early life and education [ edit ]
Misch was born on 29 July 1917 in Alt-Schalkowitz near Oppeln (Opole) in the Province of Silesia (now Stare Siołkowice, Poland).[4] His father, a construction worker, died of wounds sustained in World War I. His widowed mother died of pneumonia when he was two and a half, and he grew up with his grandparents. His older brother Bruno died after a swimming accident in May 1922.
Over the objections of the school director, his grandfather took him out of school after eight years as he thought Rochus needed to learn a trade. After several years, Misch moved to Hoyerswerda and became an apprentice with the firm of Schmüller & Model. There he trained as a painter. In 1935, after working as a journeyman painter, Misch attended the Masters' School for Fine Arts in Cologne. After six months, he returned to Hoyerswerda to continue his training. Misch met Gerda, his wife-to-be, in July 1938. They later married on New Year's Eve, 1942.[9] They had a daughter, Brigitta Jacob-Engelken who after the war supported Jewish causes.[10]
Military service [ edit ]
In 1937, Misch received a call-up notice for military service. In Offenberg, he joined the SS-Verfügungstruppe (SS-VT), the predecessor to the Waffen-SS, instead of the German Army as the SS-VT did not require Reichsarbeitsdienst (National Labour Service) time. Along with eleven others, he was selected for Hitler's personal bodyguard unit, the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH). In August 1939, he was promoted to the rank of SS-Rottenführer.
World War II [ edit ]
For the invasion of Poland in September 1939, his regiment was attached to the XIII Army Corps, a part of the 8th Army. Near Warsaw on 24 September, he was one of four men selected by his company commander, then SS-Hauptsturmführer Wilhelm Mohnke to negotiate the surrender of Polish troops during the Battle of Modlin. He was picked because of his ability, although very limited, to speak Polish. After the negotiations failed, the Germans headed back to their lines. When they were about 80 metres from the fort, firing began. Several rounds struck Misch, who fell down and lost consciousness. Some German soldiers carried him to an aid station. Later, he was transferred to two different hospitals. Thereafter, he spent six weeks at a convalescent home. For his actions, Misch was awarded the Iron Cross, Second Class. As Misch was the last living member of his Lower Silesian family, Mohnke recommended him for the Führerbegleitkommando (Führer Escort Command; FBK). This was made up of SS members, including men from the LSSAH, who were not serving on the front lines.
Misch was transferred to the FBK in early May 1940. As a junior member of Hitler's permanent bodyguard, Misch travelled with Hitler throughout the war.[4] When not serving as bodyguards, Misch and the others in the unit served as telephone operators, couriers, orderlies, valets, and waiters.[20] When on duty, the FBK members were the only armed men Hitler allowed to be near him. They never had to surrender their weapon and were never searched when they were with Hitler. It did cause Misch some concern that they were armed only with Walther PPK 7.65 pistols.
On 16 January 1945, following the Wehrmacht's defeat in the Battle of the Bulge, Misch and the rest of Hitler's personal staff moved into the Führerbunker and Vorbunker under the Reich Chancellery garden in Berlin. His FBK commanding officer, Franz Schädle, appointed Misch to be the bunker telephone operator. Misch handled all of the direct communication from the bunker. He did not leave it for any significant period of time until the war ended in May 1945. On 22 April 1945, Schädle called him on the phone and told him there was a place reserved for his wife and young daughter on one of the last planes out of Berlin. Misch was temporarily released from duty and drove to pick up his family to take them to the aircraft. However, his wife refused to take their daughter and leave him and her parents in Berlin. Upon returning to the Reich Chancellery, Misch learned that Hitler was releasing most of the remaining staff to leave Berlin. By that date, as the Red Army was entering Berlin, propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and his wife Magda brought their six young children to stay in the Vorbunker. Joseph Goebbels moved into the room next to Misch's telephone exchange in the lower level of the Führerbunker. The Goebbels children would play in the corridor around Misch's post.
On 30 April, the Soviets were less than 500 metres (1,600 ft) from the bunker. That afternoon, Hitler and Eva Braun committed suicide fewer than 40 hours after they were married. Misch witnessed the discovery of the bodies of Hitler and Braun. He followed Otto Günsche and Hitler's chief valet Heinz Linge to the door of Hitler's private room. After the door was opened, Misch only took a quick "glance". He saw Eva, with her legs drawn up, to Hitler's left on the sofa. Her eyes were open and she was dead. Hitler was also dead. He was either sitting on the sofa or in the armchair by it; his head "had fallen forward slightly". Misch started to leave to report the events to Schädle, but then stopped and returned to the door of Hitler's study. By then Misch observed that Hitler's corpse had been removed from inside the study and wrapped in a blanket. Several men then picked it up and carried it past him. Misch left and reported the events to Schädle, who instructed him to return to his duty station. After returning to the telephone exchange, Misch later recalled Unterscharführer Retzbach proclaiming "So they're burning the boss now!" Retzbach asked Misch if he was going upstairs to watch the events, but Misch declined to go. Thereafter, Günsche came down and told Misch that the corpses of Hitler and Braun had been burned in the garden of the Reich Chancellery.
Misch was present in the bunker complex when Magda Goebbels poisoned her six children and then committed suicide with her husband Joseph on 1 May 1945. According to Misch, this act by the Goebbels' of murdering their children was most unsettling. Years later he stated that event was the "most dreadful thing" he experienced in the bunker.
Prior to his suicide, Joseph Goebbels finally released Misch from further service; he was free to leave. Misch and mechanic Johannes Hentschel were two of the last people remaining in the bunker. They exchanged letters to their wives in case anything happened to either of them. Misch then went upstairs through the cellars of the Reich Chancellery to where Schädle had his office to report one last time. According to Hentschel, by that time Schädle's shrapnel leg wound had turned gangrenous. Misch told Schädle that Goebbels had released him. Schädle told Misch of the route he should take to try to get through the Soviet encirclement of the area. After helping Misch, Schädle shot himself. Misch fled the bunker in the early morning of 2 May, only hours before the Red Army seized it. He met up with some other soldiers and they travelled north through the U-Bahn tunnels. Shortly thereafter, they were taken prisoner by Red Army soldiers. Misch was brought to Lubyanka Prison in Moscow, where he was tortured by Soviet NKVD officers in an attempt to extract information regarding Hitler's last days. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was extremely interested in learning of Hitler's fate and theories about possible escape. Misch spent eight years in Soviet forced labour camps.[4][20]
Later life and death [ edit ]
After his release from captivity in 1953, Misch returned to what was then West Berlin. He arrived home on 31 December to the house which was 3.2 kilometres (2.0 mi) from the Führerbunker.[10] At the time, Misch's wife worked as a teacher in Neukölln. Misch struggled for several years with what to do with his life after captivity. He was offered various odd jobs, among others as a porter in a hospital and as a driver. Most of these job offers were through his wartime contacts, and required moving away from Berlin, which his wife refused to do. He finally obtained a loan backed by wealthy German philanthropists to buy out a painting and interior decorating shop from a retiree in Berlin. He ran this modest business successfully, and during the early Allied occupation of Berlin also became involved in the making of peanut butter for US soldiers. The business had been started by Misch's old friend, Adolf Kleinholdermann. This sideline business became so successful that Misch considered leaving his shop. His wife convinced him to remain in the painting and interior decorating business. In 1975, Gerda was elected to the parliament of West Berlin in which she served for several years. Years later, Gerda developed Alzheimer's and died in 1998. Misch continued to manage his shop until his retirement at age 68 in 1985.
Misch was loyal to Hitler to the end of his life, stating in Nazi apologia, "He was no brute. He was no monster. He was no superman", "...very normal. Not like what is written", and "[h]e was a wonderful boss".[4] Misch's daughter, Brigitta, learned through her maternal grandmother that Gerda was of Jewish descent. However, Gerda never mentioned it and her father refused to acknowledge it. Brigitta became an architect and has supported Jewish causes.[10] Brigitta stated that she was disappointed by her father's lack of remorse after the war.[10]
After the release of the 2004 German film Downfall (Der Untergang) in France, French journalist Nicolas Bourcier interviewed Misch on multiple occasions during 2005. The resulting biography was published in French as J'étais garde du corps d'Hitler 1940–1945 (I was Hitler's bodyguard 1940–1945) in March 2006, ISBN 2253121541. Translations were released in South America, Japan, Spain, Poland, Turkey, and Germany in 2006 and 2007. Misch served as consultant to writer Christopher McQuarrie on the 2008 film Valkyrie, a Hollywood depiction of the 20 July plot.
In a 2005 interview, Misch called Downfall "Americanized" while comparing what happened in the film to what happened in real life, stating that although it portrayed the important facts accurately, it exaggerated other details for dramatic effect, such as the film's characters screaming and shouting when in his recollection most people in the bunker spoke quietly.[57] In the interview he also expressed some skepticism regarding Hitler's role in Nazi atrocities,[57] stating that "Neo-Nazis" did not exist but were rather just patriotic people who cared about their countries' well-being,[57] and that the US invaded Iraq in 2003 to enrich Israel.[57]
After listening to an 11-minute recording of Hitler in private conversation with Finnish Field Marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, Misch opined:
"He is speaking normally, but I'm having problems with the tone; the intonation isn't quite right. Sometimes it seems okay, but at other points not. I have the feeling it's someone mimicking Hitler... It really sounds as if someone 'is' mimicking him."[58] — Rochus Misch
With the deaths of Bernd von Freytag-Loringhoven on 27 February 2007, Armin Lehmann on 10 October 2008, and Siegfried Knappe on 1 December 2008, Misch was said to be the last survivor of the Führerbunker.[4][59] His memoir in German, Der letzte Zeuge ("The Last Witness"), was published in 2008.[60] The English edition was published in 2014 with an introduction by historian Roger Moorhouse. Misch lived in Berlin in the same house he moved into when he was released by the Soviets.[4] The house is in the district of Rudow in South Berlin. Misch regularly received visitors who wished to speak to or interview him.[20][62] Misch died in Berlin on 5 September 2013 at the age of 96.

My name is Nate Jones and I have always dreamed of being an Olympic Champion! I remember when I was first learning to write, my parents gave me a Dr. Seuss book called “My Book About Me,” where you write about yourself. The book asked me to fill in how many teeth I had, how many doors were in my house, etc. When I got to filling in what I wanted to be when I grew up, I asked my dad “what is the best thing you can do in archery?” He quickly responded, “Be an Olympic Archer.” Ever since that moment, I knew this was my path and I am ready to turn my dream into a reality.It has been a long road filled with years of hard training, sacrifice, personal growth, and tens of thousands of arrows. However, I do not journey alone! Along the way I have found support in my family and friends, and most recently, the strength and drive from my wife Jonelle. I appreciate you being a part of my journey, and here is how you can help.I have three specific archery goals:1. Qualify for Team USA2. Become a resident archer at the USA Archery Training Center3. Win a Gold Medal at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, BrazilTo pay for coaching, travel to tournaments, tournament entry fees, and equipment, I need your help. Additionally, I also spend a large amount of time training; therefore I need to subsidize income since a part-time job does not cover all the expenses. As a college student, it has been challenging to balance my academics, work, and archery training.I am currently gearing up for a strong summer season and plan to compete in 5 large national tournaments. Every cent will help me achieve my goal and ease the financial burden on myself and my loved ones.Voyager Cup: Anoka, Minnesota136th USA Outdoor Nationals / U.S. Open: Decatur, AlabamaUSA Team Qualifier Arizona Cup: Phoenix, ArizonaUSA Team Qualifier SoCal Showdown: Chula Vista, CaliforniaUSA Team Qualifier Gator Cup: Newberry, FloridaUSA Team Qualifier Texas Shootout: College Station, TexasI truly hope that on my journey toward my Olympic dream I can instill a passion for archery in everyone I meet.

The Green Bay Packers are bringing in an old backup to help with their quarterback problems.
The Packers announced Tuesday that they had signed quarterback Matt Flynn. ESPN.com's Adam Schefter first reported the pending signing.
The move to bring in Aaron Rodgers' former backup came two days after the Packers' quarterback situation got increasingly complicated.
Seneca Wallace, who started Sunday's 27-13 loss against the Philadelphia Eagles, was injured early in the first quarter. Scott Tolzien, who was on the Packers' practice squad until last week, finished out the game.
The 26-year-old Tolzien completed 24 of 39 passes for 280 yards while throwing one touchdown and two interceptions. Packers head coach Mike McCarthy said Sunday that Tolzien would be the team's starter next week against the New York Giants.
MCKNIGHT: Breaking Real Bad: Inside the Sam Hurd drug case
The Packers are expected to need to manage about four-to-six weeks without Rodgers, who broke his left collarbone in a loss against the Chicago Bears last week.
Flynn spent the first four seasons of his NFL career in Green Bay, where he had success as Rodgers' backup. He signed a three-year, $26 million free agent deal with the Seattle Seahawks in 2012, only to lose the battle for the starting job to rookie Russell Wilson. Flynn, 28, has been released by the Oakland Raiders and Buffalo Bills this year.
The Packers have lost two straight and now sit a game behind the Detroit Lions in the NFC North.

LUCKNOW: In a bid to introduce a people-connect with heritage and history, the state tourism department has decided to include Heritage Trails in school curriculum. This would be done as a part of steps being taken to promote heritage education programmes in schools. It is expected to begin with Lucknow where participation of schoolchildren in Lucknow Heritage Walk would be made mandatory.A proposal to this effect is awaiting clearance from the chief minister's office. Once cleared, relevant orders would be passed to primary and secondary education departments. Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) already has a similar programme running successfully since 2011. For other districts, heritage trails would include visit to the heritage monument in their districts.Talking to TOI on Tuesday, director general, UP Tourism Amrit Abhijat said: "Participation in heritage walks at least once a year would be made mandatory for schools so that the children get a chance to understand the relevance of our heritage. Walks have been chosen for this because they present different pieces of history in a story-telling manner which can make the experience memorable and interesting."Abhijat informed that success of the Lucknow Heritage Walk compelled them to take the step. "We get at least 3-5 persons ready to participate in the heritage walk every day even in this sweltering weather," he said adding that the model is being replicated in other important districts as well. "We have just signed a memorandum of understanding with a consultant on Varanasi heritage walk while process for Agra and Allahabad is under way," he said.Smita Vats, founder director from Educational Trust Indian Traditions and Heritage Society ( ITIHAAS ), which has been instrumental in getting CBSE mandate on inclusion of heritage in curriculum, says: "Heritage is a resource which needs a sense of belongingness to survive. Children are the best brains to be sensitized for the cause so that they grow up as adults who take care of their community legacy which has survived in the form of tangible and non-tangible elements of history."
Philadelphia Union announced Thursday it has agreed to terms with midfielder Eric Bird. Drafted with the No. 41 overall pick in the 2015 MLS SuperDraft, Bird was a two-year captain for the University of Virginia and help lead the Cavaliers to a national championship in 2014. Per club and league policy, terms of the deal were not disclosed.
“Eric is a proven winner and he's exactly the kind of player we want to have in our locker room,” technical director Chris Albright said. “He's done extremely well at the highest collegiate level and we're confident in his ability to transition to MLS.”
Bird, 21, was the second selection the Union made in the 2015 SuperDraft. At Virginia, he played in 75 games, with 69 starts over his four-year career. He was a two-time NSCAA All-American – a third-team selection in 2013 and a second-team selection in 2014 – leading the Cavaliers to the NCAA College Cup in both seasons and ultimately winning it in 2014. He finished his career at Virginia with 15 goals and 10 assists.
“It's an honor and a blessing to sign with Philadelphia Union,” Bird said. “I've worked my entire life to get to this point and I couldn't be happier with the opportunity. I want to give all my glory to God as he has made this all possible. And I also want to express my deepest gratitude to my family, friend, teammates, coaches and everyone that's helped along this journey.”
The Union continue the 2015 MLS Regular Season against Real Salt Lake at Rio Tinto Staidum on Saturday at 9:30 p.m., broadcast on The Comcast Network.

The figures in the chart below are not actual results. They are estimates based on an Upshot/Siena College poll that showed Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump tied. Our estimate of the final vote, based on an Upshot/Siena College poll of North Carolina voters and what we know about the early vote Hillary Clinton Voted early Voting later Donald J. Trump Voted early Voting later
There aren't many states more important this November than North Carolina, a rapidly changing state crucial to Donald J. Trump's hopes of winning the White House and to Democrats' hopes of winning the Senate. If Mr. Trump does not win the state, his path to the presidency, already narrow, becomes nearly impossible.
There also aren't many states with better election data than North Carolina. The state releases detailed, individual-level information on every voter in the state. It even publishes a daily account of who has voted early, either in person or by mail.
To get a better sense of what's going on, we're trying an experiment: We're estimating the result of the early vote and the Election Day vote by combining the rich data released by North Carolina with data from the Upshot/Siena survey of North Carolina.
The Upshot/Siena poll data drives these estimates. We've matched all 2,400 respondents from our three North Carolina surveys to the state's voter data, and we've then estimated how every voter in the state of North Carolina is likely to vote.
In doing so, we've also untangled how voters have shifted over our three surveys, then estimated how they would vote today. The results, in other words, are drawn from data pooled from all three surveys, but reflect the race as it was in the weekend before the election, when our final poll showed a tied race
So far, here are our best estimates:
Already, about people have voted in North Carolina, out of about we think will eventually vote. Based on the voting history and demographic characteristics of those people, we think Hillary Clinton leads in North Carolina by about . We think she has an even larger lead – – among people who have already voted.
Here's a breakdown of those estimates for the two major-party candidates:
In raw votes As a pct. Clinton Trump Already voted Yet to vote Total estimates
Our polling data indicates that Mrs. Clinton has built a considerable lead in the early vote. The people who have turned out are even more supportive of her than one would guess from their demographic characteristics. But the voters who are left strongly support Mr. Trump. Whether enough of them turn out will decide the election.
These aren't official results. They're just estimates. If our polling is wrong, then our conclusions could be wrong as well.
Even if our polling is pretty good, there's still uncertainty: Undecided voters and the supporters of Gary Johnson pose as much of a challenge for this project as they do for a typical survey. But by the end of the early vote, one of the biggest sources of uncertainty in polling – the composition of the electorate – will be greatly diminished.
The tight race represents a big shift from our earlier estimates. Those were based on our previous poll of North Carolina, which showed Mrs. Clinton ahead by seven points. The race has tightened since then, according to both our poll and other surveys of the state and nationwide.
The biggest factor is that Mr. Trump has made big gains among white and Republican-leaning voters over the last few weeks. The support of Gary Johnson has plummeted as well, falling to 3 percent from 8 percent in our last poll.
How many people have voted, and how many we think are yet to vote And how our estimates of the final vote have changed
These estimates have not shifted much because of the turnout. In general, the composition of the electorate has not meaningfully shifted in early voting.
Below, our estimates of the vote in North Carolina across different groups of voters.
By race
From the roughly early votes: Race Hillary Clinton Donald Trump White 70% of early voters 35% 62% Black 22% 95% 4% Hispanic 2% 76% 20% Other 6% 79% 19% From the roughly votes yet to be cast: Race Hillary Clinton Donald Trump White 72% of votes remaining 29% 65% Black 20% 90% 8% Hispanic 2% 60% 33% Other 6% 50% 45% Our best guess at the final vote in North Carolina: Race Hillary Clinton Donald Trump White 71% of all voters 33% 63% Black 21% 94% 5% Hispanic 2% 70% 25% Other 6% 69% 28%
At the start of early voting, we estimated that 71 percent of the final overall total of voters would be white and that 21.4 percent would be non-Hispanic black.
These pre-early-voting estimates were strictly based on vote history. A 45-year-old white person who voted only in 2012 and a 45-year-old black person who voted only in 2012 were given an equal chance of voting in our forecasting.
In practice, vote history isn't the only factor that determines turnout. In recent elections, black voters in North Carolina have been likelier to vote than white voters with the same vote history. For this particular project, our estimates started out agnostic on whether black or white voters would turn out in greater numbers than their vote history suggests. The turnout should speak for itself.
If early voting had gone as it did in 2012, our estimate for the black share of the electorate would have gradually increased if infrequent and even previously unregistered black voters showed up in disproportionate numbers.
But black voters did not turn out anywhere near the same rate as they did in 2012. They represented 22 percent of early voters, down from 27 percent of the early vote in 2012.
As a result, our estimate for the eventual black share of the electorate has stayed steady at 21.4 percent. This would be a significantly smaller percentage than in 2012, when black voters represented 23 percent of the electorate.
By vote history
From the roughly early votes: Voted in 2014? Hillary Clinton Donald Trump Did not vote 43% of early voters 55% 42% Voted in 2014 57% 50% 49% From the roughly votes yet to be cast: Voted in 2014? Hillary Clinton Donald Trump Did not vote 46% of votes remaining 46% 46% Voted in 2014 54% 40% 56% Our best guess at the final vote in North Carolina: Voted in 2014? Hillary Clinton Donald Trump Did not vote 44% of all voters 52% 43% Voted in 2014 56% 47% 51%
Every vote counts, but not every vote tells us as much about who is winning the early vote.
There are some people who are all but sure to vote: They participate in just about every election. If they vote early, it doesn't really change our view of the race. But if a voter whom we don't expect to vote shows up, that moves the numbers. That's what the campaigns are trying to do, too: They're trying to get their less likely supporters to the polls.
One easy way to get a sense of whether infrequent voters are turning out is to look at whether they participated in the 2014 midterm election
We believe these voters will make up 44 percent of the electorate, and they support Mrs. Clinton by an eight-point margin.
By age
From the roughly early votes: Age group Hillary Clinton Donald Trump 18 to 29 13% of early voters 61% 35% 30 to 44 20% 56% 40% 45 to 64 39% 50% 48% 65 and older 27% 48% 51% From the roughly votes yet to be cast: Age group Hillary Clinton Donald Trump 18 to 29 18% of votes remaining 51% 40% 30 to 44 24% 44% 48% 45 to 64 37% 40% 56% 65 and older 20% 39% 58% Our best guess at the final vote in North Carolina: Age group Hillary Clinton Donald Trump 18 to 29 15% of all voters 57% 37% 30 to 44 21% 51% 43% 45 to 64 39% 47% 51% 65 and older 25% 45% 53%
Mrs. Clinton has a big lead among young voters, but our polling data suggests that the young voters who support her have been far likelier to vote early than those who oppose her.
Our model doesn't suppose that trend will continue on Election Day. If it does, it could help her at the margins.
By party
From the roughly early votes: Party Hillary Clinton Donald Trump Democratic 42% of early voters 84% 14% Republican 32% 10% 88% Other 26% 51% 45% From the roughly votes yet to be cast: Party Hillary Clinton Donald Trump Democratic 37% of votes remaining 72% 24% Republican 33% 12% 82% Other 29% 40% 52% Our best guess at the final vote in North Carolina: Party Hillary Clinton Donald Trump Democratic 40% of all voters 80% 17% Republican 32% 11% 86% Other 27% 47% 48%
Democrats have a longstanding voter registration advantage in North Carolina, but a significant slice of them are conservative, older white Democrats who have been voting Republican in presidential elections.
There isn't a realistic scenario in which registered Republicans would outnumber registered Democrats in the final count. That's especially true in early voting, which is traditionally used more by Democrats than by Republicans.
In 2012, Democrats had an edge of 48 percent to 32 percent in party registration among early voters, and a 44-33 edge in the final count. Since then, the Democratic registration edge statewide has diminished, in large part as older conservatives have switched to the Republicans. At the same time, newly registered voters who support Democrats have been far likelier to register without affiliating with a party.
As a result, the expected Democratic registration edge is somewhat smaller than in the past: 40 percent to 32 percent for the Democrats.
It's a sign of how far Anthony Martial had flown under the radar that Wayne Rooney had to find out who he was when news emerged of Manchester United's interest in the teenager last summer.
Rooney approached Martial's French compatriot Morgan Schneiderlin for information during United's flight back from Swansea in August, and filled in the gaps on Google.
Nine months on, everyone knows Martial. Sitting down at United's Carrington training ground, very much part of the furniture and looking forward to an FA Cup final in his first season in England, he smiles about the Rooney tale.

Wayne Rooney (right) had to Google Martial before he arrived... but he certainly knows who he is now
'Well, he knows me now doesn't he!' says Martial, aware that United's captain was not the only one bemused by the club's decision to spend an initial £36million on a relatively little known forward from France.
'I've heard that story. I guess it's pretty amusing,' he says. 'I don't know whether it's true but it doesn't bother me at all.
'It's not a case of proving anything to other people. I don't pay too much attention to that. I want to prove to myself that I can succeed.'
Many questioned United's wisdom in allowing experienced strikers such as Javier Hernandez, Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao to leave while putting so much expectation on Martial's young shoulders.
The deal with Monaco, which could rise to £58m, made him the most expensive teenager in world football. He had moved there from Lyon only two years earlier for £4.4m after four first-team appearances.
Martial, shy off the pitch and remarkably calm on it, turned 20 only in December and has taken it all in his stride. The final will be his 49th game of a season in which he has scored 17 times.

I'd love to be an icon but I'll need to score a lot of goals
That total includes a dramatic late winner in the semi-final against Everton last month. Martial is the man Crystal Palace will fear most on his return to Wembley on Saturday.
'I didn't try to put too much pressure on myself,' he says. 'Obviously, people mention the price tag but I just came here to do my best. What helped was that I'd already gone through quite an expensive transfer in the past when I moved from Lyon to Monaco.
'I just tried to remain true to who I am as a person. I've always been quite calm and relaxed, and had confidence in my ability.
'Things have gone relatively well but I feel deep down I could have done better. I hope things will go even better next season.'
Even for a player renowned for his speed, Martial has adapted incredibly quickly. He scored four goals in his first four games — including a brilliant effort on his debut against Liverpool at Old Trafford in September. It is, he says without hesitation, still his favourite.

'It just couldn't have been a better way to start. From being a kid I'd dreamed of playing at Old Trafford and to score in my first game in such a way against United's biggest rival — it couldn't have turned out better.
'It freed me up and helped me settle in. I drew a lot of confidence from scoring. Fortunately, things started to go well from that moment and I kept scoring regularly.'
And it's not just goals. His assists are also vital to Louis van Gaal's side, terrorising defences down the left with quick feet and devastating acceleration.
Martial prefers to play through the middle but his versatility has drawn comparisons to Thierry Henry, who graduated from the same Paris-based club, CO Les Ulis. So, too, the cool demeanour and clinical eye for goal. Paul Scholes has gone so far as to say Martial doesn't 'look bothered' if he scores.
'I'd heard that,' he says. 'Not happy when I score? Scoring makes me happiest because it's what it's all about. I'm really happy inside but I'm not a guy who shows that sort of emotion on the outside too much.'

Now an integral part of France's squad for Euro 2016, Martial has been linked with a return to Paris Saint-Germain but insists he is happy in Manchester. The fans have taken to him, even though it is too early to bestow the legendary status enjoyed by another famous Frenchman.
Eric Cantona scored the winner to beat Liverpool in the 1996 final and Martial would gladly settle for a similar outcome against Palace.
'I love Manchester and see myself being here for a good while yet,' he says. 'If I was to become an icon I'd be very happy but you can't possibly say at this stage. It depends on how I play, how many goals I score and how I perform in the years to come.
'I'll need to score a lot of goals and the team will need to pick up trophies. We're going to do everything we can to bring the FA Cup back to Manchester.'

NEW ORLEANS -- Former New Orleans Police Supt. Richard Pennington, who is credited with reforming the NOPD in the 1990's and tried to parlay that success into a run for mayor of the city, has died in Atlanta. He was 69.
Pennington suffered a stroke in 2010, after retiring as chief of the Atlanta Police Department. He left New Orleans for Atlanta in 2002. Though he was popular as police chief here, he lost to Ray Nagin in the 2002 mayoral election.
His former Deputy Chief Ronal Serpas said Pennington had been in declining health and became more seriously ill several weeks ago.
“Richard was a two-time, big-city police change agent. And that's hard to do,” Serpas said. “He was a mentor who had a huge impact on my career and made lasting contributions to the NOPD and New Orleans.”

Former Mayor Marc Morial tapped Pennington to serve as the city's police superintendent during his two terms in City Hall. He came to New Orleans from the Washington, D.C. police department and a national search identified him as a top prospect for the NOPD.
Pennington inherited the top job at a police agency that was plagued by corruption, in a city where violent crime and murder rate had skyrocketed in the late 1980s. When he took office, the murder rate was at 424, the highest in modern history.
As Pennington was being sworn into office at Gallier Hall in October 1994, he received word that federal agents were investigating a ring of corrupt officers, including Len Davis, who is now serving a death sentence for orchestrating a hit on Kim Groves, a woman who had filed a brutality complaint against him.
“I thought, my Lord, what am I getting myself into?” Pennington said years later.
After he came into office in 1994, he instituted a series of reforms within the department. That included strengthening the NOPD Public Integrity Bureau, outlawing off-duty detail work at bars and strip clubs, and prohibiting the hiring of people with criminal records.
He also implemented the crime trend monitoring system known as COMSTAT. The number of homicides fell to 158 just five years later.
"We've made some dramatic changes, dramatic improvements," he told The Times-Picayune in 2002 as he left office. "I would say the situation is 100 percent better than it was eight years ago."
His popularity after leaving the NOPD in 2002 prompted him to run for mayor. He finished second to Ray Nagin in the primary and then ultimately lost in the runoff election.
Born in Little Rock Arkansas, Pennington grew up in Gary, Indiana and was a Vietnam War veteran. He began his law enforcement career with the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia, eventually rising to the role of assistant chief.
After leaving New Orleans in 2002, Pennington became chief of the Atlanta Police Department, where he served until 2009.

Donald Trump today announced that he's withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate agreement, breaking ranks with 190 other countries on the question of what to do about climate change.
As with so many other issues -- military might, moral authority, economic prowess -- this appears at first blush to be a simple question of American exceptionalism. The rest of the world does one thing and we do another, because we're America and we're Number One.
But climate politics aren't as much about American exceptionalism as they are about American Republican exceptionalism. Consider this: in 2015 the Pew Research Center polled 40 of the world's countries on six different continents, asking people who lived there what they thought about climate change.
About 45 percent of Americans told the pollsters they thought global climate change was a "very serious" problem. That share's not to far away from the global median of 54 percent across all 54 countries surveyed. But look what happens when you break out American Democrats and Republicans separately.
Democrats, of course, are much more likely to be concerned about climate change: 68 percent say it's a very serious problem, in line with numbers from developing nations where people tend to be more worried about these things.
But only 20 percent of Republicans say it's very serious. If American Republicans were a country, they'd be be virtually indistinguishable from people in Poland and China on the question of climate indifference.
Put it another way: American Democrats are about 14 percentage points away from the global median on their climate concern. But Republicans are a stunning 34 points away from the center.
You could probably run a similar analysis for conservative/liberal parties in other countries, and indeed, Pew did it for a couple other wealthy democracies and found similar partisan gaps.
Still, the fact stands that whatever partisan splits on climate concern exist elsewhere, literally every single other country in the world (Nicaragua and Syria excepted) went ahead and ratified the Paris agreement. So on that measure at least, U.S. Republicans have had more success bending policy to their will than conservatives in other countries.
As the National League North side prepare to take on AFC Wimbledon in the FA Cup the striker has learned how to cope with his release by Liverpool
Friday afternoon at a Liverpool city centre hotel and Adam Morgan is speaking enthusiastically about life at Curzon Ashton. The goals are flowing for the striker and so is he in his praise of the National League North side and belief before Sunday's FA Cup second-round tie against AFC Wimbledon that they can cause an upset by beating opponents who sit three divisions and 81 places above them.
Suddenly, Morgan's mood changes. Looking over his shoulder in the ground-floor coffee shop-cum-bar, the 22-year-old becomes briefly but noticeably embarrassed. A woman is walking over. It's his mum.
Maxine Morgan takes a seat at a nearby table and waits patiently for her son to finish this interview. They are going on a shopping trip straight afterwards, but her presence is also symbolic, representing the support Adam has required during the past four years, a period when he has gone from the high of making his debut for his boyhood club, Liverpool, to the low of falling so out of love with football that he came close to quitting.
At the end of a week when Ben Woodburn announced himself as Anfield's latest goalscoring prodigy, Morgan's story shows just how perilous the road ahead can be for young talents at the highest level. He describes what happened to him as a downward spiral and it is only now, with the help of loved ones and having joined a club where he feels truly appreciated, that Morgan is on the up.

“Everyone at Curzon has been great,” he says. “They've took the pressure off me. Normally, when I've gone somewhere there's been a win-at-all-costs mentality, but that's not the case there. We play with freedom and I've been given a licence to express myself. The manager's told me to go out and do what I do best, which is score goals.”
There have been six in six appearances (three of which have been starts) since Morgan arrived at Curzon in October, including two in the 3-1 victory over Westfields that secured the club's place in the second round of the FA Cup for the second time in their history. Morgan is seen as a key figure in Curzon's efforts to make the third round for the first time, his potency in front of a goal a reminder of the talent that marked him out as a prospect at Liverpool.
Having joined the club at the age of five, Morgan was a prolific goalscorer at youth level, scoring 18 times in 16 games during the 2010-11 FA Premier Academy season. That led to Robbie Fowler hailing the boy from Halewood as “one of the best finishers I've seen for a long time”.
Morgan made his first-team debut in a Europa League first-leg qualifying tie against Hearts in August 2012. Morgan, who grew up following Liverpool home and away with his father, Shaun, remembers the moment with joyful clarity. “The night before we were training on the pitch at Tynecastle and Andy Carroll said to me that he was pulling out, so I was going to be on the bench,” he says. “I didn't know officially until three hours before the game when Brendan Rodgers named the squad – and I was on the bench.
“I replaced Fabio Borini for the last couple of minutes and I don't think I've ever taken a jacket off as quick. It was special, the best feeling in the world.”
A week later Morgan, who represented England at the 2011 Under-17 World Cup in Mexico, was handed his first start in the return leg, which meant playing at Anfield in a team containing Jamie Carragher, Steven Gerrard and Luis Suárez. “It was our strongest lineup at the time and to be part of it made me so proud,” says Morgan. “And it meant a lot to my dad – to see your son walk out for the team you love, at Anfield, was fantastic for him. A few tears were shed in our house that night.”

There were tears of a different kind after Morgan was informed by Rodgers that his Liverpool career was over having played one more time for the club, in another Europa League match against Anzhi Makhachkala.
The circumstances were brutal in more ways than one – Rodgers instructed centre-back Martin Skrtel to go against Morgan during a training session and intentionally rough him up. The striker struggled to compete and was told by Rodgers that it served as proof he was physically not cut out to be a Premier League player. “His decision wasn't off the back of that one session but what happened with Skrtel emphasised his reasoning,” Morgan says. “And he was right – I wasn't ready to play in the Premier League. But I would've liked to have signed a new contract and gone out on loan. Instead, the manager said I could leave altogether.”
Morgan holds no ill-feelings against Rodgers – “I'll never say a bad word against Brendan, he made my dreams come true” – but there is no hiding his sense of devastation at being shown the door at Liverpool after three appearances and no goals. “I sat in my car at Melwood [Liverpool's training ground] and cried my eyes out,” he says. “It was also really tough for my dad. He's travelled everywhere to see me play. One time with Liverpool, when I was 15, we played a tournament in Italy and he drove there on his own. That's how much my career means to him and seeing me reach the top and then fall down the levels hurt him.”
Morgan joined Yeovil Town in November 2013 on loan with a long-term deal in place for the following January. He struggled to make an impact and after a brief loan spell at St Johnstone, agreed a pay-off with Yeovil in June 2015 after scoring once in 19 appearances with rumours that his focus was more on having a good time off the pitch than on it. “I didn't do one bad thing at Yeovil,” Morgan says. “For starters, there's nothing to do down there to get you in trouble.”
There then followed a spell at Accrington Stanley where Morgan played 21 minutes across three appearances before he found himself without a club and training purely for fitness at non-league Hemel Hempstead and Colywn Bay. “After what happened at Liverpool I'd stopped enjoying football,” he says. “It was disappointment, anger and heartbreak rolled into one and that hits you hard. I was close [to quitting]. I looked into courses but my family and my girlfriend kept on telling me I had the talent to make a living out of football and shouldn't give up.”
Morgan heeded that advice and after a chat with his long-time friend and Curzon midfielder Luke Clark, he signed for the club – who were playing in the Manchester League in 1978 – on a week-by-week contract. Life in English football's sixth tier takes some getting used to for someone who once existed at elite level but Morgan has embraced the contrast. “At Liverpool, there were five or six physios, two masseurs, a state of the art gym … whereas at Curzon you wash your own training gear and bring your own boots,” he says. “But I come from a working-class family and haven't been brought up to depend on other people. Also, I love that the fans sit with us on the coach to away games.”
Training two evenings a week means Morgan has a fair amount of time on his hands and his dad has suggested he could keep himself busy by doing shifts at his minicab company, Wiggys Wheels. Morgan has declined the offer, with his focus on continuing to score goals for John Flanagan's side, which has been aided by namesake and fellow Liverpool academy graduate Jon Flanagan.
“I'm good mates with Jon and sent him a picture of my boots, which weren't the best, alongside a message that said: ‘Lad, sort me with a pair',” says Morgan. “He gave me a few and said one pair were magic. They're my match boots and I've been scoring in them every week.”
Morgan will aim to do so again on Sunday in a match that should end in an obvious winner given it is 16th in the National League North versus seventh in League One. But with the tie being held at the Tameside Stadium, where the majority of the capacity 4,200 crowds are sure to be vociferous in their support of Curzon, a shock cannot be ruled out.
That the match is being televised also provides Morgan with an opportunity to remind a wider audience of his qualities. “I believe I can play in the Championship,” he says. “But I'm not thinking too big. All I want to do right now is enjoy my football.
“These past few years have made me a man. When I made my debut for Liverpool, I wasn't mentally tough enough [to be a footballer] – a little thing would hurt me for a week and a big thing would hurt me for a month. It's taken a lot of soul searching and the love of the people around me, but I've finally got my head right and if I have a setback now, I know how to deal with it.”
The return to the workroom this week leaves everyone with a lightness in their step, as if they've just removed a fake pregnancy belly made of insecurity-fueled rage. When Alyssa says that the decision was “unanimous,” she isn't just talking about the fact that she and Tatianna agreed: she means that everyone watching at home was frantically reaching for the White-Out to scrawl “Phi Phi” on the nearest tube of lipstick. And it worked! Just like The Craft taught us: if you and your friends all want the same thing at the same time, then your wish comes true. Unfortunate side effect: one of you might turn heel and make some villainous choices. Let's hope none of our girls is susceptible to the draw of the Dark Side…
By the next day, though, no one seems to have gone ‘90s goth (not that I would challenge that shift from a fashion perspective). In fact, the only retro element of the process is the reintroduction of the long-lost mini-challenge. Mama Ru has sponsors to please, so we're treated to a lightning-fast edit of a ridiculous golf game that probably felt interminable in real time, all so that Andrew Christian can remind the viewing audience (half of whom are already wearing his neon, assless creations) to buy expensive-yet-barely-there go-go boy underpants. Scruff isn't explicitly mentioned, but their participation is heavily implied since most of the models have nice torsos and no faces. Alaska wins the game, and as a prize is given the opportunity to advertise the people who make Ru's suits.
All that corporate shilling, it turns out, was actually thematically important to the episode's main task: the six remaining queens will develop a product prototype and make a commercial for it. To help them with this process, Ru brings in Marcus Lemonis, then repeats his name several times so that the queens in the room won't forget it and the viewers at home can quickly Google him. His low level of fame and complete lack of drag knowledge make him the least convincing expert the show has ever booked; Katya is so underwhelmed by his presence that when he says her idea is a disaster that needs to be rebuilt from the ground up, she makes zero changes to her original concept.
To give World of Wonder credit: the shooting-the-commercial segments are less forced than I expected. Everyone has a couple slips but more or less seems to deliver because they are, after all, professionals in the top of their field. They're also all friends, as the getting-ready-for-the-runway montage proves. Some of them are, of course, closer than others; Katya waxes poetic about the importance of having a select few ride-or-die bitches who can be real with you, while Rolaskatox hugs it out over how special and lasting their bond is and how happy they are that it totally won't affect the competition at all. AT ALL. Whatever, I really want to explore more about the circle of close Judies that exist entirely to call Katya out, because I feel like her conflation of love and criticism says a lot about her.
The main stage theme of PANTS inspires another round of brilliance from everyone involved. Perpetually bootylicious Roxxxy serves up some Studio 54-26-54 realness, while Katya uses a yellow pump and an unnerving amount of confidence to turn an alien extra's costume on Star Trek: Voyager into the highest of fashion. Alyssa is in a similar boat: the only cohesive thing about her various garments is that they're all black, but any randomly generated outfit becomes inspirational when positioned below her beautiful, crazy face. The runway is and always will be Detox's domain, and her capri creation looks like a million bucks. Alaska knows that to make America great again, we just need more fringe. But the most scream-inducing moment of the night (at least by the barometer of the screaming queers I watch with) is Tati's homage to T-Boz, which gave my retinas such a deep, delicious fuck that I needed Left Eye's condom glasses. (Rest in peace, Lisa.)
I normally wouldn't be excited about a show to devote this much of its running time to commercials, but I can't wait to see what the ladies have created. (Note to all businesses: book drag queens for your commercials. I'm available and cost-effective.) Though not exceptionally charming or creative, Roxxxy gets through her wig seminar just fine. Katya's, on the other hand, is pure, genius-level art. Alyssa's is like art for lizards: it bypasses logic and taps directly into the brain's pleasure receptors. I have no particular feelings about Detox this week. Her video has a terminal case of meh. We knew Alaska would come up with something weird and hilarious, but wildcard Tatianna once again pulls through with a showcase of her tart yet endearing wit.
When it comes time for the judges' critiques, however, the waters in the shark tank get a little choppy. Katya's place in the top two is a no-brainer, though I question how Ru is going to follow through on the promise of making and selling a spray-on mood stabilizer at DragCon. Roxxxy's fourth trip to the bottom is similarly foreseeable. But Tati gets scolded for not mentioning her product enough, even though Alaska (who also said next to nothing about what she was selling) receives high praise. For my money, Detox should have been the other queen on the chopping block; her idea was garbage in more than one sense of the word. But I'm not the one in charge here.
During backstage deliberations, Roxxxy sounds like your elderly grandma when she starts speaking with alarming frankness about her impending death: just smiling and saying that it's God's will that her time has come and giving her belongings away. Tatianna, having already crossed the threshold once, comes at the conversation giving undead realness with the chilling, sexy hunger of a vampire. Again, in my mind she doesn't even belong in the bottom, so her departure seems out of the question.
And then several things I disagree with happen. FIRST, I disagree with Ru's continued mispronunciation of “duu-laaz,” because it makes me think that she's tipping the winner in something other than American currency. No one is pregnant enough to need ten thousand doulas. SECOND, I don't care if neither of them are going home, I disagree with both of the top two wearing fucking flats. THIRD, I disagree that Alaska won that lip sync, flag reveal be damned. And FOURTH, I strongly disagree with the choice to send Tatianna home (and FIFTH, disagree that Rolaskatox had nothing to do with that decision). I bind you, Lasky, from doing harm! Harm against other people, and harm against yourself!

It's a strange feeling walking away from something that has taken up a substantial fraction of your waking life for seven years. On Monday, I deactivated my Twitter account. It's like slamming on some brake inside your head. When I took a quick lunch on Tuesday I read from a book instead of casting about for three smart-assed things to say on Twitter. I'm not sure what just happened in the world — like in the last 10 minutes or so — but I'm toying with the theory that not knowing is all right. If it was important, people will still be talking about it 10 minutes from now. I'm hoping to be about 2 per cent wiser by the weekend than I would have been.

But that hope isn't why I walked away from Twitter. In my case there's a lot to walk away from. On New Year's Eve in 2009 I joined the micro-blogging site, which restricts users to 140 characters at a time on whatever subject they want to discuss. By the beginning of this week, I'd written 90,000 tweets, for an audience that was closing in on 60,000 followers. Almost every journalist I know is on Twitter more or less constantly. It's a valuable resource. Most journalists in the world tweet about breaking news before they start to write it or recite it to camera. Having those extra minutes of insider knowledge is a huge rush. And following the top experts on Brexit or jazz or cooking or humour — a few of my long-standing preoccupations — is a bonus.

I wrote about 30 tweets a day, on average. It's probably good for any writer to spend time on Twitter. If you can't make your point in 30 words, you may not have one. Above all, Twitter, for me, was a way to automate the easily distracted, bottomlessly curious work habits I've had since I was a kid. Interested in everything, with almost no attention span. Constantly jumping up from my workstation to gossip with colleagues, or to try a line aloud to see whether it got a laugh. I've been doing that since the '80s. Twitter just made that kind of behaviour convenient, and far more intense. But there were problems. This week, they got worse. Anyone on Twitter knows it is overloaded with jackasses, most of them hopped up on testosterone and posting anonymously. This makes too much of Twitter feel like a fire hose of bathroom graffiti, complete with disgusting politics, toilet humour, sexual obsession and attempts to degrade others. The avalanche of sexist, racist, homophobic, Islamophobic, anti-Semitic abuse against too many users has been exhaustively chronicled. My own imperfect response was to block anyone who tried to pick a fight. But I've seen gentler souls take appalling abuse. A friend wrote a sweet, funny observation about her baby daughter. It got misinterpreted, twisted, amplified across dozens of accounts, and soon my friend was facing near-constant abuse from across North America. One guy wrote that he'd like to watch her daughter die. The people at Twitter were good enough to suspend his account. Too many others are allowed to carry on.
Twitter knows it has a problem on its hands. It has tried, with slowly increasing zeal, to block the worst abusers. But because the company proclaims its allegiance to free speech, it hasn't done the most obvious thing: require users to post under their own name and provide proof of identity when signing up. I've got a lot of sympathy for the free-speech argument. There are people on Twitter who say valuable things that their employers or governments don't want said. Abuse is a nasty by-product of the cover Twitter gives useful speech.

But what if the cover itself isn't dependable? Mahir Zeynalov is a Turkish journalist who for years has been chronicling the excesses of Turkey's government under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Arbitrary arrest, mass firings, blacklisting, newsroom purges. The abuses accelerated after the failed coup attempt against Erdoğan in July gave him a pretext for wide-scale oppression against perceived opponents. The best source for news of this tinpot tyranny has been Zeynalov, tweeting in exile in the United States after Erdoğan had him deported in 2014. But this week Twitter emailed Zeynalov to tell him the Turkish government has called for his account to be blocked in Turkey. By midday Monday, Zeynalov's case was murky. Twitter told him it “has not taken any action on the reported account at this time. One of our core values is to defend and respect the user's voice.” Good news! But the email continued that Twitter “may consider filing petition of objection” if Zeynalov wished. Compared to the answer the Erdoğan regime should have received — “Go to hell” — that message is awfully equivocal. Twitter is not worth much if it folds like a cheap suit when one of the most thin-skinned autocrats on Earth says “boo.” Until Twitter makes it clear that it has the back of Zeynalov and other public truth-tellers, it cannot credibly protest that its users have to put up with brigades of anonymous liars. And while it sorts out its assorted positions on free speech, Twitter can get along without me. Paul Wells is a national affairs writer. His column appears Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.

A BuzzFeed editor visited Pennsylvania State University Thursday to give a presentation on fake news and Facebook's role in spreading it.
Craig Silverman, whom Fortune has called a “fake news expert,” spoke at Penn State regarding fake news and Facebook's role in propagating it during the election, as reported by Daily Collegian.
“It's crazy, but misinformation about American politics has actually become a good business opportunity,” said Silverman.
In “Fake News, Real Consequences,” Silverman called the 2016 presidential election the “perfect storm” for fake news. The BuzzFeed editor condemned fake news for causing both journalists and the audience to question the reliability of media outlets instead of paying attention to significant articles.
“They need to be held responsible,” said Silverman, referring to Facebook and proposing that the site changes its algorithm so that fake news doesn't get boosted via social media so easily.
Weiming Xie, a finance student, commented on President Trump's labeling of certain outlets as fake news.

The Wisconsin Department of Justice is updating the rules hospitals must follow in collecting evidence from sexual assault victims.
Since 2007, the state has been required to pay for the tests hospitals carry out on rape victims, regardless of whether the victim reports the assault to police. However, there's been no standard for how much a hospital can charge for gathering blood and DNA samples. The new rule sets a $1,200 maximum that the state will pay.
Jill Karofsky, the director of the state victims' rights office, said that a push to encourage more tests could end up costing the state more, but it could also promote public safety.
"The more victims who come forward and the more perpetrator DNA we are able, as law enforcement, to get our hands on, the more perpetrators we can catch and the safer we are going to be overall," Karofsky said.
Last year the state spent more than the $600,000 to run tests on 720 rape victims — a huge increase from the $50,000 the state spent in 2010 to pay for testing on 62 victims. Karofsky said that's a result of victims' rights offices across the state encouraging victims to get tested even if they don't want to report the assault as a crime.
The new rules list seven procedures a hospital can charge for. In addition to blood and urine tests, hospitals can be reimbursed for gathering a medical history and conducting a physical exam — including photos — for evidence of an assault. Also included are tests for pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.
The $1,200 cap is intended to cover about two-thirds of the overall cost of the tests. The rule includes a provision to increase that amount to keep up with inflation.
The state is also working on preventing hospitals from sending bills to victims. A federal law passed in 2013 prohibits hospitals from doing so. But Karofsky said it still happens occasionally, adding more stress for victims who are trying to recover from the trauma of rape.
Michael Dell, chief executive of Dell Inc, delivers his keynote speech at the Things Oracle OpenWorld Summit in San Francisco, California September 25, 2013. REUTERS/Jana Asenbrennerova Dell is looking to sell Perot Systems, an IT services company, for around $5 billion (£3.3 billion), according to Re/Code.
The money raised would go towards the $67 billion (£44 billion) deal to acquire EMC, a data storage company that owns a stake in VMWare, among other things. Dell is looking to raise $10 billion (£6.6 billion) in total to help fund the deal.
The company bought Perot Systems for $3.9 billion (£2.5 billion) in 2009. It provides IT services to government agencies and health care providers, including handling media claims, and was founded by billionaire businessman Ross Perot.
Dell has been courting several potential buyers, including Tata Consultancy Services, an India-based IT firm; Genpact, a US-based firm; and Atos, a French-based IT firm. The talks with TCS reached advanced stages but subsequently broke down, Re/Code reports.
As PC sales fall worldwide, Dell is looking to transition into both a services company — offering software support, among other things — and diversify into other hardware areas, such as storage. EMC has revenues of $24 billion (£15 billion) per year.
Dell is also looking to sell Quest Systems, an IT management solution with revenues of $857 million (£560 million), and SonicWall, a security company with revenues of $265 million (£174 million), according to Re/Code.
With the passing of HB 1099 yesterday, which creates a soil remediation study using hemp as the filtering agent, Colorado could be the first state in the nation to grow industrial hemp since the late 1930s.
But passing the bill was just the first obstacle. Actually implementing the plan might be more tricky.
The bill becomes law on July 1 and would require the chairs of the agriculture, livestock and natural resources committees of both the state house and the senate to appoint a task force made up of a soil expert from a Colorado university or college, an expert in radioactive material detection and leeching, an expert in phytochemistry, a horticulturist and three Colorado residents "educated and interested in the specialized use of industrial hemp."

The committee would choose a site or sites totaling no more than 500 acres. Ideally the site would be heavily contaminated, similar to the former Rocky Flats nuclear-weapons plant, though no site has been selected currently (note: we earlier incorrectly reported that the site would be at Rocky Flats). No word on exactly where the seeds for the hemp plants would come from, either.
The pilot study would last ten years, and the bill requires a final report within six months of the end of the program on the amount of contamination removed by the plants, the amount of contamination found in the actual plants and what things need additional treatments to be cleaned. The report would also help establish a baseline standard for cannabis phytoremediation levels.
But there are several hurdles to overcome. Among them is language in the bill that requires the money for the pilot program be kept in a bank or credit union that has insurance through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Because all forms of cannabis are illegal at the federal level, that could be a problem.
*Update 5/11/2012: As noted in the comments below, the final language of the bill allots all money used for the soil remediation program to the state general fund and then issued through the Colorado Department of Public health and Environment instead of using FDIC-insured banks. From the bill:

"The committee shall transmit all private and public moneys received through gifts, grants, or donation to the state treasurer, who shall credit the same to the hemp remediation pilot program cash fund ... The Moneys in the fund are subject to annual appropriation by the general assembly to the department of public health and environment for appropriation to the committee for the direct and indirect costs associated with implementing this article."
Bill author Wes McKinley acknowledged the banking issues in an interview with Westword back in February. But he said that it was still worth moving the bill forward."Hemp was the basic agricultural crop of our country at one time," McKinley said at the time. "It provides food, fuel, fiber, oil. All of our ropes and sails were made of it at one time. But because of special interests, it was outlawed."
But there are other obstacles, including getting federal approval. Colorado isn't the first to pass hemp cultivation bills. California, Hawaii, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, West Virginia and Vermont all have passed bills allowing for industrial hemp cultivation. However the cultivation would require a DEA license, and so far there are no states that have received approval.

A Missouri high school has rushed to apologize for the action of its student fan section after its actions offended students from a visiting opponent's school.
As reported by the Kansas City Star, among other local outlets, a large group of Warrensburg students turned their backs and held a Trump-Pence election sign aloft when the names of the starting five players for Kansas City Center were read aloud over the arena soundsystem. The action was considered particularly inflammatory because Warrensburg is a largely white school while Center is predominantly African-American, and all of the Center basketball players in the starting lineup were African-American.
The incident first gained attention thanks to a Facebook video post by a Center student named Toniaa Lakylia Nunn, who was at the game in Warrensburg and found the actions by the host student body disturbing.
For their part, Center's coach and basketball players said they were unaware of the incident during the game. That doesn't mean they were immune to being offended by it, nor does it necessarily condone the behavior as justifiable.
The Warrensburg school district issued an official apology about behavior that it termed, “inappropriate and insensitive toward our opponents.” Warrensburg superintendent Scott Patrick provided more color about the practice, noting that it was common for students to turn their backs on opponents during introductions, and his district's decision to apologize. He did not comment on whether any discipline would be handed down to any students who took part as members of the Warrensburg fan section.
“I think in this case, (the Trump sign) was really the difference in what took this from something that was unsportsmanlike to something that was insensitive, not necessary and inappropriate,” Patrick told the Star.
This week in our Time Travel series, we're flipping through the history of libraries.
For thousands of years, people have traveled to libraries in search of knowledge. Once civilization dawned, people needed a place to store information and archives, and thus libraries were born. The earliest libraries are traced to present-day Iraq and stored cuneiform data on clay tablets. China's creation of paper in the 2nd century BC helped spread knowledge westward at a faster pace, and more libraries appeared in sacred and private spaces.
During the Enlightenment, libraries experienced a golden age and development shifted to opening these troves of knowledge to the public. People founded more public libraries as time progressed, especially in Europe and the United States. Today, rather than shudder at technology, libraries embrace it, multiplying their catalogue of knowledge.
Flip through the gallery above to see how libraries have evolved over millennia.

Congresswoman Michelle Lujan Grisham is asking the Social Security Administration to change a policy that states a couple must be married for nine months before a spouse is able to collect benefits from the deceased partner.
The letter stems from and specifically references an Albuquerque man who was denied federal benefits earned by his deceased husband.
Anthony Gonzales* married Mark Johnson in a downtown Albuquerque mass wedding ceremony** in August 2013 that celebrated the first day of legal same-sex marriage recognition in Bernalillo County.
Just six months later, Johnson died from cancer.
After his husband's death, Gonzales applied for survivors benefits through the federal Social Security Administration. Typically, Social Security pays surviving spouses a portion of the deceased's eligible income after they die.
But the federal agency denied Gonzales' application on a technicality—his marriage to Johnson had only lasted six months before Johnson's death. This didn't account for the fact that Gonzales and Johnson were together for 16 years before New Mexico legally recognized same-sex marriage.
“It's a matter of fairness. I think Mark and I should be treated like any other couple,” Gonzales said. “We paid tens of thousands of dollars into the system.”
In her letter, Lujan Grisham points out that Gonzales and Johnson could not have legally married any earlier in New Mexico.
“We understand that the 9 month requirement is intended to reduce the likelihood that people would marry only to receive survivor benefits,” Lujan Grisham wrote. “However, Mr. Gonzales and his husband have demonstrated a life-long commitment to each other and were together for 16 years before they married.”
After Gonzales appealed the denial, he received a letter in January from Social Security informing him he and Johnson had other options for marriage. Social Security told Gonzales he could have traveled to another state to get married before same-sex marriages were legal in New Mexico.
“Straight couples don't have that requirement,” Gonzales said.
The Social Security Administration did not respond to emails and phone calls from NM Political Report seeking comment on Gonzales' denial of benefits as of press time.
Kate Kendell, executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, told NM Political Report her organization urges the Social Security Administration to accommodate couples like Johnson and Gonzales.
“The U.S. Supreme Court has held that denying same-sex couples marriage equality is unconstitutional,” Kendell said. “Denying these surviving [spouses'] benefits continues this unconstitutional discrimination, and the federal government has an obligation to remedy this.”
Lujan Grisham suggested making an exemption for “these unique cases” where it was impossible for a couple to be married for nine months or longer.
“Will SSA provide such an exception for these cases?” Lujan wrote. “If not, why not?”
Lujan Grisham's letter is signed by 57 other members of Congress, including Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida congresswoman.
A spokesman for Lujan Grisham's office said the congresswoman is willing to look into drafting legislation if the federal government doesn't change the rule administratively.
Gonzales said even though the state recognizes his marriage, it isn't going far enough.
“We're still fighting for equal rights, Gonzales said. “It's like we're fighting a never-ending battle.”

CHESTER, Pa. – In his ideal world, Philadelphia Union midfielder Freddy Adu would have played in last weekend's game against the Red Bulls and then followed that up by suiting up for the MLS All-Stars in his home stadium at PPL Park on Wednesday.
But the 23-year-old didn't play in either – which left him champing at the bit to get back out on the field for the Union's next game, a Sunday showdown against the New England Revolution at PPL Park (7 pm ET, NBCSN).
Adu is expected to play against the Revs after missing Philly's 2-0 loss to the Red Bulls because of an “team matter.”
“I can't wait,” Adu told MLSsoccer.com following Philly's training session Thursday. “It was difficult for me watching the team lose against New York. But I have to try to forget about that and get myself ready for Sunday. I'm ready to go. I have no injuries, no problems and hopefully I can help the team out.”
Adu certainly seems to have put whatever happened in the past. He joined some teammates to watch Wednesday's MLS All-Star Game with fans, which he called a “pretty cool” experience. The game also served as motivation for the former MLS All-Star, who would love to return to the game in his second stint in the league.
And as for the “team matter” that prevented him from playing in last weekend's game?
“I think it was a little bit of a misunderstanding and I just have to move on from that,” Adu said. “I'm ready to go. I'm good with my coaches and teammates, so all is good.”
Because he didn't travel to Red Bull Arena and the club didn't disclose what the specific team matter was, speculation ran wild that Adu could be out the door, with one particular trade rumor, sending Adu to Dallas for Brek Shea, gaining steam on Twitter.
Both Union interim manager John Hackworth and Adu laughed off the rumor.
“I wasn't paying attention but then I was told by a friend of mine,” Adu said. “I was just laughing because people don't know why I wasn't with the team in New York and they started speculating.
“I get along with my coaches and teammates,” he added. “There's no problem here at all. This is where I want to be, for sure.”

Issues like this occur often on vessels of all types, especially during a phase of their life designed to identify and rectify faults. This is not a serious concern.
While some argue that this is a major issue it should be noted that the Royal Navy themselves seem confident that it will not impact the schedule of the vessel. This would appear to suggest they're not too concerned. We spoke to someone serving on board the vessel via e-mail today, he told us under the condition of anonymity:
“We're bemused, nothing more nothing less. This so-called issue isn't a new thing and it's not what I would call serious. It's getting fixed shortly. Most of us on board don't care or don't know about if it's such a trivial matter. We're not ‘sinking' and we're not ‘leaking' any more than any vessel would be. It's disappointing to see how easily this has been blown out of proportion.”
It was reported this morning that internal pumps are clearing the water and the leak will be fixed before the carrier sails again, again nothing to be concerned about is happening on board the carrier.
It should also be noted that the Royal Navy accepted the vessel from the ACA off-contract and was aware of the shaft issue. The taxpayer will not be paying for the fix either.
A Royal Navy spokesman said:
“An issue with a shaft seal has been identified during HMS Queen Elizabeth's sea trials; this is scheduled for repair while she is alongside at Portsmouth. It does not prevent her from sailing again and her sea trials programme will not be affected.”
The Sun says that HMS Queen Elizabeth has been taking on up to 200 litres of seawater every hour.
“A faulty seal around one of the vast warship's propeller shafts means 200 litres of seawater pour in every hour.”
A typical bilge pump even on a narrow boat, by the way, can handle over 1000 litres per hour.
Admiral Chris Parry told Sky News the leak was a non-issue:
“Every ship, to tell you the truth, takes on water that's why you have pumps. What people have to realise is the whole reason for sea trials is that you race and rally the ship, you stress it right to its extremes, and you're really looking for faults like this to see what happens.
You get this all the time, you've got very complicated engineering under the water, it's operating obviously at sea and every yachtsman will tell you they take in water somewhere, that's what you've got pumps for, that's why you have dedicated engineers, it really is no big deal I have to tell you.”
The ThinPinstripedLine response to the story about the ‘leak' can be found here and summarises today's events very well.
“The issue affecting QUEEN ELIZABETH seems extremely minor, easily fixable and not remotely in the same league of problems that other ships have had. It is a testament to the quality of British shipbuilding skill, and the strength of the CVF design that she has come through trials with only very minor problems.
The battle for the Royal Navy though is pushing this narrative against a media determined to make a minor technical problem into a major PR disaster for the Navy. In the public mindset the front page news today will help set the narrative for the ships early life, regardless of how utterly untrue it is.
Part of this stems from a lack of understanding on the purpose of sea trials, or that faults will occur, but that they are easily fixable. It also stems from the problem that as papers have scrapped their specialist journalists, the days when deep experts like Desmond Wettern could be relied on to provide deep knowledge and understanding, spotting when an issue was a non-event, or equally when what the RN wanted to make out was a non-event was actually a scoop are long gone.”
The shaft seal issue was identified during trials and seemingly was not deemed serious enough to delay subsequent activities. While obviously this is an issue, it's not a major issue as the 200 litres an hour will easily be handled by the ships pumps until the issue is resolved, which it will be before she sails. To put it in perspective, that's around two bath tubs of water.
When I learned that the Kochs were suing Cato, I'm sorry to say that one of the first things I felt was vindication. I'd been saying for years that Cato was essentially an independent shop. The suit makes no sense unless I was right all along.
I've worked at Cato for five and a half years. In that time I have never seen a single decision made in consideration of the Koch brothers' wishes. Cato has always appeared to be run by two people: its president, Ed Crane, and its executive vice president, David Boaz. It was like that when I was hired, and it's like that now.
Even they don't call all the shots, either; plenty of things get published that they actually disagree with, including some of my stuff. The people who spin elaborate fantasies about the Kochs acting as our puppet masters were, and are, dead wrong. They've been wrong since at least the early 90s, if not earlier. I've been saying so for years. Now the whole Cato Institute is in open revolt against the Kochs, a revolt that grew up with astonishing speed.
Why? And why do the Kochs want control?
Ed Crane and Bob Levy, the chairman of Cato, think that the Kochs want to turn the Institute hard to the right, favoring neoconservatism and right-wing cultural issues at home. Most likely they want it silent on civil liberties and the War on Drugs. Their view is corroborated by my colleague Jerry Taylor's statement over at the Volokh Conspiracy:
Last year, they used their shares to place two of their operatives – Kevin Gentry and Nancy Pfotenhauer – on our board against the wishes of every single board member save for David Koch. Last Thursday, they used their shares to force another four new board members on us (the most that their shares would allow at any given meeting); Charles Koch, Ted Olson (hired council for Koch Industries), Preston Marshall (the largest shareholder of Koch Industries save for Charles and David), and Andrew Napolitano (a frequent speaker at Koch-sponsored events). Those four – who had not previously been involved with Cato either financially or organizationally – were likewise opposed by every member of our board save for Gentry, Pfotenhauer, and David Koch. To make room for these Koch operatives, we were forced to remove four long-time, active board members, two of whom were our biggest donors. At this moment, the Kochs now control seven of our 16 board seats, two short of outright control. Why are they forcing out Cato board members, all strong, principled libertarians who have been heavily involved with Cato – financially and organizationally – for years? The answer was given in early November of last year when David Koch, Richard Fink (he of many Koch hats), and Kevin Gentry met with Cato board chairman Bob Levy. They told Bob that they intended to use their board majority to remove Ed Crane from Cato and transform our Institute into an intellectual ammo-shop for American for Prosperity and other allied (presumably, Koch-controlled) organizations. That statement of intent is certainly consistent with what we've been hearing from both Kevin Gentry and Nancy Pfotenauer. They've frequently complained during their short time on our board that Cato wasn't doing enough to defeat President Obama in November and that we weren't working closely enough with grass roots activists like those at AFP… Let's take a look at a few of these new board members of ours. Kevin Gentry is a social conservative activist who's also vice-chair of the Virginia GOP. Nancy Pfotenauer is a former spokesperson for the McCain campaign who has argued on television in favor of the Iraq war and the “don't ask, don't tell” policy pertaining to gays in the military. Ted Olson is a Republican super-lawyer who's never identified himself as a libertarian… Just before the last shareholders meeting, the Koch brothers also nominated –but were unable to elect – eight additional individuals for our board. Those nominees included the executive vice president of Koch Industries, a staff lawyer for Koch Industries, a staff lawyer for the Charles Koch Foundation, a former Director of Federal Affairs for Koch Industries, a former Executive Director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (and who was, incidentally, a McCain bundler), and a lifelong Wichita friend of Charles Koch. Aside from those functionaries, they also nominated a couple of people with public profiles that make the jaw drop: John Hinderaker of the Powerline blog, whose firm counts Koch Industries as a client. Hinderaker has written, “It must be very strange to be President Bush. A man of extraordinary vision and brilliance approaching to genius, he can't get anyone to notice. He is like a great painter or musician who is ahead of his time, and who unveils one masterpiece after another to a reception that, when not bored, is hostile.” Hinderaker supports the Patriot Act and the Iraq War and calls himself a neocon.
Tony Woodlief, who has been president of two Koch-created nonprofits and vice president of the Charles Koch Foundation. Woodlief has blogged about “the rotten heart of libertarianism,” calling it “a flawed and failed religion posing as a philosophy of governance” while complaining about libertarians “toking up” at political meetings.
The evidence speaks for itself. A socially conservative, hawkish Cato wouldn't be Cato anymore. It would be the west annex of the Heritage Foundation. In this context, Andrew Napolitano — otherwise a fine libertarian — is just the lipstick on the pig. I'm sorry, Andrew, but you are.
The real work that Cato does, above all of its specific issue advocacy, is to show that the ordinary constellations of opinion, both left and right, aren't necessarily so good. Many of Cato's ideas are already out there, on the left or the right. What Cato does is fit them together in a way that we find is much more consistent and principled. We might be wrong, but at the very least we're a reasonable challenge to the status quo.
What does Cato say that no other think tank says? Militarism is not the foreign policy best suited to the free market. In fact, it's the worst foreign policy for a free market. The War on Drugs is not only unnecessary in a free market, but ending it would be a straightforward implementation of free market principles. And the freedom to buy and sell is a sick joke without robust civil liberties for all. Conversely, most people want their civil liberties partly so that they can earn a living and enjoy economic opportunities.
That is what Cato is about. That is also apparently why the Kochs are trying to destroy it.
I can't understand how people who are so smart in business can be so boneheaded when it comes to activism. It's a painfully stupid decision. Even if it were innocent — which it's not — it still looks horrible. It's as if the Kochs set out to prove every last thing that progressives have ever said about them.
To sue William Niskanen's widow is atrocious all by itself, an act worthy of a cartoon plutocrat. They appear to have been biding their time until he died, which is just ghoulish. Everyone from left to right admired Bill's honesty, courage, and intellectual rigor, even if they disagreed with him. He was a fine scholar and a true gentleman. I worked with him very closely on his last book, I saw his good qualities and learned a lot from him, and I am appalled that the Kochs would burden his widow in their bid for control.
What we are witnessing here is a very important moment in the history of conservative-libertarian fusionism. Possibly its death knell. To the extent that any of my colleagues have spoken, it's fair to say that this is what they have said as well.
I don't fear being fired anymore. They'd have to fire all of us if they wanted Cato to do their bidding. If they did, we'd just reorganize somewhere else. The donors and the audience would follow the productive people who actually did the work, not the people who sat on their shares and waited for Bill Niskanen to meet his maker. The productive folks are the ones who really run things. (Yeah, it's kind of like Atlas Shrugged in that way. Funny, huh?)
As I said on Twitter, without us, “Cato” is just a very new, very empty building. The Kochs could have bought one of those with a lot less trouble.
Fucoxanthin, a natural carotenoid abundant in edible brown seaweeds, has been shown to possess anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, anti-obesity and anti-diabetic effects. In this study, we report for the first time that fucoxanthin effectively protects against scopolamine-induced cognitive impairments in mice. In addition, fucoxanthin significantly reversed the scopolamine-induced increase of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and decreased both choline acetyltransferase activity and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. Using an in vitro AChE activity assay, we discovered that fucoxanthin directly inhibits AChE with an IC50 value of 81.2 μM. Molecular docking analysis suggests that fucoxanthin likely interacts with the peripheral anionic site within AChE, which is in accordance with enzymatic activity results showing that fucoxanthin inhibits AChE in a non-competitive manner. Based on our current findings, we anticipate that fucoxanthin might exhibit great therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease by acting on multiple targets, including inhibiting AChE and increasing BDNF expression.
Last year, George Stephanopoulos had a particularly antagonistic interview with the author of Clinton Cash, and shortly thereafter, it was revealed that he had donated a substantial sum of money to the Clinton Foundation. ABC stood by their man, though he did have to apologize on-air.
The Washington Free Beacon is now reporting that Stephanopoulos has simply stopped disclosing his donations to the Clinton Foundation.
ABC news anchor George Stephanopoulos has stopped disclosing his donations to the Clinton Foundation prior to his interviews with presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Stephanopoulos interviewed Clinton twice over the past week, once Thursday morning on Good Morning America and again on Sunday's This Week.
During both interviews he failed to disclose to viewers that he was a donor to the foundation.
This is potentially problematic because ABC has stated that its policy requires disclosure: “An ABC News spokeswoman told New York Times that any employee that makes a donation to a charity must disclose it to the network before covering a story related to that organization.”
Newsbusters reports that Stephanopoulos has issued disclaimers in the past.
Back in December, Stephanopoulos interviewed Mrs. Clinton for This Week. He offered this skimpy disclaimer: “[A] reminder for everyone watching, I worked for President Clinton, made charitable contributions in the past to the Clinton Foundation.” But even that was better than Wednesday's silence on the issue.
This story reminds me of one of my favorite Branco cartoons:
Emma Pooley (Great Britain) couldn't watch. Evelyn Stevens (United States) had her hands clasped together in prayer and Linda Villumsen (New Zealand) could only watch on the big screen. Judith Arndt (Germany) was the coolest and the calmest, and she was still out on the course, but powering towards the line. In a tense battle for the women's world time trial championships, experience paid with the German winning her fourth crown in a time of 32.26.46. Stevens - a relative rookie in comparison - held silver, over half a minute in arrears while Villumsen secured bronze ahead of a disconsolate Pooley. If women's cycling was in need of any promotional push, Valkenbrug's time trial was the tonic, as the 2012 Worlds finally came alive.
The 24.1-kilometre course had everything: A legendary champion hoping for one last triumph; a gutsy American with a point to prove after missing Olympic selection; a home nation still scrambling for their first senior individual medal and a cameo cast of athletes performing on the world's biggest stage.
But Arndt was not going to let anyone's lines spoil her script. The German was the last rider to set out from the start house, the embodiment of intent and purpose that has been the benchmark for every other, as she powered down the start ramp.
Ahead of her Stevens, Villumsen and Pooley were locked in battle, separated by less than a second at the first time check at 10.7 kilometres. All three displayed contrasting styles. Pooley spun a light gear as she bided her time and waited for the climbs. Villumsen crunched through the gears in unbreakable fashion as Stevens made up for any technical deficiencies with a sprightly blend of power and guile.
Arndt married all those qualities together and more, searing through first check six seconds faster than any of her opposition and by the second time check, Stevens had lost a further four seconds, Villumsen another nine, while Pooley had slipped to 22 seconds. The Dutch favourite Eleonora van Dijk hovered dangerously in fifth, but the vain hope that one of the leading four would make a mistake that would never materialise.
It was Stevens who crossed the line first in a time of 33:00:23. She dislodged her Specialized - lululemon teammate, Ina Teutenburg, of Germany from the hot seat. Teutenburg had earlier relegated Martina Sablikova (Russia).
Stevesn, who had finished 15th in last year's Worlds - a ride which may have cost her a slot in the US Olympic time trial team - nervously made her way to the hot seat for the long wait. Amber Neben (America), Rhae-Christine Shaw (Canada), Pooley, Villumsen and Arndt, were still to finish but one by one they trickled through. The Cauberg did in Neben, who dropped from sixth to seventh by the line, while Shaw could only manage 22nd.
Pooley, Villumsen and Arndt had decided the medals in last year's race, and it was the British all-rounder who was the next to finish. However the former Olympic silver medallist could only secure provisional second, therefore guaranteeing Stevens a medal. The colour would depend on Villumsen and a pursuing Arndt and as the New Zealand rider grinded up the Caugberg.
It initially looked as though Pooley would sneak bronze but on the false flat Villumsen pushed for the line, finishing nine seconds ahead of the British rider, who could only bury her head in a towel as the inevitable moved even closer.
Arndt had a 30-second lead on the foot of the final climb but whereas Villumsen remained seated and Pooley looked to dance up the slopes, the German remained consistent, rising from the saddle whenever the need occurred, before coming through the finish line to take gold and her rainbow jersey.
Arndt's career still flickers and although it will be extinguished after the road race on Sunday, her performance and those of her competitors, has finally set the championships alight.

DOES marital bliss depend on an active sex life? It sounds like a bears-in-woods and papal-religious-affiliation sort of question, yet around half of studies carried out into the matter suggest the answer is “no”. And this is not just a question of Darbies and Joans, who were at it in their youths, having slowed down as the years have passed. Even reasonably newly married couples, these studies suggest, do not rely on sex to keep their bond strong.
On the other hand, the remaining 50% of investigations have shown the correlation that common sense would predict—namely that in matters matrimonial, sex is crucial. Lindsey Hicks of Florida State University therefore wondered if, as is the case with many things in life, it is all a question of how you ask the question. Many psychological questionnaires permit the respondent time for reflection. Ms Hicks was having none of that. She wanted instant, gut responses.

Ms Hicks's study, just published in Psychological Science, started off by doing what previous ones have done. She collaborated with a team of colleagues to round up 120 recently married local couples. The partners in these couples were then separated and each asked to fill in a questionnaire that inquired about how satisfied they were with their spouses and how often they had sex (a fact on which, despite what cynics might suspect, husband and wife generally agreed).
Ms Hicks, however, did not leave things there. She suspected the reason why past explorations of this subject have had mixed results is because many people want to believe their marriage is in a good state despite infrequent sex, or that frequent sex should not be important for maintaining a healthy relationship. Wanting to believe something is not, though, the same as actually believing it. So she needed a way to distinguish between the two.
Her answer was what is known as an automatic attitude test. Such tests measure instant feelings. Participants are shown an image and then presented with a word that is either positive (“wonderful”, “outstanding” or “charming”, for example) or negative (“awful”, “disturbing”, “horrible”). When they see this word they must indicate as quickly as they can, using a keyboard that measures their reaction time, whether it is positive or negative. Previous work has shown that faster reaction times to positive words and slower reaction times to negative ones suggest a participant has a positive attitude towards whatever he saw in the image. Slower reaction times to positive words and faster ones to negative words suggest the opposite.
To wield the test for her own purposes, Ms Hicks arranged for participants to work through several sets of words. The first set was a control, in which they ranked the words without seeing an image beforehand. The following sets were preceded either by another control (a picture of the participant him- or herself) or by a picture of the participant's spouse.
Ms Hicks and her colleagues found that although the frequency with which couples have sex does not have much correlation with how satisfied they claim to be with their partner, it correlates well with their automatic attitudes towards one another. Those who said they had sex with their spouse two or more times a week reacted more quickly to positive words and more slowly to negative ones after seeing an image of said spouse. The opposite was true for those who had sex once a week or less. None of these effects emerged after people saw an image of themselves, or during the initial control.
Ms Hicks's result does not mean the no-sex brigade are lying when they claim it does not signify. They may genuinely believe what they say. But it does suggest they are fooling themselves. And that is not a matter of mere prurience. If things do start to go wrong in a relationship, and the participants want to patch matters up, then understanding where the real problem lies is important. This is only a single study, of course. But if it is successfully replicated, marriage-guidance counsellors the world over might want to take note.
Jake LaMotta, the boxing champion whose memoir inspired Martin Scorsese's 1980 film “Raging Bull,” is dead. He was 95.
LaMotta's daughter, Christi, confirmed the news in a Facebook post. “Rest in peace pop,” she captioned a photo of her late father. LaMotta's wife told TMZ the late boxer “died in a nursing home due to complications from pneumonia.”
LaMotta was born in the Bronx in the early '20s to Italian immigrant parents. He became a professional boxer at 19, and fought most of his career as a middleweight. His career was highlighted by a rivalry with Sugar Ray Robinson, which led to a six-fight series, of which LaMotta won only one. He did, however, win the world middleweight title in 1949, defeating Marcel Cerdan. Over the course of his career as a boxer, LaMotta earned the nickname “The Raging Bull” for his rough and aggressive fighting style.
After retiring from the ring, LaMotta continued to entertain as a comedian, actor, and bar manager. His credits include playing a bartender in the 1961 film “The Hustler,” starring Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason.
In 1970, LaMotta wrote a memoir, titled “Raging Bull: My Story,” which would inspire the feature film, released a decade later. Robert De Niro played LaMotta in the film, and won an Academy Award for the part. Scorsese's movie also won an Oscar for editing, and was nominated for six other awards, including best picture and best director.
De Niro wrote the following tribute upon hearing of LaMotta's dead: “Rest in peace, champ.”
Not to be confused with Prague University PragerU, short for Prager University, is an American non-profit organization that creates videos on various political, economic and philosophical topics from a conservative or right-wing[1] perspective. The videos are posted on YouTube and usually feature a speaker who lectures for about five minutes.[2] PragerU is not an academic institution, does not hold classes, and does not grant certifications or diplomas.[3] Contents
History
PragerU was founded in 2009 by conservative radio talk show host Dennis Prager and radio producer and screenwriter Allen Estrin,[4] in order to present conservative views and to offset what he regards as the undermining of college education by the left.[2][5] PragerU is based in the San Fernando Valley and had more than 20 employees as of March 2018.[6] Since a lawsuit over the use of a photograph in 2013, PragerU has used animation in its videos.[7] As of November 2018 , its YouTube channel includes 482 videos.[8] The organization depends on donations. According to its CEO, Marissa Streit, a group of approximately 500 students, "PragerFORCE", promotes its videos.[5] PragerU reached a billion views in 2018.[6] On October 23, 2017, PragerU filed a federal lawsuit against Google, claiming that 37 of its videos on YouTube were unfairly demonetized or flagged so that they could only be viewed with restricted mode disabled.[9] The restricted mode filter "limits views based on certain characteristics, including the age of the viewer".[9] On March 26, 2018, the case was dismissed by U.S. District Court Judge Lucy Koh, who ruled that because Google was a private company, PragerU had failed to show that it had infringed its free speech rights.[10][11] In August 2018, when asked to comment, PragerU criticized YouTube for adding fact-checks to YouTube videos which cover climate change.[12] In August 2018, Facebook removed two PragerU videos from its platform, later restoring the videos, saying that they "were mistakenly removed".[1][13]

Pollsters also found that most registered Democratic voters see Clinton as their party's eventual nominee.
About 71 percent believe she will receive that honor, versus 27 percent who think the same about Sanders.
NBC News/Survey Monkey conducted its latest sampling of 3,154 registered Democratic voters via online interviews from Feb. 1-7. It has a 2.4 percent margin of error.

HELSINKI/AMSTERDAM, July 2 (Reuters) - Finland will block the euro zone's permanent bailout fund from buying government bonds in the open market, the Finnish government said on Monday, while The Netherlands also indicated opposition to the bond-buying idea.
Comments suggesting a rough time ahead for the idea followed euro zone leaders' agreement at a summit last week to take steps to shore up their monetary union and bring down Spanish and Italian borrowing costs.
They gave few details on how they might use the temporary EFSF and permanent ESM rescue funds to buy bonds.
A Dutch finance ministry spokesman said on Monday his government did not like the bond-buying idea but did not explicitly say the Netherlands would block the plan, saying only that it would evaluate purchases on a case-by-case basis.
“The prime minister said on Friday he is not in favour of buying up bonds,” said Niels Redeker, spokesman for the Dutch finance ministry. “Using the existing instruments to buy up bonds will be expensive and can only be done if there is unanimity (between member states). That means the Netherlands would need to vote in favour.”
On the insistence of Spain and Italy, now in the eye of the euro debt storm, euro zone leaders decided last week to soften slightly the terms on which countries that observe EU rules and recommendations can get euro zone help to lower market premiums.
The agreement after last week's summit said interventions on bonds markets by the ESM and EFSF rescue funds would be carried out by the European Central Bank, acting as an agent for the funds.
But ESM bond buying on the open market would require unanimous approval from the 17 euro countries and that seems unlikely because Finland and the Netherlands are against it, the Finnish government said a report to a parliamentary committee.
“Finland finds it an inefficient way to stabilise markets,” said a senior Finnish government official.
“Due to intervention of Finland and, among others, the Netherlands, the possibility of ESM operations in the secondary markets was blocked,” the government said in the report, to parliament's influential Grand Committee.
It was not immediately clear which other governments were opposed to the move.
Since the release of his critically acclaimed album “Inferno” — which Guitar World readers voted the “Best Shred Album” of 2014 (Marty was voted “Best Shredder” as well) — Marty has toured around the world and next month he will embark on his first American tour in 12 years, which includes his participation on Axes & Anchors in 2016. Now, he is ready and excited to take his talents to sea on his first-ever cruise appearance.
“Axes & Anchors is not only the first cruise I've ever played on, but it`s the first cruise I've ever been on so I'm beyond excited to join in this awesome event!” exclaims Marty Friedman. “Not only am I going to play my ass off, but I`m planning to learn a TON from all the other super players on this trip.

Starting in September, some children attending taxpayer-funded prekindergarten programs in New York City may have school on Christmas and Thanksgiving. And their school day may be interrupted by a period for religious prayers.
The new rules are a result of a compromise by Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration that is intended to increase participation by Orthodox Jewish and other private schools in his signature initiative.
Most of New York's new prekindergarten programs are run by private organizations, including religious schools, that are compensated by the city. But many Orthodox schools have stayed away because they feel the city's requirement of 6 hours 20 minutes per day of secular instruction does not leave them enough time for religious schooling.
Discussions between City Hall and Orthodox Jewish and other private schools have continued since September. The mayor is seeking to reach his goal of some 70,000 children in full-day prekindergarten by the fall; 53,000 are enrolled now.
The 9.8 update brings a new member of the IS tank family—the IS-5, a new special premium vehicle at Tier VIII in the Tech Tree of Soviet heavy tanks.
This is a clan reward vehicle; it will not be available for normal sale. Players will have a chance to win the IS-5 in the upcoming in-game event on the Global Map. Details will be provided separately.
Below we present the parameters of this tank and explain how to use it effectively on the battlefield.
Vehicle Features
This tank's default shell is APCR (Armor Piercing, Composite, Rigid) instead of AP (Armor Piercing), giving it a default armor-piercing rating of 221 mm, compared to 175 mm with the AP shell. The IS-5 can take on almost any opponent, even Tier IX tanks, with confidence.
Mobility. Relatively good mobility for a heavy tank enables the IS-5 to always position itself in the center of the action and quickly change positions on the battlefield. The power-to-weight ratio of the vehicle is 14.07 hp/t—one of the best among heavy tanks of Tier VIII; in this parameter the IS-5 comes second only to the much lighter French heavy tanks.
Armor. The armor on the IS-5 is also impressive and allows the tank to survive in heavy combat. The geometry of the hull and turret will cause headaches for opponents: in particular, the so-called “pike nose”—the special orientation of the upper glacis plates—ensures a high chance of ricochets.
View Range. The IS-5 has the best view range of the Soviet Tier VIII heavy tanks: 360 meters. While view range is not the strongest point of Soviet heavy tanks, the IS-5 does stand out among its colleagues.
The 122 mm D-25ТАgun has the shortest aim time among the guns of the Soviet Tier VIII heavy tanks. This, combined with good armor-penetration ability, make this gun a reliable weapon in any encounter.
The IS-5 is a premium vehicle, so its combination of increased profitability and good firepower make it an outstanding “harvester” of credits.

The official draft text of the climate treaty for the soon-to-start UN Climate Summit in Paris proposes to establish a global Supreme Court that would rule on issues such as “climate justice,” “climate finance,” “technology transfers,” and “climate debt.”
Tucked away on page 19 of the 34-page document is the call for establishing an International Tribunal of Climate Justice. The text, which is still heavily bracketed with text that hasn't been completely resolved and agreed upon, reads:
An International Tribunal of Climate Justice as][A] [compliance mechanism] is hereby established to address cases of non-compliance of the commitments of developed country Parties on mitigation, adaptation, [provision of] finance, technology development and transfer [and][,] capacity-building[,] and transparency of action and support, including through the development of an indicative list of consequences, taking into account the cause, type, degree and frequency of non-compliance.
Courting Climate Tyranny
With all of the world's politically correct politicians and all of the world's “progressive” journalistas and Big Media commentariat daily hyperventilating over the ever-growing list of alleged threats and catastrophes caused by global warming, it might be expected that there would be some mention of this planned environmental judicial system for the planet. However, since the text was released on October 20, there has been a virtual blackout in the major media regarding this revolutionary development. The only mentions one is likely to find with search engines are alarms being sounded by critics, the climate realists who reject the apocalyptic predictions (and discredited pseudo-science – see: here, here, and here) of the multi-billion dollar global warming lobby.
The censoring of any coverage of the planned UN Climate Tribunal by the major media is not surprising; they have been completely over the top in their promotion of anthropogenic (manmade) global warming (AGW) hysteria and would not want to jeopardize the globalist agenda by drawing attention to the dangers of establishing a planetary judicial authority.
This follows a distinctive pattern: We have seen a similar media censorship of the regional and global tribunals that la and WTO treaties. It was only years later, when these courts began assaulting U.S. sovereignty by over-ruling U.S. laws and U.S. court decisions, that the subversive nature of these judicial bodies became apparent. Then the erstwhile supporters of these treaties (such as Senator John Kerry, now Obama's Secretary of State and a promoter of the climate treaty) claimed that they had no way of knowing that these international courts would eventually subvert U.S. sovereignty. These claims of invincible ignorance don't wash, of course, because this magazine, among other critics, warned repeatedly that this is precisely what would happen.
The same pattern is screamingly evident in the case of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) agreements to merge the United States, respectively, with Pacific Rim countries and the European Union. The so-called mainstream media have seen fit to censor any criticism of (and virtually any mention of) the dangerous tribunals (here and here) that would be established by these treaties.
As we reported, in February of this year, the International Tribunal of Climate Justice comes to us courtesy of the Marxist regime of Bolivia's President Evo Morales, a close comrade of Cuba's Fidel Castro and an ardent admirer of Communist China's founder/mass-murderer Mao Tse-tung. “In April 2010,” we reported, “Comrade Morales convened the ‘World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth' in Cochabamba, Bolivia, which drew thousands of true believer Red-Green activists from across the planet. The outcome of that confab, the ‘Cochabamba Statement,' calls for ‘the equitable allocation [of] atmospheric space between developed countries and developing countries during the period 1750 to 2050 based on the principles of equity and historical responsibility, and the needs of developing countries in order to achieve their economic and social development and poverty.'”
Like the Cochabamba Statement, the UN's draft text states (repeatedly) that the new global “decarbonization” program will be carried out “in accordance with common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.” Which is, simply, the UN's way of channeling Karl Marx's famous dictum, “From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs,” into global policy for effecting the confiscation and transfer of gigantic portions of the planet's wealth.
We noted at the time that the negotiating text said it “establishes the International Climate Justice Tribunal in order to oversee, control and sanction the fulfillment of and compliance with obligations of Annex I and Annex II Parties under this agreement and Convention.” We reported further that it called for establishing a Compliance Committee and a Compliance Mechanism to “enforce” compliance. Its stated: “In order to ensure compliance for developed countries and facilitate developing countries in their implementation,” a Compliance Committee will be created. And, the text informs us, “The Compliance Committee shall have two branches, namely an enforcement branch and a facilitative branch.” The enforcement branch would be aimed at the developed countries (especially the U.S. and EU), and the facilitative branch would function as a mechanism to transfer the wealth from the middle classes of the developed countries to the globalists and their ruling class comrades in the developing countries. The new text released on October 20 contains almost identical enforcement and compliance language (page 20) as the earlier version of the document.
During the United Nations Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable Development in 2012, Morales told delegates that capitalism “is a new colonialism,” and he urged them to “put an end to the capitalist system.” The assembly responded with enthusiastic applause and cheers. That should surprise no one; the General Assembly of the UN is dominated by countries whose ruling regimes are members of the Socialist International, the radical Marxist organization of communist and socialist parties. Moreover, as we've reported extensively, leaders of the Socialist International occupy many of the top posts in UN agencies and have been in charge of the UN's socialist green agenda for decades (see here, here, and here).
Bolivian President Evo Morales is the head of the country's Movement for Socialism Party (MAS, Movimiento Al Socialismo), which, along with other former members of the Socialist International, broke away to form the even more radical international Progressive Alliance. MAS is also a member party of the São Paulo Forum, the Castroite organization whose annual conferences are a platform for Marxist regimes and terrorists. While members of the Progressive Alliance and the Socialist International may spar over differences in Marxist doctrine, they are united in their common goal of destroying free enterprise and property rights. And they see the UN green agenda as one of the most powerful tools imaginable for the “complete transformation” of the world.
One of the organizations that has been in the forefront of blowing the whistle on this UN deception is the Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT), which, among other things, publishes Marc Morano's always-informative Climate Depot website.
In an October 23 posting, CFACT's Craig Rucker reported: “Over 130 developing nations led by South Africa and instigated by China and India are insisting that they will not sign a climate agreement in Paris unless it contains massive redistribution of wealth from developed to poor nations. Now they want the power to haul the U.S. and its allies before a UN Star Chamber to enforce compliance.”
“If the climate tribunal becomes the focus of public scrutiny, watch for the negotiators to pull a switch behind closed doors and try and accomplish the same thing by re-branding it an enforcement ‘mechanism'” Rucker wrote. “Whatever they call it, countries who sign onto this agreement will be voting to expand the reach of the UN climate bureaucracy, cede national sovereignty, and create a one-way street along which billions will be redistributed from developed to poor nations,” notes Rucker. “Developed nations would be expected to slash their emissions while the ‘poor' countries expand theirs. China, which holds a trillion dollars in U.S. debt, would be counted among the poor. China and India are delighted. They would like nothing better than a world where the West cedes the competitive advantages their free-market economies created. They hope for a future where Asia does the manufacturing and the United States and Europe do the importing — until their wealth runs out, anyway.”
Before Donald Trump takes to the debate stage Wednesday night for one last chance to prove U.S. trade policy is letting Mexico steal Michigan and Ohio's auto jobs, he might want to do some research on manufacturing trends in the global auto industry.
Mexico's biggest and fastest-growing carmakers aren't American brands like Ford and General Motors' Chevy. The biggest Mexican carmaker is Nissan, and the newest plants belong to Audi and Kia, with big BMW and Toyota plants in the pipeline.
For a candidate who argues that free trade has led to the hollowing-out of U.S. manufacturing, the most ironic cut may be that car companies are building in Mexico rather than the United States, largely because it has freer trade than the United States does with the rest of the world. Critics of the North American Free Trade Agreement, who are placing all the blame on it, are denying the reality of global auto manufacturing.
"That's what gets lost in the narrative," said Bernard Swiecki, director of the automotive communities partnership at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. "Free trade agreements are driving BMW and Audi, but they're not free trade agreements with us. Blame NAFTA all you want — it wasn't the trade agreement that made that happen.''
If you haven't seen ‘Love The Beast', do yourself a favor and check it out on Netflix. It's a documentary about Eric Bana and a lifetime's worth of ownership of a Ford XB Falcon that he modified and raced in the Targa Tasmania, a tarmac based rally event that takes place in Tasmania, Australia. In the documentary, Bana talks to Jeremy Clarkson and talks about the love of cars and seeks advice on what to do with his wrecked XB Falcon.
The interview gives a glimpse into both of the men's automotive passions and does it in a way that's unlike most interviews that occur with Jezza. The 22 minute interview covers a more serious side of Jeremy and he peels back the layers explaining why we inexplicably love certain cars, and why we develop a special relationship between ourselves and the machine.
Perhaps this explains why he loves this list of cars and hates these other ones.

ASHBURN, Va. -- Mike Shanahan changed his story in a hurry. The new explanation: Donovan McNabb was benched more because of his body, not his brain.
Less than 24 hours after declaring he yanked McNabb because of a "gut feel" relating to the quarterback's less-than-full competence in the offense, the Washington Redskins coach instead insisted Monday it was a pre-planned move that had more to do with "cardiovascular endurance" issues.
McNabb, because of nagging hamstring and groin injuries, wasn't in good enough shape to run a two-minute offense with no timeouts -- according to Shanahan.
"The cardiovascular endurance that it takes to run a two-minute, going all the way down with no timeouts, calling plays, it's just not easy." Shanahan said. "If I thought it was the best situation to do, then Donovan would have run the two-minute offense."
Somewhere in between the range of explanations is the cold fact: McNabb, who turns 34 this month, is not having a very good season.
The change of message by a coach with two Super Bowl titles made for a baffling day at Redskins Park, nearly eclipsing the stunning decision to sit McNabb in the first place.
With summer just around the corner, it won't be long before we can once again quench our thirst with a juicy slice of watermelon. But of the 400 billion pounds of watermelons grown each year, 800 million pounds are rejected because they are either blemished or deformed.
Now there is a use for all those rotting watermelons.
Science Daily reports that a 20 pound watermelon can yield a 1.5 pounds of sugar, enough to produce 7/10 of a pound of ethanol. And chemist Wayne Fish has also shown that ethanol can be extracted from the waste stream of watermelons used for nutraceuticals (like lycopene a powerful anti-oxident).
This is good news for the watermelon industry. Farmers gain an extra cash crop and the nutraceutical industry which extracts watermelon compounds, will have reduced waste water treatment expenses.
Agricultural Research Services (ARS) is perfecting a method for extracting watermelon ethanol and developing an intercropping method, whereby other ethanol crops like sweet sorghum could be rotated with the watermelon crop, providing a year-round source of ethanol.

Power your car... with watermelons?
80 million watermelons are left to rot each year. Now there's a way to turn them into ethanol.
Does even a skilled hacker's past catch up with them? Or is this another false lead?
In response to an article questioning whether Lulzsec's leader, Sabu, was a Twenty-first Century Billy The Kid, information has come to light which poses the question, has his true identity been revealed?
There have been several attempts at identifying Sabu with the resulting information being, apparently, incorrect. However, the latest attempt at Doxing him (posting his private identity details online) has coincided with him going to ground.
The name mentioned is one (of many) that has been circulating social media for some time but on this occasion it's accompanied by a large amount of alleged "evidence".
Referenced information dates back some ten years and points the finger at a Puerto Rican man living in New York. It goes far beyond what has previously been published but, being uncorroborated, we can't post the details on this site.
Information was gathered using social engineering meaning that apparent references to him on various websites have led to leads on other websites which have linked back to original sources. In short, someone's past appears to have caught up with them. The published documents show "mind maps" on how the evidence stacks up.
Of course it may not be him, but there's plenty of evidence to link the man to Sabu and make him a prime suspect. One scenario is that the Puerto Rican man is a security expert and active hacker who coincidentally called himself Sabu in the past. Another is that he's a patsy - identified by Sabu long ago as a person whose identity would fit his future activities thereby throwing pursuers off the scent. That's as unlikely as it sounds, but for a self-proclaimed social engineering expert, it's not beyond the realms of possibility. Either way, there hasn't been any public response from the man despite the fact that significant personal information (including alleged photos) and accusations about him have been posted online.
What is certain is that shortly after the "dox" were posted Sabu went to ground. Any imminent, forthcoming, high-profile arrest will indicate either that Sabu has truly been identified and that an internet paper trail, no matter how obscure, can be used to track somebody by anyone with enough patience and dedication, or that once again Sabu has given the authorities and his dissenters the slip.
This time, one suspects, we need not wait so long to have the answer.
Walmart has removed the Made in USA labels from its website after being investigated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over deceptive advertising.
Walmart's Made in USA claims were called into question after Truth in Advertising discovered hundreds of products on the website were actually made elsewhere.
The watchdog group filed notice with the FTC after comparing the Made in USA labels against the packaging of the actual products of hundreds of products. Plastic cutlery labelled Made in USA on the website was found to be labelled Made in China on the packaging, while a lotion that the website said was made in the U.S. was found to be made in Mexico.
The FTC closed its probe without laying charges after Walmart agreed to remove all the Made in USA labels from its website.
Two years ago, Walmart made a high-profile pledge to buy an additional $250 billion in Made in USA products, reasoning that patriotism sells.
As part of its deal with the FTC, the retailer must redesign the Made in USA labels on the packaging of many of its products to specify how much of the product was made overseas.
In many cases the so-called domestically made products were only packaged in the U.S. or were made from imported parts.
"We are pleased with the FTC's decision and appreciate its thorough review of our program," Walmart spokesman Kory Lundberg said in a statement. "We're committed to reviewing and strengthening our processes to help ensure customers have a great experience on our website and can find the products and information they are looking for."
Chess has generated a lot of buzz lately as a learning tool to help children and young adults improve their decision-making ability, concentration, personal responsibility, and sportsmanship. As a supporter of a New York City charity that promotes chess in schools, I've been delighted to see the popularity of the game surge across the nation, especially as a slew of studies links chess with higher grades and better reading comprehension. Chess nights are being held at urban recreation centers. There's even a chess camp for girls to help them become interested in the game. And globally, the ages of the latest crops of chess grand masters are getting younger and younger.
I wondered if chess was the key to my improvement in poker. At first, I played blitz chess for fun. I had just finished a grueling consulting project and had a bit of rare free time, so I indulged in a few 3-minute games here and there. Unlike traditional tournament chess, which can take a couple hours per game, it was convenient to squeeze in a blitz match in between answering morning emails. Plus, the growth of online chess sites means there's a global community of skilled players available any time of the day or night. The problem, though, was that I got so absorbed in the game that I would play for hours. I was surprised at my level of concentration, and I experienced that incredible "flow" when you're so involved in a task that you lose all sense of time.
When I had played chess tournaments in high school, my coach had always warned me against spending too much time at speed chess. He worried that I would get so used to making snap decisions that I wouldn't develop the skill to patiently think through strategic moves. However, as an adult, I believe that the challenge of having to make some 40 moves in a three-minute game of speed chess actually trains your brain to think on a higher level. I'm convinced that the 80,000 fine decisions I made during the 2,000 games I played before the poker tournament enabled me to better recognize patterns of play and helped me win. During a game of speed chess on a plane, a flight attendant told me she had never seen anyone so focused before and didn't want to interrupt my game to offer me a drink.
The benefits of speed chess didn't stop there. The game had improved my concentration so much that endeavors in other areas of my life that had once seemed difficult were suddenly easier. I shaved a minute off my mileage pace while training for my first 5K and held the "plank" push-up position for two minutes straight. I stopped letting myself get distracted by email and sailed through tedious work assignments. Not only had my success at blitz chess given me a confidence boost, it helped me develop mental and emotional endurance.
I stopped thinking of my chess addiction as goofing off, but an important part of my brain fitness regimen that deserved as much dedication as my physical exercise routine. Each morning at 9 a.m., I scheduled an hour of blitz chess. On days when I had work deadlines, I made it a point to fit in at least a couple games at lunch. Some days I took a break, but I tried to build it into my daily routine just as I would brush my teeth. I also measured my performance and set weekly goals to improve my rating.
The BBC's Daily Politics has just staged a party political debate on energy and climate change. It was every bit as awful as you would have expected: four politicians (Labour; Conservative; Green; Lib Dems) spouting pure, unadulterated drivel; one talking perfect sense and being marginalised and derided for it (UKIP's Roger Helmer, natch).
Apart from Helmer, the only good thing about it was inquisitor Andrew Neil, who is very much on top of the mainstream arguments about climate change and current energy policy – and is perfectly aware that both contain holes so vast they make the one in the ozone layer look like a pinprick.
Perhaps that's why, to ensure Neil behaved itself and didn't go too far off message, the BBC insisted that its resident Climate Commissar, green activist and broadcaster Roger Harrabin should sit alongside him to chip in his ‘expert' tupenny ha'penny's worth – a bit like a less informed and much less funny Richard Osman from Pointless.
Had Harrabin been doing his job properly he would have berated the pillock who declared “Ocean acidification is a scientific fact” and cited this to demonstrate why, even though global temperatures have been at a standstill for 18 years, there are other aspects of climate change which present a serious threat.
Unfortunately, the ignorant pillock was Harrabin himself, so he couldn't, really.
Helmer gave a pretty good rebuttal to Harrabin's claim but here, just to rub it in, is a reminder why “Ocean Acidification” is a busted flush. Indeed the evidence for it is so shaky, it may even rival Michael Mann's “Hockey Stick” for risible hokiness.
Matthew Hancock, representing the Conservatives, looked pale, awkward and out of his depth – as well he might as an educated bloke with a City background who'd been drafted in to speak up for fatuous, scientifically-illiterate, economically suicidal policy measures with which not even the majority of Conservative voters agree.
Neil asked him whether he thought “global warming” had been responsible for last year's floods.
Hancock said he thought it had. Neil then whipped away the camouflaged sheet covering the caltrop-filled pit. A survey had just come out at the weekend revealing that most Conservative voters disagreed with him. And rightly so. There is no evidence whatsoever to support Hancock's claim that “there has been an increase in erratic weather behaviour” because of climate change. Not even the IPCC's most recent report supports him on this.
Meanwhile, Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey – representing the Lib Dems – was caught out several times speaking unutterable guff.
Davey claimed – untruthfully – that the computer models had predicted the “pause” in global warming.
Even Harrabin felt compelled to chip in that this wasn't the case.
Neil drove in the bayonet still further: “Could you tell me which models predicted the pause?”
Davey floundered that lots of them had.
“They predicted it after the event,” said Helmer.
Helmer acquitted himself well – but then, he was the only politician on the panel with a science background (Maths) and, rather more usefully, the only one whose party policy on the environment and climate change is grounded in scientific and economic reality.
Will the debate have made any difference to anything, though? Probably not. Like all the other debates we've seen on TV so far, it was a hugely dispiriting reminder of the vast gulf that now exists between the mainstream political parties and the people they supposedly represent.
Out in the real world, only a minority think that climate change is a serious threat; out in the real world, most people would much rather have lower energy bills than be forced to subsidise ugly wind farms and solar farms (which they loathe if they're on their doorstep); out in the real world, people would prefer Britain to be able to decide its own policies on farming, the environment and flood control rather than have them imposed from outside by the EU.
Yet none of the two main parties gives a stuff what these voters think. And the only one that does – UKIP – continues to be treated in this grotesque election cycle not as the truth-tellers they are but as dangerous pariahs.
The arrest of New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez for murder yesterday is obviously bad news for the NFL and its most successful team since Tom Brady took over at quarterback in 2001.
But the NFL's bigger concern right now are the Cleveland Browns. The Browns should be one of football's flagship small-market franchises. The reincarnated version of the team, which replaced the version that moved to Baltimore for the 1996 season, moved into a great stadium in 1999. And the Browns have historically had rabid fans in football-crazy Ohio.
But bad management has made a mess of things in Cleveland. The Browns have posted only two winning seasons over the past 13 years. FirstEnergy Stadium is being filled to only 90% of capacity despite having the league's lowest ticket prices ($54.20). The Browns have not attempted to increase prices in five years. We pegged the team's revenue at $258 million for the 2011 season, tied with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for 20th in the NFL.
The Browns were looking to re-boot after James Haslam bought the team last October for an enterprise value of $987 million (part of the $1.05 billion purchase price will be paid in the future) from Randy Lerner. So much did the NFL love Haslam that the Browns were not sold or vetted by an investment banker. Instead, the league handled the sale.
The new owner moved quickly to rebuild the team and fan base. Haslam fired team president Mike Holmgren immediately after buying the Browns. Then he hired a new head coach, Rob Chudzinski in January and vowed to take a hands-on role with the NFL draft. The Browns also dropped the requirement for new season ticket owners to buy personal seat licenses.
But the Browns now appear on the verge of imploding. Haslam's Pilot Flying J his source of wealth, is being investigated by the FBI for defrauding customers. Three of the truck stop company's employees have entered guilty pleas. And credit ratings for Pilot Flying J have been put on negative watch for possible downgrade by both Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's.
Meanwhile, a few players that joined the Browns after Haslam bought the team have already gotten in trouble with the law. Quentin Groves, signed as a free agent, was arrested in April and charged with solicitation in a prostitution sting. Seventh-round draft pick Armonty Bryant was cuffed by the cops in May for drunken driving. And undrafted free agent Ausar Walcott was cut by the Browns after he was arrested for an attempted murder on Tuesday.
Will Haslam be able to hang on to the Browns, let alone rebuild the team? Who knows? Haslam has said he had no knowledge of the wrongdoings. He has also stated it will be business as usual for the Browns and has apologized to the other owners and has done the same with the team's fans.
But lawsuits can be expensive. So is keeping a company under attack by the government afloat. Don't be shocked if Haslam unloads his team. It might be the best thing for both the Browns and the NFL.
In his ongoing effort to terrorize America's tastebuds, Guy Fieri — in addition to infiltrating the heart of America's culinary scene and stinking up the joint with a gaudy, over-priced crap palace — is apparently distributing new, impossibly awful food abominations across the land via Walmart and Sam's Club stores, of course. What's Guy got cookin' for “the folks” now? Stuff like “Old Skool Pepperoni Pizza Eggrolls” and “Crispy Cheeseburger Ravioli Bites,” that's what!
But the real crown jewel of this disgusting new frozen food collection may well be the “S'mores Indoors” pizza. And judging from the early reviews that have accumulated on the product's page on the Sam's website, it is predictably terrible.
A sampling of the feedback so far…
I love chocolate, graham crackers, and marshmallows – in short, I love s'mores… but this was the worst – and I MEAN the WORST dessert ever.
the taste was HORRIBLE! I would have never expected it to be spicy. These pizza's were a total disappointment!
This is the worst thing I have ever bought.
It was nasty and we could not eat it.
This is disgusting! What a disappointment!
You remember those ads in the back of comic books for pepper-flavored gum you could give out as a practical joke? I think this is “Guy Fieri”‘s version of that. This stuff is really, really, really, wish I could rate it less than one star, bad.
We purchased this product because it looked delicious on the box and had Guy Fieri's name on it. I can't believe he would put his name on this awful stuff!
I know, right? So hard to believe Guy Fieri would allow his sterling name to be attached to such hot garbage. SHOCKING.
This, by the way, was not a selective sampling. Every single review trashed the product. Welcome to FLAVORTOWN!

Two key congressional leaders told Breitbart Texas the federal government should reimburse the Lone Star State for border security expenditures. The comments from two committee chairmen follows a request from Texas House Republican leadership requesting reimbursement of $2.8 billion spent by the state on defending the state's southern border with Mexico.
The Texas legislative leaders met on the second day of the new legislative session to ask for the reimbursement, Breitbart Texas' Lana Shadwick reported. State Representative Dennis Bonnen (R-Angleton) told Breitbart Texas, “For years, Texas has stood in the gap where the federal government has failed. With a new administration coming into office, hope the tide will turn and Washington will do its duty, so that Texas can devote its limited resources to prioritize reserved to the states under federalism.”
U.S. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX) agreed, telling Breitbart Texas, “The federal government's failure to secure our borders has often forced border states like Texas to do the job for them and pick-up the tab. I support Washington reimbursing Texas taxpayers for proven border security expenses.”
“I'm optimistic that President Trump and a unified Republican Congress will establish a more secure U.S. border, reestablish the rule of law and fund effective interior enforcement,” Brady concluded.
Rep. Bonnen reported the State of Texas and local jurisdictions spent almost $3 billion for border security operations; incarceration of criminal aliens; healthcare; education; and Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission costs. The Texas Department of Public Safety incurred the largest expense spending, $1,410,563,257 for additional manpower, equipment and technology.
U.S. House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and Science Chairman John Culberson (R-TX) also agreed on reimbursing Texas and other border states that have been forced to spend state taxpayer dollars to carry out the federal responsibility of securing the border. “Congress should reimburse Texas and every other border state that filled the dangerous gap created by President Barack Obama's refusal to enforce our immigration laws,” Culberson told Breitbart Texas. “Fortunately, President Donald Trump will begin to vigorously enforce our immigration laws and secure our border.”
Texas State Representative Tan Parker (R-Flower Mound) summed up the State's position saying, before the inauguration of President Trump, “Texas is proud to have gone beyond the call of duty in defending America's border, but we have done so at great cost to our taxpayers. “We are hopeful President-elect Trump will give it due consideration so that we can make our communities, schools and hospitals whole.”
Breitbart Texas also reached out to U.S. House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul (R-TX). The chairman's spokesperson, Lizzie Litzow responded, “The Chairman is out of pocket currently so I won't be able to get you something on deadline. Therefore, we will pass on this opportunity.” Breitbart Texas offered to wait until the chairman could respond. No reply to that extension has been received by Breitbart Texas.
In a prior conversation with a House Homeland Security Committee staff member, Breitbart Texas learned the committee might consider increasing border security spending in Texas to help prevent the state from future expenditures.
Texas expenditures reported by Texas House Republican leaders:
Texas Department of Public Safety paid out $1,410,563,257 for additional manpower, equipment and technology;
the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has been forced to incur $20,268,215 in expenses;
Texas Military Forces have spent almost $63,000 in border-related costs;
Texas taxpayers paid out $181,185,708 for educational expenses;
healthcare expenditures through the Texas Health and Human Services Commission hit $416,882,000;
the incarceration of criminal aliens in county jails cost Texans $265,563,826; and,
the Texas Department of Criminal Justice costs reached $463,278,833.

Manchester United need to add a centre-back. That is abundantly clear to anyone that watches football.
They have looked shaky at the back this season under Louis van Gaal, having forfeited the combined experience of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic to Queen's Park Rangers and Inter Milan respectively in the summer.
It seems as though they will act in the January transfer window to splash the cash on a new central defender. The Daily Mail have reported that they are still pursuing Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels, whilst the Mirror have suggested that it will be Aymeric Laporte of Athletic Bilbao who joins the Red Devils.
Valencia's Nicolas Otamendi was linked to Old Trafford by the Daily Star earlier in the window and the Telegraph have reported on a move for Raphael Varane of Real Madrid. However the latest centre-back to be linked with the club is Austria international Aleksandar Dragovic of Dynamo Kiev, as the Express claim that United have agreed a £15m deal.
Reports: Man United agree deal to sign Dynamo Kiev defender Aleksandar Dragovic
Dragovic is arguably one of the lesser known players linked with United this window – as the other four operate in Europe's top five leagues and are playing for clubs much closer to the standard of the Premier League, whilst the 23-year-old has gone from the Swiss League with FC Basel to the Ukrainian's top tier.
He is still young, so time is on his side and he could be considered a long-term option in the heart of United's defence. His positioning and ability to anticipate the opposition's attacks would also be a real boost to Van Gaal, who has had to watch his backline occasionally get caught out by a fairly routine attack – as their inexperience shows all too clearly.
Dragovic has a knack for stepping back and reading the game, cutting out balls and winnings headed duels, rather than scything down the last man or getting caught flat-footed when the opposition breaks. He is also fairly quick for a central defender, which is a plus, if nothing else.
But how does he rate alongside United's other reported targets?
When comparing the Austrian's per 90 statistics from this season, he looks some way off the pace in key areas alongside the likes of Otamendi and Hummels, having failed to make a single tackle in five Europa League appearances.
He attempted seven in that time and completed none of them, even though Dynamo won four of those five games and conceded just four goals along the way. That could suggest that Dragovic did not have that many challenges to make, against the likes of Rio Ave, Aalborg and Steaua Bucuresti, but nevertheless to complete none is not great.
Otamendi, Hummels, Varane and Laporte have all completed over one tackle per 90 this season, some of them nearer two, which puts them all ahead of the 23-year-old in those stakes.
He also pales in comparison when looking at the number of aerial duels won per 90 this season, winning 1.05 in the Europa League. Otamendi (3.21), Hummels (5.25), Varane (2.89) and Laporte (2.24) all shine brighter than Dragovic again when looking at their aerial dominance.
The same goes for their overall duel success. Dragovic has won a lowly 29.17% of his duels, whilst the other four have all won over 50% per 90 this season. He is some way behind them when it comes to battling opponents for the ball, be that on the ground or in the air.
Dragovic begins to come into his own a bit when looking at his defensive contributions, with him looking fairly assured with clearances, interceptions and blocks. The Austrian international is brave, there is no denying that. He will rush in to block a shot in the box and put himself between an opponent and the goal to keep them at bay.
Per 90, he has made 1.48 interceptions, which is the lowest of the five centre-backs, but only marginally. His 0.63 blocks per 90 is only bettered by Otamendi's 1.21 and only the Valencia powerhouse and Varane beat him for clearances (6.74 and 6.41 respectively) with Dragovic making 5.9 clearances per 90.
He is also the least error prone of the five so far this season, as he is yet to make a single error – let alone one that leads to a goal. All the other four have made errors, but only Varane is yet to have one punished with a goal besides Dragovic.
That kind of calmness would be a massive boost to Van Gaal, who has watched his backline lose their discipline, wander out of position, give away careless passes and scythe down opponents in dangerous positions this term. So a cool head at the back would do wonders for United's form.
Varane (0.88) and Laporte (1.06) have also committed more fouls per 90 than Dragovic (0.84) so he could also be seen as a more disciplined option.
It would be impossible to suggest Dragovic is the best of the five, because Otamendi is arguably the pick of the bunch on this season's form. Valencia are flying high in La Liga, he is solid at the back and has even contributed important goals in attack, scoring the winner at home to Real Madrid. So he should be Van Gaal's primary target, if he is willing to fork out massive amounts of money for the Argentinean.
However, Dragovic is young, composed and cheaper than the other four, if the £15 million figure reported by the Guardian is accurate, so he could be a great investment by Van Gaal. He is a more intelligent defender than those currently at the Dutchman's disposal and would be a vast improvement on United's backline, but he is not the best player out there.
He also takes a lovely penalty for a centre-back. Talk about composed.
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- They came, they saw and for the most part, they were impressed – but not without reservation.
A regional conference last week drew roughly 150 urban planners, business leaders, foundation officials and nonprofit managers from eight U.S. cities to Cleveland for a close look at the city's comeback.
Organized by CEOs for Cities, the Cleveland- and Chicago- and Washington, D.C.-based networking organization for urban leaders, the two-day session focused on Cleveland's recent accomplishments in downtown and neighborhood development – and lessons to be learned.
The organization is headed by former Ohio Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher.
Participants in "The Connected City: A City Cluster Workshop" came from Dayton and Cincinnati; Des Moines, Iowa; Greenville, South Carolina; Greensboro and Asheville, North Carolina; Indianapolis; and Knoxville, Tennessee -- as well as Cleveland.
Lectures and workshops in the Ernst & Young conference took place in the Flats East tower and focused on redevelopment efforts in other cities, including Detroit Future City, an ambitious revitalization plan funded by the Kresge Foundation.
But the core of the Cleveland event focused on walking and bus tours through downtown, the Euclid Corridor and East Side neighborhoods.
On Thursday morning, June 19, roughly 30 participants strolled from Public Square to Playhouse Square, taking in the Mall, the Eastman Reading Garden, the Arcade, East Fourth Street, and the Ameritrust Complex at East Ninth Street and Euclid Avenue, which Geis Cos. is redeveloping as a hotel, apartment and retail complex.
Along the way, the group listened to descriptions of the city's revitalization efforts.
Jeremy Paris, executive director of the Group Plan Commission, described proposals to re-landscape Public Square.
Developer Dick Pace touted his vision of a new lakefront development. Developer Ari Maron described how his family's firm, MRN Ltd., turned East Fourth Street into a downtown dining and entertainment mecca.
And developer Fred Geis, standing beneath the skylighted dome of the 1908 Cleveland Trust Rotunda, discussed plans to insert a Heinen's supermarket in the space.
The reactions of conference attendees during the downtown tour were non-scientific and strictly anecdotal, but instructive and credible, in that they ranged from positive to mixed.
Larry Cecchini of Greensboro, president of Secure Designs, an Internet security firm, said he was powerfully impressed by Cleveland's downtown – and how businesses, nonprofits and government seem to be collaborating on getting things done.
"There's some kind of juice going on here," he said. "I don't know how to bottle that, but it's what we're trying to do in Greensboro."
Ryan Peiffer of Greenville, vice president, Hughes Investments, a real estate firm, said he thought Cleveland was "cool," but he wasn't convinced that downtown had become a truly pedestrian-oriented district.
"The city feels sprawly. It doesn't feel dense to me," he said. "Even in downtown Greenville, it's an enjoyable walk. There's texture, there's public art. As I was walking down the street [in downtown Cleveland], I felt off-put."
Peiffer said the downtown Mall, which doubles as the green roof of Cleveland's new convention center, was, "a wonderful piece of property, but it's underutilized." He also criticized Cleveland for not having developed clearer pathways from the north end of the Mall over the lakefront railroad lines and the Shoreway to North Coast Harbor.
"How do I get down to the water? How do I get a coffee? A beer? Grab a sandwich? The city has got to make a concerted effort to pull people down there."
Nevertheless, he said the city has momentum.
"If it continues, it will be exciting to see in 10 years," he said.
Derrick Braziel, a project manager in Cincinnati for StriveTogether, a nonprofit that strives to improve educational outcomes, said he grew up in Middleburg Heights and frequently visits his mother there, but has rarely spent time downtown. After last week's visit, he's rethinking.
"I was always ashamed to say I was from Cleveland," he said. "Now I'm feeling a little buyer's remorse [about that attitude]. I'm really excited to see Cleveland is reinventing itself. Cleveland's a cool place to live."
Jeb Banner, the CEO of Smallbox, an Indianapolis Web marketing company, said that Cleveland surprised him.
"I was expecting the rotten core of a postindustrial city," he said. "Now I'm thinking this would be a really cool place to come back with my family.
"I've been pleasantly surprised by Cleveland," he added. "I was expecting something closer to Detroit than Chicago, but it's more like Chicago than Detroit."
The demolition of one Seattle apartment building offers a look at the housing challenges and rising costs for working-class residents.
With their old brick apartment building near Lake Union scheduled for demolition, longtime neighbors Cortney Clayton and Meaghan Howell scrambled to find new homes in Seattle's hot housing market.
They ended up in more expensive places, miles apart, after somewhat stressful searches.
Her hunt “came down to the wire,” Howell said. And then she had to make a snap decision. “If you don't want it,” her new landlord told her in a matter-of-fact way, “I have eight people who do.”
Clayton and Howell liked 1309 Dexter Ave. N., with its hardwood floors, glass doorknobs and close-to-downtown location. But the 1927 building was also near the epicenter of Seattle's Amazon-fueled boom. Its 22 units gave way to the wrecking ball and plans by a California developer for a seven-story, full-block design with 282 apartments and 259 parking stalls.
In a less than one-mile stretch of Dexter Avenue North, property owners have applied for demolition permits at 10 different addresses since 2012, including 1309 Dexter Ave. N.(Mark Nowlin / The Seattle Times) Source: City of Seattle
Sold 15 years ago for $1.8 million, the property fetched $16.7 million this past summer. “It's really the value of the dirt versus the value of history. And often the dirt has so many zeros after it,” said Kji Kelly, executive director of Historic Seattle, a preservation group that's been calling attention to increasing demolitions.
As teardowns displace tenants like Clayton and Howell, a kind of organic affordable housing is lost. It's not the subsidized kind for low-income people. It's the kind priced for moderate-income workers like Clayton, a flight attendant, and Howell, a breakfast server and afternoon bartender. And rents in new apartments average about $6,000 more per year.
In King County, the average one-bedroom apartment built since 2010 rents for $1,787, according to apartment-market research firm Dupre+Scott. For one-bedrooms in properties built between 1900 and 1944, the average is $1,298.
That's partly because new buildings have more amenities and modern design, said Mike Scott. (Shea Properties, the owner of 1309 and 1319 Dexter, did not respond to requests for an interview. Records submitted to the city said the new building on those parcels would offer a “diversity of sizes and rent levels.”)
In all, 2,104 housing units in Seattle have been demolished since 2012 to make way for new buildings. Permits to demolish an additional 1,647 units are pending or under review.
Upzones recommended by Mayor Ed Murray's housing task force would only accelerate the trend, said John Fox of the Seattle Displacement Coalition.
Murray's task force recognized the need to preserve more housing, particularly for low-income residents. It called for new tools: public funds to buy and renovate apartments at risk of demolition, and tax exemptions that encourage landlords to preserve rather than sell buildings.
New King County Assessor John Wilson is proposing tax breaks for homeowners, as well as landlords, for preservation. “What I heard from South King County to Bellevue to Belltown was that affordable housing was a top priority and we just can't afford to wait,” he said.
But in the time it takes to implement these strategies, hundreds, possibly thousands of homes could be reduced to rubble. And each demolition creates a domino effect that leaves the displaced competing for affordable rentals, often in older buildings increasingly likely to get knocked down.
Moving on
Howell spent 10 years at 1309 Dexter. She was paying $905 for a studio when she moved out in June. “The location was perfect,” she said about the 10-minute bus ride to her job at the Women's University Club downtown.
The building also seemed to foster some spirit of community. People let their cats roam the hallways, she said. Clayton let Howell use her washing machine.
Howell found a 700-square-foot apartment in a small building in Ballard for $995. But she now pays for water-sewer-garbage and heat, adding $100 to $150 to her monthly housing costs.
“I don't have many amenities, as they say. But it's fine for me,” she said, “because I didn't have other options.”
While she's four miles farther from her job, she feels lucky because her new place is bigger and she likes Ballard. “I now have more social things, restaurants and stores, I can walk to,” she said.
Clayton's situation was complicated by romance.
She was paying $1,400 for a two-bedroom, top-floor unit at the old building, where she lived nine years. Then she met Jeff Howes, a software systems administrator.
Howes was living farther north on Dexter, in a four-bedroom house with two roommates where he paid $800 for rent. But that house was sold to make way for new condos. Howes moved in with Clayton last year.
The savings were short-lived. They spent about $300, Clayton said, just on applications for apartments. “I did not want to move anywhere on Dexter,” Clayton said of the canyon of apartments that now dominate the street, along with a new Facebook office building and the new headquarters of Pemco Insurance. “I'm not into paying for a rooftop deck,” she said of the new apartments with names like True North.
Howes works at home and wanted a place with a view. He and Clayton finally found one, an 1,800-square-foot beauty in Queen Anne, renting for $3,400. The couple put up more than $10,000 in first and last month's rent plus security deposit.
“It was the very top of my budget,” Clayton said.
Holding the line
Wilson, the assessor-elect, is calling for a new 10-year tax exemption for owners of affordable rentals, whether in small buildings or “in-law” apartments, also known as accessory dwelling units.
If landlords know they have a 10-year tax exemption, Wilson said, they'll be more likely to invest in upkeep and upgrades.
Under his plan, rents in such properties would be set so tenants making about $20 an hour, or less, would pay no more than 30 percent of their income for housing.
Wilson's plan would require changing state law, which means lobbying both King County's elected leadersand legislators in Olympia.
Murray is on a similar path. He'll unveil a tax-exemption proposal in December or January, according to spokesman Viet Shelton. The mayor, too, is rounding up allies for changing state law.
Murray's staff aims to create a kind of early-alert strategy to identify neighborhoods and buildings where the risks of demolition and displacement are most dire. The need is escalating. Dupre+Scott projects 38,000 new units will be built in the next three years.
“We're trying to go as fast as we can, but there is the Seattle process we have to respect and adhere to,” Shelton said.
The mayor does not plan to propose a new source of funds for preservation, as his task force recommended, said Robert Feldstein, the mayor's top policy adviser.
The city now buys and preserves some apartment buildings. But those acquisitions are for low-income rentals, primarily very-low-income rentals, said Steve Walker, the city's housing director. They've preserved 192 units in the last six years.
These approaches may prove helpful for low-income housing where the greatest need exists. But, like Seattle's historical-preservation laws, they may not help residents of a building like 1309 Dexter.
“The oldest, most decorous buildings have mechanisms that can protect them,” said Kelly, of Historic Seattle. “The troubling thing for preservation is all those buildings that provide character to neighborhoods but are not eligible for protection.”
A train car derailed in Metro's Alexandria railyard on Monday afternoon, apparently due to a forgotten chock holding one wheel in place.(Photo by John McDonnell/The Washington Post)
A Metro train derailed at an Alexandria railyard Monday afternoon, apparently after a worker failed to remove a safety block from underneath one of the wheels designed to prevent it from accidentally rolling.
No one was injured in the incident, the agency said.
“Preliminarily, it appears that personnel neglected to remove one of the chocks that was under the wheel,” Metro spokesman Dan Stessel said.
The derailment occurred when a 3000-series railcar was being moved out of a workshop building at a slow speed, Stessel said. One set of wheels went over a wheel chock — a safety device intended to immobilize the wheels — and came off the rails, causing minor damage to the car and tracks but resulting in no injuries or effects on train service. Stessel called the incident “really minor.”
The employee responsible for removing the wheel chock has been removed from service while Metro safety officials investigate the incident.
“Any discipline would be determined only after the investigation is concluded,” Stessel said.
Safety chocks have been an area of focus for Metro staff in recent months, after a Federal Transit Administration report issued in August criticized the agency for failing to consistently use wheel chocks and hand brakes while storing trains.
In that report, the FTA urged Metro supervisors to enforce the widespread use of wheel chocks at railyards — in part to prevent derailments or safety mishaps that could endanger workers.
“Preventing unintended movement of rail vehicles is fundamental to safety and [the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority] needs to do more to eliminate these types of incidents from happening,” then-U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a statement at the time. “Verifying that a train has been properly secured is a common sense solution to prevent accidents.”
[FTA cites Metro's ‘universal misunderstandings' on storing, securing rail cars]
New Yorker Barry Hoggard draws a line in the sand when it comes to online privacy. In May he said farewell to 1251 Facebook friends by deleting his account of four years to protest what he calls the social network's eroding privacy policies.
"I'm sick of keeping track of my Facebook privacy settings and what boxes I have to check to protect myself," says Hoggard, a computer programmer. "I don't have a lot of illusions about online privacy, but Facebook has gone too far," he says of Facebook's recent privacy policy changes.
From Facebook to advertisers who may be putting your online identity up for sale to the highest bidder, and to strangers who could track you across town, new ways of using technology and the Internet are making privacy issues a flash point for controversy.
"Privacy today isn't what it was a year ago," says Jeffrey Chester, director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit group that promotes online privacy and free speech. "It wasn't long ago we were worried about advertisers planting cookies on our PC," he says. With today's trends, keeping a handle on your privacy is going to become even harder a year from now, he adds.
What follows are several emerging privacy threats.
Social Networks
Do social networks herald the end of privacy? Lots of former Facebook users who recently ditched their accounts in protest think so. With 450 million users, many say, Facebook is a bellwether for other social networks on user privacy.
Swapping small talk and vacation photos made Facebook addictive for users. But over the years, they've watched as their private info became shared with a growing sphere of strangers--advertisers. And in May, Facebook made changes to its privacy policy that exposed more personal data to a wider range of marketers.
One change involved the Instant Personalization pilot program, which let selected Facebook partner Websites access your data and tailor content to your tastes. With Instant Personalization activated, your Facebook information can be accessed the moment you arrive on partner sites including Microsoft's Docs.com, Pandora, and Yelp. When the program launched in April, Facebook automatically activated it for all users. However, a privacy uproar forced the company to revise its policy. Instant Personalization is now optional for users.
Facebook has suffered privacy backlashes before. In 2007 it introduced Beacon, an ad system that tracked certain actions of Facebook users on 44 partner sites so as to report those actions back to users' Facebook friends network. But many users revolted, citing privacy concerns. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg quickly apologized and made Beacon an optional feature.
"Facebook is literally turning down the Facebook privacy settings for its users," says Electronic Privacy Information Center director Marc Rotenberg. In early May, EPIC and 14 other consumer groups filed a complaint against Facebook with the Federal Trade Commission. The complaint accuses the site of following unfair and deceptive business practices, in part, for disclosing previously private details to the public.
Google Buzz (the search giant's social network) has also endured privacy issues. Buzz exposed a list of users' most frequently accessed e-mail contacts when it launched earlier this year.
Social networks have forced users to rethink what privacy is in a world where public sharing of private lives has become commonplace, observes Jeremy Mishkin, an attorney specializing in privacy law. "The real issue is how best to assure individuals they have control of their own information," Mishkin says.
Facebook declined interviews, but issued a statement: "It's important that Facebook and other sites provide [users] with clear control over what information they want to share, when they want to share it, and with whom. We're listening to feedback and evaluating the best way to respond to concerns."

Data Harvesting
Creating a digital profile on you gets a lot easier if you are on Facebook or Google Buzz and hanging a shingle on LinkedIn. That marketers use your interest in, say, Volkswagen cars to target-market you a new Jetta may be no surprise. But will your Facebook status ever be used by a credit agency, health care provider, or future employer to determine if you are a good bet?
Firms such as California-based Rapleaf say they are working with financial institutions to run their databases of e-mail addresses to assemble customer profiles based on information shared on social networks. Rapleaf's vice president of business development, Joel Jewitt, says it collaborates with company marketing departments, not credit-approval departments, to better target financial services to banking customers.
Rapleaf is merely one of many firms--ranging from Acxiom to Unbound Technology--that tap into social networks to marry your profiles, tweets, and LinkedIn information with your e-mail address. If a company wants to know more about you, it can just hire one of these outfits.
The firms bristle at the notion that your credit card interest rates could be jacked up based on a tweet that you just got laid off. But privacy experts say that this may be a reality in coming years (see related story: "Can Your Online Life Ruin Your Credit?").
To privacy activists, online advertisers have always been too smart for their own good. Now two emerging trends in advertising have privacy groups once more complaining that Madison Avenue has gone too far.
Remember that piezoelectric road prototype we saw late last year? Looks like someone (besides us) thought it was a good idea. According to The Daily Mail, a Sainsbury's supermarket in Gloucester, UK (you've never been there), has installed kinetic plates in the parking lot that use the weight of shopper's cars to pump a series of hydraulic pipes, which in turn drive a generator. The system is said to generate up to 30kw of energy an hour -- or enough to power the store's checkouts. And if that weren't enough, the store is also harvesting rainwater and heating it (during the summer, at least) with solar panels. The next in this store's "eco-friendly evolution?" Might we suggest Soylent in the deli? We hear the "green" stuff is particularly good.[Via Green Launches , Thanks Deepa]
“I think there's this strange myth that atheists have nothing to live for. It's the opposite. We have nothing to die for… We have everything to live for.” – Ricky Gervais
What a wonderful life. Has this statement ever entered your mind? Have you ever said it out loud? I hope you feel this way. What an amazing life to be born at the most fascinating period of time to date of human existence. What an amazing thing to be a conscious mass of star dust. What an amazing series of fortunate events that allowed this to happen. But there is a catch.
Just as everything lives, everything dies. Along with youth, growth and promise is the decline and suffering of old age for those lucky or unfortunate enough to get there. Eventually everyone succumbs in the hopeless battle against the friend and enemy called time.
In the Big Picture our lives are amazingly minuscule in measurements of time and space. But we don't live in the Big Picture. We live where the needle is currently hitting the record in our own tiny place on earth. This is our time where our lives matter very much. We're not dead yet.
There is no reassuring fantasy for the atheist. No comforting myth. Reason has overcome the survival instinct. Our beliefs are built on reality as in what we know to be tangible. As much as we'd love to live forever, we know that the days of our existence are numbered. The billions of people who have died before us and the thousands dying every day, we will be like they are in time. Don't fear the reaper.
The end comes soon enough, so while we have this life let's live it. Take in the eating and drinking, the family, the friends, the celebrations, the music, the plays, the movies, the books, the sights, the sounds, the smells, the games, the chats, the laughter, the places we remember, the new adventures, the travels, the desires, the pleasures, the accomplishments, the victories, the meaning that we've made, the promises we've fulfilled. And when the time comes let us die in gratitude. What a wonderful life.

The first to voice shock over Reynders' participation in the event was French reporter François Beaudonnet, a correspondent for television channel France 2. In an article published Wednesday, Beaudonnet questioned whether it was appropriate for the country's foreign minister to take part in a folk tradition that carries such strong colonialist undertones.

Reynders posted images of Saturday's parade to Twitter and to his blog , writing that, "The Noirauds' motto is 'fun and charity.' Both components have been fully met again this year and it is with joy and good humor that I have attended."

The images of Reynders in blackface also triggered a flurry of reactions on social media and comments in the Belgian press, and beyond.

The tradition of the Noirauds dates back to 1876, when Brussels dignitaries launched a fundraising campaign to build a day care center in the capital. They decided to collect money in the city's restaurants, and used blackface to maintain their anonymity.
"We put this makeup on to be noticed, yet to remain anonymous," one of the group's members told France 3.
The organization's president, Jean-François Simon, told VICE News that the founders of the group had originally picked out their costumes because they were "inspired by Africa." The historic parade was born just a few months after the 1876 Brussels Geographic Conference, an Africa-themed summit organized by King Leopold II.
Ever since, the tradition has been rooted in Belgian folklore, with very few raising an eyebrow at the bizarre tradition, except for a contingent of bloggers and minority advocates.
The Mayor of Brussels Yvan Mayeur also reportedly took part in the parade this weekend.
Simon said he was surprised by the accusations of racism that have surfaced since the event.
"We're surprised by the big song and dance made by the reporter on France 2," he told VICE News. "Our movement is not racist, we have black fundraisers who must also wear black makeup because their skin is brown, not black, and we help all children, regardless of race."
In Belgium and France, the concept of blackface is not as controversial as it is in the US, where the practice was basically phased out of society following the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, although high-profile incidences periodically surface in America, particularly around Halloween.
In 2013, a journalist for French ELLE stirred up controversy abroad after posting an image of herself disguised as Solange Knowles on Instagram. She later issued a public apology, saying that she, "didn't realize the seriousness of her action."

Challenging Compulsory Hijab: Reception at Swedish Ambassador's Residence in Tehran
02/14/17
By: Naimeh Doostar, Radio Zamaneh
An Iranian newspaper has published photos of Swedish female diplomats and business executives attending a function at the Swedish embassy in Tehran. The publishing of the photos by a state media is unprecedented as the Islamic Republic has never acknowledged the right of foreign female representatives to choose their own attire while visiting Iran, imposing the veil upon them.
Opening ceremony for the Swedish Chamber of Commerce, in Tehran
The Swedish government has since defended subjecting female diplomats to veiling laws, expressing that Sweden respects the laws of Islamic Republic of Iran.
Now some Iranian gender equality activists are asking the Swedish government -- is a trade deal with Iran worth ignoring the right of female diplomats (or any other women in Iran) to choose their attire and have control over their bodies?
Do Trade Deals help the Situation of Human Rights?
On 13 Feb, the Swedish diplomats in Tehran hosted the opening ceremony and reception for the Swedish Chamber of Commerce in Tehran, in the residence of the Swedish Ambassador.
The function which was attended by the Swedish prime minister and his delegation as well as a number of Iranian ministers, diplomats and business representatives was far from a simple business meeting. The women in Stefan Lofven's delegation did not wear the Islamic veil on the embassy's soil.
Ann Linder, the Swedish trade minister signing documents with an Iranian counterpart
Respecting the laws of the sovereign country that owns the property of Embassy is not unusual in Iran. However it is not conventional to publish photos of female diplomats and envoys visiting Iran in their western apparels.
The women who were clearly in the majority within the Swedish delegation and who had attended the earlier ceremonies hosted by Iran, covering their hair in compliance with hijab regulations for women under the Islamic Republic laws, attended the reception at the home of the Swedish Ambassador without the Islamic veil.
Tasnim News Agency in Iran, a conservative media outlet funded by the Islamic Republic published the photos of the women delegates with uncovered hair.
Stefan Lofven's trip to Iran has already been controversial in the Swedish parliament with some representatives questioning the prime minister's trip to a country that is accused of human rights violations. Lofven's however dismissed his critics saying establishment of commercial and trade relations will lead to gradual steps toward constructive change including the situation of human rights.
Swedish arm of PEN International urged the Prime Minister not to exclude human rights discussions in his trip, specifically asking him to push for the release of human rights activist Nargess Mohammadi.
The appearance of Swedish delegates in the meeting in Tehran wearing hijab triggered protests from some women's rights activists who questioned how the Swedish administration reconciled its feminist agenda with the silent compliance of its female representatives to compulsory hijab.
The question remains, if trade agreements are to lead to gradual progress in the areas of women, minority and human rights, then how can this be achieved if women in foreign envoys are not granted equal rights?
The protests were more poignant as earlier this month Sweden's Deputy Prime Minister Isabella Lovin posted on Facebook a direct swipe at Donald Trump's patriarchy by mocking him in a photo of Lovin surrounded by seven female members of her staff signing a proposal of the country's new climate law.
Why would a government that cares about gender equality and equity, allow its female representative and diplomats to bow to compulsory hijab in order to sign a trade agreement with Iran? Are we now selling out on the right of women to control their bodies because of some trade agreement?
Iranian Conservatives React to the Photos
The conservatives in Iran on the other hand lashed out at the publishing of female diplomat's photos as well as the choice of having the ceremony for the opening of the chamber at the Swedish ambassador's residence.

Hossein Shariatmadari, the ultra conservative editor-in-chief of the Tehran daily Keyhan, slammed the Iranian ministers, diplomats and bureaucrats attending the ceremony at the ambassador's residence and called it an affront to the Islamic values of Iran.
He writes that apparently a number of strings had been pulled at the behest of the Swedish Prime Minister and Ambassador to have the ceremony at the ambassador's residence. Shariatmadari says this was done specifically to have the women attend without hijab and describes it as an "unprecedented violation of international relations and a direct insult to the Iranian officials" and the country's laws.
Ann Linder, the Swedish trade minister who before this reception appeared in a photograph with a blue shawl on her hair signing documents with an Iranian counterpart, had reportedly expressed her discomfort about covering her hair but said that she did not want to break the laws of her host country.
This line of argument - respect for the host country's laws- stands in contrast to the claim of "flourishing of trade will bring about gradual change". The gradual change will never come if western diplomats initiating relations with Iran sell out on pressuring the Iranian state to acknowledge the rights of women.
Challenges to the Compulsory Veil by Female Diplomats
Iran's compulsory hijab for women has been challenged a number of times by foreign female politicians.
Iran Sweden trade meeting in Feb 2017 in Tehran.
In 2014 Emma Bonino, the Italian foreign minister reportedly protested against the need to cover her hair during a trip to Iran after her plane landed in Tehran. Bonino had reportedly said: "How come Iranian officials do not attend our receptions because we serve alcohol, so I am not willing to give in to this restriction either."
Bonino ended up bowing to the mores of diplomacy and wearing the hijab while in Iran.
Some believe that establishing trade and political relations after years of sanctions is a positive development for Iran and national interests should take precedence over human rights concerns.
For instance when female Iranian-American chess player Nazi Pakizdeh and some other contenders boycotted Women's World Chess Championships (2017) in protest to compulsory veiling laws, many claimed that it was a blow to growth of sports opportunities in Iran especially for women. It still is arguable that losing the privilege of hosting the Women's World Chess Championships could have also created positive ripples of change by forcing the Islamic Republic government to rethink its priorities.
Glimpse of Hope For Change
Swedish opposition has proposed that the signing of the agreements did not necessarily have to take place in Iran and could instead have been done in Sweden with no restrictions on how the women involved in the event should dress.
It is clear that the appearance of Swedish delegates in Iran donning hijab was a blow to the image of Sweden as a country that fights for women's control over their bodies.
Nevertheless the idea of holding the launch ceremony in the Swedish Ambassador's residence can also be regarded as gradual feminist step, albeit a small step, to initiate pressure on Iran to respect the rights of women diplomats to choose their clothing.
The Swedish delegation presence in Iran and the choice of having a reception on embassy soil, is an initiative to respect the right of women in these political and economic envoys.
The photos of Swedish female diplomats and bureaucrats at a reception in Tehran has certainly angered the ultra conservative forces and the hardliners in Iran. This can be a start and strategy to be adopted by other female foreign officials visiting Iran.
A BRUMMIE resurgence is in full swing. Visitors arriving at New Street railway station are met by a wall of quotes, trumpeting the advantages of the city: first for quality of life outside London; 40% of the population under 25; the highest concentration of companies outside the capital. Foodies note that Birmingham has five restaurants with a Michelin star. The sense of revitalisation is all over, not least at the construction of a central complex called Paradise Circus, alongside a swanky new library and a symphony hall housing one of the best orchestras in Europe.
It is not before time. Birmingham has spent much of the post-war era down in the economic and architectural dumps. Unemployment is falling but still high. Local politicians now hope that a new devolution deal could help the reboot, unlocking billions of pounds of investment in the city over the next couple of decades.

The devolution of power to English cities was championed by the previous chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne. Manchester, Birmingham's great rival, was first out of the blocks. Manchester has agreed to a deal in which it will have an elected mayor from May 2017, and more control over budgets for transport and skills training. Earlier this year the government devolved to it the whole £6 billion ($7.3 billion) budget for health and social care in the region. There were fears that the new prime minister, Theresa May, and her chancellor, Philip Hammond, had cooled on the idea. Some took the resignation of Lord O'Neill, Mr Osborne's right-hand man on the issue, and the retirement of Sir Howard Bernstein, Manchester's chief executive, as a vote of no confidence.
Yet at the Conservative Party conference earlier this month, Mrs May clarified that she was committed to devolution. Brexit-supporting, working-class voters in the north need something to boost their economic fortunes, and more empowered local government could help. Where Mr Osborne touted the “Northern Powerhouse”, anchored in Manchester, Mrs May seems keener on revving up the “Midlands Engine”, based around Birmingham. In Andy Street, a former boss of the John Lewis retail chain, the Tories have a candidate running for mayor of the West Midlands next year who has a chance of winning, unlike in Manchester and Liverpool, which are both more solidly Labour.
The West Midlands was late to put forward a devolution bid and some thought the political diversity of the region might scupper co-operation. The deal offered in return for signing up for a mayor is modest: about £37m a year over 30 years. But, says Bob Sleigh, the councillor co-ordinating the initiative, it could unlock as much as £7 billion more, including £4.4 billion attached to the construction of HS2, a high-speed railway due to reach Birmingham by 2026. “If there were no devolution it would make it much more difficult for us to maximise the economic benefits of HS2,” he says. Fiscal devolution is a future aim.
Though the Brummies are on board, the Geordies are not. The North East formed an alliance of seven councils including Newcastle and Sunderland with a view to taking advantage of devolution. But last month they voted, by four to three, to reject a similar deal for reasons that seem part parochial politics, part cynicism of Westminster and part anger at austerity. “We'd be getting central government functions devolved with massively reduced budgets for us to administer our own cuts,” says Martin Gannon, leader of Gateshead council. Ben Harrison of the Centre for Cities, a think-tank, says the absence of a big project with regional implications like HS2 may have made it harder for local leaders to see how devolution would improve things across the region. But “it is highly unlikely that turning down a devolution deal means you'll avoid needing to implement cuts,” he says. “It just means less control over the future of your economy.”
Even with its deal, the West Midlands has a big task. Productivity is below the national average. Only one of its seven councils is a net contributor to the Treasury. Across the region there is a higher than average proportion of unskilled people and a lower than average proportion of graduates. Devolution is part of a long game to address this. And Birmingham has a head start over some northern regions, where progress could be even slower.
Perhaps most difficult will be overcoming the cynicism, and apathy, of the public. “There's no point in a mayor,” says Phil Reeves, a 56-year-old railway worker smoking a cigarette outside New Street station, echoing a widely held view. “I don't trust any of them, and I don't believe the ordinary man will benefit from any of it.” It will be up to the West Midlands' new mayor to prove him wrong.

The Raspberry Pi is a tiny (think cigarette packet sized) computer designed to be cheap and easy to use for projects. A tool to teach computer science to schools and third world countries, they have inspired many people and are used for millions of projects. They are available for £20-30 and are awesome to have, even as just a small backup computer! There are of course downsides to a system that small, it lacks significant processing power for any major scale work, even the recommended operating systems tend to be smaller versions of Linux.
So the question one might ask is it powerful enough to produce music on it?
Many will say it's not feasible. The only “proper” DAW (digital audio workstation) available for Linux anyway is Ardour , which is way too much for the Raspberry Pi to handle. Since you can't really install another kind of operating system, you are basically out of luck.
But, it turns out there is a way, Non . Thanks to a developer called Jonathan Liles, an American software architect and musician who has made it possible. Setting out to make a DAW under the aim of it being “fast, light, [and] reliable” he has developed a modular system great for use on small computers, such as the Pi itself.
Best of all, Non is entirely FREE!!!
At 43k lines of code, it is an impressive feat, getting most software in that size is admirable, let alone a fully functioning DAW. He aims to maintain simplicity throughout the life of Non.
Non differs from other DAWs in its modular nature in which each component can work independently of the others. Originally designed as the Non-Sequencer, when Liles encountered difficulty with the available resources, he kicked the project into gear using JACK , a recently released, low latency sound server.
Non comes with several modular packages:
Non-Sequencer – A MIDI sequencer
Non-DAW – The timeline/arranger section
Non-Mixer – The mixer section with plugin hosting
The only real issues with Non as a DAW are that it is very much a one-man project, he is releasing it for free and updates are infrequent. Obviously, for the serious producer, this won't be a problem, as they will have another DAW, and for the hobbyist fan of Raspberry Pi hardware, it will be enough to tinker about with, so don't let that put anyone off.
If you do plan on running it on a Raspberry Pi, you will find you need more kit eg. a soundcard , however after the price of a Pi, you will likely have some money spare for these extra devices.
It really comes as a shock to realise that most computers are more powerful than the Pi, and so should really be able to handle sound production processes. In reality, the bottleneck is the size of most software DAWs.
When provided with enough computing power (as most modern computers provide), developers don't need to refine and streamline their products as much. This, in turn, leads to unnecessary amounts of code in some cases. Yes, most computers can handle it, it's still a waste of efficiency.
It's only when you get someone who realises what can be done, and is willing to invest the time, that you realise how little computing is necessary.
For best performance, I would recommend using the latest model Raspberry Pi's (I have embedded some options from Amazon below which show the current prices, Adblock may prevent this from showing so here is the link)

Despite the blood soaked journal of suspected New Jersey and New York bomber Ahmad Khan Rahami containing three references to ISIS, Federal Prosecutors have covered up this terrorist link in there official charges.
A report by Fox News says that a page revealed from the bloody journal of the New York and New Jersey bombing suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami showed three names commonly associated with the Islamic State terror group and its followers, yet federal investigators included only one of those words in their complaint charging him on Tuesday.
An image of the page, revealed during a House Homeland Security Committee hearing on Wednesday, shows a reference to Anwar al-Awlaki — the American-born Muslim cleric who was killed in a 2011 drone strike and whose preaching has inspired acts of terror linked to ISIS and Al Qaeda.
However, it also references Abu Muhammad al-Adnani — the ISIS spokesman killed by coalition forces in August after he called his followers to attack non-believers in their homelands.

The death of the young animal, known as ‘Snowy' for its ‘notably white face', comes at a fraught time for grizzly bears and their advocates
The sole cub of one of the US's most beloved grizzly bears was reportedly struck and killed by a car on Sunday evening in Grand Teton national park in Wyoming, prompting mourning among lovers of the mother animal known as 399.
Wyoming Wildlife Advocates announced the news in a Facebook post: “399's cub, known as Snowy or Spirit by the bear watchers of Grand Teton, was adored for its antics and notably white face and will be sorely missed.”
Park officials will not have official confirmation that the bear cub hit and killed on Sunday evening was 399's cub until they conduct DNA testing.

However, “based on the cub's marking, the bear's marking, and the bear's location, we're reasonably confident,” about the identification, said Andrew White, spokesman for Grand Teton national park.
399 removed her cub's body from the road, park officials said in a statement.
The death of the bear cub comes at a fraught time for the grizzly bears and their advocates in the western US.
The federal government has proposed removing them from the list of animals protected by the Endangered Species Act. Activists are attempting to forestall the delisting, while wildlife officials in Wyoming and Montana have begun preparing for the possibility of legal hunting of the bears.
“This incident with 399's cub shows just how vulnerable park bears in Greater Yellowstone are,” Roger Hayden of Wyoming Wildlife Advocates, which opposes delisting grizzlies, told National Geographic.
399, a 20-year-old grizzly bear, rose to fame in 2006 when she began spending time with three cubs near the roadways in Grand Teton park, according to the Jackson Hole News & Guide.
Over the years, the bear maintained her presence in accessible parts of the park, and became a favorite with photographers and tourists. 399 was the subject of the 2015 book, Grizzlies of Pilgrim Creek, whose author's call her “the world's most famous bear”.
In 2007, 399 mauled a hiker and was nearly killed by park officials, but her life was spared when the hiker spoke up in her defense, according to National Geographic.
This May, the bear's fans were delighted to see 399 emerge from hibernation with a single cub, especially after a hunter had claimed over the winter to have killed her.
“To see these two bears together was magical,” said Deby Dixon, a wildlife photographer who moved to Wyoming five years ago after reading an article about 399. “I'd never seen her play with her cubs before, but these two played. They were close together. It was almost like they were buddies.”

“It's sort of like a member of the family when you watch them grow up you watch them interact with their mother, travel around and that kind of thing,” said Dixon.
The area near the accident site has been closed by park officials, and will remain closed for a few days, White said.
“For the next day or two [399] can be fairly unpredictable,” White said. “After a day or two, she'll become accustomed to not having a cub.”
Sunday was a particularly deadly day in Grand Teton national park; an adult female black bear was also struck and killed by a car earlier in the evening.
Cars strike about 100 large mammals a year in the park, according to White, but deer, bison and elk are much more likely to be hit. Just one or two bears are struck by cars per year on average.
“These unfortunate incidents are an important reminder for all of us to slow down and be vigilant when we travel through the park,” the park superintendent, David Vela, said in a statement. Vela advised park visitors to abide by speed limits and be particularly careful around dawn and dusk.
Fractals for Fun and Profit
Unlike me, my wife uses computers for serious calculations to answer important questions. One of these problems involves taking the cross-correlations of the continuous seismic data of hundreds of measuring stations. A computation that can take days or even weeks. Interestingly, it turns out that a large part of this time is spent loading data from disks into memory. To better understand the problem, let us take a high-level look at the calculation of cross-correlations in Pythonesque pseudo-code:
# given is some list of stations, say a list of names of the data files stations = [..] # correlate, one by one, each unique pair of stations for i in range(len(stations)) : for j in range(i+1, range(len(stations))) : # the following correlates both the pair (i,j) and (j,i) computation(stations[i], stations[j])
The pseudo-code traverses all possible combinations of two stations and computes the so called cross-correlation. Each station's signal consists of a large data-file that is stored on disk and must be loaded into memory to compute the correlation. Loading memory from disk is an expensive operation, because even modern disks are slow compared to the processor and memory. Luckily the system caches data, i.e., it reuses data that is still stored in memory in stead of reloading it. But the system has limited and varying (on a shared system) memory capacity. When the memory is full, data that is not yet in the memory will replace the least recently used data.
Thus the order in which we access the station's data – the so-called schedule – determines the number of disk accesses. The question is, what schedule minimizes the number of disk reads and maximize the use of the cache. Moreover, what can we do without knowing the size of the memory?
As I found out two years ago the Sierpinski fractal curve provides a good, and probably asymptotically optimal, schedule. For my and (hopefully) your amusement, I've now rewritten some of the experiments in the programming language Elm to present the elegant Sierpinsky curve and its discretized brother the H-index.
Computing the Cost of a Schedule
A schedule can be visualized as a path through a square matrix where each cell consists of a combination of two stations. Such a combination is called a job. Only the lower (or upper) triangle of the matrix need to be visited as we consider (3,4) a duplicate of (4,3). The pseudo-code above defines the following schedule that we call the scanline schedule.
The displayed schedule thus starts correlating station 1 with itself, then correlates 1 with 2, 2 with 2, etc. The cost – in terms of the number of disk accesses or cache misses – of this schedule can be computed by simulating the execution while keeping track of the cache's contents and counting the number of times we load a station's data that is not yet in memory. Running such a simulation with memory capacity for five elements gives the following cumulative cost for the successive executions.
The cumulative cost shows that the scanline schedule initially (up to 15) performs quite well, but once the horizontal stretches of the schedule are longer than 5 each new job results in a cache miss. In fact, one can do quite a bit better by making shorter stretches.
Give it a try in the scheduler below! Click on the circles in the matrix to schedule a job and on + and – in the upper right corner to increase or decrease memory capacity. The goal is to minimize total cost of the schedule.
To help you make a path, unscheduled elements in the path have been marked and colored with their cost.
The Sierpinsky Curve or H-Index
It turns out to be quite challenging to find the best schedule with the least disk accesses. Some experimenting also shows that the performance of a schedule changes quite a bit for different memory sizes. That complicates our task, especially considering that memory capacity may change during execution. For example, when the correlations are done on a supercomputer that is shared by other scientists running similar experiments.
However, one quickly notices that it is generally better not to make large jumps. That is, to make a schedule where the most recent jobs are close together in the matrix. This observation leads to a divide and conquer strategy, where we subdivide the triangle of jobs into smaller triangles and schedule the jobs in the first triangle before the second. Applying this pattern recursively, we get the following sequence.
In addition to the subdivision of triangles, a line is drawn that visits each of the triangles exactly once. The line is the (lower triangle of the) Sierpinsky curve a fractal curve that, when the subdivision is repeated infinitely, will visit each point in the triangle without every crossing itself.
Now, consider the triangle of jobs to be scheduled and subdivide it recursively in smaller triangles until all triangles consist of exactly one job. The Sierpinsky curve through the triangles now describes a schedule!
Well almost: the jobs cannot properly be subdivided in triangles because jobs cannot be split. Therefore, we use the discrete incarnation of the Sierpinski curve that is called the H-index. In this context “index” is another word for schedule and the H stands for the shape the pattern takes: there's an H on its side in the lower right corner. The H-index defines the following schedule:
The strength of the H-index is that it has very good locality: any two jobs that are scheduled closely together (in time) will also be close together (in distance) in the matrix of jobs. Locality is important because jobs that are close in the matrix are more likely to be in the cache.
How much better does the H-index do? The following graph plots the cost in termes of cache misses of each schedule for a case with 64 stations and therefore 576 jobs for increasing memory capacity.
The range is limited from 2 to 64: one needs to be able to store at least two and if memory has capacity for 64 stations all schedules will have cost 64 because every job has to be loaded exactly once. The cost of the scanline algorithm is dominated by a linear relation also seen in the last part (after job 16) in the previous plot. One may also note that the H-index performs best when the memory capacity is a power of two, note in particular the low points at 4, 8 and 16. In between those spots the H-index becomes slightly irregular but generally the plotted curve quicly approaches the minimum number of loads.
Conclusion
Hopefully the final plot convinces you that the Sierpinski curve, or more accurately, H-index performs much better than the scanline schedule. However, I have not proven that the H-index is the optimal schedule. In fact, one can easily show that for certain memory sizes, such as in the manual scheduling exercise, it is possible to do (slightly) better than the H-index. Rolf Niedermeiera, Klaus Reinhardt and Peter Sanders, who invented the H-index, have given strong evidence that it is asymptotically optimal.
Does this mean we should remove all matrix traversals based on nested for loops – the scanline schedule – and replace them with with a H-index based traversel? Probably not. Much has been done to optimize such loops in compilers to fine-tune their caching behavior. The experiment presented here only took into account a very special case and has many assumptions on the behavior of the cache that will not hold for many systems.
For example, cpu caches typically use different replacement strategies; they do not simply replace the least recently used element if it is full. Yet, the Sierpinsky curve and H-index have found their way into many computing-intensive applications, from image processing to databases, and may also benefit you.
This post is too small to introduce a practical incarnation of the curve. An attentive reader may have noticed that I've only used examples where the number of stations is a power of two. This is no coincidence: the H-index is really only defined for those sizes. One can, however, adapt the index for larger sizes in ways that most of the schedule will be according to the h-index. Practical applications and their empirical evaluation is left to future work.
Post Scriptum
As for my previous project in Elm, I had fun writing this. Working with such a new language is an interesting experience: one one hand you are exploring new ways to do things, but on the other hand you have to reinvent the wheel all the time. It certainly makes you appreciate the time and effort spent by others on libraries in more mature languages. For example, I spent an inordinate amount of time on the plots, at times resulting in atrocious code.
You are free to look at/steal the code but you're going against doctor's orders.
NJ Rep. Tom MacArthur. Thomson Reuters
WASHINGTON — House Republicans hoping to overhaul the federal tax code using their newly unveiled bill need to legislate quickly to avoid another debacle like they faced during the failed attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare, according to one GOP lawmaker.
"I'm not sure this gets better with time," Rep. Tom MacArthur of New Jersey said Thursday. "It's not a like a fine bottle of wine. I don't think we go home for Thanksgiving before we vote."
The urgency to pass a tax reform bill on a tight deadline is a major concern among Senate Republicans as well, some of whom suggested weekend and holiday work are in the near future.
MacArthur is one of a handful of Republicans on the fence about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was released Thursday. Some are concerned about the way certain provisions would affect their high-taxed, predominantly Democratic constituents.
The bill in its current form does not have a high enough cap on mortgage interest deductions, MacArthur told reporters, adding that he is unsure if such improvements can be made. The bill would reduce the cap from $1 million to $500,000, which sent homebuilder stocks and other other groups into a frenzy after the bill was introduced Thursday morning.
Blue state Republicans are worried that the tax bill won't benefit their constituents
The Republicans representing blue states are conflicted about the bill.
Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York immediately rejected the bill, citing the elimination of the state and local tax deduction, as well as a $10,000 cap on property tax deductions.
"I am a No to this bill in its current form," Zeldin said in a statement. "We need to fix this State and Local Tax deduction issue. Adding back in the property tax deduction up to $10,000 is progress, but not enough progress. If I'm not fighting for New Yorkers, I can't expect anyone else from another state to do it for me."
Rep. Elise Stefanik, also of New York, called the bill "a starting point" in a statement.
"I will be working with my colleagues in the New York delegation to improve this plan to provide real tax relief for New Yorkers and to address the issue of state and local tax deductions," Stefanik added. "My goal for this process is to make certain that families and businesses in our district receive tax relief. I encourage all of our constituents to read this plan and contact my offices by phone or email to share their feedback."
Contrary to Stefanik's statement that the New York delegation would be working together to hash out their demands, Rep. Chris Collins shrugged off any such plans.
"We're gonna be one by one," Collins told Business Insider. "And I'm a yes, [Tom] Reed's a yes, I understand there'll be some Nos. I think when people actually run the numbers and they see all if not most all of their constituents are gonna pay less in taxes, why would you not support this?"

Moments ago inside the Aleppo Governorate's northern countryside, the predominately Kurdish “People's Protection Units” (YPG) imposed full control over the imperative village of Deir Jamal after they forced the Islamist rebels of Harakat Ahrar Al-Sham and Jabhat Al-Shamiyah (Levantine Front) to retreat east following a violent confrontation on Sunday evening.
With the YPG seizing the village of Deir Jamal in northern Aleppo, the primary highway to the Mennagh Military Airport is now closed off to the Syrian Armed Forces and the Islamist rebels that once controlled this base.
Moreover, the loss of Deir Jamal to the YPG has put the Islamist rebels in a difficult position in northern Aleppo, as they are now wedged between three different forces: the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) and their allies; the YPG and Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF); and the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham (ISIS).
What could possibly happen in the coming months is the YPG's expansion into the strategic border-city of ‘Azaz, while the Syrian Arab Army concentrates on the rebel stronghold of Tal Rifa'at in northern Aleppo.
Of course, this will be no easy task, give the proximity of these cities to the Turkish border and the large presence of Jihadists in the area.

Wifyer addresses crucial low cost mobile usage when abroad By Duruthu Edirimuni Chandrasekera View(s): View(s):
Imagine going abroad, trying to access your e-mail and stopping short when you remember charges for data transfer are expensive?
Well it's not so anymore, because the Wifyer application(app), created by software developer, Global Wavenet Pvt Ltd, allows peer to peer mobile data sharing powered by a transactional platform. Suren Pinto, CEO of the company says that while this is a first in the world the Wifyer supports the growth of the travel industry by addressing a crucial need of travellers looking for instant Internet connectivity while on the move and helping the data sharers monetize their mobile hotspots.
“We wanted the app to be very simple to use. It features only two modes to suit the requirement of a Wifyer user, the first is a mode to get paid for sharing data with options to control the amount of data shared and to activate the sharing mode as and when needed,” he told the Business Times. The other is a mode to consume data whereby a user has the flexibility to purchase a data bundle using Paypal, Credit card or any accrued referral credits.
For Wifyer data users, he says, a simple and convenient way to access the Internet has been introduced. “There is no activation process or time involved, which means a traveller can use the Wifyer app to detect and connect to a data sharer on the fly. Data bundles can be bought and topped up as and when required without any restrictions.”
He added that what is required to be a Wifyer data sharer is a data plan and an Android mobile device. “However Wiyfer's vision is to enable ubiquitous Internet connectivity and support the monetization opportunities for data sharers irrespective of the Operating System. As such, the Wifyer app will also be made available for Apple's iOS shortly and desktop applications for Windows and Mac are in the process of being developed. It is free to download and does not require any annual subscriptions,” Mr. Pinto added.
The originality and innovative nature of the Wifyer app were recognized and championed by The Next Web's (a technology focused media company) Boost programme (a program for early stage startups to launch products and meet investors) resulting in Wifyer bing selected as one of only a 100 start ups to be featured at Boost.

A few months back, I rented a car via Getaround, a company that's like Airbnb for vehicles. I booked a stranger's 2006 BMW for the weekend. After locating it in a nearby parking lot via GPS, I unlocked it with the Getaround app and found the key behind the sun visor. No human interaction necessary. But then I had some problems: the Bluetooth link to pair my phone required a code and the car was popping up a warning about the tires. I tried contacting the owner via the email in her posting and it bounced. I sent her a text message and she didn't respond. Having a somewhat morbid mind, I started to wonder if the owner of the car had gone to the great big parking lot in the sky. Was I in a zombie car still fulfilling its role in the sharing economy, when its owner had passed on?

We've thought a lot about what death means for our digital accounts, leading big tech companies to address the afterlife of data. Facebook lets you memorialize a deceased person's profile so it will stop prompting you to poke someone in a casket, and as of this week, lets you appoint a person to take over your account when your status is 'no longer living.' Google has a death manager you can use to let loved ones into your email after you've gone searching for the heavenly gates. Apple…. well, Apple, hasn't really addressed what happens to iBooks and iTunes music after iDie, so make sure to tell loved ones how to get into your iPad before you kick it.
But thanks to sharing economy start-ups, it's no longer just data that sticks around online after death; it includes people's homes, cars, and belongings. Science fiction creators have contemplated our things staying alive and connected after death — see this fictional short about a 'chorebot' that keeps going through its daily routine after its owner bites it — but have start-ups like Getaround and Airbnb?

"Thankfully, we haven't encountered this yet," says Getaround CEO Sam Zaid, who co-founded the company in 2011. The owner of the BMW I drove is still alive and well; she sent me an email two weeks later after she saw my review about the car's problems and apologized that her contact information wasn't up to date.
Zaid said Getaround hadn't fully grappled with how it would deal with a ghost car in the system. With Instant-enabled cars — like the one I rented — it's possible they'd continue to be rented post-owner-mortem as those rentals require no action by the car's owner beyond checking to make sure it's cleaned out between rentals. Zaid said Getaround would "find out naturally" because all owners are assigned a community manager who would likely notice if communications dropped off. If a car owner is unresponsive to a manager's emails, his or her car is taken offline. "If someone was unresponsive because they had passed away, we would deactivate their car," says Zaid, adding, "I guess we could be more proactive and scan online records."
Getaround also has analytics around how often users are interacting with the website or opening the app, so it could theoretically monitor whether a car owner stopped checking in, flagging it as a possible 'expiration' alert. "We have data about your activity. We don't use it for this purpose but we could,” said Zaid.

Getaround hasn't dealt with the issue yet but home-rental company Airbnb has — though it didn't realize it at the time. Last summer, Wesleyan college student Jordan Ruttenberg moved to New York for an internship, and rented a Bushwick, Brooklyn one-bedroom apartment on Airbnb with a college friend. The twenty-something woman who rented her apartment to them had to go to San Francisco for the summer to take care of her mother. One month into the two-month rental, Ruttenberg noticed that the Airbnb host's friends were writing sad messages on her Facebook wall saying they would miss her and "see her in heaven." He had a number for a friend of hers who lived in the neighborhood, who told him in a brief text message that she had overdosed and died.
"It was a crazy experience, really unnerving," says Ruttenberg. "It was her apartment with her clothes, her books and photos of her with family and friends, so that was really strange after she died."
His friend moved out, but Ruttenberg remained there for another two weeks, until the end of his rental. He says it was "eerie and sad" but he needed someplace to live. "We didn't reach out to Airbnb because we weren't sure how they could help us," he said. "I got a prompt from Airbnb afterwards to review the place but I didn't know what to say."

Airbnb did not find out about the incident until Newsweek wrote about it four months later. Airbnb would not offer comment on whether it does anything to ensure all of its hosts are still living. "We respect the privacy of our hosts and guests and we don't comment on questions like these," said a spokesperson. Maybe it thought my inquiry was just too creepy.
"Everybody dies. It's a pervasive problem," says Ali Lange, a policy analyst at the Center for Democracy & Technology who recently wrote about passing on your data after death ("Pro-tip: Don't put your passwords in your will because that document will become part of the public record.") "Tech companies are trying to get it right with data legacy. But death in the context of connected devices and the share economy hasn't come up as much. It may be because people participating are young and are not dying yet."
It's not just the people that are young, it's the companies and the "share economy" itself. They have not fully developed and their systems are still analog in many ways. Lots of Getaround car owners actually meet up with their renters to hand them their keys. Same thing with Airbnb hosts. But as these companies and their technology matures, their processes will become more automated. You'll unlock a stranger's door with a code or smartphone app. When the stranger's car is a driverless one that comes to pick you up when you rent it and knows that it needs to take itself to the mechanic when it has a problem, the possibility that owners' deaths will go unnoticed will increase.

"The Internet's impact on mortality is still new. We're still figuring it out," says Chris Moreman, a philosophy professor at California State University, East Bay, and editor of the essay collection Digital Death: Mortality in the Online Age. Moreman compared the grappling of death's affect on a person's Internet-connected objects to zombie fiction. "In every zombie apocalypse, there's always the question of how long the electrical grid will keep running when people aren't around anymore. When one person dies and there are other people relying on their things, it's a small-scale apocalypse. We see how long their things keep running without the person being there to push them forward."
CDT's Lange suggested that tech companies in this space should think about a service that keeps them informed about recent deaths; if they get a death notice for a user, they could take their things offline. Moreman suggested the answer might be in how companies design their systems: "How long should we program these things to run until someone needs to prompt them to keep running?"
About
Pirates vs Ninjas is the story of the very first World War, WW 0.5 the Beta war. Seeking to avoid an outright war with Japan the US enlists Pirates to protect their interests in the Pacific. Japan also seeking to avoid a costly war enlists Ninjas to fight for the mother land. The war has been forgotten by history and no one alive today remembers it ever happened. After the disastrous outcome both sides would rather forget the whole thing. The goal of the story is to show the advantages and weaknesses of both side's weapons and tactics.
Hollywood has failed us by relying on tired sequels and reboots. A geekcentric film like Pirates vs Ninjas wouldn't stand a chance of getting funding in the studio system and if by some miracle it did the results would be pathetic. The only chance a film like this has is crowdfunding.
Our goal is to put a $100 on the screen for every dollar spent. For a $250,000 budget we expect to make a film equal to what Hollywood would make on a 25 million dollar budget. For $500,000 the goal is to make a 50 million dollar film? How is this possible? We use the same hardware and software as the big budget films the rest is just time. By putting in 80 to 100 hours a week, a 120+ when we hit deadline, a two year schedule gets compressed into a year. We also reduce the budget by taking our money out of the backend. The other major factor is nothing is done by committee. There's a single coherent vision and each individual stays focused. This approach isn't possible in the studio system or even when backers are involved since they usually want input. Most budget money goes into waste. Once a shot is rendered it's cut in with no approval process. With no suits to please we can remain fast and efficient.
Our secondary goal is to fund a more ambitious film Things That Go Bump. It'll be the follow up to Pirates vs Ninjas. Help us reach our stretch goals and we'll give you a free copy of Things That Go Bump. Just give $25 or more and help us hit the first stretch goal of one million dollars and you'll receive a copy free of charge, we pay the shipping. Check out the link below for details. Also additional information can be found on the Kickstarter page of our web site. There's a direct link at the bottom of the page. Help us spread the word and you'll reap the rewards!

The skilled migrant category or SMC as it is known popularly offers an opportunity for suitable persons to move to New Zealand and work and live permanently.
Broadly speaking one must be
Less than 55 years and 360 days in age.
Acceptable level of health (ASH).
Of good character.
Have an acceptable level of English Language Ability
SMC uses a point system to determine who can qualify and one gets points broadly on the following major parameters (there are some minor parameters as well which are not being covered here)
Age
Experience
Employ-ability
Qualifications
Application process is simple enough there are two steps
Applicant completes and Expression of Interest (EOI), covering information about oneself, family, skills and experience.
If the applicant has enough points then the EOI is selected and an ITA (Invitation to Apply) is issued. The applicant completes it and returns it with supporting documents.
EOI's are valid for only 6 months, after 6 months the EOI lapses and is withdrawn from the pool, the EOI fees is non-refundable.
What happens if my EOI is selected?
In that case you get issued an ITA (Invitation to Apply) and are requested to submit your documents within four months. You need to check that information that you had supplied while making the EOI has not changed. You need to provide
Evidence to support the points that you had claimed in your EOI
Proof that you and others included in the application are of ASH and meet the character as well as English language requirements
You need to send the documents to INZ along with the forms and fees.
So what has changed ?
Earlier, you could technically get an ITA even if you had 100 points and a job offer which was the minimum, selection criterion.
From October 2016 the key things that have changed are
a) You need to have at least 160 Points
b) The English Language requirements have been made stringent, however the welcome thing is that INZ is accepting other tests apart from IELTS. From 21st Nov 16, INZ will accept the following English tests.
Test of English as a Foreign Language Internet Based Test (TOEFL iBT)
Occupational English Test (OET)
Cambridge English: First (FCE) and FCE for Schools
Pearson Test of English: Academic (PTE: Academic)
How can I get 160 points ?
Have a look at the table below, there are elements like partner's skilled employment or partner's qualifications that can come into play and give you more points.
Then there are elements like which industry you are in in, there are certain industries which will yield more points
Most importantly, one cannot miss the fact that 30 points are awarded for employment outside of Auckland.

In the first case of its kind, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled that employers are allowed to ban employees from wearing visible religious, political and philosophical symbols in the workplace.
However, such a ban has to be based on internal company rules dictating that employees “dress neutrally” and cannot be based on “the wishes of a customer”, the ECJ stipulated.
“An internal rule of an undertaking which prohibits the visible wearing of any political, philosophical or religious sign does not constitute direct discrimination,” the court said in a statement.
“However, in the absence of such a rule, the willingness of an employer to take account of the wishes of a customer no longer to have the employer's services provided by a worker wearing an Islamic headscarf cannot be considered an occupational requirement that could rule out discrimination.”
#ECJ: no direct discrimination if internal company rule prohibits wearing of religious symbols https://t.co/B0sMPtNgss — EU Court of Justice (@EUCourtPress) March 14, 2017
The ECJ ruling was based on court cases brought by two female employees in Belgium and France, who were dismissed for refusing to remove their Islamic headscarves.
The headscarf and other religious symbols are a contentious issue in a number of European countries. France, in particular, attaches importance to the separation of Church and State.
Its far-right National Front party is expected to perform strongly in presidential elections this spring.
The ruling comes a day before the Netherlands goes to the polls in a parliamentary election dominated by issues of immigration and integration.
Former President Barack Obama's deputy chief of staff for operations called President Trump a "deranged animal" after he claimed his predecessor "didn't often" call the families of fallen service members.
"That's a fucking lie," Alyssa Mastromonaco tweeted in response to Trump's claim Monday. "To say president obama (or past presidents) didn't call the family members of soldiers KIA — he's a deranged animal."
that's a fucking lie. to say president obama (or past presidents) didn't call the family members of soldiers KIA - he's a deranged animal. — alyssa mastromonaco (@AlyssaMastro44) October 16, 2017
Trump said Monday he wrote letters to the families of the four soldiers killed in Niger, adding that he planned to eventually call them "when it's appropriate."
"President Obama and other presidents, most of them didn't make calls. A lot of them didn't make calls," Trump said at an impromptu news conference in the Rose Garden.

Trump was later asked to clarify the claim about Obama.
"President Obama I think probably did sometimes, and maybe sometimes he didn't. I don't know," he added. "That's what I was told. All I can do is ask my generals. Other presidents did not call. They'd write letters and some presidents didn't do anything, but I like the combination of — I like, when I can, the combination of a call and also a letter."
The four soldiers were killed Oct. 4, and Monday marked Trump's first public comments on the deaths. The Pentagon has yet to identify which group is responsible, but the attack is suspected to have come from an affiliate of the Islamic State.

The words of Rabbi Yig'al Levenstein, cofounder of the premilitary academy in the West Bank settlement of Eli, clearly demonstrate the culture war now being fought in Israel – between those who seek equal rights and freedoms, and those who sanctify the hatred and persecution of the other.
At a conference in Jerusalem last Wednesday devoted to “dealing with the impact of Reform Judaism on Israel's Jewish nature,” Levenstein said that the values of the Israel Defense Forces, led by its Education Corps, have changed. This is reflected, he said, by educating toward religious pluralism and recognition of the LGBT community, describing the latter as “perverts.” “It is an insane movement whose members have lost the normalcy of life. This group makes the country mad and has now penetrated the IDF in full force – and no one dares voice an opinion and mock it. In the army's officer training base, there are even lectures given by perverts,” he added.
Levenstein is the latest link in a chain of religious-Zionist leaders who believe they need to dictate to the rest of Israel their narrow interpretation of the past, present and future. Such a confusion of values and misconceptions can only flourish with the support of the government, which allocates their budgets and promotes their followers.
In 1988, Rabbi Levenstein, together with Rabbi Eli Sadan, established the Bnei David Academy in Eli, the first of its kind. It became a central educational institute for religious Zionism. During the last Independence Day celebrations, Sadan received the Israel Prize for lifetime achievement.
Levenstein is no “wild weed.” No convoluted halakhic casuistry or excuses need be used to legitimize his words, as was done in the case of the newly designated chief military rabbi, Col. Eyal Karim. Levenstein holds a senior position in the network of premilitary academies (21 out of 48 of which are designated as religious), which are under the joint responsibility and are jointly funded by the defense and education ministries. His benighted declarations cannot hide behind an ideological-educational “autonomy” as long as they are funded by the state.
A feeble response or a rolling of the eyes will only confirm where the Netanyahu-Bennett-Lieberman government's heart really lies with regard to the LGBT community. No video or propaganda stunt will be able to conceal this.
After the rabbi's words entered the public realm, Education Minister Naftali Bennett tweeted an indirect condemnation (“Every person born in God's image is beloved, regardless of sexual orientation, skin color or belief”). Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman should also speak out. Levenstein cannot remain in his post after the hateful words he uttered, as long as taxpayers' money funds part of his salary.

Spaihts original script the "Beluga Xenomorph" was hinted at being the original form/source of the typical Xenomorphs that we all know and love. This would imply that the Beluga's were their own species that the Engineers discovered and "Weaponized", modifying them and improving them to be used for warfare.
This makes sense, as it seems like the Engineers bestowed many of their traits onto their Xenomorph such as their dark exoskeletons which bare a striking resemblance to the chair suits worn by the Engineers (Alternatively, their suits might have been made AFTER weaponizing the Xeno's, made to be able to withstand the Xeno's acidic blood).
When I first read the information presented I was confused as to why the Engineers would have taken away the Xeno's ability to alter their body shape, until I realized that they probably did this as a way to control them, as a Body-Altering Xenomorph would be too dangerous to use as efficient tools.
Attempted to draw the Beluga Xenomorph as seen in the scrapped concept artwork for Alien: Engineers, a masterpiece of a movie concept which would go on to be mutilated and deformed, eventually becoming the vastly less awesome film Prometheus.As taken from the Wiki:"The Beluga-Xenomorph, also known as the "Holloway Alien" after its host, was a Xenomorph creature cut from Prometheus early in its production. In Jon Spaihts' original script, titled Alien: Engineers, the creature stalked and killed several crew members of the Magellan. Its role was entirely written out of the finished film.Unlike other Xenomorphs, which are encased in rigid, black exoskeletons, the Beluga-Xenomorph is described as being ivory white and boneless, the latter of which allows it to alter its body shape and become a gelatinous, amorphous blob, allowing it to squeeze through gaps that would otherwise be too small for it. Its skin is vaguely translucent, and at the front of its elongated skull, a human-like skull can be seen beneath. It has long, spindly limbs, and jaws that can lever forwards out of its mouth (a trait given to the Deacon in Prometheus)"More information on Alien: Engineers can be found here: avp.wikia.com/wiki/Alien:_Engi… In
Could a User-Activated Soft Fork Solve Bitcoin's Scalability Challenge?
How to address Bitcoin's scalability issue has turned into a heated discussion in the Bitcoin community and no agreement has yet been reached. As it stands, it looks like no agreement will be achieved anytime soon, which is threatening bitcoin's use as a payment network as the number of unconfirmed transactions is increasing, and micropayments are becoming increasingly difficult to process successfully.
The most talked about update to the Bitcoin blockchain that has been suggested to resolve this issue is called Segregated Witness (SegWit), which has been proposed by Bitcoin Core developers last year. Segregated Witness is a proposed soft fork of the Bitcoin protocol that aims to update the blockchain network to effectively double block size and provide further scaling solutions. However, for the SegWit soft fork to be implemented 95 percent of Bitcoin miners must agree to the update. So far, the mining community has not shown lots of support for SegWit, which has left the community looking for other potential scalability solutions.
Other proposed scalability solutions include the Lighting Network, Bitcoin Unlimited and the use of sidechains.
The “Super UASF”
Now, there is a new proposed solution that is flaring up the scalability debate once again. The proposed solution, referred to as “Super UASF” (Super User-Activated Soft Fork), was suggested on the Bitcoin development mailing list by a pseudo-anonymous developer with the name of ‘shaolinfry'.
Shaolinfry suggests that a user-activated soft fork could be the solution for Bitcoin scalability issues. He suggests that instead of miners determining the next upgrade to the Bitcoin blockchain that the economic players in the ecosystem, such as exchanges, wallet providers, merchants, and payment processors, determine a soft fork that will upgrade the blockchain to make it more scalable.
He believes that enough people in the Bitcoin community support the SegWit upgrade, which also allows for Lightning Network implementation. By having the majority of economic players in the community soft fork the blockchain to make the upgrade, miners would also be forced to make the upgrade if they still want to be able to get paid in bitcoin for mining blocks.
“The hash powers' role is to select valid transactions and to extend the blockchain with valid blocks. Fully validating economic nodes ensure that blocks are valid. Nodes, therefore, define validity according to the software they run, but miners decide what already valid transactions get included in the [blockchain],” shaolinfry stated.
Currently, soft forks are enforced using hash power, i.e. by the miners, but with shaolinfry's suggested USAF Bitcoin nodes would not rely on miners to activate an update to a new software. Instead, nodes could simply have an agreed activation date in the future for the soft fork to be executed and wouldn't require miners' consent.
There are two main risks associated with the proposed “Super-UASF”. Namely, to gather and coordinate the full support from centralized Bitcoin services that are running nodes and miners being willing to mine the old chain as opposed to upgrading to the new chain and, thereby, creating a hard fork that could lead to one or more new Bitcoin blockchains, which the community generally wants to avoid.
Naturally, shaolinfry's new proposed scalability solution is causing a heated debate and faces pushback from miners. However, if rejection is the outcome decided by the Bitcoin mining community for SegWit, a UASF of this sort could potentially be implemented provided enough stakeholders in the ecosystem agree to it.

By the end of a long night of caucusing and vote counting, it seemed like the Democratic race in Iowa was a coin toss—literally. With more than 90 percent of precincts reporting, and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders still locked in a dead heat, reports began circulating around 11 PM here that at least six tied precincts had picked a winner based on the flip of coin. Bizarrely, Clinton had won all six.
As it turns out, the coin flips probably didn't have any affect on the final vote tallies. But it was nevertheless a sign of just how close the Democratic race had become in Iowa. On Tuesday morning, the Associated Press officially declared Clinton the winner, barely edging out Sanders by just less than four state delegate equivalents, according to the state party, in what amounts to the closest result in Iowa Democratic caucus history. (If this result holds, Clinton will have earned 23 of Iowa's delegates to the Democratic National Convention; Sanders will wind up with 21.)
Sanders has indicated he won't contest the results, but suggested Tuesday that his campaign might ask the Iowa Democratic Party to release the raw vote totals, something the state party has never done. (Ostensibly to show that Sanders could have won the popular vote, even if he's behind in delegates.) The Clinton campaign, meanwhile, claimed victory early Tuesday morning, arguing in a statement that "statistically, there is no outstanding information that could change the results and no way that Senator Sanders can overcome Secretary Clinton's advantage."
Still, it's hard to see Monday's results as anything other than a victory for Sanders, one that was pretty unimaginable when the self-described Democratic socialist announced his campaign in a Washington press conference last spring. As recently as December, Sanders was trailing Clinton by double digits in most Iowa polls. Even as his numbers rose in the weeks leading up to the caucus, conventional wisdom held that any enthusiasm his campaign was generating among the young and liberal wouldn't be enough to beat Clinton's superior field organization.
Sanders has made a habit of defying conventional wisdom, and reveling in it. In front of a crowd of delirious supporters Monday night, he seemed determined not to let his opponent, or the media, spin away his campaign's accomplishment. "Nine months ago, we came to this beautiful state. We had no political organization; we had no money; no name recognition. And we were taking on the most powerful political organization in the United States of America," Sanders began, barking over the noise of the ballroom at the airport Holiday Inn. "And tonight while the results are still not known, it looks like we are in a virtual tie." The crowd erupted, and kept going for almost a full minute before Sanders had to wave the group down.
The room was feverish, pulsating with the Bern. More than an hour before Sanders took the stage, the party was already packed, the risers bouncing in unison to a Motown medley. Dudes with man-buns clustered in groups of twos and threes near the stage, hopping around invisible hackey-sacks and spontaneously breaking into high fives. A troupe of what I assume were children—or potentially very tiny adults—in matching fluorescent orange fleeces milled around in a pack, occasionally jumping up and down together at random intervals.
"He's fighting—fighting for us," said Mark Harrick, a 23-year-old volunteer who'd flown in from Panama to campaign for Sanders. Joining hands with another volunteer to dance around me in a ring as I asked questions, Harrick explained: "We're a big arrow. Bernie is just the point of the arrow. A huge fat arrow."
Just outside, volunteers milled around, drinking beers and discussing where the revolution would go from here. "I've been talking about Bernie since June, when no one knew who he was," said Nathan Emerson, a 29-year-old volunteer from Des Moines, told me. "'We were going into basements, meeting with two or three people, trying to get them to support an independent running on the Democratic ticket." Now, he added, sipping from a bottle of rum, "the media is finally going to be forced to pay attention."
Across town, at her own caucus night party, Clinton was, somewhat mystifyingly, upbeat about her campaign's performance. Saying that she was "breathing a big sigh of relief," at the results, Clinton added that she looked forward to having a "real contest of ideas" with Sanders.
The Clinton camp enthusiastically echoed these ideas throughout the night, claiming that the campaign had always assumed the Iowa caucus would be a close race, and suggesting that perhaps Democrats were playing into the GOP's strategy by supporting Sanders, a candidate who, unlike Clinton, has never been seriously attacked or vetted by the opposition.
"The polls right now are based on the GOP fully attacking Hillary non-stop for years, and they haven't attacked Bernie at all—they've spent zero dollars attacking him. They don't mention him on Fox, they don't mention him in the debates, they don't mention him in any of the conservative news media," said Wesley Earley, a Los Angeles real estate agent and Clinton supporter."That's the scare with the DNC."
"Unfortunately," he added, "you can't tell any of that to a Bernie supporter."
The broader tendency among Clinton supporters, though, was simply to dismiss Sanders's success, chalking his Iowa numbers up to youthful exuberance that they assume will fade as Democrats start looking for a serious presidential contender.
"Bill Bradley had this [enthusiasm]," said Minnesota Democratic Party leader Corey Day, who attended Clinton's Monday night party as a special guest. "Ralph Nader had it. Howard Dean had it. Do you know what they all had in common? None of them won the nomination. So I'm not losing sleep over it per se—we've seen this before. The reality is that Hillary is the best candidate for the job. She's the most qualified candidate for the job, and she's shown it time and time again."
This is the argument Clinton supporters have been making ever since she entered the race: The former first lady, New York senator, and secretary of state has the strongest résumé in the Democratic field, and a history of shrugging off attacks made by the right-wing media. But even after she put enormous resources into Iowa, she couldn't manage a convincing win over Sanders, who represents the kind of grassroots progressivism that she herself has never been inclined, or able, to inspire.
In that sense, Monday's vote was a referendum on the way that politics is conducted in this country, by Clinton and other politicians like her.
"I have a lot of respect for Hillary, but for me, Bernie Sanders is walking the walk," said Erika McCroskey, a 37-year-old Sanders supporter who attended Monday night's victory party. "Clinton takes it everywhere she can get it, between Super PACs and speaking fees."
"For me, Bernie represents democracy, how it's supposed to be," she added. "I believe him."

Since the success of its rebooted X-Men franchise, with X-Men: First Class, 20th Century Fox has been working hard to create a unified and cohesive X-Men movie universe, taking into consideration what happen in the original X-Men trilogy. Hiring former Marvel writer Mark Millar as their Marvel consultant was a great start since Millar has familiarity with Marvel having written comics for X-Men—and Fox's Fantastic Four franchise too.In summer 2013, Fox will begin this movie continuity-fixing process with the release of The Wolverine. Set after the events in X-Men: The Last Stand, Logan finds himself alone in Japan facing questions about his immortal-like mutant healing ability and thinking about those who have been lost. Obviously the plot of The Wolverine is unknown until it releases in theaters on July 26, 2013, but Millar has already confirmed The Wolverine is indeed the new beginning of Fox's cohesive Marvel movie universe. (Even though it would technically be X-Men: First Class as the new beginning since most of that cast is coming back for the sequel.)So The Wolverine will set up the events in X-Men: Days of Future Past, but how? While Logan has to deal with the fallout of X-Men: The Last Stand in his solo movie this summer, fans will have to pay attention during The Wolverine to find the puzzle pieces that are sure to be clues for the next X-Men movie.The Wolverine could have teases like the creation of the Sentinels being planned, or time travel being created. Even though this is a lot of speculation, X-Men: Days of Future Past will indeed have Sentinels and time travel. Millar, himself, has already confirmed both So we have time travel and Sentinels, both are big parts of the original comic story arc, and only a few days ago it was also confirmed that the actors who played Iceman, Rogue and Shadowcat will all reprise their original X-Men roles , in Days of Future Past too.The most important part of all of this is the fact that Shadowcat, a.k.a. Kitty Pryde, will be a part of the new X-Men movie. In the comics, Shadowcat's mind travels back in time to possess her younger self to warn everyone of the pending doom for mutants in the future. An assumption is that, as in the comics version of this story, Sentinels are eradicating the mutant population in the future. To prevent this, things must be done differently in the past. Hence, the time travel by Pryde.Even though Marvel movies only take a little from the comics and adapt them for the big screen, Shadowcat could still time travel and change the future. And as the future changes, Fox will be creating a brand new, cohesive X-Men universe as they intended. Finally, if Fox does things right and changes timelines via time travel successfully, you can bet Hugh Jackman will be seen in future X-Men movies seeing as how he doesn't age. His cameo in X-Men: First Class proved Wolverine still has and always will look the same—as long as Jackman continues to defy the aging process in real life.There you have it. Time travel by Kitty Pryde, after the events in X-Men: The Last Stand, to a younger version of her post-X-Men: First Class will change the continuity of the past X-Men movie trilogy to create a cohesive, singular X-Men movie universe for Millar and Fox to play in, expand with more solo character movies and whatever else they may have planned.

Zora Stephenson, WNCT - WASHINGTON, N.C. (WNCT) -- One high school student in Beaufort County, N.C. is committed to making sure its students are taken care of. Students at Washington High School started a food pantry to make sure none of their classmates go home hungry.
What started out as a student government project is now a full time resource to students.
Senior Erin Lewis says, "We wanted to focus on those that need it, but they don't want to tell us that they need it."
Lewis along with other classmates and their supervisor decided to start a food pantry. It offers students non-perishable goods as many times as they need it with no questions asked. There are no advertisements or flyers for the resource because it's anonymous.
"We don't want the students to be embarrassed or the family to feel like they've done something wrong," guidance counselor Jennifer Beach said.
Beach says students find out about the pantry through word of mouth.
"Those who were involved in it to start with, will let other students know, hey this is something we've got up and running we helped create it and you can see your counselor for help," Beach said.
Project supervisor Laura Thompson says helping one another is what the Pam Pack is all about.
"It's the idea that we're not just here to teach you the material that you need to know to pass a test," Thompson said. "We're here to educate you for life. Part of that is nourishing the whole student, mind and body, and when we do both of those things we know students will have great outcomes."
Dozens of students currently use the food pantry. The goal is to expand it and add perishable items. Washington High School also has sanitation items, school supplies and clothes available to its students.

UK car production fell by 13.7% in June compared to a year earlier - the third month in a row that output has fallen.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said the UK market was cooling in line with forecasts, following a long period of record growth.
The industry is likely to fall short of its ambition to produce more than two million cars a year by 2020, it said.
The SMMT said uncertainty over Brexit was an added cause for concern.
But a spokesperson for the Department for Exiting the European Union said the government was determined that the UK would continue to be "one of the most competitive locations in the world" for automotive manufacturing.
Sales falling
The fall in production mirrored a decline in UK car sales.
Over the first six months of this year, sales were distorted by a rise in Vehicle Excise Duty in April, which prompted drivers to bring forward purchases of new cars.
But comparing the first six months of 2017 with the equivalent period in 2016 still showed a fall of 9.5% in UK sales, the SMMT said.
Overseas demand for British-built cars has remained broadly steady in the first half of this year, falling only by 0.9% compared to the same period last year.
As a result, total output for the year is 2.9% lower than a year ago.
'10% hit'
Independent forecasters are predicting output will pick up in the second half of the year, thanks to new and updated models coming into production.
However the SMMT warns that output could fall in 2019, if the UK fails to secure a deal with the EU, or at least an interim agreement, that maintains current trading conditions after Brexit.
Image copyright BMW Image caption BMW plans to build a new electric Mini in Oxfordshire
The SMMT suggested a "hard" Brexit, with the UK leaving the EU single market and customs union, could result in a 10% hit to production.
"Brexit uncertainty is not helping investment and growth is stalling.," said Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive.
"The government has been in 'listening' mode but now it must put on the table the concrete plans that will assure the future competitiveness of the sector,"
The Department for Exiting the European Union spokesperson said: "The government's industrial strategy makes clear that we want to build on our strengths in advanced manufacturing in this sector.
"Nissan's decision to continue its investment in Sunderland and plans by Jaguar Land Rover to double its output here are clear votes of confidence in our automotive industry.
Earlier this week, BMW announced it would manufacture the new electric version of the Mini at its site in Cowley, Oxfordshire - a move welcomed by Business Secretary Greg Clark as a "vote of confidence" in the UK.
However, that investment builds on existing production of the standard Mini, already taking place at Cowley.
Analysts said the real test of confidence would come when carmakers decided where to build new models.
Ray Loeser, the head coach at the University of Charleston in West Virginia the past five seasons, has been named as the head softball coach at Wright State University.
“We are so excited to welcome Coach Loeser to the Raider family,” said Joylynn Brown, associate athletics director and senior woman administrator at Wright State. “The moment you meet Ray, his passion and enthusiasm for the sport of softball is obvious. The success he has had at the Division II level made him really stand out to the committee. His team winning 50 games and competing in the Division II World Series last season obviously impressed us. He knows how to win, and he also understands our mission to create the best experience possible for our student-athletes, both on the field and in the classroom. We are confident Ray will continue the strong Wright State softball tradition and are looking forward to where he will lead the program.”
Loeser directed Charleston to its best season ever in 2016 as the Golden Eagles finished with a school-record 50 wins (50-12), won the NCAA Atlantic Regional and Super Regional titles and advanced to the NCAA Division II College World Series in Denver. Charleston ended the season ranked #8 in the final National Fastpitch Coaches Association Division II Top 25 poll, the first national ranking in program history.
Winners of 25 straight regular-season games during April, Charleston claimed the NCAA Atlantic Regional title with a win over Lock Haven and two victories against Kutztown. The Golden Eagles then defeated West Virginia Wesleyan twice in the NCAA Atlantic Super Regional before facing Adelphi and Southern Arkansas in the College World Series.
The 2016 NFCA Atlantic Region Coach of the Year, Loeser was also selected as the Mountain East Conference Coach of the Year. Away from the diamond, four players earned CoSIDA Academic All-District honors, with one player selected as a Third Team Academic All-American.
Charleston made its first-ever NCAA postseason appearance in 2015, advancing to the Atlantic Region Finals while posting its third most wins in a season with 38.
In five years at the helm, Loeser posted a 184-84 record while the program had one All-American, 10 All-Atlantic Region selection and 24 All-MEC honorees. The Golden Eagles were regionally ranked in four of his five seasons there (2012, 2014, 2015, 2016).
“I am truly grateful and humbled for the opportunity to lead the Wright State softball program,” said Loeser. “A big thank-you goes to Bob Grant, Joylynn Brown and the search committee for having the faith in me to be their next leader of such a successful program. Throughout this process I was able to tell that the dedication to their student-athletes is a large reason for the success of the Raider nation.”
“As for now, WSU has a solid nucleus that competes year in and year out for the top spot in the Horizon League,” added Loeser. “I have seen the roster that returns from the conference tournament championship game, and I am anxious and excited to get on the field. I look forward to continuing to build their success.”
Before coming to the University of Charleston, he spent four seasons as the assistant softball coach at Arkansas Tech University. In that role, he was the recruiting coordinator, hitting coach and pitching coach of a program that won three Gulf South Conference West Division championships in four years.
Prior to Arkansas Tech, Loeser spent two seasons at St. Petersburg College in Florida, in which they won a Suncoast Conference title. Loeser began his coaching career as a student-manager at Mississippi State.
Loeser is a 2005 graduate of Mississippi State with a bachelor's degree in business administration in information systems. He and his wife, Karie, were married last November.

There's so much to do in The Crew 2. Ubisoft Ivory Tower has crafted a miniaturised version of the United States that feels truly gargantuan, and it's packed with different activities where you'll need to drive, fly and climb to reach success.
While hardly bereft of content, there isn't a slither of personality to be found in this ambitious racer. It's competent on all fronts, but without a soul to carry its many mechanics, The Crew 2 falls into the pits instead of roaring across the track.
Related: Best PS4 Games
The Crew 2 has you playing the role of an emergent racer. You're an influential figure in the sporting world, and thus you'll need to build followers to grow into the superstar you hope to be. Followers are the primary form of progression in The Crew 2, growing with almost every single action.
Much like its predecessor, Ivory Tower has tried to blend a seamless narrative of sorts into the open world of The Crew 2 – and has once again failed to craft anything compelling. The idea of being a viral sensation in the racing world has potential, but it's instead filtered into a handful of woefully acted cut-scenes that you'll be desperate to skip.
Big bads of sorts are introduced in the form of veteran racers, but they're needless window dressing to an already bland experience. There's nothing wrong with having a story baked in with a racer, but it needs to compliment the mechanics behind it instead of distracting you, making your eyes roll in the midst of loading screens that you're incapable of skipping.
The failing narrative is one of many ailments of The Crew 2's inconsistent tone. It's trying to be upbeat, cheery and down with the kids, but instead comes around as a silly, cringe-inducing charade I wish you could mute and focus on the enjoyable racing it upholds.

Vehicles are split into three categories: Cars, Planes and Boats. All possess four individual disciplines that lead to additional vehicles and events. The depth on display here is admirable, and I had a blast testing out new rides as my rank increased.
I especially enjoyed the newly implemented motorcycles, which not only control brilliantly but allow for a multitude of absurdly rad tricks to pull off. The Crew 2 shines when you're given the freedom to take advantage of its sprawling world, whether it's through bespoke events or dynamic exploration.
Sadly, despite encompassing the entirety of the US, everything just feels a little empty. The likes of New York, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City are all ripe for exploration, but driving through them provides a gorgeous visual showcase and only a smattering of events in which to partake.
You'll seldom stumble across things naturally, having to reference the cumbersome map to even find an activity, let alone partake in them. It takes far too long to get your bearings, and in a world so big, this proves to be an even bigger problem. A button that created a waypoint to the nearest event would have been a lifesaver, providing players with a constant stream of things to do.
Instead, you'll be hopping from event to event without driving through the massive world Ivory Tower has spent years crafting. Ultimately, it's a detrimental piece of design that makes the inclusion of such a vast setting feel mute.

All the presentation and tonal issues aside, how does The Crew 2 actually play? All of its vehicles control with an aura of satisfying competency. Pulling off tight corners in a Ferrari before switching into a boat and bopping along the New York harbour all feel great, although there's seldom a feeling of a mastery among the formidable suite of vehicles.
Instead, the performance of each vehicle is determined by loot you can earn and equip yourself with after each event. These colour-coded parts are easy to understand. The higher the number, the bigger the upgrade they'll bring to your ride. It feels like Destiny or Assassin's Creed if the playable character was replaced by a range of cars, boats and other crazy means of transportation.
Having such a level of customisation over a vast selection of vehicles is an excellent feature, even if having to return to a specific hub to fully change things up grows cumbersome after a while. Jumping into a race and suffering defeat only to return with a pimped-out ride and wiping the floor with the competition never gets old, especially if you're willing to invest in The Crew 2's many disciplines.

It's worth noting that, at times, The Crew 2 is visually spectacular. Drifting around a narrow, rain-drenched corner as the sunlight pours in overhead had my jaw dropping on multiple occasions. On the flip-side, the human beings that occupy the open world resemble skinless aliens with their dead-looking eyes and lack of detail.
It makes me think The Crew 2 should have gone down the Burnout Paradise route and abandoned in-game humans altogether. Nothing wrong with a dystopian world filled with self-driving cars and nobody in sight.
Verdict
The Crew 2's evident ambition to encompass cars, planes and boats into a seamless sporting experience is admirable, but constantly undermined by the bland, unattractive shell in which it's contained.
Ivory Tower's rendition of the United States is bereft of personality, reminiscent of a ghostly spectre that does nothing to implement the nation's bustling culture into a racer that's in desperate need of some identity.
If you're after a racer with plenty of depth and options and aren't concerned about its lacklustre presentation, then there's definitely something here to enjoy. Otherwise, there are plenty of other racers on the horizon.
As science money is increasingly awarded to a small number of expensive projects, some academics argue that a new funding system is needed
Big science costs big money. The 100,000 Genomes Project will burn through £300m by the time researchers sequence the genetic blueprint of that many humans. Finding the Higgs Boson is estimated to have cost as much as £8bn. The newly approved European Spallation Source initiative is budgeted at €1.843bn – for now.
But is this type of mega project worth the price tag? Is it worth the opportunity cost of failing to fund other scientific ideas that will never be explored as a result? And how can big science researchers really prove that their work is worthwhile when the cost is so high, the timescales so long and the outcomes so uncertain?
At Bangor University, Jo Rycroft-Malone, professor of health services research believes that although impact from big science investments may be hard to predict, “big science scientists should be challenged to better argue the case for the impact and benefits”.
We shouldn't keep quiet about how research grant money is really spent Read more
Some academics take a harder line. Bill Amos, professor of evolutionary genetics at Cambridge University doesn't believe the outcomes of big science projects have so far been worth the “grotesque” sums invested, and says that funding bodies are far too impressed by “grandiose projects”.
“Take the 100,000 Genome Project. It's a fabulous waste of money because it is hypothesis free – they're not testing something,” he says.
Research councils, Amos says, often back big science out of ignorance. “Somebody who has a big research programme will pour out research papers and their CV looks so strong that when they make an application for funding they can't be refused. But if you divide the number of papers published by the huge number of researchers involved, then [these big projects] are terrible value.”
Funding application forms now require scientists to fill in sections called “pathways to impact”, and about these, Amos is unremittingly scathing. “Anyone who understands science can see what rubbish this is. Basically, it says ‘speculate on how this is going to change the world' and it's completely unprovable, so it's a charter to support bullshitters. If I speak to scientists I really respect, they are exactly the sort of people who if you ask them to fill out two pages speculating on their impact, well, they just want to get on with their research. They won't do it.”
Big science: skewing research agendas?
Ryecraft-Malone points out that big science doesn't just suck up vast amounts of money – it also risks skewing research agendas. Because projects are funded mostly by wealthy countries, these projects may be more likely to be geared towards the needs of the developed world.
The smaller the total pot, the more desperate people get, and so the more money they ask for Bill Amos, professor of evolutionary genetics, Cambridge University
At Ulster University, Dr Kevin Curran, group leader for the ambient intelligence research group acknowledges that large projects do hive off resources from greater numbers of smaller projects. But he says that the potential impact can be worth the gamble.
Researchers, Curran believes, could increase their impact by working with industry. “Interacting with industry allows researchers to become exposed to real world needs,” he says. “[This] allows academics to work on real world problems rather than theoretical or presumed problems.”
Assessing the value of big science funding is clearly going to be easier in some situations than in others. “An obvious case would be an invention which leads to a spinout company which leads to employment,” says Curran. “Measuring the impact on the economy can be done quite easily though sales and income tax etc, and then subtracting the funding to see ‘profit' to government.”
It is however far harder to measure the value for money of a computer algorithm that's released on open source license and incorporated into various products over many years. “The issue is that it can take a long time for the advances in knowledge to percolate into everyday life, and thus sometimes the general public don't feel that the investment is paying off,” says professor John MacIntyre, dean of the faculty of applied sciences at Sunderland University.
“I think the key issue is whether the projects are appropriately defined to have a chance of solving the problems they are working on.”

Elaborating on his argument about waste, however, Amos points to the untold millions that have been spent on huge research projects worldwide to find a cure for cancer. There is, he points out drily, no cure yet. By contrast, he tells a story about how a single thoughtful researcher exploring an idea can discover something that may prove to be of untold value to humanity.
“We're desperate to find new antibiotics,” he observes. “And there's someone in my department who's researching burying beetles. When these beetles find a corpse, they shave it, roll it into a ball, cover it in saliva which is full of antibiotics that keep it fresh, and lay their eggs on it. That researcher isn't looking for antibiotics, they're doing something on parental care, but they asked themselves the question, ‘why is this corpse not rotting?' And if you only ever fund big projects you're going to bypass all this kind of natural history and biology research.”
Big research funding programmes can become too unwieldy to function well
Ryecraft-Malone says that “big science funding should focus on a balanced portfolio of investment between science oriented and solution oriented programmes.” This, however, requires an overarching framework in which big science would have to operate – including paying attention to how scientific research agendas are shaped, clarity about government motivations for funding big science, and careful evaluation over time. “As far as I'm aware, such a framework does not exist.”
Meanwhile, the focus on international big science projects creates an unhealthy dynamic for researchers, believes Amos. “The smaller the total pot the more desperate people get so the more they ask for, raising the average size of grants and resulting in fewer grants and more desperation,” he says. “Small amounts doled out widely would allow many to chug along nicely, reduce the numbers of applications and encourage much greater frugality. People who get awarded lots often spend much more than they need. Value for money again suffers.”
A different problem is also becoming apparent: big research funding programmes can become too unwieldy to function well. “I think the Horizon 2020 programme is trying to identify opportunities for impact – economic impact, social impact, and even cultural impact – but there are significant problems in how the European research programmes are managed and controlled,” MacIntyre says.
European research funding: it's like Robin Hood in reverse Read more
“In particular, they have become hugely bureaucratic: the scientific community is worried at the long lead times needed to construct partnerships and bids, and the very low success rates in some areas of the programme. If it takes a year or more to put a consortium of European research partners together to work on a bid for a project, and the success rate is only one in 42 bids, then potentially a researcher could work through their whole career and only see one project funded. As a result, many researchers are turning away from the European programmes and looking elsewhere to get support for their work.”
For an alternative model, Amos points across the Atlantic. “The Canadian system is based on giving those who are productive enough money to carry on,” he says.
“This is hugely efficient – no spending a third of your time writing grant applications, most of which fail, no need to ask for far more than you need because you never know if that will be your last bit of funding, no spending hours reviewing grant applications and no politics and schmoozing to butter up committees so that you get awarded grants you may not deserve.”
Rycroft-Malone wonders whether in fact the wrong people are divvying up the cash. With resources so precious, she says, “perhaps it's time to open up the debate to the public about what scientific agendas we should be pursuing and how they should be resourced. This could help move away from a trend where our governments are buying into ‘vanity projects', and would have the potential to hold them more to account.”
This article was amended on 16 June to correct the estimated budget of the European Spallation Source initiative. This has been changed from €1,843bn to €1.843bn.

Abbott overrules Hockey on baby bonus cuts
Posted
Federal Opposition Leader Tony Abbott insists the Coalition will oppose Government cuts to the baby bonus, even though treasury spokesman Joe Hockey is in favour of them.
Coalition sources have confirmed Mr Hockey wanted to support the cuts but was overruled by his shadow cabinet colleagues.
It is understood he will continue to fight for the bonus to be scaled back as one measure to improve the budget bottom line.
Mr Abbott has avoided questions about the disagreement but says the Coalition will focus on cutting waste in government instead.
"It's very important that we get the budget deficit under control but the best way to do that is not to be tough on the Australian people," he said.
"It's to reduce waste and bloat in government and that's where the thrust of the Coalition's expenditure reductions will be.
"We don't want to be tough on the forgotten families of Australia."
The cuts were announced by the Government in its budget update in October.
It plans to reduce the baby bonus payments for second and subsequent children from $5,000 to $3,000, saving more than $500 million over the forward estimates.
When he announced the move, Treasurer Wayne Swan said it would bring the payment more into line with the actual costs of having children, given that parents would have already purchased a cot and pram.

The Dementia Epidemic
Dementia is a disorder of the mental processes caused by brain disease or injury and marked by memory disorders, personality changes, and impaired reasoning.
1906: Year that dementia first “discovered” (named) by Alois Alzheimer
44 million: number of people, worldwide, with dementia today
76 million: number of people with dementia in 2030
135 million: number of people expected to have dementia by 2050
7.7 million: number of new cases of dementia each year
1. There is a new case of dementia somewhere in the world every 4 seconds.
Where are they?
62: percentage of dementia suffers in 2013, living in poor countries
But that number will rise to:
70 percent by 2050 (living in poor countries)
Most countries are not prepared for this global epidemic:
From 2013 to 2050 (number of people projected to have dementia)
Asia: 22 to 72 million (226 percent increase)
Europe: 11 to 21 million (90 percent inc.)
The Americas: 9 to 31 million (248 percent inc)
Africa: 3 to 12 (345 percent inc)
The Cost of Dementia
$600 billion: global cost of dementia care.
That's 1 percent of global domestic product (GDP)
13: number of countries with national dementia plan (out of 130 countries in the World Health Organization). They are:
• Australia
• Belgium
• Denmark
• Finland
• France
• Luxembourg
• Netherlands
• Chinese Taipei
• Norway
• U.K.
• Republic of Korea
• Switzerland
• U.S.A.
If dementia care were a country, it would be the world's 18th largest economy, ranking between Turkey and Indonesia.
If dementia care were a company, it would be the world's largest by annual revenue, greater than:
• Wal-Mart ($414 billion)
• Exxon Mobil ($311 billion)
Recognizing dementia
Symptoms: 2 of these core mental functions must be significantly impaired to be considered dementia:
• Memory
• Communication and language
• Ability to focus and pay attention
• Reasoning and judgment
• Visual perception
60-80 percent: of dementia cases suffer from Alzheimer's Disease
24 million: number of people worldwide, with Alzheimer's Disease (the most common form of dementia)
• 5.3 million: number of Americans with AD
• 6th leading cause of death in U.S. is AD
• AD is 5th leading cause of death in Americans age 65 and older.
Vascular dementia: 2nd most common form (after AD)
Other, less common forms of dementia:
• Frontotemporal dementia: aka Pick's disease or frontal lobe dementia.
• progressive supranuclear palsy and
• Binswanger's disease.
• Korsakoff's syndrome: associated with heavy drinking
• HIV-related cognitive impairment
Treatments:
Doctors use medicines to treat dementia in the following ways:
• To correct a condition that's causing dementia, such as thyroid replacement for hypothyroidism, vitamins for lack of B12, or antibiotics for infections
• To maintain mental functioning for as long as possible when dementia cannot be reversed
• To prevent further strokes in people who have vascular dementia
• To manage mood or behavior problems, such as depression, insomnia, hallucinations, , and agitation
Medicines to help maintain mental function:
• Cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil (Aricept), galantamine (Reminyl), and rivastigmine (Exelon).
• These drugs were developed to treat Alzheimer's disease, but they may be tried in other dementias, especially vascular dementia.2
• It is not clear how long these medicines will work.
• Memantine (Namenda). Used to treat symptoms of Alzheimer's disease
Medicines to help control mood or behavior problems:
• Antipsychotic drugs, such as risperidone (Risperdal) or olanzapine (Zyprexa).
• Antidepressants, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
Medicines to prevent future strokes:
• medicines for high blood pressure and high cholesterol, since these conditions are risk factors for vascular dementia.

Jamie Dimon and the other big banks CEOs have plenty to cheer for in Trump's tax plan. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Big banks could see profits spike by $6.4 billion under President Donald Trump's tax plan.
The six largest US banks — JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley— stand to reap a massive windfall that would boost net income by 7% if the plan, which cuts the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%, successfully clears Congress, according to a Bloomberg report.
The big-six banks, which paid an average federal tax rate of 26% last year, would have an outsized benefit from the tax plan as they claim fewer deductions than most companies.
Bloomberg's analysis assumes a 20% effective tax rate for the banks, but the savings could be even greater if certain deductions are left in place.
Trump Supporters Step Up for Owner of Destroyed Limo
Violent anti-Trump protesters set ablaze a limo during President Trump's inauguration last Friday — but what they probably did not know is that the limo was owned by Muhammad Ashraf, a Muslim immigrant.
Ashraf, who owns DC-MD-VA based Nationwide Chauffeured Services, did not vote for President Trump but says he does not condone the behavior of the protesters, either.

Now, benevolent Trump supporters have stepped up to help Ashraf, who estimates it could cost $90,000 to replace the destroyed limo. Mike and Marlo Denning own a limo service of their own in Florida, and have started a GoFundMe page to help pay for replacing the destroyed vehicle.
So far, the page has raised over $6,000 of its $20,000 goal. Ashraf says he plans to use the money raised to replace the limo and give the rest to an employee who was injured during the ordeal.
BitTorrent's peer to peer data protocols are most known for file sharing through torrents and Sync, but now the company believes it can tackle a completely different platform: live television.
To be clear, the company isn't taking on livestreaming platforms like Periscope or Twitch; it's setting it's sights on broadcast television. Called BitTorrent Live, the platform will focus on the areas Web streaming hasn't quite cracked yet, including sports, news and events – all which BitTorrent says hold the majority of television viewership.
Part of the reason large scale streaming video has been problematic is simply an issue of scale: the more viewers a network has, the larger and more expensive its content distribution network has to be. We're all too familiar with laggy livestreaming.
Credit: BitTorrent P2P livestreaming could theoretically be much cheaper to monetize at large scales.
That's where P2P comes in: Every viewer becomes part of the distribution network by both receiving and sharing that video at the same time – just like a torrent. Only this time the protocol has been tuned for latency; BitTorrent promises under 10 seconds of latency without the need of an expensive CDN, even at the scale of traditional over-the-air television.
The platform will include 13 free channels to start – including live sports, news, tech and film channels – but will later expand to include subscription, ad supported, and pay-per-view networks. Head on over to the source link below for more details on the current lineup.

Earlier this week, I reported on a new pilot program designed to combat revenge porn that Facebook is testing in Australia. The program involves sending nude photographs to the social network ahead of time, to prevent their potential spread in the future.
Security researchers and journalists—including me—had additional questions about exactly how it works, so I reached out to Facebook to ask. I then wrote a follow-up piece with more details the company provided, most important of which was that actual humans will review the explicit photos sent to the social network manually.
In my conversations with Facebook however, I discovered that the initial way the anti-revenge porn feature was described to me was incorrect. The Facebook spokesperson I talked to misrepresented a key detail of the program, and then later confirmed to me that the feature did not work the way that they said that it would. Facebook said that the nude images would be blurred when they were reviewed by humans, but that is not the case.
This is how the anti-revenge porn pilot program is going to work in Australia, according to a blog post Facebook published Thursday: First, users file a report with the country's eSafety Commissioner's office, saying that they want to preemptively report photos as being explicit, to prevent their spread in the future as revenge porn. The user is then asked to send the photos to themselves via Facebook Messenger. Facebook is made aware of the report, and then an actual human, a member of Facebook's Community Operations team, looks at the nude photograph to ensure that it violates Facebook's standards.
This is where a Facebook spokesperson initially described the process incorrectly. When I first reached out to ask how the program would work, I was told that the images would be blurred. This was repeated to me twice.
Facebook's blog post didn't mention blurring at all, and what I was told was contradictory to other reporting, so I reached out to Facebook again, in the hopes of clearing up the confusion. Finally, I was told that there will actually be no blurring. This means that Australians who want to use the new program have to voluntarily decide they are comfortable with Facebook's Community Operations team seeing them naked. “To prevent adversarial reporting, at this time we need to have humans review the images in a controlled, secure environment,” Facebook's Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos said in a tweet.
Facebook is having human reviewers be part of the process in order to prevent legitimate images from being inadvertently tagged as revenge porn. As recent studies have shown, image-recognition algorithms are still extremely easy to spoof.
After the images are reviewed by a human, what is referred to as a “hash” or unique digital fingerprint is built. Facebook does not retain the images themselves, just the hashes. Once it has created a hash, it notifies the person who uploaded the original image, and they are asked to delete it from Messenger. Then Facebook deletes the image from its servers, retaining only the hash.
Each time a user subsequently uploads an image, it's tested against Facebook's database of hashes. If one matches a hash labeled revenge porn, Facebook stops the user from posting it. As Stamos pointed out in his tweets, this is an imperfect solution to an incredibly difficult problem.
It's unclear why this happened, but I think it's important to highlight the confusion. Major tech corporations like Facebook are incredibly careful about how they message themselves to the public, and this is an instance in which it initially got the communication about its own program wrong.
Oh, Ted. What have you done now? First you approved an attack ad against Donald Trump that creepily used children chanting "eminent domain" and for an encore, you've done, what?
Buzzfeed reports:
Ted Cruz's campaign has pulled its most recent ad, “Conservatives Anonymous,” after learning one of the actors in the spot is also a softcore porn star.
The ad, which was set at a group therapy session of conservative voters who feel betrayed by Marco Rubio on immigration, featured actor Amy Lindsay, who played a woman telling another group member, “Maybe you should vote for more than just a pretty face next time.”
Lindsay has appeared in several softcore porn films, including Erotic Confessions, Carnal Wishes, Secrets of a Chambermaid, and Insatiable Desires.
BuzzFeed News, after learning of Lindsay's prior filmography, requested comment from the Cruz campaign. Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler told BuzzFeed News in a statement that the campaign is taking the ad down and replacing it with a different one.
“The actress responded to an open casting call. She passed her audition and got the job. Unfortunately, she was not vetted by the production company. Had the campaign known of her full filmography, we obviously would not have let her appear in the ad,” Tyler said.

Australia has denied accusations that its athletes participating in the Delhi Commonwealth Games vandalised their tower in the athletes' village.
Indian media said the athletes were angry because their cricket team lost the Test series to India on Wednesday.
They destroyed furniture and electrical fittings and threw a washing machine from the eighth floor, reports said.
The Australian high commission admitted that a washing machine had been damaged during "spirited celebrations".
But, it denied that any Australian athlete had been involved in vandalism.
The Times of India newspaper quoted an unnamed police officer inside the Games village as saying: "The house-keeping staff tried to stop them [the Australian athletes] but to no avail.
"The Australians also shouted slogans against batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar, who played a pivotal role in ensuring India's victory."
'Completely baseless'
In a statement e-mailed to the BBC, the Australian high commission said there had been "some spirited celebrations involving the Australian team and a number of other teams" at the athletes' village.
"We can confirm that in the course of those celebrations a washing machine was damaged, though it remains unclear who did the damage, what their nationality was, and whether it was deliberate or accidental."
The statement denied that the athletes were protesting against their team's loss in cricket.
"The suggestion that this was a reaction to Australia's loss in the second Test is completely baseless.
"The Australian team's celebration had nothing to do with the cricket, or India, or Sachin Tendulkar," it said.
Australia led the medals tally at the Games, winning 177 medals, including 74 golds.
Police say they have not received any complaint so far from the Games organising committee.
E-books in Indiana
I had the pleasure of talking about e-books (what else!) at the 2012 Annual Conference of the Indiana Library Federation, recently held in Indianapolis. I'd like to thank my gracious hosts Meg Atwater-Singer (University of Evansville) and Susan Akers (Indiana Library Federation) for the opportunity. The timing was rather interesting, as the e-book statement from the ALA Chapters was in development, and I had the opportunity to meet a major force behind the statement, Terry Rheinheimer, the Indiana Chapter Councilor.
My presentation focused on four stakeholders in the publishing ecosystem: publishers, distributors, authors, and libraries. To get the full story, I refer you to my slides (.ppt). But the highest-level message is that there are many complexities and inter-dependencies behind the decisions that we observe, such as the business practice of refusing to sell to libraries or selling to libraries at excessive prices.
The publishing ecosystem itself has changed fundamentally. In the print world, the ecosystem operates largely in a linear fashion. Authors work with their agents and negotiate with publishers. Project selection, manuscript development, editing, and production are managed by publishers. Distributors serve as intermediaries between publishers and bookstores & libraries.
By contrast, in the digital world, the model is more akin to a network. True, the linear relationship still is relevant for many works, though increasingly other alternatives are emerging. For example, some authors may work directly with distributors or retailers. Some libraries contemplate publishing, and already some libraries are adapting characteristics of retailing.
Finally, I appreciated the opportunity to participate in other sessions, including several on e-books. I learned about the challenges of e-books in the K-12 schools setting, and some of the innovative practices Indiana school libraries have. One session featured experiments on patron-driven acquisition in several Indiana universities. This business model does not involve a priori e-book purchases. Instead, when a patron requests a title, the library pays a fee (such as 10 percent of the list price) for that one access–a rental charge, and the library pays again for the subsequent two (or so) loans of the same title. The fourth (or so) loan request triggers a purchase of the title. Thus, for the titles that are purchased, the library would pay more than 100 percent of the list price, but the library pays much less than the list price for titles that patrons borrow infrequently, and pays nothing for titles that are not borrowed at all.
Of course, such a model involves advantages and disadvantages, but may well be desirable for some libraries in higher education. Might such a model work for some public libraries?

Let's say you're preparing dinner and you realize with dismay that you don't have any certified organic Tuscan kale. What to do?
Here's how Michelle Obama handled this very predicament Thursday afternoon:
The Secret Service and the D.C. police brought in three dozen vehicles and shut down H Street, Vermont Avenue, two lanes of I Street and an entrance to the McPherson Square Metro station. They swept the area, in front of the Department of Veterans Affairs, with bomb-sniffing dogs and installed magnetometers in the middle of the street, put up barricades to keep pedestrians out, and took positions with binoculars atop trucks. Though the produce stand was only a block or so from the White House, the first lady hopped into her armored limousine and pulled into the market amid the wail of sirens.
Then, and only then, could Obama purchase her leafy greens. "Now it's time to buy some food," she told several hundred people who came to watch. "Let's shop!"
Cowbells were rung. Somebody put a lei of marigolds around Obama's neck. The first lady picked up a straw basket and headed for the "Farm at Sunnyside" tent, where she loaded up with organic Asian pears, cherry tomatoes, multicolored potatoes, free-range eggs and, yes, two bunches of Tuscan kale. She left the produce with an aide, who paid the cashier as Obama made her way back to the limousine.
There's nothing like the simple pleasures of a farm stand to return us to our agrarian roots.
The first lady had encouraged Freshfarm Markets, the group that runs popular farmers markets in Dupont Circle and elsewhere, to set up near the White House, and she helped get the approvals to shut down Vermont Avenue during rush hour on Thursdays. But the result was quite the opposite of a quaint farmers market. Considering all the logistics, each tomato she purchased had a carbon footprint of several tons.
The promotion of organic and locally grown food, though an admirable cause, is a risky one for the Obamas, because there's a fine line between promoting healthful eating and sounding like a snob. The president, when he was a candidate in 2007, got in trouble in Iowa when he asked a crowd, "Anybody gone into Whole Foods lately and see what they charge for arugula?" Iowans didn't have a Whole Foods.
For that reason, it's probably just as well that the first lady didn't stop by the Endless Summer Harvest tent yesterday. The Virginia farm had a sign offering "tender baby arugula" -- hydroponically grown, pesticide free -- and $5 for four ounces, which is $20 a pound.
Obama, in her brief speech to the vendors and patrons, handled the affordability issue by pointing out that people who pay with food stamps would get double the coupon value at the market. Even then, though, it's hard to imagine somebody using food stamps to buy what the market offered: $19 bison steak from Gunpowder Bison, organic dandelion greens for $12 per pound from Blueberry Hill Vegetables, the Piedmont Reserve cheese from Everson Dairy at $29 a pound. Rounding out the potential shopping cart: $4 for a piece of "walnut dacquoise" from the Praline Bakery, $9 for a jumbo crab cake at Chris's Marketplace, $8 for a loaf of cranberry-walnut bread and $32 for a bolt of yarn.
The first lady said the market would particularly appeal to federal employees in nearby buildings to "pick up some good stuff for dinner." Yet even they might think twice about spending $3 for a pint of potatoes when potatoes are on sale for 40 cents a pound at Giant. They could get nearly five dozen eggs at Giant for the $5 Obama spent for her dozen.
But whatever the socioeconomics, there can be no doubt that Obama brought some serious attention to her cause. Hundreds of people crowded the market entrance on I Street as police directed pedestrians to alternative subway entrances. Hundreds braved a light rain and gave a hearty cheer when Obama and her entourage took the stage. "I can't imagine there's been a day in the history of our country when people have been more excited about farmers markets," Mayor Adrian Fenty, Obama's warm-up act, told the crowd.
The first lady, in gray slacks and blue sweater, marveled that the people were "so pumped up" despite the rain. "I have never seen so many people so excited about fruits and vegetables!" she said. (Must be the tender baby arugula.)
She spoke of the global reach of her cause: "The first thing world leaders, prime ministers, kings, queens ask me about is the White House garden. And then they ask about Bo."
She spoke of the fuel fed to the world's most powerful man: "I've learned that when my family eats fresh food, healthy food, that it really affects how we feel, how we get through the day . . . whether there's a Cabinet meeting or whether we're just walking the dog."
And she spoke of her own culinary efforts: "There are times when putting together a healthy meal is harder than you might imagine."
Particularly when it involves a soundstage, an interpreter for the deaf, three TV satellite trucks and the closing of part of downtown Washington.

“It's respect both ways, to say ‘we're here for you,'” said Somerset County Sheriff Frank Provenzano.
Read between the lines. A few dozen New Jersey towns are showing their support for law enforcement.
“A Thin Blue Line. I mean it represents law enforcement. We've had a very difficult couple years, a few years, in our profession. It's certainly been a dangerous profession. We're targeted just because of the uniform we wear,” said New Jersey State Policemen's Benevolent Association President Patrick Colligan.
“The climate in the country within the last year and a half, two years, with all my brothers in blue being shot and killed. We have a target on our back. It's never been that way,” Provenzano said.
But it turns out, thanking the men and women in blue by painting the town blue isn't quite that simple. The Federal Highway Administration sent a letter to the Somerset County Engineer's Office saying, “filling in the gap in a double line, either partially or fully, does not comply with the provisions of the [Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]… The use of blue pavement markings is limited to supplementing white markings for parking spaces for persons with disabilities.”
“I'd like to find the handicapped person who's going to confuse a line in the middle of the roadway with a parking spot. I mean, if that's the case, then respectfully, they shouldn't be driving,” said Colligan.
He also says he thinks the Federal Highway Administration has better things to do.
“Highway deaths just went up over 10 percent, the biggest increase in 50 years, and somebody has time to sit at their desk at the Highway Administration and weigh in on a blue line in New Jersey? Just boggles my mind,” Colligan said.
Provenzano took up the issue with state legislators. State Sens. Kip Bateman and Tom Kean Jr. condemned the federal guidance against the Thin Blue Line in a press release this week, calling it “an overreaction to a very important local matter.”
“I march in the St. Patty's Day parade every year here in Somerset County. And my guys, I follow them, my honor guard, and I stand right in the middle of them marching down the middle of Main Street. What am I walking on? The green line. Nobody complains,” said Provenzano.
Colligan explained, “People are talking about legislation and it costs a lot of money to do legislation. I hope the state isn't going to waste that kind of money. I hope that towns will just turn and say, it's a blue line. Is it a law? I don't think they're violating a law. It's inexpensive. It's $15 in paint, it's $20 in time. I'd say wait until the Highway Administration comes in with cease and desist orders and see what happens.”
A legislative approach is taking shape fast. Bateman told Provenzano he already has a resolution prepared.

The following is a guest post by Lucien Greaves, co-founder and spokesperson for The Satanic Temple.
Soon after the violent white supremacist protests in Charlottesville — and while the President was, for the first time in his political career, carefully moderating his words against those whom he was expected to denounce — opinionators began the usual drudgery of fitting the events into their preferred narratives, regardless of how square the circle. Conservative Sylvia Thompson declared that the entire fiasco had been staged by “fascist leftists” who had infiltrated to Unite the Right movement with “Deep State operatives” to sow racial animus.
Radio host Michael Savage took to Twitter to ask the question that was on no single reasonable person's mind, “WHO STARTED THE RIOTS IN VIRGINIA? IS THE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER AN INSTIGATOR OF UNREST?”
The groveling Christian apologist, conservative commentator, and insufferable little sh*t, Dinesh D'Souza was also quick to somehow put the unlikely blame upon his political adversaries tweeting, “Maybe if Democrats admitted their 150 year history of bigotry & apologized for it this country can begin to heal its divide #Charlottesville”
American Family radio host Bryan Fischer also took to Twitter to blame Democrats, offering a typical Fischerian historical revision, “White nationalism is not conservative but far left. KKK was a Democrat organization, Hitler was a socialist.@CNNhttp://cnn.it/2vXGi0j”
White nationalism is not conservative but far left. KKK was a Democrat organization, Hitler was a socialist. @CNN https://t.co/vaHwp7fblj — Bryan Fischer (@BryanJFischer) August 12, 2017
The Ku Klux Klan is, and always has been, an openly, explicitly, Protestant religious sect, which also made the Twitter comment of author and Corporate Strategist, Eric Garland, who attributed White Supremacy to America's “Satanic side” both senseless and infuriating:
That long shadow has tainted the hearts of those who cling to America's Satanic side. White supremacy. Hatred of rule of law. Violence. — Eric Garland (@ericgarland) August 13, 2017
Evangelist Franklin Graham blamed the Charlottesville violence on the removal of a Confederate memorial, as well as on Satan, “Shame on the politicians who are trying to push blame on President Trump for what happened in #Charlottesville, VA. That's absurd. What about the politicians such as the city council who voted to remove a memorial that had been in place since 1924, regardless of the possible repercussions? […] Really, this boils down to evil in people's hearts. Satan is behind it all.”
Writing for the Washington Post, 14 August 2017, Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, described on his website as “the moral and public policy agency of the nation's largest Protestant denomination,” further elaborated a position that white supremacy is “Satanic.”
“The church should call white supremacy what it is: terrorism, but more than terrorism. White supremacy is Satanism. Even worse, white supremacy is a devil-worship that often pretends that it is speaking for God. It is the same old idolatry of the flesh, the human being seeking to deify his own flesh and blood as God. The Scripture defines this attempt at human self-exaltation with a number: 666. […] The church should call white supremacy what it is: terrorism, but more than terrorism. White supremacy is Satanism. Even worse, white supremacy is a devil-worship that often pretends that it is speaking for God. White supremacy angers Jesus of Nazareth. The question is: Does it anger his church?
As the co-founder of, and spokesperson for, The Satanic Temple, my irritation at such comments shouldn't be surprising. However, to the unaffiliated there seems to be a tendency to view Moore's comments as a triumph of progression among prominent American Christians. He is clearly denouncing the terrorism of the White Supremacists and, while I may identify non-theistically with a Miltonic Satan that defies all subjugation, exalts scientific inquiry, and promotes Humanistic, pluralistic values, I must also recognize that there is a general colloquial understanding of “Satanic” as synonymous with evil, cruelty, and abject depravity. What Moore is really saying is that Christians, and Christian Churches, should be clearly opposed to the mindless tribal thuggery of White Nationalists and they should also be clear that no such philosophy enjoys any of their support. While it may be thoughtless to ignore that self-identified Satanists very actively fight for individual and civil rights, is it not a relatively small crime given the overall picture?
No. In fact, Moore's characterization of the situation is no small offense and, I would argue, one should be at least as offended by Moore's assertion that White Supremacy is Satanism as they may be over Dinesh D'Souza's implication that the violence in Charlottesville can be blamed on the Democratic Party, or Michael Savage's unsurprisingly asinine speculation that the Southern Poverty Law Center was involved. There is more at stake here than a semantic battle over who defines “Satan.” Moore's article, and the various comments from Christian leaders seeking to attribute Charlottesville to Satan or Satanism are nothing short of their Declaration of Refusal to confront the Protestant roots of the American Racist Right. Further, their invocation of the eternal adversary as a scapegoat comes with darker implicit assumptions that should be confronted and rejected outright.
In allowing the colloquial use of “Satanic” to stand unopposed as a blanket term to describe all that is reprehensible and morally corrupt, one also tacitly affirms the implied opposite, that Christianity defines — and has defined — all that is just and morally sound. Correcting this assumption is more than a matter of embittered punitive nitpicking, it's a matter of maintaining fidelity to historical facts so that we might more appropriately confront the dire issues of the present. It's a matter of undermining the destructive certainty of moral authority held by the superstitious.
Slavery in the United States was traditionally — and rather credibly, from a theological perspective — justified on scriptural grounds. The Ku Klux Klan is as much a religious Protestant sect as the Taliban or Al-Qaeda are Muslim. The doctrine of the Christian Identity Movement, with its spurious scholarship and militant apocalyptic urgency, forms the ideological backdrop of “virtually all white supremacist and extreme anti-government movements” in the United States. Allowing Christian leaders to merely disown Protestant radicalisation by fiat absolves them of having to confront the problem of radicalisation from amongst their own. It's one thing to disagree with the scriptural interpretation of a movement, it's entirely another to deny that the movement had any foundations in scriptural interpretations at all. Facing the problem of Protestant racism from within means acknowledging its existence and dedicating a certain amount of energy to maintaining a non-racist Church, not merely claiming that no such element exists only when politically convenient.
It's well past time we stopped allowing religious authorities to pretend that their doctrines have guided the Rights Revolution, while in reality they've traditionally stalled and crippled it. Without a moment's introspection, we find American Christian religious leaders claiming the glory of the 1960s Civil Rights movement while simultaneously fighting to prevent and undo any advances in LGBTQ rights. Believing they've never been wrong, and failing to be corrected by those who know better, they carry on assuming that “right” is not defined by that which is equitable, increases happiness, or reduces suffering, but rather “right” is defined by (their interpretations of) what is stated as such in their archaic yet allegedly infallible laws.
Further, blaming “Satan” for any misdeeds, whether real or imagined, has never been a victimless crime. Moore's words are the very stuff of witch-hunts inspired by a guilty desire to purge one's own sins in a conflagration the scapegoated “other.” In fact, Trump's own conspiracist scapegoating, his cozy relationship with deranged paranoia-mongers, and his near-unanimous support among Evangelicals are all unquestionably factors that have contributed to the increasing flagrance of the Racist Right. Blaming Satanism for Charlottesville only adds fuel to the growing flames of conspiracist unreason while shifting responsibility from where it properly belongs.
Finally, it must be said that nothing could be more antithetical to Modern non-theistic Satanism than racist ideologies. We embrace a large diversity of individuals from a wide spectrum of political and cultural backgrounds, but we're all unified by our respect for individual rights and pluralism. It is axiomatic within Satanism that individuals must be judged for their own actions and for their own merits. To unfavorably relegate individuals into arbitrary categories, or to take credit for the achievements of another based upon a shared classification, is to defy the very foundational principles of our ethics. We simply have no place for simple-minded Supremacist, Nationalist ideologues and, what's more, it's impossible to interpret our tenets otherwise.
Ironically, much of what Moore and other preachers of superstition claim to know about Satanism is derived of a mythology constructed from libels against minority out-groups by Christian majorities. Pagans and Jews were early victims of violent purges, their practices deemed Satanic and intolerable. Native Americans and black slaves were often suspected and accused of Satanic activity in early America. In fact, the vision for a “Christian Nation,” persistently fought for by Evangelical Theocrats, with its refusal to accept cultural diversity, holds that there is but one right way to live our lives, one lifestyle for all households, only one acceptable religious outlook that should be dictated to the nation at large, one god for one people. Is it really so mysterious that some among them might decide there's a “right” race as well?
If we're going to confront the violence in Charlottesville in any constructive manner, we're going to have to do better than ‘the Devil made them do it.'

After stomping Splyce, we had the chance to sit down with H2k Midlaner Febiven to talk about the series, the current Midlane meta, the upcoming EU LCS Summer Split Finals and who he regards as the best EU Midlaners at the moment. Enjoy!
Congratulations on the win. How do you feel right now?
I'm feeling pretty good. I'm quite satisfied but we are not yet at the point where we should be right now. There are still a lot of things to improve on. We have a lot of issues everywhere. In every aspect of the game, we are not perfect. We are good but we could be better in terms of teamfighting, decision-making, vision, etc.
Those two games were really one-sided in many ways. Of course, there was one or two teamfights were Splyce managed to come back with good Galio and Maokai ultimates but overall it looked very convincing. Especially given that a lot of people expected Splyce to win even or at least it to be a close series. Do you think that this was true to what you guys expected?
There wasn't any thought that we would lose because I can handle Sencux easily and I won't have any trouble against him. When I'm controlling the Midlane we usually end up winning as well unless we do stupid macro mistakes or we throw a game. Also, when my team sets me up to a get a lead for me, we usually end up playing good and I knew that I would have a good time today. I played for the team composition and I could farm because Sencux is not the most aggressive player so I expected to win lane. I still expected more from Splyce because Trashy tweeted “Time to show who is the best team in group B.” and I thought “Oh, this guy actually has confidence”.
Your Orianna performance was impressive in the second game. Orianna is that standard Midlane pick that always feels viable. Do you think that's almost a problem that she is just too good as an allrounder?
In my opinion, there are counters to Orianna like Galio. With Galio you can always push like Sencux did. He always pushed me in the early game and they always had pressure. But there is a certain point in the game where Orianna takes over. Her shield is too effective and the cooldown is very low. Also, always having the threat of the Orianna ultimate in team fights is insanely huge. Then there are the slows, you can engage, you can kite. With Orianna you can really do everything. In the lane, she doesn't have bad matchups. You always can go even just against Syndra it is a little bit harder since she has more range but Orianna is still more useful in team fights. I do not think Orianna needs a nerf. I think she is balanced. Some players don't even prioritize Orianna. Some players just like to pick her because she is strong in lane and in teamfights.
Let's talk about H2k. You are a strong team right now and in the top two if not the best team in Europe. Looking back at Rift Rivals, do you regret not having qualified and do you think you might have done better than other teams?
Yes, for sure. I think we would have done better than Fnatic and G2. They got stomped a lot and Fnatic was getting abused by their lack of strategies. I think our playstyle matches better against NA teams because we play in a similar way. Even though NA has good Midlaners like Bjergsen who play really good around their lane. We match up pretty well in every role. Every role can hold on their own and get their leads. Then it is just up to us how we play as a team and I think you could see us playing well against those teams.
You'd want to go to Worlds this year for sure. How do you see your chances, given the last split and looking at playoffs where you are quite likely securing the #1 seed in your group? Do you think that's a reasonable goal?
We won't lose to Splyce. That's for sure and in the next weeks, we won't lose to Unicorns of Love anymore. We have lost so many times against them that we should know how to play them now and the last time we played them we were far ahead and then threw. It is not possible to lose against Exileh anymore because he plays very bad. It hurts to see when he always dies and still wins in the end. He can make so many mistakes and somehow, they always manage to come back but I think that this should get punished harder by the good teams and I think we should be one of those teams. Further, we should be able to beat Fnatic as well. It will be hard but I think that G2 is better than Fnatic. To me, it seems much easier to play Fnatic because G2 just has better players in every role. It is going to be a G2 vs. H2k final for the Summer Split Finals.
Do you think that Fnatic got exposed with their limited amount of strategies at Rift Rivals?
Definitely. Their ADC was only playing two or three champions. Other teams just permanently pushed Botlane and used the pressure to roam to other lanes. They either took the tower early and did an early swap or laned with the ADC only and sent the Support to roam with the Jungler 24/7 while having a strong Midlane pick that can set up ganks for mid and just permanently gank Caps. The only thing you must avoid is to farm against Fnatic until late game. You will lose because they will push you for your life. It is a good strategy in EU but against the better teams, you get punished.
Caps usually get a lot of help from his Jungler. Exileh also, even if not he does not perform that well currently. Do you think that a lot of EU Midlaners look better because they get a lot of help from their Junglers?
No, I do not look at this as a thing that makes them look better. Playing well with your Jungler is important for the vision and pressure but usually, I rate a player by his mechanics. Movement, decision making, and positioning are factors. Not that much on how they synergize with their Jungler because I think most players in EU play well with their Jungler.
In these regards, you probably have a good opinion of Perkz, PowerOfEvil and Nukeduck since they have consistently shown good mechanics?
Yeah, those Midlaners are the best in Europe besides me. I think there is us for in the top tier and then there's the rest. It is really close though. It depends on which team you are on. Nukeduck is a bit in ELO hell. He cannot get as much praise or as many achievements as he should get if he would be on a better team. I think if you would put Nukeduck in H2k or Fnatic you would see a similar performance from him. I don't think he is a that different from the other Midlaners. Maybe personality-wise everyone is different and could benefit in different ways but skill-wise it is close.
Is there anything you would like to say to your fans or the fans of your team H2k?
Thank you, everyone, for cheering. I really want to go to Worlds again and don't want to miss out on this once more. We really can do it and I feel like I personally have the skill necessary to contend with the best players in the world. In the end, it is a team game and we have to do this together but the more love we get the better we will perform. I will always try my best.
Thank you very much for your time!
Lyon brings 'Jeff' to the party
Pakistan spin great Saqlain Mushtaq will have raised eyebrows among the slow bowling fraternity by declaring Australia's Nathan Lyon still has more to do to prove himself at Test level.
Lyon, with 195 Test wickets at 32.87 from 54 Tests matches, is Australia's greatest ever off-spinner in terms of volume of Test scalps taken.
It's a standing in the game that has seen many of Lyon's teammates take to calling him GOAT – an acronym for the Greatest Of All Time that doesn't sit comfortably with the 28-year-old from Young in New South Wales.
Lyon passed Hugh Trumble's mark of 141 Test scalps last winter when he dismissed Kraigg Brathwaite in his 41st Test in Jamaica.
He currently sits fifth on the list of Australian slow-bowling wicket-takers, a list headed by the incomparable leg-spinner Shane Warne.
Saqlain, however, remains far from impressed, putting Lyon alongside England's Moeen Ali and declaring India's Ravichandaran Ashwin a far more complete bowler.
"Nathan Lyon and Moeen Ali still need to prove themselves but Ashwin is a world-class bowler and is bowling superbly at the moment," Saqlain told reporters at the Asia Cup in Bangladesh.
"Ashwin has proved himself at Test level but the other two still need to do a bit more."
Fans of Lyon may wonder what that "bit more" is.
The Australian will look to bring up his 200th Test scalp in his country's next series, against Sri Lanka in mid-year, perhaps at the same Galle venue where he made his debut in 2011.
Details of the Sri Lankan tour are yet to be finalised by the hosts.
In fact, Lyon needs only 13 more wickets to equal Saqlain's Test haul of 208 wickets achieved in 49 Tests.
Now entrenched as Australia's first-choice spinner after he was dropped twice during Australia's 2013 tours of India and England, Lyon is tracking towards being one of Australian cricket's most successful ever bowlers should he maintain his fitness and form.
WATCH: Proud Lyon reflects
Based on his current record of roughly 35 wickets and 10 Tests per year, Lyon should have somewhere between 400 and 450 Test wickets by the time he's 35. And that's crunching the numbers conservatively.
Lyon has a near identical record home and away. Following the Christchurch Test he had played 26 Tests at home and abroad. A further two were played at neutral venues in the UAE against Pakistan.
Lyon has taken 101 wickets in Australia and 91 away, with an average of 31.97 at home compared to 30.31 on foreign soil. His economy is slightly better at home, his strike rate marginally better away.
WATCH: Lyon's amazing Adelaide afternoon
Ashwin, who has played 32 Tests for 176 wickets, has a vastly superior record in home conditions, where his average is 20.92 compared to 36.66 abroad. Ashwin's strike right in India is 46.3, whereas its 67.5 abroad. He has also benefited from playing 19 of his 32 Tests at home.
Saqlain defended Ashwin's record away from home, saying a dip in results was to be expected.
"Ashwin has skills. He has troubled batsmen in the subcontinent and he is capable of doing that outside as well," Saqlain said.
"One needs to accept that in places like England and Australia, the performance graph will go down a bit.
"In Australia, you will play with three pacers and a specialist spinner, in India it will be opposite. The surface, the condition, the ball, everything changes. So if Ashwin gets five-for in India, he will perhaps get three in Australia.
"A captain's plan for spinners in Australia is completely different unless there is some grip in the pitch. Spinner is your fourth option and accordingly will bowl less number of overs,"
Lyon and Ashwin have gone head-to-head in nine Tests, six in Australia and three in India. The numbers provide for endless study, each is a better bowler in home conditions, but what is certain is each belongs at Test level.
Lyon and Ashwin head-to-head
The life of James Bond star Sir Roger Moore was celebrated with a 'beautiful service' on Saturday, his manager has said.
Friends and family said their goodbyes to the longest-reigning 007, who died in Switzerland last month aged 89 after a 'short but brave battle with cancer', at a private service in Monte Carlo.
Sir Roger's manager and biographer, Gareth Owen, posted a photo of the order of service on the actor's official Twitter account on Sunday.
Family and friends came together for a memorial service in Monte Carlo for Sir Roger Moore, pictured, following his death from cancer last month
Sir Roger, pictured left in 2016 and right as James Bond in Octopussy, was remembered in a 'beautiful service'
He added the message: 'Yesterday we said our goodbyes in a beautiful service and celebrated a wonderful life. (Gareth).'
Actress and friend Dame Joan Collins said the funeral was a 'beautiful and loving service for one of the great Saints, Knights and Gents of our time' in a post on Twitter.
She added: 'One last drink. Goodbye, dear @sirrogermoore'.
The private service took place at 11am at Saint Paul's Church in Monte Carlo.
The actor's three children, Deborah, Geoffrey and Christian, announced his death via a statement on social media on May 23.

They said a private funeral would be held in Monaco in 'accordance with our father's wishes'.
Following the news, Sir Roger's predecessors and successors as Bond offered tributes, with Pierce Brosnan lauding him as 'magnificent' as he shared a photograph on Instagram of the pair together.
Sir Sean Connery said he will 'miss' the actor, with whom he enjoyed a long friendship 'filled with jokes and laughter' while Daniel Craig simply wrote 'Nobody Does It Better', in reference to the theme song of The Spy Who Loved Me.
BRANDON, Man. — RCMP in Brandon, Man., are investigating a report that thousands of honey bees have been poisoned in the region recently.
Mounties say in a news release that two locations northwest of Brandon in the rural municipality of Elton are involved.
They say the alleged poisonings are believed to have happened between Aug. 14 and Sept. 3.
Mounties say the bee producers have suffered a substantial financial loss.
Dwindling bee populations have been an increasing concern in the agricultural community, though generally not because of any criminal action.
In recent years, bee populations worldwide have been ravaged by pesticides, parasites and colony collapse disorder, a mysterious phenomenon in which worker bees suddenly disappear.
In California, a record drought has reduced supplies of honey, raising prices for consumers and making it harder for beekeepers to earn a living.
In Ontario, a proposed class-action lawsuit has been launched against two chemical companies that make pesticides widely blamed for massive bee deaths.
I remember thinking when the SEC preseason media poll came out prior to the start of the 2013-14 season that seventh seemed incredibly low for South Carolina women's basketball.
Obviously being around the program we knew they were going to be good, but it was going to take some time for those across the nation to see.
None of us expected the ride to come though. How could anyone?
As the 2013-14 season progressed it became painfully obvious to not just us that were covering the team, but everyone in the country that Dawn Staley had a special group.
The Gamecocks playing in front of what would be some of the best crowds in the nation would go on to win their first-ever SEC regular-season title en route to garnering their first NCAA No. 1 seed.
The Gamecocks would claim their first outright SEC regular-season title in front of a crowd of 12,458 at the Colonial Life Arena on Feb. 27, 2014.
"It just seems so surreal," Staley said at the time. "I think our kids have worked extremely hard, have put themselves in a position to be SEC champions and we took care of business. I'm glad that we did it in front of almost 12,500 fans who were able to join in and share in this joyful moment for us."
South Carolina would eventually bow out in the Sweet Sixteen, but with the pieces in place and A'ja Wilson and the No. 2 recruiting class in the country coming in it was obvious 2014-15 was going to be special.
The 2014-15 season commenced with the Gamecocks advancing to No. 1 in the Associated Press national rankings for the first time in program history.
The Gamecocks would expound greatly upon their tremendous fan following from 2013-14 to finish the year leading the nation in attendance.
That was the not only place the Gamecocks would lead the way though as once again, South Carolina procured another SEC regular-season title before winning their first-ever SEC Tournament title that would be followed up by their inaugural trip to the Final Four.
It was an exceptional season that will live on in the minds of South Carolina fans forever.
After the year was over, Staley and the Gamecocks were honored at the South Carolina State House for all that they did over the course of the season.
“It's tremendous, exciting and amazing, the outpour of support we've got from the entire state," Staley said. "I don't think you could write a better script. All we do is play basketball, but the fans they've created this environment of oneness. Whether you're a Gamecock fan or not, you have an appreciation for what our players have brought to this state and how they've represented our state.”
Now considered one of the top powers in all of women's college basketball, Staley and the Gamecocks started the 2015-16 considered the favorite for the SEC regular-season title once again, while also having a shot at the national title.
Step No. 1 has already been crossed off the list as Staley and the Gamecocks became just the third program in SEC women's basketball history to win three straight SEC regular-season titles, joining Auburn and Tennessee.
Fittingly with South Carolina (24-1, 12-0 SEC) quite possibly now the standard in the SEC, the Gamecocks knocked off the program considered the standard in Tennessee, 62-56, to claim at least a share of the SEC regular-season title on Monday, Feb. 15, 2016.
The currently third-ranked Gamecocks have come a long way in Staley's eight years at the helm and the win over the 24th-ranked Lady Vols was just South Carolina's second ever in Knoxville, Tennessee. It was South Carolina's school-record 11th win over a national ranked opponent this season.
The Gamecocks still have a ton to play for with the SEC Tournament coming up soon and the NCAA Tournament looming.
Nevertheless, looking back makes it fun to look forward as the historical run for South Carolina women's basketball to three straight SEC regular-season titles is nothing short of special.
Still, for Staley and the Gamecocks, while it all may be special, winning SEC regular-season titles is not the end goal for a program of their stature.
Staley - who just won her 351st career game at Tennessee - and the Gamecocks want to win it all.
"There have been some special ones wrapped in there (her career wins), but the biggest one is yet to come," Staley mused recently.

The Detroit Lions have announced the signing of all nine 2013 draft picks.
Defensive end Ziggy Ansah, cornerback Darius Slay, guard Larry Warford, defensive end Devin Taylor, punter Sam Martin, wide receiver Corey Fuller, running back Theo Riddick, tight end Michael Williams and linebacker Brandon Hepburn all agreed to four-year deals.
As a first-round pick, Ansah's deal includes a team option for a fifth year.
Ansah is just the second first-round pick, and first in the top 10, to already agree to terms on a deal.
The team did not disclose the terms of the contracts, but those numbers can be accurately projected based on the league's rookie salary scale.
The Lions are scheduled to open up rookie minicamp on Friday. All eyes figure to be focused on Ansah.
"He's playing -- I don't want to say it's a completely different position -- but he's playing a different technique, a different style with us," Schwartz said on ESPN's "NFL Live" on Thursday. "Physically, we know the sky's the limit. We know everything he goes through is going to be a learning experience."
Paul Lambert is set to receive further transfer funds from Randy Lerner in January and expects highly-rated youngster Jack Grealish to sign a new contract.
Lambert has already held talks with Aston Villa over his strategy for the next transfer window in another clear sign that Lerner is planning to remain as chairman in the short-term, despite the club being up for sale.
Lerner made his first public appearance for a game in nearly two years last weekend for the 3-0 defeat against Arsenal and will return again before the end of the year.
Villa has been on the market since May but Lerner still made around £15million available towards transfer fees and wages in the summer, with the promise of more financial backing in the New Year.
Lambert said: “I've spoken to Tom Fox [Villa's chief executive] about January and whether we need to do something, ultimately the decision will come from the chairman.
“If he thinks it's right for the club he looks at it. If it's too dear he'll say no but he's never turned me away from anything. It all depends on the personnel and hopefully no injuries.
“If somebody comes in and makes an offer that will make Villa stronger then he will make that decision himself but while he's here he will continue to make it the best it can possibly be.
“He came over the other week and I'm pretty sure he'll get over to more games.”
Villa are in talks with Grealish over a new four-year deal and remain confident of the 19-year-old ignoring interest from Saturday's opponents Chelsea to agree terms.
The Ireland under-21 international is regarded as one of the most promising youngsters to emerge from Villa's academy in recent years and is already on the radar of clubs including Chelsea, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur.
But Lambert is hopeful the winger, who joined Villa at the age of six, will extend his deal which expires in June.
“Jack is developing and he's nowhere near the finished article. This is the best place to be because he will get a chance to be around the first team. Hopefully something can be done,” he said.
“He's still so far off from being a established player but we've got high hopes for him. We're talking to the respective parties and let's see what happens.”
Villa are also in negotiations with England international Fabian Delph and club captain Ron Vlaar over new deals.
CLOSE Gayle Manchin, mother of Mylan CEO Heather Bresch, helped boost sales of the EpiPen in her position as president of the National Association of State Boards of Education. USA TODAY

After Gayle Manchin took over the National Association of State Boards of Education in 2012, she spearheaded an unprecedented effort that encouraged states to require schools to purchase medical devices that fight life-threatening allergic reactions.
The association's move helped pave the way for Mylan Specialty, maker of EpiPens, to develop a near monopoly in school nurses' offices. Eleven states drafted laws requiring epinephrine auto-injectors. Nearly every other state recommended schools stock them after what the White House called the "EpiPen Law" in 2013 gave funding preference to those that did.
The CEO of Mylan then, and now, was Heather Bresch. Gayle Manchin is Heather Bresch's mother.
Mylan is the subject of congressional investigations related to huge price hikes the company announced last month. It also faces an antitrust probe by the New York attorney general stemming from its EpiPen sales contracts with schools.
Bresch is testifying before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Wednesday at a hearing called by Republican and Democratic members of the panel.
In October 2012, Mylan sponsored a morning of health presentations at the association's annual conference. The presentations included a panel described as being on three of the biggest school health concerns, including food allergies.
The presenter at the panel, Chicago-based allergy doctor Ruchi Gupta, received more than $400,000 last year from Mylan for research on which she was the principal investigator, according to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services records. The center began releasing drug and device makers' payments to doctors in 2013, when Gupta got more than $17,000 from Mylan for speaking, education, food and travel.
About this time, Mylan launched its "EpiPen4Schools” program, which has provided more than 700,000 free EpiPens to 65,000 schools, about half the nation's schools. The New York attorney general's investigation centers on this program, which required schools to buy EpiPens rather than its competitors if they got discounted versions, but Mylan has since changed the policy.
In December 2012, the association announced an "epinephrine policy initiative" designed to "help state boards of education as they develop student health policies regarding anaphylaxis and epinephrine auto-injector access and use," according to a press release that month. The resulting policy “discussion guide” listed key components that school policies and state legislation should have, including protection from legal liability for the school.
It was the first time the group had addressed food allergies as policy despite its own admission that it had been a growing issue since about 2000.
Previously, the association carefully avoided corporate influence, especially when its policy guidance was involved, says Brenda Welburn, the former longtime executive director. Companies would sponsor conference meals at the most, she said.
Manchin became president-elect of the education association in late 2010 and Welburn retired at the end of 2011. Welburn recalls Manchin stopping by her office saying her "daughter's company" could donate to the group. The following year, it did. "It just looked so bad to me," Welburn said. "She (Manchin) becomes president and all of a sudden NASBE is saying EpiPens are a good thing for schools."
In a statement, Mylan said its sponsorships "focused on initiatives to raise awareness and understanding of anaphylaxis and encouraged policies that supported greater access." (Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic that can be life-threatening and may include trouble breathing, vomiting and a rash.)
"There is no truth to the suggestion that the company's efforts were anything but straightforward or that we are aware of anyone advocating inappropriately for the right of schoolchildren to have access to potential life-saving medicine," the statement said.
Manchin did not respond to requests for comment.
A family affair
Manchin was appointed in 2007 to serve a nine-year term on the West Virginia board of education by her husband, then-Gov. and now Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. Gayle Manchin became the association president in January 2012, the same month her daughter became Mylan's CEO.
Minutes of a NASBE board of directors meeting in March 2012 show Mylan funding was discussed. It continued this year with what executive director Kristen Amundson said was a $15,000 contribution from Mylan in April.
Considering the association's $2.5 million annual budget, Amundson said the $25,000 in 2012 to pay for the epinephrine discussion guide wasn't enough for the group to "engage in behavior to cause our members to question why" the money was accepted.
Part of the "boilerplate" language in the association's Mylan agreement says the group "will not directly or indirectly promote Mylan Specialty's products," Amundson said.
It didn't have to.
Then, as now, EpiPen was about the only auto-injector for the drug epinephrine, which has been around since about 1900. The Mylan-sponsored materials rarely mentioned EpiPens. Instead, references to treatment for anaphylaxis mentioned only epinephrine and auto-injectors.
In the epinephrine discussion guide,” the association acknowledged Mylan's support, but noted "NASBE alone is responsible for the editorial content contained herein."
David Kysilko, who was the group's director of publications until his retirement in 2014, says that for the discussion guide, "we were provided one person who was our contact within Mylan." That person "provided us with both the background and research (but) not all of it,” as well as contacts for other research, he said. The association also "gave them a look at an early draft," which he said is "fairly common whether it's a company or a foundation."
Still, "we were always very careful in terms of who made final editorial decision," he said.
Rhode Island attorney Patrick Guida, who succeeded Manchin as NASBE president in 2013, says he doesn't "cynically see any of the sinister motives of these companies" that others do.
Who knew what
When asked about the Mylan sponsorship of two panels she moderated at the association's 2012 annual conference, Brenda Gullett, a former Arkansas state senator and school board member, said she wasn't aware of Mylan's funding for either panel or the numerous policy publications.
"Had I been aware, I would have been concerned,” she said, “and, given my proclivity to speak up, I would have addressed it."

Gullett wasn't the only one unaware of the Mylan-Manchin connection. "It's probably true that (NASBE) didn't highlight that outside of the board of directors meetings," Kysilko said.
NASBE board member Alan Taylor of Connecticut says he doesn't recall knowing there was a family connection between Mylan and Manchin, who succeeded him as president. Guida said he was unaware of the relationship, and "I know Gayle pretty well."
Since there were highly publicized allergy-related deaths, which included a seven-year-old Virginia girl in 2012, state legislatures including Taylor's own were worried about liability if schools handled medication wrong, he said.
"It seemed like a useful thing for NASBE to do for state boards," Taylor said of some state-specific, Mylan-sponsored policy guidance. There were concerns the "funding would control the policy but of course everyone gets skeptical about that."
But Gullett said she can't imagine the group allowing a drug company to sponsor official guidance on concussions — a top school health concern at the same time food allergies were. And Welburn recalls when HIV/AIDS became a concern in the 1990s and NASBE suggested gloves should be worn around blood, she never would have entertained the idea of a latex glove maker sponsoring the education efforts.
"Companies like that don't know schools," Welburn said. "They want to use you to get into schools."

Benedict Cumberbatch: Code Breaker Alan Turing Was A Puzzle Himself
Enlarge this image toggle caption Black Bear Pictures Black Bear Pictures
The Imitation Game is the story of Alan Turing: British mathematician, World War II code breaker and seminal theoretician of computer science. "It's a war thriller, it's a love story and a tragic testament to a genius wronged," the star of the film, Benedict Cumberbatch, tells NPR's Robert Siegel.
Turing, who was openly gay at a time when homosexuality was a crime in Britain, talked his way into a job helping the British crack the German code called Enigma. Cumberbatch says the film's script has a "beautifully complex unraveling through time ... the unraveling of both the problem and the man, himself, trying to solve the problem."
Interview Highlights
On the audience's introduction to Turing, who was known to be awkward and eccentric
I think what's extraordinary about Graham Moore's first feature script is how you, layer by layer, sort of uncover this man at the same parallel time as the team he eventually does play a part of. ... And I think, to be fair to Alan, what's beautiful about Graham's script in his introduction to him ... it's utterly uncompromising. There's no vanity, you're not asked to like the character. You're introduced to him, warts and all. And he is ... difficult; he's very stubborn and arrogant.
But there's a sort of naive guilelessness about the whole thing. He doesn't come in with an abrasive attitude. He just doesn't have the formal respect for authority. ... And he is utterly brilliant and he knows it and he's been told that and he doesn't mind talking about it. But it's not to show off; for him, it's a statement of fact.

And he is utterly brilliant and he knows it and he's been told that and he doesn't mind talking about it. But it's not to show off; for him, it's a statement of fact.
On the way the state punished Turing for being gay
It's disgusting to think that within less than 100 years [that] this was going on hundreds — thousands in fact — of men were prosecuted and given the chance to choose simply between two years' imprisonment or two years' state-sanctioned chemical castration through weekly estrogen injections. Alan chose the latter in order to continue his work. But the man was a marathon runner as well as a sexually active homosexual man, and not only did the drug ravage his body and affect his physicality but it also started slowly to impinge on his faculty, on his mind, on his ability to do that work. So he was denied the one door he still had left open to him for love, for freedom, for expressing who he was.
On bringing Turing's story to a wider audience
In comparison to his achievements and his greatness — both as a scientific mind [and] philosopher ... somebody who ... basically was the father of computer science, somebody who was part of an effort that saved, some estimate, 14 million lives by breaking a code that brought about a two-years-early end to World War II. That that man wasn't better-known — I mean, why isn't he on banknotes with Darwin and Newton? Why isn't he on the cover of history books as well as science books? That really was a driving motivation for me to tell this story and bring his legacy to a wider audience.
On the Turing machine
It's more than a machine. I mean, that machine takes on such a personality. .... A replica is still at Bletchley Park, which I advise any of your listeners who are lucky enough to be in that part of the world to go and see it. It's the most extraordinary, chilling, amazing exhibit of all the work. ... You can ask someone to give you a very patient explanation of it because it's quite complex. But basically, it was the machine that Alan adapted from a Polish machine to break the other machine, the Enigma machine — which was capable of ... 159 million, a million, a million possible variations every single day that would change at midnight. It was beyond the human ability to crack.
On the way these machines are seen in 2014
"Where's the screen?" as one friend's child said. ... Broke my heart when I heard that. But the same kid then went home and Googled — using probably an algorithm very similar in the search engines that were used by Turing, invented by Turing to break the code in the second world war — used a Google search engine in order to look up and research more about Enigma. This is an 8-year-old. I mean, it's fantastic.
On his decision to go by Benedict Cumberbatch (his father, also an actor, is named Timothy Carlton, and Cumberbatch's full name is Benedict Timothy Carlton Cumberbatch)
I started as Benedict Carlton. I think Carlton's a great name; it was my grandfather's first name and I never got to meet him, so that alone was a good reason. And I wasn't getting anywhere with my first agent and with that name and when I went to meet someone else at a new agency about six months after I graduated, she said, "Why on earth don't you use your family name? It's the most fantastically extraordinary, unforgettable name." ...
Even I can't say it early on a Monday morning. It sounds like a fart in a bath. There's a whole lot of bubbles.
She rightfully said, "Look, it's pretty unforgettable once you get your head around it." And I said, "Yeah, but even I can't say it early on a Monday morning." It sounds like a fart in a bath. There's a whole lot of bubbles. But, you know, it seems to have worked out all right, doesn't it, Robert?
On whether being famous is fun
It's fun. It's got to be fun. There are moments when, like all of us, you get a bit self-conscious and you'd rather not be living any of your day in public. Those are the awkward times, but you've got to have fun with it.
State Rep. Anthony Kern said he handed out materials as part of a church group on the Glendale Community College campus for several years without any trouble.
But one year, “all of a sudden they came up with this free speech zone which was way away from the people,” the Republican told the Arizona Capitol Times.
That inspired Kern to introduce House Bill 2615, which broadens campus “free speech zones” to the entire public college campus as opposed to designated areas. It provides students the right to exercise their First Amendment rights without concerns about the time, place and manner unless the public higher education institution can prove the restriction is reasonable and justified.
“The First Amendment right of free speech is a bedrock founding principle of our Republic,” said Gov. Doug Ducey (R) when he signed the legislation this month. “Likewise, part of the university experience is to be able to express diverse views, openly, without fear of retribution or intimidation – and to be exposed to other views and perspectives, even if they aren't politically correct or popular.”
“These bills protect free speech throughout our college campuses, and also ensure an individual's right to engage in free speech isn't shut down by someone else who disagrees with his or her perspective,” Ducey added.
Gov. Ducey also signed House Bill 2548 which could help people like Brittany Mirelez.
The Paradise Valley Community College student filed suit against PVCC after administrators prevented her from recruiting on campus for a Young Americans for Liberty chapter.
Mirelez's suit claimed that by confining her to a pre-designated free speech zone, her First Amendment rights had been violated.
HB 2548 gives students the right to file lawsuits against colleges and universities, and to receive an award judgment if the court finds that the university or community college has restricted the student's speech.
OREGON CITY, Ore., March 10 (UPI) -- A Nevada man driving to a court hearing was stopped for speeding three times in Oregon, racking up $2,000 in fines, police said.
Lt. Gregg Hastings, a spokesman for the Oregon State Police, said the driver, Jose Romero-Valenzuela, 34, of Las Vegas, was clocked at 105 mph the first time, 98 mph the second and 92 the third, The Portland Oregonian reported. All three stops occurred within about an hour.
Romero-Valenzuela came close to getting a fourth ticket, when a trooper west of Hood River tracked him with a radar gun and found he was chugging along at a stately 65 mph.
"I've heard of two stops, but not three," Hastings said. "You'd hope that the message would have gotten across the first time he was stopped. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case."
In addition to a possible $2,000 in fines, Romero-Valenzuela could lose his license for 90 days for driving at more than 100 mph, Hastings said.
Romero-Valenzuela already had legal problems in Oregon. He was on his way to a preliminary hearing on a drug charge in Oregon City.
Aam Aadmi Party leader Shazia Ilmi may resign from the Arvind Kejriwal-led outfit on Saturday, Times Now reported, as she called for the AAP to reinvent itself. Ilmi may make the announcement at a press conference scheduled for 1pm on Saturday, the TV channel reported.
Dissent within the AAP came to the fore on Friday as the party's foot-soldiers questioned the leadership over the debacle in the Lok Sabha elections and demanded dissolution of the Political Affairs Committee (PAC), even as party leaders tried to pacify them.
Read: Kejriwal writes letter on why he is in jail; AAP plans drive
At a meeting organised to discuss future course of action for the party after its convener Kejriwal's judicial custody was extended, many volunteers sought answers about the functioning within the party.
Some volunteers were seen holding placards with messages, "Who will own the responsibility of defeat (in the Lok Sabha elections)?" and "PAC should be dissolved" at the meeting.
In a bid to pacify them, party leaders asked the cadre to write their queries and grievances on a paper, which many did even as a few grumbled.
Read:AAP volunteers hold protest against Kejriwal's detention
"This system does not work as party hardly gets back on these questions," an AAP volunteer said.
Party leaders, however, admitted there was a lack of communication with the party volunteers, but tried to rejuvenate them with encouraging talks.
"There has been a lack of communication in the party because of the limited resources," party Delhi unit secretary and AAP spokesperson Dilip Pandey told volunteers.
"We admit that we have faults and we have to build the organisation. We have to improve the system," party leader and Political Affairs Committee (PAC) member Gopal Rai said.
"Congress is more than 125 years old and we are just one and half years old. Still we have done good," he said.
Senior party leader Manish Sisodia applauded the cadres for their work despite the dismal performance saying its vote share had increased in the Lok Sabha polls compared to Delhi elections.
"Who says we have not done well? Ours is a one and half year old party and we have managed to increase our vote share from 29 per cent to 33 per cent. Our candidate in Udaipur has managed to get more than 1.5 lakh votes where senior party leaders did not campaign," Sisodia said.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley's Hatch Act violation isn't the first ethical or legal lapse for Trump's administration. | Spencer Platt/Getty Images Nikki Haley hit for Hatch Act violation over Trump retweet
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley violated the law by retweeting President Donald Trump's endorsement of a South Carolina congressional candidate, according to the federal Office of Special Counsel.
Haley's June Twitter post from her personal account marks the second time this year that a top Trump aide has run afoul of the Hatch Act, a Depression-era law that regulates campaigning by government officials.
Story Continued Below
While the flagged message circulated from @nikkihaley, which isn't Haley's official ambassador account, the Office of Special Counsel determined her decision to repost a presidential message supporting Republican House candidate Ralph Norman still “gave the impression that she was acting in her official capacity.”
The Office of Special Counsel is an independent federal agency born out of the Watergate scandal that has investigative and prosecutorial powers to protect federal employees who face discrimination or other workforce problems, including retaliation for whistleblowing. The office, located in downtown Washington, also has authority to enforce the Hatch Act.
Haley's personal page at the time of the post included an official government headshot with the American flag behind her, as well as a picture at the White House with Trump and other members of the U.N. Security Council. Many of Haley's Twitter posts also covered official matters, and the official homepage of the U.S. Mission to the United Nations included a link back to her personal Twitter account, wrote Erica Hamrick, the deputy chief of the Office of Special Council's Hatch Act Unit, in a September 28 letter to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, the government watchdog that first flagged the tweet.
Haley has since deleted her June 19 retweet after she became aware of the potential violation, and the Office of Special Counsel said it found no evidence she engaged in any additional prohibited political activity on Twitter. Haley will not face any penalties over the retweet, and Hamrick said she had closed Haley's file.
At the same time, Haley did get a warning that any repeat offenses could lead to disciplinary action for “a willful and knowing violation of the law,” Hamrick said.
Haley's Hatch Act violation isn't the first ethical or legal lapse for Trump's administration. White House social media director Dan Scavino got flagged for his own Hatch Act violation in June for a Twitter post that called on Trump allies to launch a primary challenge against Michigan GOP Rep. Justin Amash.
The Office of Government Ethics earlier this year also urged White House attorneys to investigate senior adviser Kellyanne Conway for “misuse of position” after she endorsed presidential daughter Ivanka Trump's clothing line during an appearance on Fox News. Trump himself has come under fire over his decision in January to be sworn into office while retaining ownership of his personal businesses.
“One is unfortunate, two is a coincidence, but three in less than a year is a pattern,” said Noah Bookbinder, CREW's executive director, who blamed the Haley, Scavino and Conway lapses on Trump. “This all stems from the president's permissive attitude toward ethics. The tone is set at the top.”
While Trump himself is not covered by the Hatch Act, ethics lawyers have also raised questions about White House aides who may have played a role in crafting a presidential speech delivered in August urging Missouri voters to oust Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill.
A White House spokeswoman referred questions about Haley's Hatch Act violation to the U.S. ambassador's office, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Some astronomers call it the Big Quiet – the absence of sunspots during what is supposed to be a period of heightened magnetic activity on our sun.
For past four or more days, telescopes pointed at the sun have detected only a handful of sunspots, sometimes none at all, in a “very weird” development that is baffling scientists, said Alan Duffy, an astrophysicist at Swinburne University.
Almost spotless: the sun on July 18. Credit:NASA
“Sunspots can change all the time, but when you should be seeing many dozens at any one point of time, it's quite strange that we're not seeing any at all,” Dr Duffy said. “We don't have any idea why that is.”
Sunspots have been studied for centuries and are one gauge of the solar cycle – a roughly 11-year period of above- or below-average magnetic activity. During maximum periods, such as the current one, observations of sunspots and solar flares being fired by the sun should be more common.
The coastline of the United Kingdom is formed by a variety of natural features including islands , bays , headlands and peninsulas . It consists of the coastline of the island of Great Britain and the north-east coast of the island of Ireland , as well as a large number of much smaller islands. Much of the coastline is accessible and quite varied in geography and habitats. Large stretches have been designated areas of natural beauty, notably the Jurassic Coast and various stretches referred to as heritage coast .
Length Edit
The mapping authority for the United Kingdom, the Ordnance Survey, records the coastline of the main island, Great Britain, as 11,072.76 miles rounding to 11,073 miles (17,820 km).[1] The British Cartographic Society points out that "The true answer is: it depends!". If the larger islands are added, the coastline as measured by the standard method at Mean High watermark rises to about 19,491 miles (31,368 km).[2] According to the CIA Factbook, the length of the UK coastline is around 12,429 km or 7,723 miles, although no details are provided about how this figure was calculated.[3] On the basis of EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive boundaries,[4] the UK coastline can be divided into the eastern, Greater North Sea section, which using 1km2 box counts and including islands is 4,994 km, and a western Celtic Seas coastline, which using the same measurement approach and including Northern Ireland is 14,201 km.
Furthermore, the measurement of any coastline is subject to variation depending upon the scale of map used. It is a meaningless statistic without knowing the scale of the map being used and the accuracy of the measurement. A larger map scale and smaller unit of measure will result in more detail being revealed and measured and thus a greater length.[2] And because the resultant length increases exponentially faster than the increase of scale of measurement, there is no such thing as "an approximate answer" to this question. This is referred to as the coastline paradox. A coastline is fractal-like — which means that it has self-similar properties, similar at every scale — therefore the closer the observer looks, the more detail is revealed, leading to a greater overall length.[5]
Shape Edit
The United Kingdom's coastline is more broken than coastlines of many other countries. It has a fractal or Hausdorff dimension or 'wiggliness' of 1.25, which is comparatively high; the Australian coastline for example has a fractal dimension of 1.13, and that of South Africa is 1.02.[6]
As a result of this shape and the number of islands, the coastline of the UK is longer than that of similar sized countries. For example, the coastline of Italy is around 9,226 km in length, France 7,330 km and Spain 7,268 km. Greece, which has a large number of islands similar to the UK, has a coastline of around 15,147 km. This means the UK has a relatively high coast/area ratio.[7]
Nowhere in the UK is more than 113 kilometres (70 mi) from the coast. It is estimated that around 3 million people (out of 60 million) live on the coast of the UK. The place furthest from the coast is Coton in the Elms in Derbyshire, which is equidistant from Fosdyke Wash in Lincolnshire; White Sands between Neston in Cheshire and Flint, Flintshire in Wales; and Westbury-on-Severn Gloucestershire.[8][9]
PORTLAND, OR—The parking lot of Arborview ShoppingPlex is, in most respects, no different from that of any other suburban shopping center: Shoppers and commuters hurry to and fro, busy with the hustle and bustle of hectic modern life. But something about this particular scene is different. The parking lot is alive with song.
"Give me oil for my lamp, keep me burnin', burnin', burnin'," sings Portland-area resident Gerald "Jerry" Svoboda, a kind, bearded Christian with a guitar and a story to tell.

"Everybody!" he shouts before repeating the chorus.
In a time when community involvement often seems to be a thing of the past, it is rare indeed to find someone who reaches out to others in the hope of making the world a better place.
But here, on the outskirts of Portland, such a man exists. Though a community-mandated restraining order prevents Svoboda from actually entering the mini-mall complex, this modern-day minstrel continues his mission: to spread his message of love, hope and happy sing-along fun.

Ignoring the irritated stares of passing shoppers, he strums gently on his acoustic guitar. "Let me tell you all a story," says Svoboda, a "part-time retirement home play therapist and full-time lover of the Lord." "This is a story about a man… a man who lived 2,000 years ago… a man from Galilee."
Though onlookers eventually begin pelting him with debris, the soft-spoken crusader and self-described 'songsmith' is not deterred.
Svoboda has been playing his self-penned inspirational tunes for community residents since 1989. Sometimes, in area churches or veterans' lodges, he provides slide-show accompaniment, featuring watercolor Bible story illustrations by his friend Warren. Some would say his unique brand of personal ministry is not terribly effective, since in the eight years he has been musically witnessing, he has only converted four people to the Lord, and three of those were among a vanload of retarded adults on a field trip. But to Svoboda, each one is a victory.

"If even one soul is saved by my music, I'll keep telling my story. You know what? God loves you… and I love you too," he says, forcibly embracing a passerby.
"I enjoy talking to people, especially the kids. Because of my long hair, they trust me," he says, casually brushing aside one of his long locks like a young girl. "They know I'm one of them. I talk about this in my song 'C'mon Teens, Let's Hang Out With Jesus.' I admit, I may not know any songs by the Grateful Dead, but friend, I'm here to tell you all about the victory over death by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ!"
Teenagers remain the primary focus of Svoboda's music and mission. He approaches a group of pierced, leather-clad rockers. "Say, how are you boys doing today? Just doing your own thing? I think that's neat. Say, do you ever think about God?"
Advertisement
Moments later, Svoboda is savagely beaten by the youths. His good-time spirit, however, is strong as ever.
"Don't worry about my ripped clothes," he says, smiling and tenderly icing his blackened eye. "I have plenty more baggy, earth-tone sweaters at home just like this one." Within an hour, he has changed clothes and received first-aid care, and is back in action.
Despite his remarkably positive attitude and never-say-die spirit, Svoboda is no stranger to adversity: An alcoholic for some 11 years, he found the Lord in 1985 after being jailed briefly for molesting cats. But with the Lord's help, those troubles are thankfully far behind him.
Advertisement
"And they'll know we are Christians by our love, by our love," he sings as the minivans and family wagons drive away at day's end, ignoring him. "Yes, they'll know we are Christians by our love."
Soon, mall security will come, as they do every night, and demand that he leave. But until then, Jerry Svoboda has a story to tell—a story for us all.
A black Lamborghini Aventador burned itself up like a protesting Buddhist monk this morning in Southern California according to a poster on Luxury4Play. And here we thought self-immolation was a Ferrari trademark. UPDATE!
The owner is ok, but the gorgeous black bull is sadly a pile of blackened metal.
UPDATE! The car actually belongs to a dealer and was on a test drive, which led to this awesome pose from "Aventador Guy" and video of the fire.

The "left rear wheel on fire" points to a non-collision incident, although it's too early to speculate what caused it.
Hopefully, this is just a one-off and not the start of a trend.

No official announcement has been made and contract negotiations are still reportedly in play, but according to EP and co-creator Steve Levitan, it looks like Modern Family will live to see its ninth season.
“In about a month or so, the writers will re-gather and we will sit down and we will start the season with a big, ‘What now?'” Levitan said during an Academy of Television Arts & Sciences panel discussion Wednesday night.
Following a special advance screening of the Season 8 finale episode ‘The Graduates' in which the characters of Manny (Rico Rodriguez) and Luke (Nolan Gould) get their diplomas, Levitan–who also directed the episode–speculated as to how a new season might handle the kids being all grown up. “That's a reality, we can't escape that,” he said. “We're not The Simpsons, where everybody can stay young forever and nobody ages, so it forces our show to change.”
We're not The Simpsons, where everybody can stay young forever and nobody ages,” Levitan said of kids on the show like Jeremy Maguire, pictured with Sofia Vergara.
Jessica Chou
Others though, seemed less sure of the show's future.
“Are they going to cancel us?” Sofia Vergara joked, as the rest of the cast and audience broke out laughing. Vergara, who plays Colombian character Gloria, was light-heartedly referencing the Trump administration's apparent disinterest in the inclusivity the show has historically championed. But joking aside, Levitan admitted the political influence had been on his mind, leaving him wondering how it might affect the show's trajectory.
“I've been thinking about that lately,” he said. “How is our political movement going to affect our taste in comedy? It's so much a part of our life now in a really big way that I wonder if it will seep in more in next season with what we're all going through.”
Beginning in 2009, Modern Family has always come from a place of political freedom. Back then, it was still exploring relatively new territory when it put gay couple Mitch (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Cam (Eric Stonestreet) front and center.
“People think it's old hat to have a gay couple, and they're complaining, ‘Well they're both white!' and you're like, ‘Yes, but eight years ago they were gay,'” Bowen said of Tyler Ferguson and Stonestreet's characters, pictured.
“I grew up very closeted, “Tyler Ferguson said. “And I always thought how great it would be if I could turn on my television and find someone who's not just gay, but in a gay relationship. That would have made my coming out a lot easier.”
More recently, the show introduced guest star Jackson Millarker, an eight year-old trans actor playing Tom, the trans friend of Mitch and Cam's daughter Lily (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons).
“It was very exciting,” Tyler Ferguson said. “I think it was very important for all of us to have a kid who's actually identifies as transgender.”
While Modern Family has been something of a trailblazer when it comes to inclusivity, Levitan is quick to pay homage to an earlier show that paved the way. “We owe a lot to shows like Will & Grace,” he said. “That really broke huge barriers at that time.”
Julie Bowen, who plays Claire, pointed out that despite the political situation, television seems to be making some headway when it comes to inclusivity and diversity.
“People say we were cutting edge eight years ago,” she said. “And the fact that we're no longer cutting edge I consider a testament to how well the show has been accepted by a broad audience. The fact that people think it's old hat to have a gay couple, and they're complaining, ‘Well they're both white!' and you're like, ‘Yes, but eight years ago they were gay and that was the first thing that people noticed.' The fact that they aren't noticing their gayness, that's great, that's a stride, that's steps forward, that's wonderful.”
Perhaps Levitan will rise to the political challenge and we'll see the show sharpen that ‘cutting edge' next season.
The panel at the Television Academy's Saban Media Center also included Ty Burrell, Eric Stonestreet, Ariel Winter, Nolan Gould and Aubrey Anderson-Emmons.
This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN: Juan, before we go to our first segment, you did a very interesting column in the New York Daily News on the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the union of police officers in New York, and its leader, Pat Lynch.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yeah, well, I've been following, as many people have around the country, the ongoing standoff between Mayor de Blasio and the policemen's union, Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, which has been going on now for more than a month with—and it's been marked by incredible allegations by the head of the police union, Patrick Lynch, that—for instance, that the two officers who were assassinated on December 20th, on December 20th, were—that their blood was on the mayor's hands; and then by hundreds of policemen, at the funerals of the officers, turning their back on the mayor; and now, for over two weeks, a complete slowdown by New York City police officers refusing to write summonses or do misdemeanor arrests. There's been about a huge drop in the number of arrests and tickets issued in New York City. Now, that's begun to change now, finally, and those summonses and arrests are going back up. But there's clearly been an attempt by the policemen's union very much to almost—I don't want to call it a coup, but it is an attempt to try to tell the mayor, a progressive mayor of New York, “You can't run this city without us.”
But now it turns out there is a huge dissension within the ranks of the police department itself. There was a—Pat Lynch had issued a letter asking cops to disinvite the mayor and the City Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, from any funeral in case they were killed in the line of duty. Only 4 percent of the cops have signed on to the letter. Yesterday there was a meeting of the union of the police delegates, and there was an open fight that broke out between several of the pro-Lynch people and the anti-Lynch people saying, “We don't care about an apology from the mayor. What we want is for you to handle our grievances and our problems that we have as police officers,” because the police have been without a labor contract for five years. And now I'm reporting in today's Daily News that there is an entire slate of people that is preparing to run against Lynch in union elections that are being held in June. And he hasn't had a challenge since 2003. He's been the president of the union for 15 years. So, there's a major convulsion going on within the police union.
And, of course, it's against the backdrop that the New York City Police Department now has a majority of minority officers, African-American, Latino and Asian officers. It's not the same police department that existed 15 years ago when Lynch was first elected. And many of those officers are equally angry over the past practices of racial profiling, of stop-and-frisk arrests, and they, too, are demanding some kind of change. So, we're going to have to see what happens, but clearly there's not the kind of unity among the police against the mayor that has been portrayed so far in the press.
AMY GOODMAN: We'll link to your column at democracynow.org. I also encourage people to go to our website to look at our interviews with the New York police officer Adhyl Polanco, as well as retired detective Graham Weatherspoon, all talking about who actually represents the police in New York. This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org.
