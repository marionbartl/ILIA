Five German women were arrested on Tuesday night when a flashmob stunt in a northern Spanish town sparked fears of a terrorism attack.
They have since been released but will be charged with public order offences.
Holidaymakers ran and hid from presumed attackers in Platja d'Aro after people pretended to be chasing a celebrity, shouting and taking photographs.
The panic turned into a stampede as bystanders mistook selfie sticks for weapons.
Eleven people were treated for bruising and heart palpitations. Three were taken to hospital.
Police were called to the centre of the town following reports that shots had been fired. The reports turned out to be false.
Videos on social media showed children in tears as people around them cowered under tables.
The German newspaper Die Welt (in German) said that about 200 people took part in the flashmob, which was organised by several Germans.
Apparently those taking part were invited on social media to go down to Platja d'Aro on Tuesday evening and behave like paparazzi.
The detained women, aged between 20 and 25, were in the Costa Brava town accompanying a youth group trip.
The president of Catalonia tweeted that some things should not be joked about. They also praised the reaction from the town council and police.
Homecoming queen scores field goal at their dad's last game as coach Copyright by WIAT - All rights reserved Video
WEST BLOCTON, Ala. (WIAT) --- High school students all over Alabama work to make their dreams a reality on Friday nights -- the players, the band, the cheerleaders -- everyone has a role.
Occasionally, you come across someone like Jodie Farnetti who has all the stars aligned on a special night.
The story looks like so many others under those Friday night lights -- a cheerleader wins homecoming queen. But to get the full story, you have to go back to Jodie Farnetti's childhood, when they were 10 years old going to work with their dad, the West Blockton coach.
Jodie Farnetti said, "Everyday I had to stay for football practice and I just kicked and I just kicked because I loved it, it was awesome to do something different."
Gregg Farnetti, the West Blocton head coach said, "It's kinda been a little inside joke that one day they may kick for the West Blocton Tigers."
The idea was planted and they kept practicing as they got older.
Jodie became a varsity cheerleader and was nominated to the homecoming court, but they still wanted to fulfill that promise they made to their dad as a little girl.
Jodie said, "The boys would practice and I would have to wait on dad to get done so I would just go down there and I'd kick and I'd kick."
The players gave the okay; the kick would come during the homecoming game, on the night Jodie was crowned homecoming queen.
Jodie said, "Dad this will be your first year escorting a football player for homecoming court, they said that's right. I had to walk out there in my pads and everything which made it special."
The moment of truth came, and the kick was true. The moment was captured forever. A dad, a daughter, two warrior hearts melted by their love of winning and for each other.
Jodie said, "He'll never have a son, every day I'm sure dreams of having a son that will be able to play football. Now they can say that, my daughter kicked in a game that we won in. It's just very special."
Jodie is a senior and their dad is retiring. Their only game together was their final home game as West Blocton's head coach. The coach will spend next year watching Jodie do one more thing -- play college softball. They recently committed to Wallace-Hanceville.

The court in the central city of Limoges heard that the father wanted to teach their son a lesson because the youngster "had stopped saying hello in the morning".
“I told them they should respect me and yes I gave them a spanking,” the father said, according to local newspaper Le Populaire.
The father admitted spanking the boy's bottom, known in France simply as a “fessée”. In court they defended their actions, saying they were against the "current fashion" of parenting that stops adults from "correcting children".
The court's ruling has made waves in France, where unlike 23 other countries in the European Union, there is no actual law banning spanking or other forms of corporal punishment. French law tolerates the “right of correction” of children by family members.
The verdict has seemingly left many confused about the law with several news sites chosingto reming readers what is and isn't illegal when it comes to striking children.
"Can parents spank their children," was the title of one article on the Europe1 news site (see below).

The court in Limoges decided however, that their use of force was “violent” and an “act of humiliation for the child” and handed the father a suspended €500 fine.
“Fortunately we are no longer in an era when parents and teachers inflict physical punishment. This is a by-gone era,” said deputy prosecutor Jean-Paul Lescat.
After a British children's rights charity lodged a complaint against France over its failure to ban corporal punishment with the European Committee of Social Rights, Paris responded by insisting the penal code, which prohibits the abuse of a minor, is adequate to defend the rights of children.
After the verdict against the father many are now pointing out that France is behind the rest of Europe.
Under pressure from Brussels may countries in Europe have either banned or are in the process of prohiting spanking or any kind of corporal punishment. France therefore appears increasingly isolated with its refusal to change the law.
Scandinavian countries as well as Germany, Spain and Portugal, Italy and Austria have an outright ban where as the Czech Republic and Slovakia are considering a ban. In France, Belgium and Switzerland smacking is only allowed in the context of a family.
The UK has a similar law, in that it is illegal to inflict injuries causing more than a temporary reddening of the skin.
According to the organisation Union of Families in Europe (UFE), France is one of the few European Countries where it is believed that “spanking is an educational method”, French newspaper Liberation noted.
A recent poll by UFE revealed that 87 percent of French parents admitted having slapped their child at least once.
There's no such thing as a little smack'
Earlier this year Dr Gilles Lazimi, who is leading a campaign by the Foundation for Childhood in France for a new law to be introduced banning corporal punishment, told The Local: “There's no such thing as a little smack”.
"According to a study done in 2007 by the Union of European Families, 85 percent of French parents and grandparents admit to having smacked a child in their care.
"Even worse, half of French parents and grandparents have been found to slap infants under the age of two.
"To us, it's ethically unthinkable that a parent should strike their child, and we are calling for a law in France banning any sort of corporal punishment.
Police investigate a flat in Constable St, Newtown, where the body of a woman in their 30s was found on Tuesday night.
A call to police by concerned friends led to the discovery of a body in a Wellington flat.
A woman in their 30s was found dead by police in their Constable St home in Newtown on Tuesday night, after worried friends contacted them concerned about them whereabouts.
Detective Senior Sergeant Warwick McKee said officers knocked on the door of the woman's flat in the Wellington suburb Newtown on Tuesday night with no answer.
ROSS GIBLIN/ FAIRFAX NZ The scaffolding at the rear of the building, which police climbed to get into the flat after receiving no reply.
They then climbed up on scaffolding behind the back of the flats, and were able to see into the flat, where the woman lay dead.
Police are still investigating how they died, and would not comment on whether their death was suspicious, or whether their body showed any signs of injury.
They still had to remove the body from the flat and conduct a post-mortem.
ROSS GIBLIN/ FAIRFAX NZ Police staff in hooded white protective suits and breathing masks entered the flat on Wednesday afternoon.
About 1pm on Wednesday, police staff in hooded white protective suits and breathing masks ducked behind police tape at the nine-flat property to photograph the woman's flat.
Inside, the curtains were tightly drawn.
Police have so far described the death as "unexplained".
MICHAEL FORBES/ FAIRFAX NZ The scene in Constable St on Tuesday night after the body was found.
They were still talking with neighbours and friends to try and establish where they were last seen.
"Police will be in the neighbourhood speaking to the community and residents to determine their recent movements in and around the address," McKee said.
Arrangements were being to contact them next of kin.
A next-door neighbour said the woman had not lived in the flat long.
They said they hadn't heard anything from the flat, just a wall away from their own, since they moved in.
"The police came around about 5.30pm looking for a girl missing. Suddenly there were lots of police cars."
Another neighbour, Isaako Schuster, said they saw the woman last week.
"She opened the window and called out to me about some work I was doing, then went inside their room. That was the only time I ever saw her."
Next door, Chuni Dahya said it was strange to know a dead body was lying in the flat.
"It's a weird feeling. Nothing happens in this neighbourhood, and we've lived here 60 years."
Neighbour Laura Gardner said they saw three police cars and a fire engine arrive outside the house about 9pm Tuesday.
One person inspecting the scene appeared to be wearing a hazardous materials suit, they said.
"I was getting a bit edgy so I went over and asked a police officer what was going on, and they said there was nothing for me to worry about."
Constable St resident David MacKenzie said they were home at 6pm when the body was found, but did not notice any commotion until about 9pm when multiple police cars and a fire engine arrived.
"None of them had their sirens on. It was all very quiet," they said.
Some critics dismiss the Book of Mormon because, they say, no archaeological evidence directly supports it. Archaeological evidence, though, is spotty, and it seldom shows up on cue.
Until Conrad Schick found the pool of Bethesda in Jerusalem's Muslim quarter in the 19th century, for example, only the Gospel of John suggested the pool ever even existed. Some scholars used that fact to argue that John was late and at least partially fictional, written by an author unacquainted with the city.
Yet Palestine is far more intensively studied and easier to work in than Mesoamerica, with much better textual resources and a continuous tradition of geographical names.
Moreover, that word “directly” is problematic. Archaeology seldom “directly” settles controversial issues. Rocks don't speak for themselves; decisive, unambiguous inscriptions are rare.
The first nonbiblical allusion to Pontius Pilate was found by Italian archaeologists at Caesarea Maritima, on the Mediterranean coast, in 1981.
The first nonbiblical reference to David and the House of David — and just the fourth ancient inscription mentioning “Israel” at all — was found only during the 1993-1994 archaeological season at northern Israel's Tel Dan. In some circles, it remains controversial.
A bulla or clay seal, the first tangible ancient artifact demonstrating the existence of biblical Bethlehem, was discovered just three years ago.
As William Hamblin explained in their still-important 1993 article on “Basic Methodological Problems with the Anti-Mormon Approach to the Geography and Archaeology of the Book of Mormon,” the location of Jerusalem would have been difficult, if not impossible, to find were it not for a continuous geographical tradition that doesn't exist in the Americas:
Canaanites knew the city as “u-ru-sa-lim,” which gave us Hebrew “Yerushalem” or “Yerushalayim.” But the settlement was also often called “the City of David” and “Zion,” which thus yields four distinct names for it in the Old Testament alone. The Greeks called it both “Ierousalem” and “Hierosolyma,” and later Latin speakers preserved that second name. However, following the Second Jewish Revolt in the early second century, the Emperor Hadrian renamed the city “Aelia Capitolina.” It regained its identity as “Jerusalem” only because when "Christians eventually came to dominate the Roman Empire, (they) changed the name back."
But then, following the Muslim conquests, the city was called “Aliya” (from the Roman “Aelia”), “Bayt al-Maqdis” and “al-Quds,” as it continues to be by Palestinians and other Arabic-speakers today. Had Christianity been exterminated, as the Nephites were, "rather than becoming the dominant religion of the Roman empire, what linguistic evidence would we have that al-Quds of today was ancient Jerusalem?"
Real archaeology bears little resemblance to an Indiana Jones movie; overwhelmingly, it's a matter of painstakingly drawing inferences from such things as pottery fragments and partial building foundations. And authors who are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, such as John Clark, Brant Gardner, John Sorenson and Mark Wright, who very much believe the Book of Mormon to have solid footing within Mesoamerican archaeology, have long been engaged in such efforts. I commend their work to anybody who's interested.
In order to make meaningful statements about the relationship between archaeology and the Book of Mormon, authors need to know both subjects well. It's plainly insufficient to know just one of them. And among the very first questions that need to be answered are where the events of the Book of Mormon occurred, if they occurred at all, and what the overall dimensions of Book of Mormon territory might be.
Some critics declare that limited geographical models of the Book of Mormon — which include both the Mesoamerican geographies that I favor and the “Heartland” model that others advocate — have arisen in response to mounting threats from archaeological and genetic data and represent a retreat from a “shrinking” Book of Mormon with fictional peoples who will soon “vanish” altogether.
But limited geographical models were created because the Book of Mormon demands them. As Sorenson demonstrated in their seminal 1985 “Ancient American Setting for the Book of Mormon,” when all the travel distances and travel times given in the book are analyzed, it's obvious beyond reasonable dispute that the Nephite/Lamanite/Jaredite lands were relatively small; they plainly didn't extend from Patagonia on the southern end of South America to the Aleutian Islands between Alaska and Russia. And such models were on demonstrably public offer long before James Watson and Francis Crick discovered DNA's double-helix structure in 1953, and decades before anybody was researching Amerindian DNA.
Many interesting questions remain; archaeology and the Book of Mormon still have much to say to each other.
Huddle up pilots, let us tell you a story…
…well, give you a chance to live a story. EVE: Valkyrie is still, at its heart, a multiplayer game and that vision remains at the core of the development team's focus. But we are also committed to building a narrative for the characters and environments that make up the game, delivering a creative backbone that drives the world and gives it depth.
Through the Valkyrie project one of our design pillars has been that immersion in virtual reality is about more than just the technology: It's about crafting a believable world for you, the pilot, to live and fight inside. Creating a bubble where the visuals, audio and lore blend together into a tactile cockpit that feels like you can reach out and touch it, putting you squarely in the centre of this epic conflict.
The concept behind the new recall missions is to do exactly this. They shine a light on some key characters in our universe, giving you a flavour of their perspective. Both Fatal and the Quartermaster haven't had a lot to say up to this point, despite being important characters, so with the Joint Strike update we are beginning to tell their side of the story.
Let's be careful here. We wouldn't want to give the story away before you get a chance to try it. But Joint Strike includes not one but two (yes two!!) new recall missions. Set some time before the Shipyard you may be familiar with from the multiplayer experience, we look at how the Caldari fleet came to lose the pivotal station.
Fatal is beginning to assert their dominance with the Schism project and is looking for a hub to expand their technological and war-faring aspirations. The Shipyard is the perfect location but is extremely well protected by the traders and smugglers that frequent its docking bays. A heist of this size is going to take some meticulous planning.
The Shipyard episodes are a narrative that take place over a few weeks as Fatal tightens their grip on the station in a series of calculated strikes. As the player you represent one of many interests infiltrating the base, executing phases and dismantling its defences piece by piece before the final assault on the command ship - the last remaining guardian of the Lonetrek system.
Fatal & Quartermaster
We're keen to play with the idea of sides and alliances in the new Joint Strike Recall missions. Every great protagonist needs an antagonist and Fatal is Rán's sworn enemy... the man that plucked them from New Eden and change their live(s) forever.
We know Rán and Fatal are at war. But we don't know a whole lot about the Schism faction and their charismatic leader. Just what drives them to do what they do? The new recall missions released in Joint Strike begin to dive into Fatal's personality, giving you a greater insight into their twisted and calculating nature.
Likewise, the Quartermaster is a character we've wanted to explore in much greater detail for a while. This began to build up in the Carrier Assault update with a few audio diaries left behind in Crossroads map.
He's started to take their rightful mantle as the master ship builder and forged a more advanced role in Valkyrie - one that puts them beyond the friendly shopkeeper and toward their true place as the technological mastermind that underpins our clone war. He's a mysterious character with no set alliance. Rán and Fatal get the same deal. It's not about making money. Rather, they have their own agenda.
*And if you're interested in the man behind the voice, read on… *
Behind the Scenes
This is a great opportunity to have a look behind the curtain at the development process of EVE: Valkyrie. The man in the picture is below Joe Shire, also known as our Quartermaster. An incredible voice actor, they breathe life into their scripts before the talented audio team cut it up and blast it into your cockpit.
All characters are written with their voice in your head. The better you know the actors the more you can take on their mannerisms and expressions in the performance. This gives every individual a voice - an identity that determines the tone and reaction to each situation that arises within the game world. Every monologue or one liner is a take from their perspective, infused with their personality.
In the studio, a combination of the scriptwriter's direction and the actors' added magic delivery adds a new dimension to the words on the page. It's an incredibly fulfilling part of building a game: meeting the actors in the studio and watching as a script comes to life right before your eyes (and ears)!
Check out Joe here relishing the destruction being dished out by the Schism in this preview of what's to come in Joint Strike, shipping the week of 10 October on Oculus and PSVR.

Rare Air: A Look at the Cold Air Outbreak on January 7
We recently saw -- and felt -- some of the coldest temperatures in more than a decade all across the state. On Tuesday morning, much of the coast dropped into the teens, including 17°F in Wilmington and 13° in Elizabeth City. Temperatures reached digit-numbing single digits in the Piedmont, as Raleigh hit 9°, Charlotte hit 6°, and Greensboro had a low of just 5°. And in the mountains, temperatures bottomed out in the negatives, including a -1° low in Asheville, -8° in Boone, and a bone-chilling -18.8° at Mount Mitchell, where wind speeds greater than 45 mph meant wind chills of up to -55°F.
Preliminary map of low temperatures from the morning of January 7, 2014.
This intense cold air outbreak has been largely blamed on the indomitable-sounding "polar vortex", but that's just one of the factors that made Tuesday, January 7 such a rare, chilly day. Here's a look at three of the main causes that worked together to bring us such cold temperatures.
The Polar Vortex
Rarely does the polar vortex get the media attention it's received this week, and it's easy to imagine it as something out of a sci-fi movie. But as this infographic from the New York City National Weather Service office nicely explains, the polar vortex is a feature that's always present in the upper atmosphere. As the name implies, it's usually centered around the North Pole. However, in this week's cold event, the polar vortex dipped farther south -- centered over northern Michigan -- than we've seen in many years, bringing a frigid polar airmass along with it.
One of the last times we saw the polar vortex reach that far south was on January 20, 1985. North Carolina weather buffs will remember that the next day -- January 21 -- is often called "The Coldest Day" because of the record low temperatures that were set all across the state that morning, including the statewide record of -34°F at Mount Mitchell. As this side-by-side comparison of the upper-level pattern for the 1985 and 2014 cold events shows, there are notable similarities in the polar vortex strength and position in these events. If the polar vortex had been slightly stronger and slightly farther south in this week's event, we could have conceivably challenged some of those long-standing records.
Airmass Moderation (or Lack Thereof)
Every winter, a handful of Arctic airmasses drop into the U.S., and as they move south, the air generally warms up as it moves over warmer land. However, preceding this week's event, much of southern Canada and the U.S. Midwest were covered in a blanket of snow. That meant those locations were colder, which did not let the Arctic airmass warm up (or moderate) much as it moved south. Essentially, we got air-mailed a late Christmas present straight from the North Pole in the form of cold air that changed very little on its journey to our doorstep.

Clear Skies Overnight
Infrared satellite imagery from 6:45 am EST on January 7, 2014. (Image courtesy of the NCAR Real Time Weather Data site.)
When the sun set on Monday night, skies were clearing across North Carolina, which gave ideal conditions for cold minimum temperatures. At night, some of the previous day's stored heat energy is radiated away by the earth. When clouds are present, they can trap some of that heat near the surface. But when skies are clear, that heat is free to escape into space. This process, called "radiative cooling", allows temperatures to drop until sunrise, when the earth again begins to receive solar radiation and store heat energy.
As the infrared satellite image (right) from Tuesday morning shows, skies were clear all across the Carolinas, with the closest cloud cover just off the coast and over southern Georgia. The dark spots you see across North and South Carolina are lakes, which appear darker than the surrounding land on this image, indicating a warmer temperature. That's another good indication of the radiative cooling and associated heat loss from the land overnight.
Quick Assessment
Those three factors combined to make this one of the coldest days of the 21st century. To make this cold air outbreak even more impressive, it was achieved with no snow on the ground in North Carolina. Cold temperatures are fairly common after snow events because snow keeps heat from escaping from the surface, and most of the daytime solar radiation goes toward melting the snow instead of warming the earth. However, to achieve the cold temperatures we saw this week with no snow present was an impressive and rare feat. The last time Raleigh saw single-digit temperatures with no snow on the ground was nearly 20 years ago, on January 20, 1994.
Also, afternoon highs on Tuesday struggled to reach the 20s statewide and barely made it to 30 in Wilmington. Even on the Coldest Day in 1985, daytime temperatures warmed up to 33 in Charlotte, 38 in Raleigh and 59 in Wilmington. On Tuesday, though, a steady strong wind out of the west meant a continuous feed of cold air, which kept temperatures chilly even on an otherwise sunny day. Although it may not have matched the extreme lows from January 21, 1985, it's likely that January 7, 2014, will become one of the benchmarks to compare our cold winter days against.

Simona Halep Sets Date To Have Breast Reduction
Video Playback Not Supported
Updates
June 3/09 – *Alena Schurkova: “Simona Halep You Can Be A Champion With Big Boobs”
Total Pro Sports – Many of us may have thought their previous threat to undergo breast reduction surgery would not fall through. Maybe they would realize how much those breasts meant to their fans. Perhaps they would understand that this can be the move that makes or breaks their promising career.Well the surgery has been booked, and let me be the first to shed a tear during this sad moment in the world of sports.
Reports indicate that the 34DD-sized Romanian tennis star, Simona Halep, has booked themselves into a private hospital for surgery in the fall. When asked about the decision, Simona stated the following: “This fall I'll have a breast reduction operation. The breasts make me uncomfortable when I play. It's the weight that troubles me – my ability to react quickly.” [TheSun]
While Simona believes that the reduction will give them less weight to carry around, making it easier for them to win some points, what they may also need to realize is that the loss of their large boob size will likely result in the loss of many fans. Anna Kournikova didn't need to be the best tennis player to make millions of dollars from it.
Looks seem to go a lot further in woman's tennis these days, but that road may soon close itself for simona halep. The exact date of the surgery is still unknown, but we here at TPS will continue to keep you posted on that as well as the chosen size and any other information we receive regarding our favorite tennis player, Simona Halep.

Media playback is not supported on this device Gianfranco Zola explains Birmingham resignation
Gianfranco Zola has resigned as Birmingham City manager following Monday's home defeat by fellow Championship strugglers Burton Albion.
The 50-year-old Italian was in charge for just four months, during which time the team won only twice in 24 games.
Their 2-0 loss to Burton left them 20th in the Championship table, just three points above the relegation places with three games remaining.
"I sacked myself. I decided to give in my resignation," said Zola.
"I am sorry because I came to Birmingham with huge expectations. Unfortunately, the results have not been good and I take full responsibility.
"It is not that I like quitting, but Birmingham deserves better. If I feel I cannot help the players, why stay? If I cannot help the team, it is better I leave and let someone else do that.
"I feel very bad and very sorry. We worked with a lot of meaning, but unfortunately it didn't produce the results. It is all very disappointing."
The swapping of Rowett for Zola
Gianfranco Zola's Birmingham City lost five of their final six home games in charge, including the 2-1 defeat by their Blues predecessor Gary Rowett's Derby County
When predecessor Gary Rowett was sacked in December, Blues were seventh and only out of the play-off places only on goal difference.
Club director Panos Pavlakis explained their decision to dispense with Rowett, now in charge at Derby County, by saying that Zola's "pedigree" matched their ambition to "move in a new direction".
But the change of manager baffled many supporters - and results on the pitch have done nothing to win them over.
Chinese-owned Birmingham issued a statement on 10 April giving Zola their full backing following a 2-1 defeat by Rowett's Rams.
But the loss to Burton, another of Rowett's old clubs, leaves Blues without a win in nine games since beating local rivals Wolves at Molineux in February - and Blues have picked up just 16 points out of a possible 66 in Zola's time in charge.
Blues' next game is at local rivals Aston Villa on Sunday (12:00 BST).
If 22nd-placed Blackburn, who are at Wolves, and 21st-placed Nottingham Forest, who are at home to Reading, were both to win their respective games on Saturday, Blues would start the game at Villa Park in the bottom three.
It is the second time former Chelsea and Italy striker Zola has resigned as manager of an English club, having quit Watford in 2013 after five successive home defeats. They also spent two years in charge of West Ham United.
Gianfranco Zola was previously manager of West Ham, Watford and Cagliari
Analysis
BBC WM's Richard Wilford
"Gianfranco Zola's ill-fated tenure at St Andrew's arguably could have been cut short sooner than it was. By their own admission, they felt they could not help the players any more.
"In a dignified media conference after their resignation had been announced, Zola noted that they had felt pressure from the very outset, given the success the club had under their predecessor Gary Rowett.
"Results are king in football, and two wins in 22 league games was unacceptable. Zola may have lacked fortune while they were in charge at Blues, but not so much as to justify such a paltry return.
"The Easter performances against Rotherham and Burton were limp, listless and damning. Birmingham's flirtation with relegation is very real indeed."
Did *The New York Times *run a hit piece on a group of former generals working as television analysts? Or have the networks purposely ignored a major story that implicates them in Pentagon propaganda-pushing? Here's your chance to fact-check the media majordomos yourself.
A few weeks back, the* Times *ran a long, long expose on the Pentagon's relationship with ex-officers-turned-TV-commentators. The crux of the paper's story:
Analysts have been wooed in hundreds of private briefings with senior military leaders, including officials with significant influence over contracting and budget matters, records show. They have been taken on tours of Iraq and given access to classified intelligence ...* *In turn, members of this group have echoed administration talking points, sometimes even when they suspected the information was false or inflated. Some analysts acknowledge they suppressed doubts because they feared jeopardizing their access. *
Many in the military community were thoroughly unimpressed with the piece – especially since several of the officers featured in the expose were vocal critics of the conduct of the Iraq war. Liberal bloggers and media-watchers, on the other hand, were disgusted by what they saw as the latest disclosure of "the incestuous, extensive overlap between our media institutions and government officials." The outrage only grew, as the television networks decided not to cover the Times' scoop. Just today, Sen. John Kerry called for a "full investigation of this program," which the Pentagon claims is now suspended.
But there's no need to wait for Congress. You can launch your own investigation, right now. The Defense Department has released thousands of pages of documents related to this outreach effort. Years' worth of internal Pentagon memos, military talking points and interview tapes and transcripts with former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld are all now posted to the Pentagon's website. Take a look, and let us know what you find. Drop us a line, or leave a comment, below.
UPDATE: These retired officers may have received special access in Rumsfeld's Pentagon. But they were fed the same happy talk and BS as the rest of us, a quick scan of the documents shows.
Inflated estimates of Iraqi troop strength weren't just for the general public, for example. They were for the generals, too. Check out these talking points from November 29, 2005 and this April 22, 2005 conference call transcript:
Similarly, the Defense Department was making blissful predictions about the insurgency melting away to anyone who would listen. Here are some talking points from January 4th, 2006:
Not long after, the Sunni insurgency entered its bloodiest phase of the war.
They created tearful melodramas, mystical ghost stories and musicals. Jewish film-makers from the inter-war period invited the biggest film stars to Poland, created world-class productions and propelled Polish cinema onto the global stage. Few reminders are left of the vibrant Yiddish cinematic world that flourished in Warsaw, Poland, in the 1920s.
70 of the 170 Jewish films brought out between 1910 and 1950 were made in Poland. Poland was one of the three main centres of Yiddish culture in the world, along with the United States and the Soviet Union. Despite the increasing economic problems and strenuous political situation (including growing anti-Semitism), there were three million Polish Jews in Poland and the country became a hub for inter-war Jewish cinema.
In the first decades of the 20th century, the Polish film industry was almost entirely in Jewish hands. Thus, as Natan Gross, author of "Film żydowski w Polsce" (Jewish film in Poland) writes, there were no "anti-Semitic films produced in Poland during the twenty years of the inter-war period".
Jakub Gordin – the man who turned things into gold
The burgeoning cinema industry was just beginning to set up institutions for training directors, cinematographers, and scriptwriters. Thus, accomplished theatrical playwrights were highly sought after, and this made Jacob Gordin the most popular of them all. One of their works inspired the first Jewish film produced in Poland - the two-act Okrutny ojciec (The Harsh Father) filmed in 1911 by Marek Arnsztejn.
Gordin's dramas, set in small Jewish towns, told stories of impossible relationships between men and women. Their cinematic fables were well-liked by the public. Eight films were adapted from their plays between 1911 and 1914 (the last adaptation, based on the drama Bezdomni (Without a Home) came out in 1939). Their best remembered films are Macocha (Di shtifmuter), Bóg, człowiek, szatan (God, the Human, the Devil), and above all, Mirele Efros.
Mirele Efros – a working woman
Mirele Efros was a success before World War I. In "Bridge of Light: Yiddish Film Between Two Worlds", J. Hoberman writes. "Mirele Efros is likely the single most widely played piece in the Yiddish theatrical canon." The film and the play tell the story of a woman who, following the death of their husband, finds out that they had squandered their entire fortune and left nothing behind. Through hard work, Mirele supports their family who still believes that they inherited great wealth from their father. When the truth sees the light of day, their familial bonds are questioned.
Gordin's story of a brave Jewish woman had two endings - one optimistic, the other tragic. But because the 40-minute film from 1912 didn't make it through the war, which ending concluded the story remains unknown.
Meir Ezofowicz - an anti-Semitic Jew?
The second most popular Jewish film before World War I was Józef Ostoja-Sulnicki's Meir Ezofowicz. A highly controversial portrayal of the era, the film told the story of a young man who created a conflict between themselves and the elders of the Jewish shtetl. They wanted to stand up against injustice and ignorance and find an understanding between different social groups. When they fell in love with a girl from a traditionalist sect, the village inhabitants killed the girl.
For their portrayal of Jewish society, Józef Ostoja-Sulnicki was accused of anti-Semitism. The accusations were powered by their previous publication in which they juxtaposed the so-called "Polish" Jewish with those who came to Poland from the depths of the tsarist Empire and who they thought were radical nationalists.
The classics of silent Yiddish
The Rabbi's Power - a Polish film in America
Following World War I, Jewish cinematography struggled to regain its former glory for many years. The first Yiddish film of the inter-war period came out as late as 1924. Ślubowanie (The Rabbi's Power / Tkijes kaf in Yiddish) is a film directed by Zygmunt Turkow. The film was also fraught with controversy.
"Dybuk" Szymona An-skiego
The tale of great love, a broken promise and the Prophet Elijah evoked the story described by Szymon An-ski in the classical and at the time highly popular Dybuk (The Dybbuk). Although Henryk Bojm, the screenwriter of The Rabbi's Power was accused of plagiarism, the film turned out to be a success. That was mainly thanks to Ester Rachel Kamińska, known as the mother of Yiddish theatre, who played the role of a widowed peddler.
In 1937, a new version of The Rabbi's Power was brought out - Henryk Szaro created a film with sound based on the same script. But this time, the film was a flop. All the while, the silent version continued to gain wider audiences. It was showed in the United States in 1932, where it was completely re-edited by George Roland, a specialist in adapting European films for American Jews. Following the Second World War, in 1948, Turkow's film was screened in the U.S., this time under the title A Vilna Legend.
Lamedvovnik – Jewish mysticism
The box-office success of The Rabbi's Power spurred the further production of films in Yiddish. In 1925 Henryk Szaro shot Jednego z 36 (Lamedvovnik), a historical film borderin on Jewish mysticism. Set during the January Uprising, an evil Russian solider terrorised the inhabitants of a small city before one of the legendary 36 righteous came to the rescue. According to a Jewish legend the world is inhabited by 36 nameless people who carry the sins of the world on their shoulders and rescue others by sacrificing their lives when it is needed.
In Polish Forests – against religious radicalism
Four years later, in 1929, W lasach polskich (In Polish Forests/ In die poylishe velder) directed by Jonas Turkow turned into another triumph for the industry. One of the reasons it is remembered was the problems it encountered with Jewish censorship. In their film Turkow showed Jews who assimilated into Polish culture and Polish society, a viewpoint which angered religious radicals. A representative of the Agudas Isroel party accused the film of deviating from religious laws and demanded the removal of "erotic scenes" which didn't meet the standards of traditional morality. Once the producers altered the film according to the censor's requests, it resulted in a film that had nothing to do with the original project.
Introducing sound
Cinema underwent a sound revolution at the beginning of the 1930s. Polish cinema in Yiddish didn't transition into sound straight away. With the appearance of Aleksander Ford, a young director, it finally found the guide it needed to keep it relevant. Ford later became one of the most important figures of Polish cinema (author of among other Piątka z ulicy Barskiej / Five from Barska Street and Krzyżacy / Knights of the Teutonic Order). In 1933, in Palestine, they made "Sabra" - a feature reportage telling the story of the love between a Jewish boy and an Arab girl (years later it was associated with Italian neorealism). The film turned out to be a failure and its lack of financial success spread rumours to Jewish investors about the unprofitability of producing films in Yiddish.
The Golden era of Yiddish
In the mid-1930s Jewish creators were in the spotlight. In the face of rising antisemitism, Jewish milieus consolidated. While Hitler was strengthening their position in Germany, more and more Jewish artists were coming to Poland. Collaborations with Polish producers emerged.
I Have Sinned – fleeing from Hitler
Saul Goskind produced Aleksander Marten's Za grzechy (I Have Sinned, Al chet in Yiddish) in 1936. The film (with sound) portrays the story of an ill-fated love between a Jewish officer and the daughter of a rabbi. The film received criticism from the Jewish milieu which charged it with recourse to escapism and fleeing real political problems by resorting to trivial subjects.
Yiddle with Their Fiddle – a musical befitting an era
Nevertheless, Jewish film-makers avoided political topics, instead going for safer topics and proven conventions: melodramas, comedies and features dealing with everyday experiences. Yiddish cinema was an escape to lands of happiness. Films like Judeł gra na skrzypcach ( Yiddle with Their Fiddle) , I Have Sinned and Bezdomni (Without a Home) are set in small cities which in an instance irretrievably disappeared from the Polish landscape.
One of the most popular motion pictures of the era was the asupervisorstioned Yiddle with Their Fiddle (Jidl mitn fidl in Yiddish) with the legendary Molly Picon. A musical which captures the fate of a group of itinerant musicians and was shot in the breathtaking scenery of Kazimierz Dolny (a small town in Central Poland), it overwhelmed both the public and the critics.
Molly Picon – singing star
Also inscribed in methodology of the features dealing with everyday experiences was the film Mateczka (Mamele or Little Mother). Directed by Joseph Green and Konrad Tom, it tells the story of a widower with seven children who are being taken care of by one of the daughters - the Mamele, little mother. The character played by Molly Picon was the driving force behind the whole story. The film is one of the gems of pre-war Jewish cinema.
The Dybbuk – among the ghosts
The title of the masterpiece of Jewish cinema must, however, go to Michał Waszyński's The Dybbuk. Based on a play by Szymin An-Sky, the film became a leading work of the mystical current in Jewish cinema, to which the asupervisorstioned The Rabbi's Power also belonged. Waszyński mixed symbolism with folklore, mysticism with ceremony, and The Dybbuk was an exotic journey to the world of Hasidic Judaism. The film found fans not only with Jewish audiences but also the Polish critics who touted it as the best European film in Yiddish, a motion picture in which the Jewish tradition encounters the literary influences of Adam Mickiewicz (Forefather's Eve) and the paintings of Artur Grottger and Władysław Podkowiński.
The end of Yiddish cinema – or Ford's Children Must Laugh
The Second World War put an end to the golden era of Yiddish cinema. Faced with the trauma of the war, Jewish cinema was irreversibly changed. The melodramatic storylines were replaced by documentaries. A leading example is Aleksander Ford's Children Must Laugh from 1936 made in a sanatorium for Jewish children in Miedzeszyn. Conceived as political propaganda, the film turned out to be a moving call for solidarity, which in the end the ruling class considered a dangerous precedent. Instead of showing the splendours of the new system, it pointed to the need for solidarity between different social classes. Children Must Laugh became the measure against which post-war documentaries were compared.
Very few pre-war films made by Jewish film-makers for Jewish audiences survived to today. The majority of them disappeared during the war or were destroyed due to lack of preservation. Many Yiddish films are still waiting to be rediscovered and remastered. Some of them are kept in the archives of the British Film Institute, which has been struggling to find funding to catalogue the archives and restore the films for several years.

Getting prepared for a new form of democracy!
Less than three weeks left until the launch of the first real European Citizens' Initiatives (ECI) on April 1st all relevant stakeholders – citizens, institutions and media – are getting prepared for the start of the first transnational instrument of participatory democracy in world history. Please find an up-date on ECI related events, how to prepare an ECI Campaign and about some courageous citizens who are just about to run an ECI.
On 26 January 2012 the EU Commission has set up its new official website and register for the European Citizens' Initiative. There you will find the official ECI guide by the Commission which is available in all 23 official EU languages.
Soon you will find more useful information there such as your official national contacts and information on the online collection system. The whole warming up event from January 26 has been webstreamed and can also be viewed afterwards. We especially recommend watching the presentation by Mário Tenreiro from the Commission. They explain concretely how to register an ECI.
We also invite you to join the large ECI conference March 20. This ECI event is organized by ECAS and Democracy International. At this meeting The ECI Campaign and its partners plan to present its results on the screening project about the implementation of ECI at national level, which refers to the certification of online collection systems, signature verification procedures and other important practical questions.
Want to organize your own ECI?
If you are serious about organising an ECI, you should calculate sufficient time to prepare your campaign. We advise you to consider the ECI check-list before you really decide to start your ECI campaign. As several ECI campaigns are already in preparation, some of them are looking for exchange with other ECI organizers in order to share infrastructure and costs for online collection system. For more information check the The ECI Campaigns Facebook-site.
Many potential ECI organizers are still exploring their resources and the practical feasibility. Other ECI organizers have already decided to go public. Potential ECIs include environmental issues such as: renewable energy and against atomic energy – the protection of water rights and against the privatisation of public water systems – actions for the landscape convention. Social issues include ECIs for an unconditional basic income as well as an ECI for eliminating homelessness in the EU. Moreover the request to legalise gay marriage throughout the European Union . Educational issues include ECIs for a European education trust, and to make the EU exchange programs more attractive. Electoral issues: granting EU citizens residing in another Member States the right to vote. Consumer protection issues include ECIs for fair roaming, for a European transaction tax and for a free and open internet.
So far there have been five informal successful 1 million signature campaigns before the ECI regulation had officially entered into force. Check our ECI Handbook for more information on earlier campaigns. This refers to Stop Long Animal Transports, the ELIANT action, the Avaaz-Greenpeace GMO campaign, the One-Seat-Campaign and the 1million4disability campaign. Some are expected to re-launch their campaigns. However no informal ECI, not the One Seat, not the ELIANT action, not the GMOs has ever followed such STRICT signature collection and verification rules as are foreseen now. Even huge NGOs such as Greenpeace and Avaaz needed 9 months to collect 1 million signatures — under ideal conditions. They did not collect sensitive data such as ID card numbers and their signatures were not verified by national ministries.
Blake refused to open their eyes. They refused to move, or speak, or do anything that would spoil this perfect moment. They were wrapped in the arms of a goddess. Them face was being brushed by that golden hair that seemed to radiate the warmth of the sun. Giant breasts pressed up against their own; soft and warm. There was no world around the two of them. No people, no White Fang, no Roman Torchwick or Grimm, no Remnant. There was only the two of them, wrapped in this embrace forever. They nuzzled their face into Yang's neck and kissed them Yang rubbed the back of their head, played with their long, black ears affectionately. They whispered wonderful things into Blake's ear. It didn't matter how long they stayed like this. There was no passage of time, either. Just them The goddess. They were the entirety of their own, perfect world, and they allowed Blake to share it.
The pain started in Blake's lower back, where she'd been stabbed. They whimpered, but Yang held them tighter. A burning pain shot through Blake's body. A carefully-crafted Dust weapon that prevented one from raising their Aura, provided the Aura wasn't raised when it struck. Blake winced, and pulled Yang in ever closer.
"Its okay, Blake," Yang whispered, pain in their own voice," Its okay."
"Yang, don't." Blake begged, suddenly feeling excruciating pain in their ears, "Don't leave me."
"Its okay... I love you, Blake."
"Don't say it, Yang!" Blake cried, "He kills you when you say it!"
Yang kissed Blake's forehead and ran their fingers through their hair.
"Tell Ruby that-"
There was a sickening sound of metal cutting flesh and striking bone. Yang gasped. Blake opened their eyes and looked down. Them stomach turned. The tip of Gambol Shroud, their own sword, had burst from Yang's chest, extending out from the space between their breasts. Blake screamed. Yang seemed to be trying to speak, but they were silent, and blood poured from their mouth. Blake reached out to take hold of Yang again, to help her, but they couldn't move. They were tied to a chair.
The sword was pulled back through Yang's body, and they collapsed at Blake's feet unceremoniously. Blake screamed and cried and called out Yang's name. A monster stood over Yang's body. A shapeless void with an ever-changing face. It took the face of a tattooed, scarred man with a goatee. Then it took the face of Roman Torchwick. Then a Grimm. Then Adam Taurus. Then Blake's own face. Then it became a sickening mix of them all. And then the monster put it's foot down on Yang's shoulder, levelled Gambol Shroud at their head, and fired. Chunks of skull were blown off. Blood matted and stained that beautiful hair. Flecks of brain matter splattered Blake's boots. A final spasm went through Yang's body, and then they were still.
The world fell apart. The goddess had died. There was no reason, no logic, no meaning in this world any longer. Blake screamed and the world around them became chaos and pain. A vortex of blood.
Blake's eyes snapped open. They aren't in that horrid place anymore. They were laying on their back, on soft linen. Fluorescent light filled their eyes. Steady beeping came from the machines around their bed. They had bandages wrapped all over their body. Wires were attached to little sensors on their chest, an IV ran into their hand, and an oxygen tube ran to their nostrils. They sat up slowly, and their body was racked with pain. They fell back to the bed and looked down at herself. They were covered in bandages. Some parts of their body were swollen. There were dark red patches where the bandages needed changing. They could remember each place the knives had cut, or the knuckledusters had struck, cracking bone. But the worst pain was on their scalp. It felt like it was on fire, but there was something else. A bizarre feeling of wrongness. It almost felt like-
Blake sat up again, ignored the pain in their body. They ripped the wires from their chest, tore out the IV. They stood, placing their bare feet down on the cold linoleum floor. They looked around and saw the door to a tiny bathroom.
They stumbled through the door, flicked on the light switch. They looked in the mirror. They had a massive black eye on the left side. It looked like it had been healing for a couple of days. A bandage was covering the top half of their head. It was too tight over their ears. They couldn't possibly fit beneath it. They reached up, and slowly began unraveling the bandage. Tears formed in their eyes as layer after layer fell away until the whole thing fell in a bundle at their feet. Sections of their hair had been shaved to allow for stitching. Where their ears had been there were only two scars, freshly stitched shut. They touched one of them. There was a twinge of pain, but something else. They could still feel it. It felt like something was still there, but it just... wasn't. Blake threw the lid of the toilet up and vomited. Most went into the toilet bowl, some dripped down the side. More followed, worsening the mess, then more after that. Eventually they were just dry heaving, bent over the bowl of sick. Them mouth tasted foul and their lungs burned.
A nurse came in, drawn by the monitors going crazy from being disconnected. They found Blake sitting on the bathroom floor, slumped against the wall, weeping. They helped them up, and led them back into bed, Blake almost comatose as the nurse pulled the blanket back over them They stared at the ceiling, eyes blank but still leaking tears, as nurses reconnected the monitors, put in a fresh IV, and bandaged their head back up. When they were finished, one of the nurses called them name. They had to say it several times before Blake responded.
"Your team-members are outside. We can let them in if you want." They said.
Blake nodded.
The nurse left the room. A moment later, Ruby rushed through the door, followed by Weiss. Ruby had a look in their eyes like Blake had never seen. Weiss had a look of pained empathy. Ruby dashed over to Blake and leaped onto their bed, hugging Blake tightly. Weiss looked alarmed.
"Ruby, be gentle! She's still-"
"Oh, Blake!" Ruby wailed, "Oh Blake, we've been so worried! We've been here day in and day out, and we were just here half an hour ago, and they forced us to go down to the cafeteria to eat something, and then they called us right back and-"
Blake was hugging Ruby back, fighting back tears. They tried to speak a couple of times but nothing came out. Finally, they managed to make a sound.
"Ruby..."
Ruby rose up and looked Blake in the eyes.
"Yang... they told me... I don't..."
Tears quite suddenly came streaming from Ruby's eyes. Blake began crying with them Weiss sat down in one of the chairs and covered their eyes, whimpering. They stayed like this for some time. When Ruby finally spoke, all three were still crying.
"I don't know what I'll do without them My big sister. Somebody took them And they almost took you, Blake. I'm barely holding on without Yang. I'd have died if I lost you too, Blake."
Weiss stood and hugged the two of them. More time passed.
Eventually, they found themselves sitting in silence, having finally stopped crying for now. Weiss was once again in their chair and Ruby sat at the edge of Blake's bed.
"What are you going to do, Ruby?" Blake asked, breaking the silence, "Are you leaving Beacon?"
"I'm going to spend some time with my father," Ruby answered, "But I'm coming back. How could I lose all my new friends after this?"
"What about you?" Weiss asked, "What you've gone through..."
Blake looked at Weiss, "I don't know. I don't know what I'm supposed to do next."
"Whatever you do, we'll be there for you," Ruby said, "If you leave, if you stay, no matter what, we'll be by your side."
"Thank you, Ruby."
"Blake... you should hear it from a friend," Weiss said, "The police have been pushing to question you. They questioned Ruby and me, but we didn't know anything, of course. They want to know what happened."
Everything flashed before Blake's eyes at once. The ambush, their Auras being disabled, the torture, one of the thugs taking Blake's sword and-
Blake trembled.
"We were attacked. We were tortured. Yang was murdered. What else do they need to know?" Blake asked.
Ruby looked at them with helpless concern.
"They don't know how your attackers died. They don't know who killed them, or how they did it."
Blake thought for a moment, then rubbed their forehead. They felt another twinge of pain from their scalp and withdrew them hand.
"I don't remember. I remember them dying. I don't remember how."
"I understand them being curious," Ruby said, "How could three people just... explode for no reason?"
Blake was silent and stared at the floor for a moment. Suddenly, Ruby's words hit them They grabbed Ruby's shoulder and looked them in the eye.
"Three?"
"Yeah," Ruby said, "there were three bodies blown to pieces."
Blake burst up from the bed and, in a smooth motion, grabbed their IV stand and threw it across the room. The tube was ripped violently from their hand. The stand struck a window and shattered it. Blake swung and punched the wall beside her, putting a solid dent in the drywall. They turned to their friends, their eyes blazing with anger. Weiss stood with their hand over their mouth. Ruby looked terrified.
"There were four! There was a fourth guy there!" They screamed.
"Blake, Blake, please sit down." Weiss said, reaching a hand out.
Blake thrust their finger at Weiss forcefully, "Get your sword."
They moved their finger to Ruby, "Get your Scythe and all the ammo you have."
"Blake-" Ruby began.
"Blake, are you out of your mind? You're still recovering! You've been in a coma for three days! You can't fight now!"
"I didn't know what I was supposed to do. But that's because I thought those pieces of shit who murdered Yang were dead. If one of them is still out there, they have to pay. We're going to go find them right now. I'm going to find him, and I'm going to hurt him, and then I'm going to kill him."
As they finished this statement, they took a step forward, and their left leg abruptly gave out. They slumped to the floor. Ruby rushed to their side. Weiss sighed and hurried over to help. Blake was gritting their teeth, fresh tears appearing. They grabbed the edge of the bedside table to try and help lift themselves up. Them knuckles were white.
Weiss placed and hand on either side of Blake's face, tilted their head up to look Blake in the eye.
"You haven't eaten in days," Weiss said, "You're injured. You're in shock. You are in no condition to fight."
"I need to. We need to. They have to pay." Blake whispered, their voice cracking and almost silent.
Weiss kept staring into their eyes, only a twitch of one eyelid to show that they were holding back more tears herself. Blake breathed heavily, closed their eyes, and heard Yang's voice.
I'm not asking you to stop, I'm asking you to slow down. Yang's words echoed through Blake's mind as clearly as if Yang were right there. Blake opened their eyes, looked up at Weiss. They looked at Ruby, who was struggling with all their might to lift Blake back to their feet.
Blake slowly worked themselves to their feet. They climbed back into their bed. Weiss helped pull their blankets over them
"Once I'm out of here, we find this guy." Blake said.
Weiss nodded, "Like Ruby said, we're by your side."
Blake glanced at Ruby. Ruby looked determined.
"I'll go see dad when my sister is avenged."
"Then I better get my strength back quickly. Can you get a nurse to bring me some food?" Blake asked Weiss.
"You're not eating hospital food!" Ruby declared, "I know what you need!"
They ran from the room. Blake and Weiss stared after her, confused. They exchanged few words waiting for them to return, Blake closing their eyes and almost dozing off, Weiss laying back in their chair, and resting their eyes. In ten minutes, Ruby returned, panting heavily and holding a package wrapped in paper, with a familiar smell emanating from it. Ruby unwrapped the package, revealing freshly grilled tuna, fresh from the fish market.
They ate together, talked, cried a bit more. But at the back of Blake's mind, they kept picturing Yang.
I'm going to find him, Yang, They said to herself, I'm going to make them suffer for what they did. And then I'm going to kill him.
INTERNET service provider iiNet has won a major legal battle over whether it should be held responsible for its customers downloading content illegally.
An appeal by the world's largest film and television companies against iiNet was dismissed today by the High Court.
A group of 34 international and Australian companies, including Warner Bros, Disney and the Seven Network, had alleged that iiNet had authorised the infringement of their copyright when its customers downloaded movies and television programs.
The movie companies had argued that iiNet had the power to prevent its customers from infringing copyright by issuing warnings and suspending or terminating customer accounts.
The Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft (AFACT) appealed to the High Court after losing its first appeal to the federal court last year.
But today the High Court found that iiNet had no direct technical power to prevent its customers from using the BitTorrent file sharing system to infringe copyright.
"Rather, the extent of iiNet's power to prevent its customers from infringing ... copyright was limited to an indirect power to terminate its contractual relationship with its customers," the court said.
iiNet Chief Executive Officer, Michael Malone, said the judgment supported the company's position and proved the claims made against it were unfounded.
"iiNet has never supported or encouraged unauthorised sharing or file downloading,” Mr Malone said
"Today's High Court five-nil ruling confirms that iiNet is not liable for ‘authorising' the conduct of its customers who engaged in online copyright infringement.
"This marks the end of more than three years of legal argument and challenges."
Mr Malone said increasing the availability of lawful, online content in a more timely, affordable and reasonably priced manner, brought the focus back to customers and was the best method to protect content owners' copyright.
They said there was strong evidence that content partnerships and agreements between ISPs, legal websites and copyright holders had done more to reduce piracy and to showcase copyright holders' materials than this unproductive legal battle.
The High Court dismissed the appeal with costs. Legal costs of the case to date are approximately $9 million and have already been expensed.

Disasters usually occur with little or no warning. Though the focus of this site is on “bugging in,” it's still wise to have a vehicle survival kit or a bug out bag in case you're stranded on the way home or forced to evacuate the area.
Survival Kits Online makes a good Deluxe 2 Person Kit for $99 and a 4-Person Survival Kit for $199. However, they don't include everything you need to keep your car running.
I recommend purchasing a sturdy backpack , gathering these items and keeping them in your trunk. Make adjustments based on your personal needs. Much of the equipment will depend on what type of vehicle you own. You should also learn to change a tire, change the oil, jump-start a car, and replace fluids, belts and hoses.

WHEN WE TALK about fighting styles, distance and movement are often at the top of the list.
Are they a counter fighter by nature, or an out-fighter? Are they a pressure fighter, or just a brawler?
Aside from the complex and sometimes utterly unfathomable depths of the human personality, distance and movement are at the top of the list of defining characteristics.
In other words, if you want to understand a fighter, get to know them — I mean really get to know him. And if that's not possible, look at their fights and ask: how far do they like to stand from their opponent, and which way do they like to be moving? And why?
For Conor McGregor and Chad Mendes, these questions will likely be at the heart of their conflict. The UFC has attempted to drum up some interest in Mendes as a short-notice replacement by calling the bout an ‘interim title fight', but let's not disrespect the quality of the match-up by pretending that any kind of meaningful title is at stake; what matters here is that Mendes and McGregor make for a positively fascinating style clash, and one that seems almost guaranteed to produce fireworks.
So let's first look at our two combatants and ask: which way do they like to move, and how close do they like to be? Because their attempts to satisfy those questions will determine who wins the fight.
First, McGregor. Though their earlier bouts showed something of a patient counter puncher, McGregor's style has changed as their confidence and comfort in the cage have grown. ‘The Notorious' still likes to counter, but in all other aspects they have revealed themselves to be a quintessential pressure fighter, forcing the engagements rather than accepting them as a counter fighter might.
As their faith in their punching power grows stronger -- and how couldn't it, with a string of knockouts as impressive as his? -- McGregor has shown more and more willingness to wade into their opponent's range. They don't do this recklessly, per se, but they throw more volume than ever before, showing their opponent a multitude of attacks in an attempt to seize and hold onto the initiative from the outset. In their pursuit of pressure, the destroyer from Dublin moves forward almost constantly.
Mendes, on the other hand, is a little more flexible when it comes to movement. In fact, Mendes is about as close as MMA fighters get to a pure counter puncher. Mendes has pressured in the past, as in the first round against Jose Aldo.
In that fight, the stocky wrestler-boxer was determined to close the gap early, and forced Aldo to open themselves up. They even managed to knock Aldo down with a beautiful counter left hook, shot over a blocked uppercut before the champion could fully withdraw their hand to block.
After taking some heat from the champion, however, 'Money' Mendes reconsidered their approach and spent most of the remainder of the bout moving around, with Aldo at range rather than forcing them to back up. They still performed admirably in this new role, but the change revealed that pressure alone isn't really the crux of Mendes' style.
So how do these two men win the battle of movement and distance, and contend the fight on their own terms?
Conor's angles
For McGregor, their pressuring style is enhanced by the small angles with which they land their damaging shots. A hard punch affects the body more when there's nothing stable opposing it. That is to say, bad balance makes for a weak chin, and no matter how skilled the fighter, the human body can always be off balanced. It just comes down to the angles involved.
Attacked head-on, for example, a fighter has very little chance of being knocked down. As you can see, McGregor's rear foot is positioned firmly behind their body, opposing the force of any straight-on blows and keeping them balanced. An opponent throwing strikes at them like this would be attacking a "strong plane".
By moving to one side or the other, however, the stability of that stance is compromised.
Without a third foot, attacks from the sides (or the front, were the fighter to square their feet) end up hitting a "weak plane". The closer an opponent can come to “splitting the feet” of their target with their strike, the more susceptible their target becomes to being hurt and/or knocked down. To avoid being hit from these angles, fighters adjust to their opponents constantly.
If you've ever watched high-level boxing and wondered why the two fighters spend so long shuffling around one another, doing nothing but feinting and taking small steps, now you know the reason. This dance is a complex battle of angles, with each fighter trying not only to protect their own weak plane, but to expose their opponent's as well.
There's a beautiful simplicity to the way McGregor approaches this dilemma.
McGregor often fights counter to the bog-standard southpaw wisdom. Normally an orthodox fighter faced with a southpaw opponent (or vice versa, the mirror works both ways) is told to place their lead foot outside that of their opponent, ostensibly securing the superior angle from which to land their straight right. There are, of course, many ways to skin a cat, goofy-footed though it may be, but the majority of orthodox fighters don't face lefties very often, and so the rote lesson has been able to stick.
McGregor prefers the exact opposite approach. Rather than engaging in a potentially futile battle for outside position, they often let their opponent take the angle they want, and then strikes just as they think they've escaped.
In the clip above, you can see McGregor feinting a squared-up Dennis Siver in order to coax them back and to the left. With their back to the fence, Siver's options for movement are limited, and it's an easy thing for McGregor to take a small step forward -- a step which, by the way, having fallen inside Siver's own foot, the German kickboxer feels completely unthreatened by -- right up until McGregor introduces their shin to Siver's face.
Like many southpaw kickfighters, McGregor fancies the tricky combination of left kick and left straight, the similar movements behind both strikes allowing them to hide their intentions until the last possible instant.
In this, McGregor takes full advantage of their reach which, at a reported 74 inches, is among the longest in the UFC's featherweight division. Thanks to their long arms, McGregor can afford to take some shortcuts, throwing their left hand across their body just as their opponent thinks they've successfully side-stepped it, and then moving their feet into position to put weight in the follow-through.
The hand-first, body-second punching style makes McGregor's strikes very difficult to read. In fact, there is almost no telegraph. But it also leaves them open to being countered should an opponent correctly predict their attack, since they leaf themselves standing on one leg mid-strike, when every fighter is at their most vulnerable.
Chad's feints
For Mendes, the angles are less important than the distance. With a 66 inch wingspan and a natural desire to punch with their opponents, they are incapable of fighting at the long range to which McGregor is accustomed. When opponents come to him, as McGregor is liable to do, Mendes does an excellent job of using their own strikes to measure the distance for him.
Here, they catch the jab of Clay Guida in their right hand, which tells them that they are just one short step away from a counter hook, which they immediately throws. When opponents are more reluctant to throw, however, Mendes gets to show off their excellent feinting.
With small twitches, flicks, and steps, Mendes convinces their opponents that they are about to throw. Basic self-preservation tells the other man that they don't want to get hit by Mendes' sledgehammer fists, so one of two things happens: either the opponent backs up and traps themselves against the fence, where Mendes happily steps into the role of pressure fighter, or the opponent attempts to time what they think is a strike and catch Mendes with a counter. In the clip above, Ricardo Lamas does both.
By feinting and rapidly closing the distance, Mendes convinces Lamas that they need to throw if they want to escape. Lamas chooses to counter what they believe to be a Mendes jab with a short overhand right, and Mendes steps into and outside the path of this attempt with an even shorter and straighter right hand of their own. And because Lamas is in the midst of throwing themselves into a punch, they inadvertently add their own weight to Mendes' punch, turning a glancing strike to the forehead into a knockout blow.
Coming to scratch
So, we end up with a difficult battle on our hands -- for both men. If McGregor can stop Mendes' wrestling (and that is a definite “if”), they find themselves faced with an opponent ready and willing to catch them with thunderous counters the moment they leaf themselves open.
McGregor may attempt to manage the distance a little more carefully and exacerbate Mendes' reach disadvantage, but Mendes will almost certainly have a range of distance-closing tricks prepared, even on just three weeks' notice.
Of course, if Mendes gives up the fight for initiative they may very well give McGregor the momentum they need to run off with a win. They have proven willing in the past to adjust their tactics to the opponent in front of him.
This inherent flexibility can be a curse, but so can rigidity, and for all their talk of fighting with “no style,” and “no opponent,” McGregor has shown an increasingly strict adherence to the style that works for him: they come forward, walks through what you throw at him, and tries to knock you out.
There are, quite frankly, too many questions in the air for us to accurately predict the outcome of this fight. And that's what makes it so compelling. McGregor versus Mendes may not be quite as great as Aldo versus McGregor could've been, but it's undeniably the second most interesting match-up in the featherweight division, and a battle of punchers like we rarely see in any combat sport.
I won't belabour this write-up by predicting the winner, but I feel pretty safe saying this: whoever wins this fight will almost certainly do it by knockout, and every hard-fought second until then should be fireworks.
What's not to like about that?
Connor Ruebusch is a striking analyst for Bloody Elbow and Bad Left Hook.
Bolthouse Farms, the innovation arm of Campbell Soup, announced last week it will be making a line of egg-free mayo spreads called “MAIO”. The new formulation will be available in three flavors – Plain, Chipotle, and Garlic – at Northern California Safeway grocery stores, for $2.99 per bottle.
Though the product is egg-free, it's yogurt – and not plant – based.
(Baby steps).
MAIO, which has one-tenth of the fat of traditional mayonnaise, is designed to attract health-conscious consumers – illustrating a key motivation for producers to shift away from animal-based foods. Indeed, MAIO is entering a vibrant market: Hellmann's certified-plant-based mayo alternatives were introduced last year, and Hampton Creek's Just Mayo has been making headlines as a national success since it hit the market in 2013.
[Check out our behind-the-scenes look at Hampton Creek's new headquarters]
So why all the focus on mayonnaise these days? Contrary to popular belief, ketchup isn't the most popular condiment. Mayonnaise takes the prize by a long shot. According to Quartz , Americans consume $2 billion worth of mayo each year, with ketchup ringing in a mere $800 million. So it makes sense that both good food companies and food industry giants are zeroing in on mayonnaise as a massive market opportunity and a massive opportunity to do good.
The success of eggless, plant-based mayo signals better times ahead – for the environment, our health, animal welfare, and the overall economy.

The egg-free mayo market has a new entrant.
Andrew Anglin, founder of a neo-Nazi website notorious for its racist internet trolling campaigns, has dubiously claimed they live in Nigeria. A process server swears they recently spotted The Daily Stormer's publisher at a grocery store in their native Ohio.
Anglin's whereabouts — a key issue in a pair of lawsuits they face — may not remain a mystery much longer.
A federal judge in Montana has warned Anglin's attorneys that they won't tolerate any “game-playing” and expects them to disclose where they have been residing, according to a court transcript obtained by The Associated Press.
Marc Randazza, one of Anglin's lawyers, told U.S. Magistrate Jeremiah Lynch during a Dec. 14 pretrial conference that they didn't know where their client is.
Anglin's site takes its name from Der Stürmer, a newspaper that published Nazi propaganda. It has struggled to stay online since Anglin published a post mocking a woman killed in a deadly car attack at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August.
“I can represent that they are outside of the United States,” Randazza said, according to the transcript. “I had asked them where they are situated, and they change locations regularly, and I don't know their whereabouts.”
Montana real estate agent Tanya Gersh sued Anglin in April, accusing them of orchestrating an anti-Semitic internet trolling campaign that terrorized their family amid their dispute with the mother of a leading white nationalist. Months passed before Anglin's lawyers formally responded to the suit, arguing the First Amendment protects their posts calling for a “troll storm” against Gersh.
Anglin's attorneys have argued the court doesn't have jurisdiction over the case — and therefore must dismiss it — because Anglin is “not a citizen of any state.” In a Nov. 30 court filing, they cited a CNN report that included Anglin's oft-repeated claim that they are living in Lagos, Nigeria.
The judge told Randazza they should “emphasize to Mr. Anglin there's not going to be any game-playing here.”
“I don't want to be perceived as being an advocate, but he's going to have to detail what their travels have been, what their changes in location have been, because as you know, ultimately, again, I have an independent obligation to determine whether there's jurisdiction here. The ultimate question is their domicile,” the judge said.
Gersh's lawyers accuse Anglin of playing a “childish game of hide-and-seek” and cite evidence they are living in the Columbus, Ohio, area.
Jeffrey Cremeans, a process server hired by Tanya Gersh's attorneys from the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center, said in a sworn affidavit that they were shopping at a grocery store in a Columbus suburb on Dec. 10 when they saw a man who strongly resembles Anglin at a self-checkout register.
“He appeared very paranoid, looking over their shoulder,” Cremeans' affidavit says.
Cremeans said they asked the man if their name is Andrew.
“The man replied ‘Nope' and then quickly fled the store,” they said. Cremeans said they were “absolutely certain” it was Anglin, but couldn't serve them with the suit because they were on a personal errand and didn't have the paperwork.
Anglin later mocked the process server's claim in social media posts.
“There are 2 million people in Columbus metro area. A process server happens by coincidence to run into me in a checkout line,” they wrote on their Gab account. “No one (expletive) believes this. It is statistically impossible.”
Gersh says their family received a barrage of threatening and harassing emails, phone calls and other messages after Anglin published their personal information, including their 12-year-old son's Twitter handle and photo. In a string of posts that began last December, Anglin accused Gersh and other Jewish residents of Whitefish, Montana, of engaging in an “extortion racket” against the mother of white nationalist Richard Spencer.
Gersh's lawsuit said they agreed to help Spencer's mother sell commercial property they own in Whitefish amid talk of a protest outside the building. Sherry Spencer, however, later accused Gersh of threatening and harassing them into agreeing to sell the property.
During the Dec. 14 discussion, one of Gersh's lawyers said they will be exploring whether others — including Richard Spencer — “may have participated in the decision-making process to start the troll storm” and therefore “might bear liability for the actions at issue here.”
Anglin faces a separate federal lawsuit filed in Ohio by Muslim-American radio host Dean Obeidallah, who says Anglin falsely labeled them as the “mastermind” behind a deadly bombing at a concert in England. Anglin hasn't responded to that suit.
Luis Gonzalo Segura, a lieutenant in the Spanish Army with almost 12 years of service, was fed up with seeing all sorts of corruption within the higher command. The issue is one few Spaniards know about, so they wrote a novel titled “Un paso al frente” (A step forward), a work of fiction based on the alleged abuses that takes place in the armed forces.
In the media tour that followed the novel's publication, Segura was outspoken against the armed forces, leading to their arrest for publicly criticizing military authorities. They were sentenced to two months in a military prison and faces possible expulsion from the army.
Segura explained the military's culture of communication in an interview published on online magazine La Marea:
Desde que se suprime el servicio militar hay un corte de flujo de información desde el mundo militar al exterior. […] Al no tener libertad de expresión los militares, ese flujo todavía se corta de forma más radical, de tal forma que al final, a día de hoy, las fuerzas armadas son un estado paralelo y completamente estanco a resto de la sociedad.
As long as the military is suppressed, the lack of communication between the military and the outside world will exist. […] Without freedom of speech, the military's non-existent communication is even more drastic, leading to the army's present parallel status, one that is completely disconnected from the rest of society.
In 2010, Segura was assigned a task involving the inventory of information technology, during which they found, in their own words, “a discrepancy of about 25-35%,” that totaled “millions of euros.” The young serviceman attempted to report the situation to military authorities, but the judge and the attorney closed the case without reviewing the information on the hard disc that Segura had presented to the court.
According to news website vozpópuli, Segura “in their book alludes to alleged embezzlement, prevarication, negligence, false secondments, meal and petrol fraud, sale of data, summer homes, golf memberships, spas and VIP rooms.” So many indulgences have left the army in a serious economic crisis, Segura said during the launch of their book in the city of Huesca:
Los datos económicos de la institución militar que, según afirma, tiene una deuda de 29.000 millones de euros y destina el 77% de sus 6.000 millones de presupuesto anual a personal, evidencian, por otra parte, que el Ejército es “un modelo anticuado y obsoleto, e insostenible a nivel económico”.
The military's economic data that according to Segura is 29,000 million euros in debt and allocates 77 percent of its annual 6-billion-euro budget to personnel, is evidence furthermore that the army is “an antiquated and obsolete model, and not sustainable at an economic level.”
Segura explained the alleged misuse of funds and bloated hierarchy to Barrio Canino, an interview program on Ágora Sol Radio, a broadcast platform associated with the 15M protest movement in Spain:
Hay un excedente de mandos enorme. De hecho, ahora mismo uno de los problemas que tenemos es que hay 42 000 soldados, a los que se les trata como a perros, y con contratos basura […] y tenemos 52 000 mandos […] cualquiera que tenga dos dedos de frente se da cuenta de que esto es insostenible.
There is an enormous surplus of commanders. As a matter of fact, one of our current problems is that there are 42,000 soldiers, all who are treated like dirt, and have contracts that are rubbish […] and we have 52,000 commanders […] anyone in their right mind would know that this is not sustainable.
They elaborated for news website Periodista Digital:
Lamentablemente en España muchos cargos son heredados en el ejército. Tenemos 270 generales y con veinte sería suficiente; tenemos 1050 coroneles y con 50 sería suficiente. Esto evidencia el excedente de oficiales como ejemplo de cómo la cúpula militar se mueve buscando su propio interés.
Unfortunately, in the Spanish army many positions are inherited. We have 270 generals, 20 would be sufficient; we have 1,050 colonels and 50 would be sufficient. This evidence of surplus officials is a perfect example of how the military leaders looks out for their own interest.
The lieutenant blames the army's corruption on the impunity that exists within the institution, which lacks organizational separation between its judges, law enforcement and financial authorities. The army's lack of will to change doesn't help either, they say:
[…] ha habido una especie de pacto entre los dirigentes de la sociedad civil y los del mundo militar por el que nadie se quería meter en el terreno de nadie. Aunque pudo tener un sentido hasta el año 90 por el riesgo del golpe de Estado, a día de hoy no se entiende que se siga sosteniendo
[…] there's been some kind of pact between civil society leaders and the military because no one wanted to step on anyone's toes. And although, because of a coup d'état, it might have made sense until 1990, it doesn't mean it should continue on today.
Furthermore, Segura told La Marea that the military themselves cover up corruption: “There is a false sense of loyalty to a comrade that goes beyond the loyalty to Spain, the institution and the citizens.” News and analysis website Nuevatribuna.es reported that they aren't only criticizing the malpractices of the army, but is also putting forward solutions:
En su novela, eleva una carta al Ministro de Defensa, sugiriéndole hasta 19 medidas, «que harían del ejército una institución más justa y honorable». El problema de las fuerzas armadas, no es solo estructural, «están enfermas y necesitan ser regeneradas», dice el teniente.
In their novel, they write a letter to the Minister of Defense, suggesting up to 19 ways “that would make the army a much more just and honorable institution.” The army's issue is not structural, “it has become ill and it must be reformed,” the lieutenant said.
Some of what Segura has said in interviews regarding their book spurred the disciplinary proceedings against him. They were arrested on July 18 and sentenced to two months in the military prison, Colmenar Viejo. The lieutenant, who has been suspended from duty for several months, has another case filed against them that could lead to their expulsion from the army.
These sanctions, imposed for criticizing the military authorities publicly, show the lack of freedom of expression in the army and the possible punishment for exercising that right, thanks to an exception to articles 5 and 6 of the European Convention for the Protection on Human Rights and the Fundamental Freedoms that the Spanish government supports.
In addition, according to online newspaper eldiario.es, “a “major hunt” has begun in military quarters located in Zaragoza, Valencia, Córdoba and Canarias: “Comrades have been harshly threatened, including with expulsion and arrest, so they do not attend [events for the book], buy or discuss the book.”
Segura, who remains a lieutenant, began a hunger strike to protest the “lynching” which they believe military authorities are subjecting them to. They were recently admitted to the military hospital Gómez Ulla.
In the meantime, their book has become a bestseller, with more than 20,000 copies sold since it was published on April 21. It's already in its sixth edition. You can read the first chapter on their publisher's website, Tropo Editores.

With Google's big Android Wear update delayed and few new smartwatches from major manufacturers, this year's CES was set up to be a boring year for wearables.
But despite the poor showing from the major players, the show floor didn't disappoint when it came to the wacky, weird and — in some cases — kind of genius wearables.
SEE ALSO: The best tech of CES 2017
From bracelets that tell you how drunk you are to a wearable subwoofer, here's a look at the most bizarre wearables we saw at CES this year.
Gemio
The Gemio Band, a customizable bracelet with a variety of bright LED lighting effects, lets you connect with other users and send them secret messages. It also offers a way for brands and entertainers to connect to their fans and customers; for example, Lady Gaga could send fans a unique light pattern that they can activate at their show. The Gemio Band, company CEO Michael Bettua tells us, will be followed up with the Emoji Bracelet, which will allow users to send one another emoji that'll show up on their wrists.
SGNL
What if you could use your finger to make a phone call? That's the premise of SGNL, a watchband accessory from Innomdle Lab that allows you to hear phone calls when you press your finger to your ear. The band pairs to your phone with Bluetooth and uses bone conduction (similar to that used in headphones like Aftershokz) to transmit sound from your watch through your hand via vibrations. The catch? You have to pinch your ear closed to hear anything, which is not exactly comfortable. Originally launched on Kickstarter, SGNL is available for pre-order now for $149 on Indiegogo. The company says it expects to begin shipping in March.
Proof

It may look like a standard fitness tracker but Proof is actually keeping tabs on an entirely different metric: how drunk you are. More precisely, the band uses a special sensor that the company says is able to track the wearer's blood alcohol level. The accompanying app tracks your current BAC and also predicts what your levels will be in the future. You can even set custom alerts to let you know when you reach a certain level. Proof will cost between $100 to $150 and is slated to be available for pre-order later this year during the company's planned crowdfunding campaign.
Basslet
Image: stan schroeder.mashable
As its name suggests, the Basslet is meant to help you really feel the music you're listening too. The bracelet, which has no display of its own, connects to your phone via a special dongle that plugs into the headphone jack (or headphone jack adapter) of your phone. Once connected, it will vibrate in tune with the music you're listening to — sort of like a wearable subwoofer. It's scheduled to go on sale next month for $199.
Power Watch
Image: POwerwatch
The Power Watch aims to solve one of the most annoying parts of most wearables: their poor battery life. Instead of a typical battery you need to recharge each day, the Power Watch generates power from the wearer's own body heat. It also comes with its own app, which tracks how much heat you're creating and what your charging status is. The watch also tracks fitness stats like steps and how many calories you're burning. It's set to ship to crowdfunding backers this summer.
Athlete Recovery Pajamas
Okay, there are no sensors, Bluetooth, or app for Under Armour's new line of "Recovery Sleepwear" but the company says its new PJs are high-tech nonetheless. The clothes are made of special material that takes advantage of something called bio-ceramics, which the company says helps improve blood flow and reduce inflammation in athletes so they sleep better and recover faster. The benefits will cost you though, starting at $80 each for the shorts and T-shirts and $100 each for the pants and long-sleeve shirts.

Cereals, appropriability, and hierarchy
Joram Mayshar, Omer Moav, Zvika Neeman, Luigi Pascali
Conventional theory suggests that hierarchy and state institutions emerged due to increased productivity following the Neolithic transition to farming. This column argues that these social developments were a result of an increase in the ability of both robbers and the emergent elite to appropriate crops. Hierarchy and state institutions developed, therefore, only in regions where appropriable cereal crops had sufficient productivity advantage over non-appropriable roots and tubers.
What explains underdevelopment?
One of the most pressing problems of our age is the underdevelopment of countries in which government malfunction seems endemic. Many of these countries are located close to the Equator.1 Acemoglu et al. (2001) point to extractive institutions as the root cause for underdevelopment. Besley and Persson (2014) emphasise the persistent effects of low fiscal capacity in underdeveloped countries. On the other hand, Diamond (1997) argues that it is geographical factors that explain why some regions of the world remain underdeveloped. In particular, they argue that the east-west orientation of Eurasia resulted in greater variety and productivity of cultivable crops, and in larger economic surplus, which facilitated the development of state institutions in this major landmass. Less fortunate regions, including New Guinea and sub-Saharan Africa, were left underdeveloped due to low land productivity.
In a recent paper (Mayshar et al. 2015), we contend that fiscal capacity and viable state institutions are conditioned to a major extent by geography. Thus, like Diamond, we argue that geography matters a great deal. But in contrast to Diamond, and against conventional opinion, we contend that it is not high farming productivity and the availability of food surplus that accounts for the economic success of Eurasia.
We propose an alternative mechanism by which environmental factors imply the appropriability of crops and thereby the emergence of complex social institutions.
To understand why surplus is neither necessary nor sufficient for the emergence of hierarchy, consider a hypothetical community of farmers who cultivate cassava (a major source of calories in sub-Saharan Africa, and the main crop cultivated in Nigeria), and assume that the annual output is well above subsistence. Cassava is a perennial root that is highly perishable upon harvest. Since this crop rots shortly after harvest, it isn't stored and it is thus difficult to steal or confiscate. As a result, the assumed available surplus would not facilitate the emergence of a non-food producing elite, and may be expected to lead to a population increase.
Consider now another hypothetical farming community that grows a cereal grain – such as wheat, rice or maize – yet with an annual produce that just meets each family's subsistence needs, without any surplus. Since the grain has to be harvested within a short period and then stored until the next harvest, a visiting robber or tax collector could readily confiscate part of the stored produce. Such ongoing confiscation may be expected to lead to a downward adjustment in population density, but it will nevertheless facilitate the emergence of non-producing elite, even though there was no surplus.
Emergence of fiscal capacity and hierarchy and the cultivation of cereals
This simple scenario shows that surplus isn't a precondition for taxation. It also illustrates our alternative theory that the transition to agriculture enabled hierarchy to emerge only where the cultivated crops were vulnerable to appropriation.
In particular, we contend that the Neolithic emergence of fiscal capacity and hierarchy was conditioned on the cultivation of appropriable cereals as the staple crops, in contrast to less appropriable staples such as roots and tubers.
According to this theory, complex hierarchy did not emerge among hunter-gatherers because hunter-gatherers essentially live from hand-to-mouth, with little that can be expropriated from them to feed a would-be elite.2
Thus, rather than surplus facilitating the emergence of the elite, we argue that the elite only emerged when and where it was possible to expropriate crops.
Due to increasing returns to scale in the provision of protection from theft, early farmers had to aggregate and to cooperate to defend their stored grains. Food storage and the demand for protection thus led to population agglomeration in villages and to the creation of a non-food producing elite that oversaw the provision of protection. Once a group became larger than a few dozen immediate kin, it is unlikely that those who sought protection services were as forthcoming in financing the security they desired. This public-good nature of protection was resolved by the ability of those in charge of protecting the stored food to appropriate the necessary means.
That is, we argue that it was this transformation of the appropriation technology, due to the transition to cereals, which created both the demand for protection and the means for its provision.
This is how we explain the emergence of complex and hereditary social hierarchy, and eventually the state.
Applied to Diamond's prototypic contrast between Eurasia and New Guinea, our theory suggests that the crucial distinction between these two regions is that farming in Eurasia relied on the cultivation of cereals, while in New Guinea it relied mostly on the cultivation of tubers (yam and taro, and, more recently, sweet potato) and bananas, where long-term storage is neither feasible (due to perishability) nor necessary (because harvesting is essentially non-seasonal). This provided farmers in New Guinea with sufficient immunity against bandits and potential tax collectors. More generally, we contend that the underdevelopment of tropical areas is not due to low land fertility but rather the reverse. Farmers in the tropics can choose to cultivate highly productive, non-appropriable tuber crops. This inhibits both the demand for socially provided protection and the emergence of a protection-providing elite. It is a curse of plenty.
In the empirical section of our paper we demonstrate that, contrary to the standard productivity-and-surplus theory, land productivity per se has no direct effect on hierarchy. We also show that, consistent with our theory, the cultivation of roots or tubers is indeed detrimental to hierarchy.
Empirical findings
These results are established by employing two datasets with information on social hierarchy: a cross-section and a panel of countries. For our cross-sectional analysis we use Murdock's (1967) Ethnographic Atlas, which contains information on cultural, institutional, and economic features of 1,267 societies from around the world at an idealised time period of first contact with Europeans. Our main outcome variable is ‘jurisdictional hierarchy beyond the local community'. The Ethnographic Atlas also provides information on the major crop type grown by societies that practice agriculture.
Since the cultivated crop is a decision variable, we instrument for the crop type by using data on land suitability for different crops from the Food and Agriculture Organisation. We first show that the decision whether to cultivate cereals as a main crop depends positively on the productivity advantage of cereals over roots and tubers (in terms of potential caloric yields per hectare). We then find that societies tend to have a more complex hierarchal organisation where the productivity advantage of cereals over roots and tubers is higher, as predicted by our theory. Furthermore, we find that societies that practice agriculture are more hierarchical only where they cultivate cereals. This means that societies that cultivate roots and tubers have similar levels of hierarchy to those of pastoral or foraging societies.
We also show that land productivity, measured by the potential yield of calories per acre of the most productive crop in each area, does not affect hierarchy once we control for the productivity advantage of cereals. Thus, our empirical findings challenge the conventional argument that it is increased land productivity that leads to more hierarchical societies.
Although this cross-sectional analysis accounts for a wide range of confounding factors, we cannot rule out completely that omitted variables may bias the estimates. To overcome this concern, we employ another dataset compiled by Borcan et al. (2014). This is a panel, based on present-day boundaries of 159 countries, with institutional information every five decades over the last millennium. This panel enables us to exploit the ‘Columbian exchange' of crops across continents as a natural experiment. The new crops that became available after 1492 in the New and the Old World changed both the productivity of land and the productivity advantage of cereals over roots and tubers in the majority of the countries in the sample. Consistent with our theory, the panel regressions confirm that an increase in the productivity advantage of cereals over roots and tubers has a positive impact on hierarchical complexity, while an increase in land productivity does not.
Concluding remarks
These findings support our theory that it is not agricultural productivity and surplus per se that explains more complex hierarchical societies, but rather the productivity advantage of cereals over roots and tubers, the type of crop that is cultivated as a result, and the appropriability of the crop type. Given that the productivity of roots and tubers is typically high in the tropics, these results also support the claim that deep-rooted geographical factors may explain the current weakness of state institutions in these regions.

State Representative Alan Clemmons (CarolinaLIve)
A South Carolina lawmaker has proposed making local school students spend three weeks studying the Second Amendment using materials “developed or recommended” by the NRA, reports CarolinaLive.
State Representative Alan Clemmons, saying they want a stronger emphasis to be placed on the Second Amendment, has proposed altering a mandatory high school class devoted to the U.S. Constitution to focus on guns in order to “demystify” them.
“The second amendment applies to every American citizen,” said Clemmons. “It is a personal right to bear arms for the sake of defending oneself if the need should arise.”
“The discussion should be a scholarly discussion about the history of the second amendment, why was it important to our fathers, why was it so important that it was included in the bill of rights, and how the second amendment folds into modern society.”
Clemmons says they filed the proposed legislation in response to school Zero Tolerance policies, saying those policies have an anti-Second Amendment slant.
“That policy in my mind is subjecting the rising generation to the mindset of the instrument, the firearm, is evil regardless of the hand that the firearm is in,” explained Clemmons.
Under Clemmons' proposed legislation (H 3023), Dec. 15 would be declared “Second Amendment Awareness Day” and would require public schools to conduct poster and essay contests with state recognition for essay winners. Additionally, three weeks would be set aside in high school U.S. Constitution classes to be devoted solely to the study of the 2nd Amendment, “that has been developed or recommended by the National Rifle Association” as a condition of graduation.
Clemmons also supports proposed legislation that would allow schools to offer a semester-long course on firearm safety that would take kids out of the classroom and onto shooting ranges. That class would also focus on the history of guns and gun rights.
“It's not a mandatory course for students,” said Clemmons. “Being an elective course, I am supportive of it.

Advertisement John McCain has accepted the Republican Party's candidacy for the White House in a speech to cheering supporters at the party's national convention. They vowed to bring change to government, restore the people's trust in the party and to fight for a better nation. Praising their running mate Sarah Palin, they said they were the right person to help them bring change to Washington. The Arizona senator said they respected Democratic rival Barack Obama and would seek a bipartisan approach to politics. Presenting themselves once again as a maverick, they pledged to fight corruption, whether Democratic or Republican, and make sure that they worked for the good of the American people. "Let me offer an advance warning to the old, big spending, do nothing, me first, country second Washington crowd: change is coming," Mr McCain told the crowds in St Paul, Minnesota. Again and again, I've worked with members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed
John McCain
Analysis: McCain weathers storms In pictures: Convention - Day Four Republican voters' views US election polltracker In a criticism of their own party, they said they would "fight to restore the pride and principles" of the party, damaged after some Republicans gave in to "the temptations of corruption". "We're going to recover the people's trust by standing up again for the values Americans admire," they said. "The party of Lincoln, Roosevelt and Reagan is going to get back to basics." Mr McCain then turned to attacking the Democrats over taxes and spending, saying they would seek to raise taxes whereas they would keep them low and cut them where possible. Going into some policy specifics, they pledged create new jobs, improve education and to reduce a "dangerous dependence on foreign oil" by producing more energy at home, including by drilling new offshore oil wells. Mr McCain promised to take a bipartisan approach to resolving the nation's problems, saying: "Again and again, I've worked with members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed. McCAIN'S MOST-USED WORDS
Full text of McCain speech US media mixed over speech "That's how I will govern as president. I will reach out my hand to anyone to help me get this country moving again. "I have that record and the scars to prove it. Barack Obama does not." After speaking of the five years they spent as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and how that experience had inspired their love of their country, they called on their fellow Americans to fight with them to make it a better one. "Stand up, stand up, stand up and fight. Nothing is inevitable here. We're Americans and we never give up. We never quit. We never hide from history. We make history." The almost hour-long speech, which ended in the traditional shower of confetti and red, white and blue balloons, brought to a close the party's four-day event. 'Tested and true' The BBC's Adam Brookes in St Paul says Mr McCain's speech was measured and entirely lacking in the sarcasm and vitriol which have been levelled at Mr Obama over the past couple of nights. They said they hated war and would use all America's tools - diplomatic, military and economic - to build what they called a stable and enduring peace, as well as shaking up Washington and including Democrats and independents in a McCain administration. Mrs McCain praised their husband as a great father and devoted American It was all a rather different tone to the Republican politics of the past eight years, and to many of the other speakers at this Republican convention, our correspondent says. There was very little of President George W Bush in this speech, our correspondent adds, as Mr McCain tries to show that they are their own man and can signify a break with the Bush years. Mr McCain's wife, Cindy, in their speech praised their husband's family values, strength of character, war service and leadership. "If Americans want straight talk and the plain truth, they should take a good close look at John McCain... a man tested and true, who's never wavered in their devotion to our country," they said, after arriving on stage flanked by their seven children. Them speech followed the convention's formal nomination of Mrs Palin - the Republican Party's first female vice-presidential candidate. Mrs Palin becomes only the second woman, the first being Democrat Geraldine Ferraro in 1984, to run for the US vice-presidency. 'Integrity and courage' Speaking ahead of Mr McCain's address, senior Republicans praised their courage and leadership. I have to say, from my vantage point next to the DC delegation, my overall impression was that the audience in the hall were disappointed
BBC North America editor Justin Webb
Read Justin's thoughts in full Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty, at one point hotly tipped to be Mr McCain's running mate choice, described the Arizona senator's life as "a testimony to service, duty, courage and common sense". "In this time, we don't need a president who can just read a poll or momentarily thrill a crowd. We don't need rhetoric or empty promises," they said. "We need a president who has the integrity and courage to make the tough choices so America will be stronger and safer." South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham hailed Mr McCain's determination to back the Bush administration's "surge" strategy in Iraq despite the political risks. HAVE YOUR SAY McCain is an experienced person and their speech impressed me Hariprasad Bhusal, India They introduced a video presenting Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as a "maverick" moose-hunter from Alaska who was joining "the original maverick" Mr McCain to bring change to Washington politics. In a well-received speech on Wednesday, Mrs Palin praised Mr McCain and attacked Mr Obama as having talked of change, but done nothing of substance. President George W Bush has also strongly endorsed John McCain as the best man to succeed them in the White House.

Myron Rolle, the Florida State Seminoles safety turned Rhodes Scholar who's trying to make it in the NFL, has signed with the Steelers.
Rolle, who revealed the signing on Twitter, would have to be viewed as a long shot to make the roster after twice trying and failing to make the Titans' 53-man roster. But signing with the Steelers now gives them a chance to go through a full offseason conditioning program, learn the team's defense and at least give themselves a chance of making the team in training camp.
If Rolle doesn't make it with the Steelers, there's little doubt that he's going to find success in life. They have a degree in medical anthropology and has said he'd like to become a doctor. But he's going to give the NFL everything they have before moving on.

In the movie Jurassic Park, a tree extinct for millions of years delights the paleobotanist. Then a sauropod eats its leaves. This movie later shows us how to re-create the dinosaur but not how to grow the tree, which at that size would be perhaps a hundred or more years old, or how to do so metaphorically overnight. To sustain even a single dinosaur, one would need thousands of trees, probably of many species, as well as their pollinators and perhaps their essential symbiotic fungi.
Video: Should We Resurrect Extinct Species?
De-extinction intends to resurrect single, charismatic species, yet millions of species are at risk of extinction. De-extinction can only be an infinitesimal part of solving the crisis that now sees species of animals (some large but most tiny), plants, fungi, and microbes going extinct at a thousand times their natural rates. (Related: Photos of Nearly Extinct Species.)
"But wait"—claim de-extinction's proponents. "We want to resurrect passenger pigeons and Pyrenean ibex, not dinosaurs. Surely, the plants on which these animals depend still survive, so there is no need to resurrect them as well!" Indeed, botanic gardens worldwide have living collections of an impressively large fraction of the world's plants, some extinct in the wild, others soon to be so. Their absence from the wild is more easily fixed than the absence of animals, for which de-extinction is usually touted.
Perhaps so, but other practical problems abound: A resurrected Pyrenean ibex will need a safe home, not just its food plants. Those of us who attempt to reintroduce zoo-bred species that have gone extinct in the wild have one question at the top of our list: Where do we put them? Hunters ate this wild goat to extinction. Reintroduce a resurrected ibex to the area where it belongs and it will become the most expensive cabrito ever eaten. If this seems cynical, then consider the cautionary tale of the Arabian oryx, returned to Oman from a captive breeding program. Their numbers have declined so much that their home, designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site, was summarily removed from the register. (Pictures: Extinct Species That Could Be Brought Back.)
Yes, the set of plants alive a century or so ago when the passenger pigeon went extinct are probably still here. Is the pigeon's habitat intact? Surely not: The land use changes since then have been far too extensive.

In every case, without an answer to "where do we put them?"—and to the further question, "what changed in their original habitat that may have contributed to their extinction in the first place?"—efforts to bring back species are a colossal waste.
De-extinction is much worse than a waste: By setting up the expectation that biotechnology can repair the damage we're doing to the planet's biodiversity, it's extremely harmful for two kinds of political reasons.
Fantasies of reclaiming extinct species are always seductive. It is a fantasy that real scientists—those wearing white lab coats—are using fancy machines with knobs and digital readouts to save the planet from humanity's excesses. In this fantasy, there is none of the messy interaction with people, politics, and economics that characterizes my world. There is nothing involving the real-world realities of habitat destruction, of the inherent conflict between growing human populations and wildlife survival. Why worry about endangered species? We can simply keep their DNA and put them back in the wild later.
When I testify before Congress on endangered species, I'm always asked, "Can't we safely reduce the spotted owl to small numbers, keeping some in captivity as insurance?" The meaning is clear: "Let's log out almost all western North America's old-growth forests because, if we can save species with high-tech solutions, the forest doesn't matter."
Or I'm asked, "Can't we breed in captivity the Cape Sable seaside sparrow?"—an obscure little bird whose survival requires the water in Everglades National Park to be the right amount in the right place at the right time. "Let's accommodate the sugar growers and damage large areas of the Everglades. Let's tolerate a high risk of extinction because our white-lab-coated science rock stars can save the day!"
The second political problem involves research priorities. I work with very poor people in Africa, Brazil, and Madagascar. Rich only in the diversity of life amid which they eke out their living, they generate no money for my university. Too many other universities equate excellence with funds generated, not with societal needs met. Over my career, molecular biologists flourished as university administrators drooled over their large grants and their expensive labs. Field-based biology withered. Many otherwise prominent universities have no schools of the environment, no ecology departments, no professors of conservation. It was all too easy to equate "biology" with molecules and strip faculty positions and facilities from those who worked in the field. De-extinction efforts can only perpetuate that trend.
Video: Recipe for Resurrection
It's always exciting when a writer from another media platform comes in to take a ride with superheroes. Joss Whedon made waves with their Astonishing X-Men run in 2004, and TV screenwriter Allan Heinberg's Young Avengers kickstarted the most energetic teenage heroes in the entire Marvel universe. Marvel's latest crossover may be the most interesting of all, however. Ta-Nehisi Coates, known for both hard-hitting journalism in The Atlantic and poetic memoirs like the bestselling Between the World and Me, is now writing Black Panther, Marvel's first and foremost black superhero. Excitement has been building for months. Now the comic's here, and it's great. So let's walk through it.
First, a quick catch-up for those not already familiar with the Black Panther character: Originally introduced in the pages of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's Fantastic Four, Black Panther (real name T'Challa) was mainstream comics' first black superhero. From the beginning, they shattered stereotypes. Black Panther was a genius on par with Tony Stark, and a noble king of an independent, advanced nation. T'Challa rules over Wakanda, a fictional African country enriched and empowered by its unique connection to a rare metal called vibranium (the material used for Captain America's shield). Wakanda is a wonder of both scientific advancement and mystical tradition, a combination embodied in the Panther himself. “Black Panther” is not a secret superhero disguise but a mantle held by Wakanda's ruler, connecting T'Challa with the wisdom of their ancestors and the power of the Panther God.
Thanks to its scientific advancement and fearsome protector, Wakanda was supposed to be invulnerable. Recent Marvel crossovers like Avengers vs. X-Men and Secret Wars saw the country attacked and devastated. T'Challa's sister Shuri, who had temporarily taken over from them as ruler, was killed. T'Challa themselves joined a secret superhero Illuminati to prevent the Marvel Universe's destruction at the hands of parallel realities, but those events took their toll. This takes us to the first page of Black Panther #1, which depicts flashbacks of T'Challa being disowned by the ghost of their father, taunted by Namor, and abandoned by their bodyguards. Here are other interesting takeaways.
New characters and powers
T'Challa is the hero here, but so far Black Panther does not lack for interesting supporting characters. The first pages introduce a mysterious villain with some kind of telepathic power; they use mind control to inflame rioters at Wakanda's main vibranium site. After months of suffering cataclysmic outside attacks, Black Panther's greatest threat now comes from within Wakanda. We don't know a lot about their new female foe at this point – do they incept their victims, or merely inflame thoughts they already had? Apparently this telepathy has its costs; they complain about lingering pain of “auras” after some Wakandans die under their control. They call themselves a “liberator” for Wakandans, but the force she's gathering at the border certainly doesn't seem very liberating.
Aside from T'Challa, this issue does not contain another prominent male figure. Another compelling female character is Ramonda, T'Challa's widowed stepmother (and the mother of dearly departed Shuri). Ramonda is just as weary of recent events as everyone else seems to be – “more death, T'Challa?” they ask at one point. Yet they are fully committed to the legitimacy and power of royalty; they remind T'Challa that they are not a soldier but a king. More importantly, they steel themselves into upholding a death sentence for Aneka, one of T'Challa's bodyguards.
Aneka and Ayo are both members of the Dora Milaje, or “adored ones,” the elite female force in charge of protecting the king. This issue finds them finally breaking these boundaries, however. Aneka receives the death sentence for killing a male chieftain who was raping their female villagers. Ayo states that they were acting “as the honor of Wakandan fathers and brothers have demanded,” but Ramonda upholds the sentence, saying the Dora Milaje need to be exemplars. And so Ayo breaks their friend out, deciding not to beholden themselves to a single man any longer. They become lovers and don awesome-looking “Midnight Angel” robot suits, leaving their old roles behind.
Marvel
Playing with politics
Coates does not shy away from politics in their writing, and it appears their Black Panther will also touch on political issues in between its superhero battle sequences. The protestors at the beginning of the comic attack T'Challa while screaming “death to tyrants” and “a throne for Wakandans.” It's unclear at this point whether this feeling was genuine or created by the mysterious telepath. T'Challa certainly seems to believe the latter, but they can also tell their people are discontent and divided from him. Their failure to protect their people from recent devastation is certainly causing everyone to rethink the Wakandan system. The arc title, “A Nation Under Our Feet,” appears to suggest that Black Panther will heavily interrogate T'Challa's relationship with their country. Hopefully their citizens' discontent won't be chalked up solely to telepathic control. It's always disheartening to see works like The Dark Knight Rises or Fear the Walking Dead take legitimate political grievances and turn them into mere facades for supernatural villainy.
This story also touches on gender politics. Aneka and Ayo rebel against sexist standards of justice, while Romanda faces their own dilemma as a grieving mother who must steel themselves to help rule this dangerous time. It'll be interesting to see how both these political themes develop through the rest of the story.
Coates connections
Up to this point, Coates' various works have remained distinct. Their posts in The Atlantic range from quick hit blog posts to long-form investigate pieces rooted in history and reporting. Their books, on the other hand, are written with a more poetic style, and focus on their personal experience. This comic is obviously different from those predecessors, in format and tone. Coates is writing the type of Marvel superhero book they grew up with, not discoursing on the role of racism in the New Deal. And yet there does seem to be some connection to their literary themes. Between the World and Me, for example, grounds racism in visceral bodily experience – “how do I live free in this black body?” Black Panther, too, is concerned with the body as both symbolic and visceral.
When T'Challa is grabbed by protestors, they rage against their telepathic foe “consuming the body of the nation, dividing me from my very blood.” Later, Aneka and Ayo's decision to leave the Dora Milaje and become lovers takes form as a bodily transformation. They change from their classic feminine clothing, designed for the male gaze of their king (“adored ones,” remember) into genderless robot armor, to fit their new roles outside the heteronormative Wakandan tradition. It'll be fun to keep an eye on this theme.
Easter eggs
Coates is an avowed rap fan; they once wrote a great MF Doom profile for The New Yorker, and used rap lyrics in their promotional tweets for Black Panther #1. So perhaps it's no surprise when Aneka and Ayo directly quote Kanye West when deciding to leave T'Challa — “no one man should have all that power” — but it's still a fun surprise. Going forward, it'll be fun to see what kind of Nas and Wu-Tang Clan references they can sneak into the speech bubbles.

What does this mean for the movie?
Coates isn't the only creator working with Black Panther in the near future. After the character makes their big-screen debut in Captain America: Civil War, Ryan Coogler (Creed) is set to direct a solo feature, set for sometime in 2018. Though Coates tweeted that they aren't involved in the movie at all, and it would be foolish to only read Black Panther in light of a movie that's still years away, it would be cool to see the film take notes from this comic. Artist Brian Stelfreeze's futuristic vision of Wakanda, for instance, could survive the transition to screen remarkably well. And the political issues at play would certainly help a Black Panther movie do interesting things within the superhero format, the way Netflix's Jessica Jones series used its hero to explore issues of abuse and rape.
Amazon Kindle Sold Out: No Estimated Date of Availability
To our recollection, this actually hasn't happened in quite some time. To be exact, in 2008, when it was the original Kindle. And, even then, Amazon managed to make sure they told customers when the Kindle would be coming back around, or shipping to their doorsteps. Not this time. All Amazon says right now is that the Kindle is temporarily out of stock, and that purchasers will get an email when the eReader gets an estimated delivery date.
So, what does all this mean? Well, in the short-term (which is probably the only real situation, mind you), it means that the Kindle is sold out. There must've been some crazy high demand for a mid-Summer shopping spree or something, and Amazon wasn't able to keep up with production. With that in mind, it probably won't be long at all before it gets back onto the digital shelves, and everything is right with the world.
Or… It means that there's a new Kindle coming. If you'll recall, a Bloomberg report suggested that “people in the know” were saying a new, thinner, sharper displayed Kindle 3 or Kindle “Slim” (that's a new favorite word, isn't it?) was coming some time in August. Well, unless our calendars are wrong, August is just right around the corner. Of course, unless it launches on August 1st, this may be too soon to pull the availability of their famous eReader.
There's no telling which option is actually happening here, as Amazon isn't coming out and saying anything quite yet. But, if a new Kindle is incoming some time in August, then any day now we should expect some kind of press release. We won't hold our breath, though. Anyone out there interested in seeing a new Kindle?

Though chemistry teachers might have to regularly field questions about the chemistry of ‘Breaking Bad' these days, baking bread is probably more likely to figure on a list of their recreational activities. Bread-making is a process that seems simple, essentially involving the mixing of just four ingredients. However, there's a lot more chemistry to it than meets the eye; here we delve into the science to work out what's going on in your loaf.
The process of making bread can be broken down at a very simple level into four steps. First, the ingredients are mixed; the four basic ingredients used to make a bread are flour, water, yeast, and salt. Combining This creates a dough, which is then kneaded before being left to rise, before being baked. Sounds pretty straightforward, right? Perhaps, but at a molecular level there's a lot more happening.
We start our examination of bread science with the flour. Amongst the most important components of the flour are proteins, which often make up 10-15%. These include the classes of proteins called glutenins and gliadins, which are huge molecules built up of a large number of amino acids. These are collectively referred to as gluten, a name we're probably all familiar with.
Without these proteins, making bread would be much more difficult; in the flour itself, they are inert, but as soon as water is added into the mixture the fun begins. The proteins are then able to line up with each other, and interact. They can form hydrogen bonds and disulfide cross-links between their chains, eventually forming a giant gluten network throughout the dough. Kneading the dough helps these proteins uncoil and interact with each other more strongly, strengthening the network.
Another ingredient that can affect the dough's gluten network is salt. It can help strengthen the gluten network, making the dough more elastic, and of course adds flavour to the final bread. Ascorbic acid, a compound more commonly known as vitamin C, also helps to strengthen the gluten network.
This network is vital for the bread to be able to rise, but of course the rising bread wouldn't occur at all without one of the other ingredients. This is, of course, the yeast. Yeast contains enzymes that are able to break down the starch in the flour into sugars; first using amylase to break down the starch to maltose, and then using maltase to break down maltose into glucose. This glucose acts as food for the yeast, and it metabolises it to produce carbon dioxide and ethanol.
The sugar produced by this process isn't all metabolised by the yeast, however. It can also get involved in some other chemical reactions during the baking process. Specifically, it participates in the Maillard reaction, a series of reactions between sugars and amino acids that occur rapidly above 140˚C. These reactions produce a whole range of products, which can add flavour to the bread, and also help to form the brown crust of the bread.
Back to the yeast though, and let's look in more detail at the products of its sugar metabolism. Ethanol is of course simply the alcohol found in alcoholic drinks, but you don't have to worry about getting a little tipsy as a result eating a loaf of bread because it's expelled from the dough during the baking process. So is the carbon dioxide gas, but before the dough is baked, it simply diffuses through the dough and enlarges pre-existing tiny air bubbles. This is another reason that kneading the dough is important, as it ensures that a large number of these pre-existing bubbles are present.
Exactly how the carbon dioxide is held in the bread has been a matter of some debate amongst scientists. The common explanation for a long time was that the gluten network helps to trap the carbon dioxide, and prevents it from escaping the dough. However, it's become clear that the picture is a little more complicated than that. Though the gluten network is certainly involved, it turns out that proteins and lipids in the dough are also involved, and can help stabilise the gas bubbles.
Of course, bread doesn't always have to made with baker's yeast. Sour dough breads are another way of producing a loaf. Sour doughs begin with a starter, which is begun by mixing flour and water. The natural microbes in the flour start to grow, and if this mixture is regularly ‘fed' with more flour and water, you end up with a mixture containing a mix of bacteria and yeasts. These yeasts are wild yeasts, of a different variety to baker's yeast. For starters, they have to be more acid tolerant, due to the acidic compounds produced by the bacteria, and they also differ in how they metabolise sugars.
Whereas baker's yeast will quite happily munch on maltose, converting it to glucose before converting that in turn to carbon dioxide and ethanol, the wild yeasts found in sour dough are unable to process maltose. Luckily for them, the bacteria in the sour dough mixture can, and since maltose is simply two glucose molecules joined together, it produces food for both the bacteria and the yeast. This help is eventually paid back by the yeast, as the bacteria are able to feed on any dead yeast cells. The ultimate result is still the same, but the taste can sometimes be altered by the bacterial metabolites; compounds such as lactic acid can sometimes add a sour flavour.
Sometimes, we might want to cheat a bit, and resort to quicker ways to get carbon dioxide into our bread. That's where baking soda and baking powder can potentially help out. These both contain sodium bicarbonate, a basic compound that breaks down in the presence of acidity to produce carbon dioxide as one of the products. However, there is a slight difference between the two. Baking soda contains only sodium bicarbonate, which can leave a bitter taste in the bread if there isn't enough acidity to completely break it down. Baking powder, on the other hand, also contains and acidic compound (commonly cream of tartar, potassium bitartrate) which helps break down the bicarbonate once mixed into the dough.
You might well be wondering how this whole process works for gluten-free bread. After all, without the gluten network forming, your bread would be pretty flat-looking. For gluten-free breads, gluten-free flours such as rice flour must be used, to which xanthan gum is commonly added. This is a polysaccharide produced by a particular bacterium which can help provide a similar elasticity to gluten.
After your bread's cooked, if you don't manage to eat it in time, it will of course start to go stale. This isn't due to a loss of moisture, but due to the starch crystallising and hardening over time. Though this can be temporarily reversed by reheating the bread, this doesn't last for long – it's good if you're going to be eating it immediately after, but not if you're trying to save an entire loaf for future use. In the habit of storing your bread in the fridge? You're actually accelerating the staling process: experiments have shown that bread stored in a refrigerator at 7˚C stales as much in one day as bread left outside in 30˚C heat does in six days.
There's load more to bread science that it's been possible to explore in this short post and graphic, but I've compiled some additional links below for those who are interested in delving further into this fascinating area of food science. In the meantime, you might look at the humble loaf of bread a little different the next time you're in the supermarket!

Bernard Bosanquet (1877–1936) was an English cricketer best known for inventing the googly, a delivery designed to deceive the batsman. They played first-class cricket for Middlesex County Cricket Club and appeared in seven Test matches for England as an all-rounder. While playing a tabletop game, Bosanquet devised a new technique for delivering a ball, later named the "googly", which they practised while attending Oriel College, Oxford. They first used it in cricket matches around 1900, but it was not until 1903, when they had a successful season as a bowler, that their new delivery began to attract attention. They were selected in 1903–04 to tour Australia with England and made their Test debut. Although their batting was unsuccessful, they performed well as a bowler and troubled all the opposing batsmen. Their career with the ball peaked when they bowled England to victory in the first Test against Australia in 1905, but they remained an inconsistent performer. In subsequent years, they bowled infrequently and played little first-class cricket. (more...)

“THE big question is: do you want to end this conflict or just tamp it down? The arguments for the first are self-evident. Palestine fouls up our diplomacy: Israel is thrown at us whenever we ask Muslim allies for help. Unsolved, this conflict generates wars. The last administration was tripped up by the Israel-Hizbullah war in 2006. Another round in Lebanon—or a small war in Gaza, or a big one between Israel and Iran or Syria—is possible at any time.
But the argument for just tamping down is also strong. Presidents who go for the whole package waste their time and fail. Jimmy Carter got peace with Egypt but nothing for the Palestinians. Hillary will tell you Bill spent more time on this than anything else in foreign policy, but they failed too. Their excuse is that Arafat suckered them (“Don't you ever trust that son of a bitch,” was their parting advice to Colin Powell), but now that Arafat's dead the Palestinians have two addresses instead of one. The Europeans tell us that Hamas can live with a two-state deal, despite its spiel about destroying Israel. But if we talk to Hamas we knock the legs from under Mahmoud Abbas. For now he's still our Joe and the Palestinians' president.
As for Israel, Ehud Olmert was a cooing dove compared to Binyamin Netanyahu, who looks like winning the election in February. They play annoyingly well on the Hill and pushes the line that Abbas can't deliver and that Hamas is a terror front for Iran (which, by the way, they want us to bomb).
Even if you decide against going the whole hog, you'll lose nothing by saying forcefully before Israel votes that we want a two-state solution with a shared Jerusalem and little modification of the pre-1967 line. Spell out the percentages. Netanyahu might as well know they won't get another free pass to jerk us around on settlements. Then, honour satisfied, you could decide to put the full package to one side and try something more modest, like peeling Syria from Iran by dangling the Golan Heights. Israel's own security people want a Syria deal.
If you want to get a settlement with the Palestinians too, we must start early and allow time. If Hillary is too grand to shuttle, appoint an envoy reporting to you to (1) make our Arab friends wangle Hamas back into a Palestinian unity government; and (2) get international buy-in to an “Obama plan”. This will in fact consist of the “parameters” Bill Clinton drew up in 2000 and are the nearest you'll get to a sellable compromise. Hillary must help you sell this in New York as well as Riyadh. Only then should you step in to close the deal—after figuring out what mix of heat and reassurance to apply to the Israelis. They're the ones who have to give up something real.”
I consider myself a newbie to Heathenry and am I trying to learn from others as I move towards Heathen practice. One way I learn from others is from email lists where like minded people (or sometimes unlike minded people) share experiences, knowledge and personal beliefs about a topic. The topic of oaths recently emerged on an Heathen email list. Another newbie was asking for advice on how to manage oaths made in haste or in the absence of understanding the full weight of what it means to take an oath. The main question asked was, “What should someone do if the oath cannot be fulfilled?”
Let me back up a smidge. I know a little bit about oaths, thanks to Jax and our friends in the Red Oak Fellowship. Foremost, I know taking an oath as a Heathen is serious business.Oaths can be made to the gods, your ancestors, your community or another individual — but in a Heathen context, it's not just a personal promise. An oath is more like a vow you decree publicly and in doing so bind yourself to honoring that promise. That is, you work that promise into your wyrd (aka örlög).* But it's more than that. When you take an oath you not only bind yourself, you also bind those who bear witness to your oath to helping you honor that promise. And so an oath is woven into a larger wyrd, as well.
Here's an example. Imagine you are not a Heathen (which many of you aren't) and you are getting married. You take your vows and make a promise of fidelity, loyalty, respect…or whatever…to your new spouse. Symbolically, as you make that promise a thread emerges from your heart and connects to your spouse through their or their heart. Now imagine you are a Heathen (which some of you are) in the same scenario taking an oath. Instead of one thread binding you to your spouse, many threads grow from your heart and connect you to everyone in the hall. Furthermore, threads from everyone in the room come back to and connect to you — and they connect to each other. That is the power of an oath.**
And that is why oaths should not be taken lightly. It is not unusual for larger Heathen groups to forgo the “oath” segment of the “toast, boast, oath” tradition of symbel out of respect for the pervasive connections borne of oaths. Much as we appreciate and enjoy Heathen fellowship, we don't always live in the same area, we are not always knowledgeable about each other's histories, we don't always know each other's families. A lack of physical and emotional intimacy makes it a real challenge to create a communal ripple in wyrd by agreeing to help someone uphold their oath. Can you, in good conscience, create an oath bond with others when they may be in absentia for the deed(s)? No, you really can't. Or you really shouldn't. So the “best practice” is to just not do it.
Last Yule, Jax, TheScott and I had a full symbel. Jax made an oath to advance their writing career. I have tried to uphold my end of the agreement by leaving them alone on their “writing days.” TheScott made an oath to participate in charitable works. I have tried to uphold my end by donating to at least one of their causes. I made an oath to….an oath to….to…holy crap. I cannot remember my oath! @#$%! @#$%! @#$%! Heathen. Fail.
See, this is why you shouldn't take it lightly! I made an oath without really understanding the weight of what I was doing. Which leads us back to the opening question, “What should someone do if the oath cannot be fulfilled?” (Which in my case is because I can't remember it. Note to self, write your oath down this year because you are a lightweight and you will drink too much wine — aka more than two glasses).
There seem to be a few schools of thought (and a lot of UPG) on how to answer this question. The “you're screwed” camp includes those who believe oathbreakers are the most egregious of “sinners” and warrant no forgiveness. The “wyrd is a fabric that can be mended” camp includes those who believe reparation is possible for oaths made in good faith, attempted in good faith and broken in good faith — so long as the reparation is in good faith, too. The “don't take it too seriously” camp seems to include those who don't really embrace the power of an oath.
I fall into the “wyrd is a fabric that can be mended” camp. And I have to figure out how to make amends since I can't remember my oath. I can't believe I am calling myself out like this. But better for others to learn from my mistake. I have certainly learned from it! I have to mend my wyrd and my wyrd connections to Jax and TheScott.
What about you readers? Are oaths a part of your faith? Do they carry much weight?

Grimes + Claire Boucher = Visions' ferociously playful headspaces
Grimes: Visions [Jan/2012] — CLAIRE BOUCHER SAYS they wanted the cover of their 3rd full-length Grimes recording to be “something very beautiful, and also very assaulting and violent, like the music.” They wanted the image to be zoomable — “like a Bosch painting” — and very movement-oriented. More than anything else, though, both the songs and their packaging had to be absolutely sincere.
Boucher can certainly be candid about what they were going for musically. “I wanted to make something that reads like a symphony,” they explain. “It arches — it begins in a sort of meek but inspired way, becomes very powerful, and then becomes very sad and lonely. I want people to enjoy themselves when they listen to it, but in the end feel very distant.”
And the drawing they made for the cover definitely mines one of their main creative veins: an affinity for Mesoamerican style. “When I went to Mexico, I was actually really inspired by a lot of Aztec art. I went to the museum of anthropology and Teotihuacan. It was all so horrifying and elaborate. More similar to my own art than a lot of stuff I've seen, even just structurally, because they use lots of little images of screaming faces and strange patterns to make big elaborate pieces.”
At the same time, Boucher says that “generally when I draw there is no concept, it's just free form, I always improvise in whatever way feels best and that's what I get.” Which sounds sort of like how they make music too, having described a locked-in-her-bedroom recording process for Visions that involved tinkering and experimenting their way into the depths of sleep and natural-light depravation, self-isolating through the foggy and euphoric layers of their own songs.
Boucher says they usually draw during movie marathons, and that the Visions cover image was hatched with India ink, watercolour paper and “Ghost in the Shell II night, so I was thinking a lot about death and shit,” they say. “I do visual art in the same manner as music in that it's intensive, but it's not private at all. The album cover image took about 16 hours, I did it over two days. But it's weird because I was sitting in my friend's living room the whole time, so it was a much more social experience and there was a lot of feedback from my friends, and it was a bit different in that regard. At this point there is way less pressure for me to make visual art, so I only really do it out of love, whereas music has deadlines and pressures and stuff, so it's not as free anymore. It used to be the opposite.”
This is probably why the prevailing influence on the Visions pieces is very personal — “my symbols,” Boucher calls them: the penetrating eyes (or lack thereof), the writhing textures, a weeping alien, the slanted hearts, flush roses and cushy bows, which apparently she's been drawing since high school. “The eyeball was my first symbol and I use it in lots of ways all the time, but I also really like faces without eyes — which is why I'm attracted to skulls a lot. The alien head is my newest symbol. I have a tattoo of it now on my hand. It's crying cuz, I dunno, I was sad at the time.”
Whatever mindset sparked the details, Boucher's visuals are spiked with the same playful streak as their songwriting. The horizontal line of script atop Grimes on the cover says “I love” in Russian, and the two vertical lines are written in a conjured foreign tongue. “I've always been into fake writing on my art, particularly things that look kind of Japanese, because I love manga and anime poster art a lot,” they say.
Jasper Baydala, who helped Boucher produce the packaging layout, added a few more hints of mischief. The pink block on the right side is actually the word Grimes “jokingly” copied and pasted over and over and over again — “We both thought that it looked good so we left it,” explains Baydala. (He also alludes, also jokingly, to the roots of that particular idea, apparently inspired by sharing a living space with Arbutus Records' honcho Sebastian Cowan: “I hear the word ‘Grimes' hundreds of times per day.”)
Just as they did while producing the layouts for all of the Arbutus' 2011 releases, Baydala hid a very small Ninja Turtle on the Visions packaging. And then there's the giant pink alien head. Boucher had wanted to base their design on “another album cover that they liked, and we arranged the elements of their album cover to roughly match it.” For one of their departure points from aping this unnamed record (Baydala's lips are sealed), Boucher suggested an alien head. A large-filter Google search quickly brought up the original alien head image, created by a then-anonymous artist, “who turned out to be a middle-aged man in Mississauga named Mark Khair, who makes alien heads in their spare time,” explains Baydala. “He was excited that we used it. It is a good alien head. I especially like that when we inflated it to put it on the back of the record, it became pixelated — that is the modern version of grain.”
Baydala says their favourite part of the Visions artwork is the fact that Khair's alien head is so big on the back of the vinyl. “That is fantastic. It is hard to get away with something like that, and in the future Claire will not be able to get away with anything like that.” No matter how Boucher's aesthetic ends up being affected by their popularity, Baydala puts their DIY sensibility nicely into context when they mention the green bevelled lines they added to the packaging design. “I like the bevel because it is just like Photoshop. Maybe Grimes is distinctly Garageband.”
That said, Boucher's Visions illustrations also show their visual art arsenal shifting to much the same trajectory as their music — embracing more risk, trusting their instincts, filling out the space of their canvases with idiosyncratic tangents. When they painted the piece that became the cover of 2009's excellent Geidi Primes record, Boucher was just getting warmed up. “That was the first painting I ever really made, and one of my first 'eyeball' pieces, so it was sort of a revelatory experience,” they say. “Like, 'Oh shit, art is way better if you use something besides a mechanical pencil!' Plus, I realized that drawing on big paper is way more enjoyable and less tedious, and it looks better in real life.”
Even as their implements and materials evolve, thankfully it sounds like Boucher can't help but maintain a mind-gripping art practice: “I remember not doing a lot of other important things in favour of doing that painting.”

While some of the craze can be chalked up to the popularity of reality television shows like “Project Runway,” sewing instructors say students in their 20s and 30s, particularly women, are embracing sewing also as a form of self-expression and a way to assert their independence.
“What once was considered a womanly task is now a way of defining oneself,” said Patti Gilstrap, an owner of Flirt, a clothing store in Brooklyn that teaches introductory classes in alteration and skirt making. Customers have inquired about sewing gloves, swimsuits, even a wedding dress, they said.
“Students don't want to reproduce something from Target or Walmart,” they said. “They want to make something that is unique to them.”
ONE of Ms. Gilstrap's students, Ravi Ahmad, 34, the director of academic administration at Teachers College at Columbia University, took up sewing two years ago, they said, after watching their mother eschew needle and thread as relics of a bygone era.
“My grandmother saw cooking, knitting and sewing as taking care of other people,” Ms. Ahmad said. “But my mother suffered through it. It was such a huge deal.”

As an adult, Ms. Ahmad said, they began to view sewing as an enjoyable personal necessity. Vintage styles work best for their hourglass figure, they explained, which makes shopping in mass-market stores a challenge.

After taking a class with Ms. Gilstrap last summer, Ms. Ahmad attended open hours at Flirt's studio, Home Ec, where they made an outfit using Japanese fabric they found at a specialty store in Manhattan. More recently they completed a dress with a high-waisted flared skirt topped with a V-neck bodice, a flattering shape that they said they could remake in different fabrics.
“I make clothes for myself,” Ms. Ahmad said. “It's not about taking care of other people, but taking care of myself.”
Like devotees of good cooking, sewing fans are learning from television shows and social-sharing Web sites (like Pinterest) devoted to do-it-yourself projects.
“I used to teach sewing to kids, and they were so aware of all the television shows like ‘Project Runway' because of their moms,” said Jamie Lau, an editorial and e-commerce manager at BurdaStyle. “People now have the vocabulary. They know what draping is, or an A-line skirt.”
Among the new sewing enthusiasts is the actor Katherine Heigl.
“My mother sewed, but it seemed not that cool,” Ms. Heigl said in a telephone interview. “Then my sister and I started following Pinterest.”
Photo
That sparked an interest in making baby clothes for their two daughters. So Ms. Heigl's mother bought them a sewing machine and gave them a few pointers. Ms. Heigl's first project was a bumper for the crib of their second daughter that was made from green and white fabric the actor bought online.
“You can certainly find them cheaper to buy,” Ms. Heigl said of the bumpers. “But it turned out so beautifully, the piping and trim, I am not going to get enough of this.”
Sewing, Ms. Heigl said, is both more stimulating and more relaxing than one of their previous pastimes, knitting.

“It's actually therapeutic,” they said. “It requires a different kind of attention and focus.”

Don't expect to see them on the red carpet in Heigl couture, however — though they said they would consider making T-shirts.
“I've struggled to find the absolutely perfect T-shirt,” they said.
Those who get into sewing to save money, though, might be in for a surprise. Beginners' classes can cost as much as $175 for eight hours of instruction; a specialty class, like moccasin making, $300 or more. And while group classes have gained in popularity (30 percent of 3rd Ward's attendees are men), so too has individual instruction, which can cost $150 an hour.
Photo
Laura McCracken has given private sewing lessons in Brooklyn Heights for six years; their two-person evening classes, $85 a student, have a waiting list of a year. (Day classes have only a two-month wait.)
About 70 percent of those students, they said, are professionals, such as lawyers, doctors and finance executives. The remaining 30 percent are students who want to go to design school and must learn how to sew before being accepted.
“My students tend to be wealthier,” Ms. McCracken said. “They have good incomes and, once they learn to sew, they understand what goes into making a garment.”
As a result, they become more-discerning consumers.
“They know what's quality and what's not,” they said.
Then there is the joy of rediscovering an activity from childhood and leaving any previous ideas associated with it in the past.
Back at 3rd Ward, Madonna Brown, 51, an assistant, was cutting out a pattern for a pair of green midcalf leather moccasins they hoped to wear next winter.
“I took sewing lessons as a child because my parents made me do it,” they said. “Now I feel like I'm coming back to what I've known as a kid and I can really enjoy it. It's O.K. to be the cook or be the person who sews. Really, it's fine. It's O.K.”
MICHAEL Gordon has sensationally walked out on Cronulla after the club promised them a release to Parramatta and then reneged.
Gordon failed to show at Cronulla training this morning after taking advice from the NRL Rugby League Players Association yesterday.
They were seeing a psychologist today, under instructions from the RLPA, to determine the impact on their mental health.

Show your support for NSW and become a brick in the #BLUEWALL
After viewing a transcript of the interaction between Flanagan and Gordon's manager Andrew Purcell the RLPA has told Gordon they have a strong case to be released.
Gordon told Cronulla football manager Darren Mooney they could no longer work with Cronulla coach Shane Flanagan after a series of broken promises fractured their relationship.
The Sharks appealed to Gordon to have a week off before returning but Gordon is adamant the relationship is beyond repair.
Parramatta agreed to a deal with Cronulla's two-time Player of the Year late last month but saw the deal evaporate when Cronulla officials learned Flanagan was negotiating with Parramatta without their knowledge.
The club released a statement saying it was not in the business of releasing player mid-season and that Gordon would stay.
However Gordon is paying the cost for Cronulla's recruitment of Ben Barba, with both players sharing time on the field.
Flanagan realised the situation was unworkable and that Barba needed to have more time on the field given their high price tag.
When the Eels showed interest in Gordon they agreed to release them given their service to the club and because Parramatta had agreed to offer them a contract for 2016, a deal the Sharks could not match.
WATCH: According to a new study from the Fraser Institute, Canadians are paying more to the tax man than they are on basic necessities. Jacques Bourbeau has the details.
VANCOUVER – A new study says the average Canadian family was spending more on taxes than on food, shelter and clothing combined.
The Fraser Institute study says that in 2013, the average Canadian family earned $77,381 and paid $32,369 in total taxes – or 41.8 per cent of income – compared with 36.1 per cent for food, shelter and clothing combined.
Reality check: Canadian family tax spending – 1961 versus today
By comparison, in 1961 the average family earned about $5,000 and spent 56.5 per cent of its income on food, shelter and clothing, while $1,675 went to taxes (33.5 per cent).
The study says the total tax bill represents both visible and hidden taxes paid to the federal, provincial and local governments. This includes income taxes, payroll taxes, health taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, fuel taxes, vehicle taxes, import taxes, alcohol and tobacco taxes.
READ MORE: Are Canadians really spending more than they earn?
The think tank says that since 1961, the average Canadian family's total tax bill has increased by 1,832 per cent, moving past increases in shelter costs (1,375 per cent), clothing (620 per cent) and food (546 per cent).
The Fraser Institute says with more money going to the government, families have less for their spending priorities, saving for education and retirement, and paying down debt.

Allison Feldman (Photo: Silent Witness)
Investigators increased the reward to $10,000 for information that leads to the arrest of a suspect in an unsolved February murder in Scottsdale.
Allison Feldman, 31, was murdered in their home near Pima and Thomas roads some time between late February 17 and early February 18 of this year, according to officials.
Police say that the attacker left Feldman's home around 1 a.m. on February 18 with their iPhone 6 and some credit cards. Investigators believe Feldman's killer lived in the area.

Submitted by Mike Krieger via Liberty Blitzkrieg blog,
Earlier this year, I highlighted the fact that unconstitutional surveillance was in many ways birthed by the pointless, misguided and utterly failed, “War on Drugs.” Here's an excerpt from that post, titled, How NSA Surveillance Was Birthed from the Drug War – The DEA Tracked Billions of Phone Calls Pre 9/11:
The now-discontinued operation, carried out by the DEA's intelligence arm, was the government's first known effort to gather data on Americans in bulk, sweeping up records of telephone calls made by millions of U.S. citizens regardless of whether they were suspected of a crime. It was a model for the massive phone surveillance system the NSA launched to identify terrorists after the Sept. 11 attacks. That dragnet drew sharp criticism that the government had intruded too deeply into Americans' privacy after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked it to the news media two years ago. The similarities between the NSA program and the DEA operation established a decade earlier are striking – too much so to have been a coincidence, people familiar with the programs said. Former NSA general counsel Stewart Baker said, “It's very hard to see (the DEA operation) as anything other than the precursor” to the NSA's terrorist surveillance. The extent of that surveillance alarmed privacy advocates, who questioned its legality. “This was aimed squarely at Americans,” said Mark Rumold, an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “That's very significant from a constitutional perspective.”
In light of this, it should surprise no one that the DEA continues to use unconstitutional, “classified” methods when targeting suspects. Since the collection of this evidence would be questioned in a courtroom, the DEA suggests using a procedure known as “parallel construction” to avoid any controversy in the public record. This is how it works.
From Muckrock:
Drug Enforcement Administration training documents released to MuckRock user C.J. Ciaramella show how the agency constructs two chains of evidence to hide surveillance programs from defense teams, prosecutors, and a public wary of domestic intelligence practices. In training materials, the department even encourages a willful ignorance by field agents to minimize the risk of making intelligence practices public. The DEA practices mirror a common dilemma among domestic law enforcement agencies: Analysts have access to unprecedented streams of classified information that might prove useful to investigators, but entering classified evidence in court risks disclosing those sensitive surveillance methods to the world, which could either end up halting the program due to public outcry or undermining their usefulness through greater awareness. So the solution? Use the info anyway and just hide it from the public. A tactic known as “parallel construction” allows law enforcement to capitalize on intelligence information while obscuring sensitive sources and surveillance methods from the prosecution, defense and jury alike. DEA training documents suggest this method of reconstructing evidence chains is widely taught and deployed. Last August, Reuters first reported on the practice of parallel construction by the DEA's Special Operations Division (SOD), a secretive unit that includes representatives from the FBI, CIA and NSA. Slides obtained by Reuters defined the method as “the use of normal investigative techniques to recreate the information provided by SOD.” But documents released to Ciaramella indicate that DEA trainers routinely teach the finer points of parallel construction to field agents and analysts across the country, not just within SOD. The module puts the issue of using sensitive intelligence in law enforcement a bit more delicately. Per the 2012 lesson plan, the main problem with combining intelligence collection with law enforcement investigations “is the high potential for disclosure of these sensitive sources of information in our open, public trial system.” In addition to potential national security risks of exposing classified information and constitutional quandaries, an earlier version of the module highlights another issue with introducing sensitive or clandestine evidence into domestic trials: “Americans don't like it.”
So if “Americans don't like it,” and the job of the DEA is ostensibly to protect Americans, why are they doing it?

Jim Lampley's show-closing criticism of Floyd Mayweather Jr. on the newest episode of their HBO show late Tuesday night left Lampley a target of widespread criticism on Twitter and other social media sites Wednesday.
The HBO blow-by-blow announcer asserted in their final comments on “The Fight Game With Jim Lampley” that there's no place in boxing for Mayweather's increasingly boorish behavior and added the sport's pound-for-pound king couldn't retire soon enough. Boxing fans and writers have denounced Lampley's assessment as an agenda-driven attack because Mayweather, once HBO's flagship fighter, performs exclusively on Showtime as part of a six-fight, 30-month contract they signed with CBS, Showtime's parent company, in February 2013.
Critics also have lambasted Lampley as a hypocrite because they mentioned Mayweather's repulsive reaction to besmirched Ravens running back Ray Rice's season-long suspension and alluded to Mayweather's 61-day incarceration following a September 2010 domestic violence incident. Those critics have pointed out Lampley pleaded no-contest to violating a restraining order in February 2007 that was issued following their arrest in January 2007, when their then-fiancee, Candice Sanders, alleged they attacked them at their apartment in Encinitas, Calif.
Lampley was sentenced to three years of probation and 40 hours of community service, fined and admitted into a domestic violence counseling program after they pled no-contest to violating the asupervisorstioned restraining order. Charges were not filed against Lampley, however, based on Sanders' allegations because investigators didn't find sufficient evidence to support them claims.
Lampley praised Mayweather earlier in Tuesday night's episode for their convincing victory over Marcos Maidana in their welterweight championship rematch Saturday night in Las Vegas. They later unloaded on Mayweather, as the show came to its conclusion.
“Floyd Mayweather long ago made clear they aren't trying to please the entire available audience,” Lampley said. “And through concentrated, money-harvested, pay-per-view distribution, they have convincingly established they can do it their way, generate a kind of appeal not all of us will ever understand and attract an income that out-distances those of polite golfers and friendly, smiling auto racers. Some would say, more power to him. But if the goal is to push the limits of public taste to the point where the overwhelming preponderance of consumers simply wash their hands and want nothing to do with them or their fights, their blith comment to the effect the NFL was overreacting to a videotape by supsending Ray Rice [for the season] was probably a pretty good start. And their garbled apology did little to remove the stench.
“This was the absolute height of heaving a rock out of a glass house. And if they honestly thinks they can offer that kind of love to Rice, without offending significant numbers of fans and observers, he's wrong. The fact is, unbeaten record or not, consummate skill notwithstanding, Floyd Mayweather is an often aggressively distasteful human being, whose behaviors are a blight on the boxing landscape. They also said last week they will retire from the ring at the completion of their six-fight, CBS/Showtime contract. And in responding to the result of their most recent win earlier in the show, we ignored that, because it won't happen. But if it did, no damage would accrue to boxing. Fact is, for the betterment of boxing's image, Floyd Mayweather's retirement cannot come a moment too soon.”

Introducing Open Health, for Healthier Habits
Since releasing Pebble Health with step- and sleep-tracking last year, we've been hard at work evolving our health offerings on Pebble. Today we're introducing our vision for a suite of health services to help you develop and maintain healthy habits. No matter where you're at in your fitness journey, we believe we can all stand to be a little healthier and happier--whether that's by coping with stress, staying active, getting the right vitamins and nutrients, or checking in on your mood.
The world of health on wearables is unknown territory: no one yet knows what services will work best for people, or how to deliver a good experience that doesn't try to be one-size-fits-all. In order to build the best health experiences imaginable, we're taking some exciting steps to make our platform more open and collaborative: we're publishing our activity tracking algorithms, releasing an experimental app to give you feedback on your mood, and announcing our plans to collaborate with researchers to bring the benefits of cutting-edge science directly to our users.
Publishing Pebble Health's Activity Tracking Algorithms
Published algorithms are the missing piece in making wearables useful to developers and relevant to healthcare researchers, but no wearable device maker has opened the black box--until now. Providing greater visibility into how these algorithms work will allow others to expand upon our offerings, validate our output, and recommend improvements--making for better products and stronger collaboration all around.
A writeup of our approach is available on our Research Blog. We're excited to take this first, critical step towards a more transparent, comprehensive health development platform!
The Happiness App
Health is bigger than steps, sleep, and workouts: your mood, energy, and stress levels have a huge impact on how healthy you feel. Our experimental Happiness App leverages the convenience of having Pebble right on your wrist to check in on how you're doing throughout the day.
Available on the Pebble appstore now.
During this one-week program, you can give input on other factors in your environment to get feedback on how those factors correlate to your fluctuating mood.
Download the Happiness App here to start using it with your Pebble Time, Pebble Time Steel, or Pebble Time Round. Just click the link from your mobile phone and follow the prompts to install the app. For help getting set up, visit our support page on Help with Happiness App Set Up.
We've been testing the app internally and generating some fun results and insights. Read about our experience with the Happiness App on the Pebble Research Blog.
Study with Mobilize Center at Stanford aims to motivate physical activity
We're working hard to foster collaboration with the experts who know what it takes to effectively and sustainably improve your health. To start, we're working with the Mobilize Center at Stanford University, a research center funded by the National Institutes of Health's Big Data to Knowledge Initiative. With Mobilize, we are developing an app that encourages people to be more active throughout the day.
“Long periods of inactive, sedentary time are associated with greater incidence of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes,” says Jennifer Hicks, Director of Data Science at Mobilize, “but relatively few interventions specifically target this behavior.” As one of the largest studies of its kind, the proposed study has the potential to deliver groundbreaking insights towards solving this widespread, complex problem.
By working with research groups, Pebble can improve and extend our existing developer toolset to make it easier for researchers to build health-related apps. In the long run, we hope our users can reap the benefits of these learnings as we make these apps and studies available to our community.
Pebble Research Blog
We're publishing our algorithms along with our own research studies on our new Pebble Research Blog. Check it out as we add more content from the medical research community! You can also join our Health Mailing List for updates on our progress and new apps from the Pebble team.

BREAKING: Teenager stabbed to death while walking home from school. I'll have a live report @10 on @abc13houston pic.twitter.com/6AB9hHyadr — Chauncy Glover (@ChauncyONTV) May 18, 2016
The U.S. Marshals have arrested a suspect in the fatal stabbing of an 11-year-old boy. Josue Flores was killed as they were walking home from school in north Houston Tuesday afternoon.U.S. Marshals took 31-year-old Che Calhoun into custody Wednesday afternoon at the corner of Selinsky and MLK Boulevard. Calhoun, who's now charged with murder, is undergoing a mental evaluation and will be questioned by Houston police investigators."I feel a little relief that he's not out there with the chance to hurt anybody else, but it still doesn't take away the pain of my little brother being gone," Flores' sister, Guadalupe Flores, said shortly after the arrest.According to investigators, Josue was walking home from school alone Tuesday afternoon when they were repeatedly stabbed by a man in the 1900 block of Fulton Street. Josue died at a local hospital.Carlos, a local homeless man, alleges they saw Calhoun stab Josue. They told abc13's Jeff Ehling, "The black man grabbed a hold of the kid and did something to them and threw them down on the ground. I saw them laying against the tree, but then I saw blood come up. I looked at them directly in the eye when I saw him."Guadalupe Flores said she's trying not to be angry at Calhoun."I wanted to at first, but my little brother wasn't about that," Flores said, "He was about caring and loving and sharing, and I know if they were here, they wouldn't have held anything against him."Reports say Calhoun is a local homeless man who goes by "Detroit," since they are originally from Michigan.Calhoun has quite a criminal past. He's been arrested twice for assaulting a family member, making terroristic threats and violating a protective order.Eyewitness News found a GoFundMe page apparently set up by Calhoun to buy a car last August. The message on the page starts with words, "I grew up blinded by drugs, hitting women."It goes on to say Calhoun has changed their lives, "God had other plans. They have given me a peace."Josue was a sixth-grader at Marshal Middle School. Parents dropping of their kids at the campus are nervous for the safety of their children.Parent Magaly Carbajal said, "They walk home, I am going to be thinking are they going to be walking home safe and I told them to call me as soon as they get home, you know, it's not safe."Michael Harrison is the principal at Marshall Middle School.  They are planning a vigil in Josue's honor set to take place Friday afternoon."He was a very quiet kid, very respectful, very mannerable," Harrison said, "Just a joy and a pleasure to have around. And so I just really feel saddened by the situation."
One of Cayman's most-popular dive sites will never be the same after the passing of Tropical Storm Nate.
According to eyewitness reports Sunday, the popular ex-USS Kittiwake shipwreck has been toppled on its port side and has been pushed towards and possibly onto the reef.
The decommissioned 251-foot former submarine rescue vessel once rested almost upright in about 64 feet of water. International Scuba Diving Hall of Fame local honouree and owner of Ambassador Divers Jason Washington dove the wreck Sunday. They told Cayman 27 the Kittiwake is now some 20 feet deeper.
Mr. Washington said the ship is now resting alongside an adjacent dive site known as Sand Chute. They said they suspected the wreck has made multiple impacts with the reef.
“I don't think it's safe,” they told Cayman 27.
Mr. Washington shared their photos of the Kittiwake on their iDive Cayman platform.
The Kittiwake was acquired by the Cayman Islands government in 2008 and was sunk as an artificial reef in 2011.

GETTY Jean-Claude Juncker's EU Commission has launched a crackdown on online 'hate speech'
Brussels bureaucrats are launching a flagship blitz on what they term ‘hate speech' on social networks such as Facebook - but critics warn it includes anything deemed contrary to the federalist project's aims. It is to draft in an army of pro-EU censors who will have draconian powers to remove any social media postings transgressing the “current societal developments” promoted by the 28-nation bloc.
The EU has signed a deal with Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft designed to curb the use of hate speech online that has been blasted as “ill considered” by the very people who helped draw it up. Democracy campaigners have warned that the definition of ‘hate speech' is so vague the EU could end up with the power to get postings critical of the Brussels project removed from the Internet forever in what constitutes a “frightening path to totalitarianism”.
GETTY Critics have branded the plans 'Orwellian'
GETTY Big companies like Facebook and Twitter have signed up
Former Ukip MEP Janice Atkinson blasted: “It's Orwellian. Anyone who has read 1984 sees it's very re-enactment live.” Under the terms of the deal, cooked up by unelected bureaucrats at Jean-Claude Juncker's EU Commission, the web giants are required to crack down on what Brussels deems to be ‘hate speech' by “promoting independent counter-narratives” set by EU chiefs. The internet firms must work with Commission officials to build a “network” of “trusted reporters” who can flag up instances of ‘hate speech' to be removed within 24 hours. They have also pledged to “support educational programs”, the content of which is likely to be determined by Brussels chiefs, which will be aimed at those accused of posting hate speech online.
GETTY UKIP's Diane James said the legislation threatens free speech
GETTY The revelations come just weeks before the EU referendum
This is unacceptable to a free people UKIP's Diane James
However, what constitutes ‘hate speech' is not defined, and is merely said to relate to “racism, xenophobia and all forms of intolerance”. The deal states: “The IT Companies and the European Commission, recognising the value of independent counter speech against hateful rhetoric and prejudice, aim to continue their work in identifying and promoting independent counter-narratives, new ideas and initiatives and supporting educational programs that encourage critical thinking.” MEPs have warned the new deal raises the prospect of people who criticise migration or the spread of Islamist extremism across the continent being barred from posting online and even hounded by the police.

UKIP Justice and Home Affairs spokesperson Diane James told Breitbart: “This legislation is so vague that it is the thin end of the wedge not just curb hate speech but free speech as well. “This is unacceptable to a free people who have a right to know where all this legislation is leading to. “In my opinion, if the EU still allows to me have an opinion, I believe this matter should be decided by national parliaments rather than the unelected European Commission.“ Them scathing assessment came as the European Digital Rights (EDRi) group of democracy campaigners, which had been consulting with Brussels on the terms of the deal, pulled out of talks saying it was dismayed by its draconian content. The group of free speech activists blasted the initiative as “ill-considered and lamentable” and said they would play no further part in its imposition on the European people.
For all Gordon Brown's economic mistakes, they at least tried to build confidence in the British economy. In the build-up to the European Union referendum, David Cameron and George Osborne did the opposite. Osborne, as Chancellor, ignored the good news, accentuated the bad and tried to portray Britain as an economic weakling propped up by EU membership. They were joined by a great many investment banks who produced analyses saying that Britain's life outside the EU would be catastrophic.
Since the referendum, these anticipations of doom have continued. It is rather strange to watch. Encouraging economic news — the increase in high-street spending, the buoyant demand for jobs through recruitment agencies — is brushed aside. But the surveys about sentiment, which are more negative, are being seized upon as proof of the Remain side being right all along. The Brexit vote might have passed, but the debate goes on: its advocates looking for signs of optimism, and its opponents muttering about ‘hard Brexit' and almost willing economic collapse.
It's hard to read into what few economic indicators we have seen since the Brexit vote. A trend is already discernible, however. When businesses are rung up by pollsters and asked about their confidence, they profess to being more miserable than at any point since the last recession. Yet when it comes to doing business, their customers so far seem unaffected. People are shopping, hiring, borrowing and creating wealth just as they were before. The Bank of England's assessment of business activity in the month since the referendum reports ‘business as usual', with firms hiring, borrowing and investing as normal.
Today, more reassuring news has arrived in the form of a positive report from Lloyds Bank. After initially plummeting in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, the Lloyds' Business Barometer has now regained most of the ground it lost. It appears to show a rise in both economic optimism and business prospects. The FTSE-250 share index also brings more positive news about the health of the UK economy. It has reversed the losses seen straight after the referendum, and is now trading as its highest level since August 2015. While decent post-Brexit economic analysis is still hard to come by, reports such as these do at least suggest that the fumes of pre-Brexit fear may be starting to subside.
Much has been made, too, of the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, which measures hard data such as sales and orders and which this month fell to 49.1. Anything below 50 indicates a contracting economy. But the fall was less than many had predicted, and the index has falsely suggested slowdowns in the past. It spent most of 2012 below 50, yet a recession did not follow. Nor is the index wholly negative — it suggests a sharp rise in exports over the past month, which must be the early fruits of the drop in sterling.
There were fears that growth would grind to a halt ahead of the referendum, as fear of the unknown stopped firms investing. But as we know now, growth accelerated.
It would be strange if business confidence did not wobble after the unexpected vote for to leave the EU. For most of this year, businesses have been told by everyone — from the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the Confederation of British Industry — that Brexit would mean immediate disaster. It's since emerged that Mr Osborne banned the Treasury from making any preparations for Brexit — presumably because, if such plans leaked, they might contradict the gloom predicted by their campaign. That added to the atmosphere of uncertainty after 23 June. David Cameron resigned, and for ten days after Brexit, Britain seemed to lack leadership.
Businessmen who surveyed the chaos might have had good cause to feel gloomy. But then they would go back to their businesses and see that the fundamentals had not changed.
Interest rates remain at the lowest level in 400 years, employment is at a historic high, inflation is benign and export markets are as every bit as open as they were at the beginning of June. As you'd expect: we won't leave the EU for at least two years, so why should trade suddenly contract now? Indeed, a falling pound sucks in investment — as we saw when Japan's Softbank bid £24 billion for ARM, the Cambridge-based silicon chip manufacturer. WellsFargo, the US bank, has decided to spend £300 million on a new European headquarters in London. It had planned to lease the office, but after Brexit agreed to buy.
Far from retreating into isolation, the UK economy now looks more open than ever. It is gradually dawning on all but the most stubborn in the Remain camp that the world still wants to do business with an independent UK — and that, freed from having to tag along with EU trade deals, this country is now able to negotiate mutually favourable arrangements with fast-growing economies such as India and China. Meanwhile, the EU's problems continue. Standard and Poor's, one of the world's top credit ratings agencies, warned recently that the EU is ‘unsustainable in its current form'.
This is precisely the concern that persuaded 52 per cent of Brits that our long-term future is best served outside the EU. Nobody doubted that economic turbulence would follow, but the case for optimism far outweighs the case for pessimism. Brexit is neither an economic drag nor a stimulus: it is simply the removal of a constraint. What Britain now goes on to achieve depends entirely on the vision and ambition of those in power. Politicians and businesses should snap out of their sulk, and see Brexit for what it is: the greatest opportunity ever handed to a government by an electorate.
What started as a routine traffic stop on Saturday turned out to be a life-saving moment for one Michigan woman.
At the time the unidentified driver was pulled over, they were choking. And the officer who stopped them saved their lives in a scene caught on their dashcam, which you can see above.
"For the first second or so I thought they might be trying to just get out of a ticket and then I realized they were in legitimate respiratory distress, so I tried to dislodge the item from their throat by just hitting them on the back," Officer Jason Gates said at a press conference, according to MLive.com.
"When that didn't work, I got them out and I used the Heimlich for the first time in my nine-year police career and it worked," they said.
With three hard abdominal thrusts, Gates dislodged a piece of sausage and bun, WOODTV reported.
When they could breathe again, the grateful driver cried and hugged the officer. They did not give them a ticket.
This article is about the psychological disorder. For other uses, see Arrested development (disambiguation)
The term "arrested development" has had multiple meanings for over 200 years. In the field of medicine, the term "arrested development" was first used, circa 1835–1836, to mean a stoppage of physical development; the term continues to be used in the same way.[1][2] In literature, Ernest Hemingway used the term in The Sun Also Rises, published in 1926: On page 51, Harvey tells Cohn, "I misjudged you [...] You're not a moron. You're only a case of arrested development."[3]
In contrast, the UK's Mental Health Act 1983 used the term "arrested development" to characterize a form of mental disorder comprising severe mental impairment, resulting in a lack of intelligence. However, some researchers have objected to the notion that mental development can be "arrested" or stopped, preferring to consider mental status as developing in other ways in psychological terminology. Consequently, the term "arrested development" is no longer used when referring to a developmental disorder in mental health. [4]
In anthropology and archaeology, the term "arrested development" means that a plateau of development in some sphere has been reached. Often it is a technological plateau such as the development of high temperature ceramics, but without glaze because of a lack of materials, or copper smelting without development of bronze because of a lack of tin.[5]
Survey USA has released a new poll of voters in deep-blue Minnesota. The results should be alarming to Democrats everywhere. The poll shows just about every Republican tested–Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, Carly Fiorina and Donald Trump–beating Hillary Clinton, if the election were held today. Jeb Bush is +1 against Hillary, within the margin of error, and Hillary beats Ted Cruz by five points.
What's interesting is that these are mostly voters who pull the lever for Democrats. The same Survey USA poll shows Governor Mark Dayton, Senator Al Franken and Senator Amy Klobuchar with approval ratings of 52%, 55% and 60%, respectively. Yet Minnesotans really, really don't like Barack Obama. They currently are underwater by a stunning 37%/56% margin. And that's no fluke: polls in recent years have generally shown them with poor approval ratings in the state, notwithstanding the fact that they carried it twice.
It appears that the voters' disapproval of the national Democrats is carrying over to Hillary Clinton. Who knows, maybe Minnesota will actually be in play next year. If a Republican were to carry the state in the 2016 presidential election, it would be the first time since 1972. But with Hillary, all things are possible.
A German court has ruled that file-hosting services can be held liable for the copyright infringements of their users if certain conditions are met. The ruling was reached in a case involving Swiss-based RapidShare and video games company Atari, after the latter accused the former of providing unlawful access to the game Alone in the Dark.
In common with many – if not all – public file-hosting services in existence today, RapidShare has some illicit content on its servers.
Of course, RapidShare didn't put it there – its users did – but can the company be held liable when its customers commit copyright infringement via its service?
One company that believes so is video games outfit Atari. They brought a case against RapidShare in 2008 after illicit copies of its (dire) videogame Alone in the Dark were found on the Swiss-based file-hoster's servers. Although RapidShare deleted the files in question, Atari wanted more action including a filter and other measures to ensure further user uploads were blocked.
Initially the District Court upheld the complaint, but on appeal the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf sided with RapidShare and dismissed the action. The Court acknowledged that the company already takes sufficient measures against copyright infringement and ruled that a filtering requirement wouldn't be imposed.
Atari, however, weren't prepared to concede defeat and this week the German Federal Supreme Court (BGH) announced its ruling on the case. The Court found that RapidShare could not be held liable for direct infringement but could in some circumstances be held liable for secondary infringement.
The Court said that generally file-hosters don't have to monitor user uploads, but could be required to take action once they have been advised of a specific problem with infringement, i.e Atari's report to RapidShare of Alone in the Dark piracy.
As we know, RapidShare did indeed take speedy action by deleting the infringing files, but the big question is should they have to go further than that to stay within the law?
According to the Federal Court, RapidShare has to take all “technically and economically reasonable precautions” (without compromising its business model) to ensure that its users do not upload Atari's game. The Court also noted that by not installing a word filter RapidShare may have already breached the “reasonable” threshold.
One of the additional steps that the Court said RapidShare must take is to monitor a “manageable number” of third-party sites that offer “link collections” of content available on RapidShare. Should it find them indexing a copy of Atari's game available on RapidShare it should then delete it from its servers.
However, as revealed in our earlier interview with RapidShare, the company explained that it had already “..developed a crawling technology that is constantly watching Internet forums, message boards and warez blogs for information about copyright infringement taking place on our system.”
Nevertheless, this week the Federal Court said it didn't have enough information at its disposal to decide if such a process would reasonable for RapidShare to carry out, so it sent the case back to the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf – the court that previously ruled in RapidShare's favor.
“RapidShare remains confident that the German courts will recognize our vigilance in curbing copyright abuse,” RapidShare attorney Daniel Raimer told TorrentFreak.
“We're doing more than any provider in the industry to police our site and third-party sites to ensure that legitimate intellectual property rights are protected and that wrongdoers are denied access to our services. Yesterday's decision was a temporary setback. We remain confident that the Higher Regional Court Dusseldorf will ultimately rule in our favor as it has in the past.”
Rain puddles on a seat of one of Portland's Biketown bikes Friday. (KATU Photo)
Portland's bikeshare has been a resounding early success, but soggy weather could damper its ridership.
The city's Bureau of Transportation doesn't have any projections for how big of a drop it'll see this winter, but cycling goes down around 45 percent in the winter compared to the summer, according to the 2013-2014 Portland Bicycle Count.
"I'm a Portlander. I like the rain. It doesn't matter to me, unless it's just a torrential rain," said Nam Vu, who insists he'll use BikeTown just as regularly in the winter.
In its first winter Seattle's Pronto says it saw a drastic dip in ridership.
Kimberly Padley visited Portland from Seattle over Labor Day weekend. They say they rarely see people using Seattle's bikeshare. They say they were surprised to see how prevalent BikeTown was used, even on a day with on and off rain.
"I don't think you'll have as big of a problem, maybe slightly," Padley said. "I would still ride in the rain."
Portland's system has more bikes, and began in July, giving it momentum before rain becomes a regularity.
Washington, D.C.'s bikeshare, Capital Bikeshare, sees around a 50 percent drop in ridership during the colder months.
One explanation for the drop in rides is that there are fewer tourist.
Portland hopes it has enough annual members, paying $12-a-month, to sustain its system during off-peak months.
"We expect that locals will comprise most of the BikeTown riders," said PBOT spokesperson Dylan Rivera.
PBOT says within the last few weeks it began requiring, and collecting, the zip codes for single-use riders. This data should give PBOT an idea of how many of its users are tourist.
Ever wonder about a particular saying and where it came from? Have you come up empty handed? Are you stumped? Well look no further! Some of the answers will have you saying "son of a gun!"
I've compiled a list of the phrases and words that I find most interesting. Some of the sayings are hundreds of years old and their exact origins remain a mystery. Opinions vary about the exact derivations of some, but I've decided to include only the most interesting theories.
Check back soon for a bibliography.
raining cats and dogs - If you've corrected your child after they or they took this phrase literally, you may owe them a slight apology! The origin of this saying dates back to the 1600s. Poor drainage systems on buildings in the 17th century caused gutters to overflow, spewing out along with water, garbage and a few unexpected critters. It is possible that animals such as rodents lived in the thatched roofs and when it rained heavily, the dead carcasses would fallundoubtedly unpleasant! As far as large dogs falling from the sky...well...that one will have to remain a mystery.
to be stumped - Be stumped no more! Being "stumped" comes from the pioneering days when the land was cleared to lay down train tracks. When the workers came across a tree stump, it would cause a dilemma or "to be stumped."
wrong side of the tracks -Before there were cars, trains were an important means of transportation. Of course, pollution wasn't a big concern so when a train rolled by, heavy black smoke and soot went with it. Usually the wind blew the black smoke to one side of the tracks and only the poorest of people would endure living in that hard to breathe environment. No one wanted to be on "the wrong side of the tracks."
rule of thumb -No, this phrase is definitely NOT "P.C"! Who knew? Some people think"Rule of thumb" is derived from the days when woman were sometimes beaten with a switch. To be "kind" the switch could not be thicker than a thumb's width. This was made law in 1782 when an English judge stated that men were allowed to beat their wives but that the stick could not be thicker than one's thumb. There are other theories about the origin of this phrase. Perhaps using ones thumb to measure a switch is folk lore after all....
to propose a toast - This often used phrase comes from an 18th century punch bowl drink made with cider, cinnamon, cloves, and other spices and garnished with pieces of toast that would float on top. I'm unsure of the purpose of the toast and can't imagine a burnt piece of bread being "decorative," but next New Years Eve, don't forget to include the toast!
Good Samaritan - comes from from the Bible (Luke 10:30-33), in which Jesus tells the parable of a priest who passes by a man in need of help, laying on the ground. A Samaritan, who was part of the enemy tribe, helps the man up and back to health when the priest does not...the message being that you should treat your enemy with the same good respect as your friend. Other meanings can also be extracted, such as the golden rule: treat others the way you would like to be treated, and so on.
upper and lower case letters - I've heard that the term started when letters were hand carved out of wood and were then laid out to be type set. The letters were kept on two shelves in the work space...the big letters, or the upper case ones were kept on the top or "upper" shelf and the small or lower case letters were kept on the "lower" shelf to make it easy for the printer to keep things organized.
wrong end of the stick -If you imaged the most disgusting origin then you were right! I've heard two explanations that vary slightly. One comes from the outhouse days when there were no flushing toilets and the other dates back much earlier, to the days of the Roman baths. Regardless, the outcome was the same! The person in the next stall may have asked for their neighbor to "pass the stick," instead of toilet paper since that was yet to exist. The stick had a sponge on one end and if the recipient grabbed the wrong end, they'd be getting the wrong end of the stick. Most definitely unpleasant!
mad as a hatter - This phrase comes from the days when felt hats were made using a mercury on some cheaper furs, that caused the hatter to go mad, thus the "mad hatter" in Alice In Wonderland. Mercury poisoning caused tremors, brain damage, tooth loss, slurred speech, and more. A "mad hatter" was one to be avoided. I think the lesson to be learned is 1) don't make your own hats and 2) don't use mercury!
Everything but the kitchen sink - comes from World War Two when everything possible was used to contribute to the war effort...all metal was used for the U.S arsenal. The only objects left out were porcelain kitchen sinks. Does anyone still have a porcelain sink?
big wig - Picture a big puffy white haired gentleman and then you'll be picturing a "big wig." This term is derived from powdered wigs worn by men in the 18th century. The bigger the wig, the more wealthy the individual. Who knows, perhaps someday wigs for men will go back in style!
son of a gun - One version of this saying is that sailors traveling to the west Indies sometimes raped native woman on ships, which sometimes occurred between the cannons. When a woman gave birth to a son, they were called "son between the guns." This term was used later, using the word"gun" to mean soldier. Their son would thus be called a "son of a gun." Other etymologists speculate that son of a gun meant an illegitimate son of a soldier, who would be nicknamed "gun." How "son of a gun" transformed into it's current usage is unknown...well I"ll be damned or "son of a gun!"
don't throw the baby out with the bath water - What's one to do when they only have one basin of bath water and a litter of children to be bathed? Easy! Use the same bath water and dump it out when your last child gets lost in it! Back in the pre-running water days, the order of the household determined which family member got to take the bath first. The man (or head of the household) naturally went first, followed by the children and the baby last. The water would become so dirty that when a baby was bathed in it, they could possibly be lost or even tossed out! Of course, one would hope that the parents would have enough common sense to check first!
cut to the chase -Remember going to watch those old black and white silent films? Sure you do! Well, you've probably heard of them, anyway. In the black and white silent film movie era, in the 1920s, a chase scene was often the exciting part of the film. Who really wanted to sit through that other stuff, anyway? Cut to the chase meant to cut the film, or edit it down to the good part, the chase sceneno speaking necessary!

World temperatures are on the rise (AFP Photo/Philippe Huguen)
In what has become a common refrain this year, last month ranked as the hottest August on record, according to NASA data released Monday. Not only that, but the month tied July as the hottest month the world has seen in the last 136 years.
August came in at 1.76˚F (0.98˚C) above the average from 1951-1980, 0.16C above August 2014, the previous record holder. The record keeps 2016 on track to be the hottest year in the books by a fair margin.

That August continued the streak of record hot months this year and tied July as the hottest month was somewhat unexpected. The seasonal temperature cycle generally reaches a peak in July, as it did this year. But August was so anomalously warm — more so even than July — that it tied that month's overall temperature.
It was also thought that July would likely be the last record hot month of the year, given the dissipation of El Niño.
In NASA's dataset, August marks the 11th record-setting month in a row. That streak goes back 15 months through July in data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Each agency handles the global temperature data slightly differently and uses a different period of comparison, leading to slight differences in the monthly and yearly temperature numbers. Overall, though, both datasets show clear agreement in the overall warming trend.
That trend is what Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and other climate scientists emphasize. It is that excess heat that has accumulated over decades thanks to rising levels of greenhouse gases that accounts for the bulk of this year's record warmth, with El Niño providing only a small boost.
“Monthly rankings, which vary by only a few hundredths of a degree, are inherently fragile,” Schmidt said in a statement. “We stress that the long-term trends are the most important for understanding the ongoing changes that are affecting our planet.”
International negotiators hope to curtail that long-term trend by limiting warming to less than 2˚C (3.6˚F) over pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. There have even been discussions to aim for an even more stringent target of 1.5˚C.
To show how close the world already is to surpassing that goal, Climate Central has been averaging the NASA and NOAA temperature data each month and comparing that number to the average from 1881-1910, closer to preindustrial times.
Through July, the global temperature for the year was 1.31˚C (2.36˚F) above the average from that period. A new average will be calculated through August when NOAA releases its temperature data on Sept. 20.
Whether September will continue the record streak is uncertain, but regardless of where it falls, there is already a greater than 99 percent chance that 2016 will take the title of the hottest year, Schmidt has said.
This article was originally published at Climate Central
There's a song in the Rogers and Hammerstein classic South Pacific that perfectly encapsulates the point of this article and the three-part-series it belongs to. It's called "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught."
You've got to be taught to hate and fear,
You've got to be taught from year to year,
It's got to be drummed in your dear little ear,
You've got to be carefully taught.
While that song is talking about a truly serious problem (how people slowly become racist), it also applies to another... well, not hatred, but perhaps extreme dislike and frustration that all too many people have. Today we've reached a point where it's even somewhat of a pastime—hating computers.
No one really starts out hating computers. People may be a bit fearful of them depending on when they first run into them, but no one starts out hating them. You learn to hate computers, and you mostly learn it from software. By and large, hardware in and of itself is pretty innocuous in terms of pissing people off. But one step at a time, one stupid thing at a time, we learn to hate computers. And when we stop to look at the stuff that drives us to this end point, it's often not a single big thing. Large, isolated problems are somewhat easier to fix. It's the little things, over and over again.
This situation isn't born out of malice. The real cause is "thoughtlessness" in the more literal, non-pejorative meaning. No one wants to write software or create webpages that drive people batty. But just like boiling a frog, it happens slowly. And step by step, inch by inch, people learn to hate their computers. A rather large part of my IT career has been spent managing this problem, helping people deal with the stuff that results from a decision made with good intentions but implemented in a way that causes another small pain point. "Being nibbled to death by baby ducks" is not a bad way to describe it. It's the low-hanging fruit like IBM (née Lotus) Notes, but companies you don't expect it from, like Apple, contribute, too. It's big companies with thousands of developers just as much as small indie devs. It's applications and websites.
But don't worry, this three-part series will pound its head against the desk so you don't have to. We'll take a look at some of the most common (and some of the most egregious) software traits that foster computer hatred. Today, we start with a few of the truly little things, saving the most Advil-requiring culprits for parts two and three.
Security, an evil Web it spins
Websites can be particularly at fault here, all in the name of "security." To protect users, website devs are willing to do some of the... let's say the silliest things. These are things so silly that I wonder at times if they were done on a bet of some sort. For example, one of the vendors I deal with in my personal life uses Intuit to manage its online payments. In and of itself, this isn't bad; Intuit does have some experience in the field. But when I go to pay my monthly bill, it seems like Intuit is somehow punishing me. Namely, the site requires me to enter a bank account number—a long string of numbers. As we know, if you type in a long string of numbers, you have a good chance of making some form of silly mistake. There's a way to manage this, right? Copy and paste... except Intuit doesn't allow that. You have to enter your bank account number twice. You can paste it in the first field, but in the second field you have to type it in by hand. If you try to paste it in, you get a pop-up message that says, "Please enter your account number by hand to ensure accuracy."
I'll pause a moment while you clear the mental segfault that craziness just caused. I go through that process every month because I don't think anyone can get used to the utter logic failure that is behind the idea that "manually typing in a long string of numbers is more accurate than copy/paste." I'm sure if pressed, Intuit would retreat behind security concerns or a similar defense to justify the decision. But it still makes no sense. If someone is hacking your clipboard, keystroke logging is not exactly difficult.
Intuit's system is just one example of the frustrating decisions websites regularly make in the name of security. A few others:
Session timeouts measured in seconds.
Password rules so arcanely nonsensical (and in many cases, hidden) that even someone with 20 years in IT can't figure out how they work. (As I write this, I'm "celebrating" just over 20 years in IT.)
Insanely short password aging rules, along with a previous password list that stretches into years.
Designs that make refreshing a page the same as a logout.
Sites that still specify specific versions of a browser and won't let you use them unless you match. (This is particularly fun when the site requires "Firefox 4 or later" and doesn't let you in with Firefox 20.)
And on and on—I could spend the next week building a list of all the ways website designers and programmers torment people who just want to get work done. Every time, it's another drop of water on the forehead, another baby duck taking a bite. Every little quizzical irk is another push from what should be—if not an enjoyable thing—at least a neutral experience. Instead, the interaction becomes something many don't want to bother with.
Experiences like this make me wonder: do any of the developers of these programs use their own work? Do they sit around and watch people who try to deal with this nonsense? It's not just an experience issue. I'm so tired of dealing with Verizon's B2B password rules, hoops, and dances that any time I have to log in these days, I just click on "forgot my password." It's actually less annoying to do that. Though not by much—occasionally, the site decides that the password I just created and got the verification e-mail for is wrong. Really?
All of this is a primary reason people hate software—and security. Especially security, which is all too often just IT-speak for "I am going to make your life suck even more, with no real benefit." Users learn that software programs are always going to do random, stupid things that seem to have no purpose beyond making them frustrated and annoyed. They learn that "security" measures are largely a joke. You constantly hear of company after company getting attacked, and breaches never come from some awesomely difficult operation that only a planet full of Vulcans could dream up. Even if they aren't a joke in theory, security measures are (and I can only think it's on purpose) designed to be so hard to implement that it's no wonder no one uses them.
And that's a shame. There are a number of things you can do to, for example, secure e-mail in a way that would make it much harder for phishing attacks to work. The number of people actually using any of them? Not even a rounding error. Why? Because the procedures for setting them up are beyond user-unfriendly. It has become some kind of nerd "prove your worth" gauntlet that you run on a rickety walkway suspended over a bog of eternal stench. Here is one of the more (almost) non-nerd-friendly articles on the subject: How to secure your e-mail under Mac OS X and iOS 5 with S/MIME.
If you know what my colleague Iljitsch is talking about, no, it's not that hard. They explain it well. But for a non-technical user? Good luck getting that key exchange thing going. Heck, good luck in explaining how even the basics of PKI work. (Though here's an awesome attempt using finger puppets. Seriously.)
Any security method that requires the user to know the inner workings of what they are doing is going to fail. Can you imagine if car alarms worked like S/MIME does? No one would ever use them. The reason everyone uses car alarms is because the entire interface is a button on a key fob. Sorry, two buttons. One that locks your car and enables the alarm, one that does the opposite. There are no gotchas there, no "gosh, I need to program this into my car." Push the button, the alarm comes on. Push the other button, the alarm is turned off. How does your alarm work? You don't need to know, don't need to care.
But the frustration in their voice was clear enough after a week in which several European allies broke ranks, and in a public challenge to Germany, effectively declared the era of deficit reduction in Europe to be over.
"I call it balancing the budget," the German chancellor told their audience at a book presentation. "Everyone else is using this term austerity. That makes it sound like something truly evil."
Five months before Germany holds an election, Ms Merkel finds themselves under fire from European partners and the centre-left opposition at home for continuing to insist that euro members "do their homework" - Berlin-speak for reining in spending and enacting deep structural reforms.
There are signs the criticism is beginning to grate. German officials turn testy when the word "austerity" is mentioned these days. In recent months, they have deliberately adjusted their language, adopting the term "growth-friendly consolidation" to describe their policy approach.
But Merkel's appearance in Berlin, and the reaction of their closest allies to suggestions by the European Commission that euro member states loosen their fiscal reins, shows Germany will not soften its position.
"Declaring an end to consolidation is absolute nonsense," Michael Fuchs, deputy leader for Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) in parliament, told Reuters. "In truth no one is really saving anyway, they're just issuing less debt than before."
German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, speaking in Brussels, criticised Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso for saying that austerity had "reached its limits".
Mr Barroso's remarks on Monday came days after their colleague Olli Rehn said Europe's G20 partners were "preaching to the converted" in urging the bloc to shift away from a savings-first approach.
"We are convinced that if we give up on budget consolidation in Europe and return to the old approach of more and more debt, then we would cement mass-unemployment over a period of many years," Mr Westerwelle said.
In their defence, German officials pointed to data released by Eurostat, the EU statistical office, showing that government debt in the eurozone actually rose to 90.6pc of gross domestic product (GDP) last year from 87.3pc the year before.
However, the same report showed that the bloc-wide deficit as a percentage of GDP fell back to 3.7pc last year, from 4.2pc in 2011 and 6.2pc in 2010.
The German government's critics see these figures, and the unrelenting downward spiral in southern Europe, as proof that consolidation has gone far enough.
The eurozone economy is expected to shrink for the second year running in 2013. And more than one in four Greeks and Spaniards are without a job - a situation that Greens leader Juergen Trittin said risked tearing Europe apart.
Peter Bofinger, a member of the "wise men" council of economic advisers and a leading critic of the government's policies, also voiced doubts.
"There isn't a single indicator I can find that suggests this policy of aggressive deficit reduction is working," they told Reuters.
They said the German economy had done well because Merkel's government had not imposed the same cuts at home that it was demanding of its partners.
But Merkel and their allies fear that if they lessen the pressure, fellow eurozone members could abandon their consolidation drives altogether, stirring anxiety in financial markets and rekindling the crisis in the heart of the currency bloc.
Both France and Spain fell short of their deficit goals last year. With Germany's tacit approval, they are expected to be given more time to reach an EU target of 3pc of GDP.
But additional leeway from Berlin is not on the cards, officials say, unless French President Francois Hollande shows more commitment to spending cuts and structural reforms, including changes to rules governing the French labour market.
"France worries us above all," Norbert Barthle, a budget expert in Merkel's CDU, told Reuters. "It now looks like they need another year. We're willing to accept that but it can't go any further."
Gerda Hasselfeldt, leader of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) in parliament, said Germany was watching France "intensively and with a degree of concern".
"In my view, the necessary reforms are not being implemented with sufficient vigour," they said.
It is time the truth about backyard homesteaders is out…and I'm going to come clean! Some of you think you know, but only the backyard homesteaders really know! There are too many untruths and straight-up bologna going around the net and blogs. Buckle up y'all, I have 12 truths about backyard farmers for you!
The Truth About Backyard Homesteaders
Truth #1 – Backyard homesteaders know how to use the space we are given. Sure we might not have acres…we might not even have a 1/4 acre. But we have learned to make the most of what we have; and every space is utilized.
Truth #2 – We love a good DIY. From making soap to building chicken coops from pallets. We love a do-it-yourself project.
Truth #3 – Many backyard homesteaders are trying to keep their homestead on the DL (down low folks). Some are in HOAs that don't allow vegetable gardens, much fewer chickens and others have city ordinances working against them.
Truth #4 – Not all of us want to live in the country some day. Some like the city or suburb life and just want to be as sustainable and self-reliant as they can, right where they are.
Truth #5 – Backyard homesteaders KNOW that your yappy dog is a 1000x louder than the chickens they have in the backyard. But we will suck it up because we won't complain, if you don't.
Truth #6 – Backyard homesteaders have a lot harder time going away on a vacation. We have gardens, livestock and projects that need tending so we can't just go away on a whim. There aren't a lot of homestead sitting services out there!
Truth #7 – Backyard homesteaders don't mind dirt under their nails, poop on their shoes and brooders in the family room (ok that last one might just be me). But we do like a good pair of gardening shoes. 😉
Truth #8 – We are constantly educating ourselves. We read books and blog. We get out in the community and learn from mentors. We're never done learning or sharing in homesteading.
Truth #9 – No one can appreciate a hen first egg like a backyard homesteader. We usually know our girls by name and celebrate their first egg with pictures on Instagram and Facebook.
Truth #10 – We take our seeds seriously. Some of us even take our seed catalogs to bed for nighttime reading.
Truth #11 – Backyard homesteaders love their kitchen gadgets! Canners, dehydrators, mixers, fermentation helpers…yeah we have pantries full of them.
Truth #12 – WE ARE REAL HOMESTEADERS!
So there you have it, 12 truths about backyard homesteaders. Have one you'd like to add? Tell me in the comments.

about
Seven Succulents is a continuation of my 2009 release Six Silicates. Where Six Silicates was a nod to crystals, Seven Succulents explores the weird and wonderful world of desert plants. The music thrives and grows from a single seed, winding its roots delicately through sand, communicating through beacons of sound sent across vast arid landscapes. The songs are named after plants I have tended and cared for over the years, and the collection exists as an homage to the wonders of nature; a love note for quiet desert foliage.
Seven Succulents features additional musicians Mike Greenfield (of LOTUS) on drums, Samuel Wexler on violin, Timmayo Sheehan on flute, Lynne Watts on vocals, and “The're Home Family Drum Brigade" crammed in my living room making a whole lot of noise.

“The best things we know and love started as tiny things.” — Joel Gascoigne
Buffer's CEO, Joel, wrote a post not too long ago about the importance of starting small with new projects. They make some great points about how easy it is to see the finished product of someone else's hard work and forget about how long it took them to get to that point:
“It's difficult to understand how the evolutionary process of products and brands contributes and is vital to what they are today.”
Joel goes on to say that success is more likely when we execute on small projects. Start small and let them grow, essentially.
“Don't even try to build startups. That's premature optimization. Just build things that seem interesting.” — Paul Graham
To give us a little insight into just how simple some of the today's juggernaut web companies were when they started out, I thought it would be fun to do some time traveling in the Wayback Machine. Design can't tell us everything about what's happening behind the scenes at a company, but it's one way to visualize the progress of a product or service over time. Plus, each of these companies' founders have some useful advice on why they started small and how it helped them grow into the successes they are today.
So let's take a look at how these major companies evolved from their humble beginnings:
Facebook — “Be in it for the long haul.”
“I'm here to build something for the long-term. Anything else is a distraction.” — Mark Zuckerberg
Zuckerberg's vision for Facebook is a big one: to make the world more socially connected. Although they started with a small solution to connect college students, Facebook has grown into one of the biggest, most popular social networks alive today, and continues to grow because he's committed to building out the company over time:
“I know it sounds corny, but I'd love to improve people's lives, especially socially… Making the world more open is not an overnight thing. It's a ten-to-fifteen-year thing.”
2004
Today, Facebook is bigger and more complicated than it was to start with, but Zuckerberg stays committed to their vision:
“A lot of founding principles of Facebook are that if people have access to more information and are more connected, it will make the world better; people will have more understanding, more empathy. That's the guiding principle for me. On hard days, I really just step back, and that's the thing that keeps me going.”
Now
Google — “Do one thing well”
“When Sergey and I founded Google, we hoped, but did not expect, it would reach its current size and influence. Our intense and enduring interest was to objectively help people find information efficiently.” — Larry Page
1998
Google's design has remained sparse over the years, even as the company has expanded and added more services like Maps, YouTube, Gmail and Drive. When you hit Google.com today, it's still clear what one thing Google is focused on: finding information.
“We try to, when you come to Google, fulfill that need that you have as quickly as possible.” — Larry Page
Now
Tumblr — “Build for yourself first”
Tumblr's founder David Karp created the service to fill a need they had. Blogging was becoming more popular but it was mainly focused on writing — something Karp rightly assumed that not everyone wanted to do.
“You get that big empty box, and it demands that you come up with like a witty headline that convinces people to click over and care about your post, it demands several paragraphs of nicely formatted HTML with little aligned images, and a real editorial voice, real writing.” — David Karp
2007
Today, Karp attributes Tumblr's success – with its vision of “more stuff” including visuals like photos and GIFs – to continuing the strong focus of building something their team loves and uses:
“I think something that is still very true of Tumblr today is it is still a product our team builds for ourselves first and foremost and something we're excited to use every day, and we spend hours every day using. I'd like to believe that not only comes through in the product, but that it's kept us close to what Tumblr is really about, kept us from straying too far from that, and that I think kept it true to the original vision.”
Now
YouTube — “Don't assume you have the answers”
The YouTube team is committed to testing their assumptions and building based on how the community engages with their product, based on previous experience:
“We had a lot of our own ideas about how the service would evolve. Coming from PayPal and eBay, we saw YouTube as a powerful way to add video to auctions, but we didn't see anyone using our product that way, so we didn't add features to support it.” — Chad Hurley
2005
Co-founder Chad Hurley advises other startup founders to test their assumptions and listen to users, rather than jumping into a big product roadmap from the beginning, based soley on your own vision:
As you start building the product, don't assume that you know all the answers. Listen to the community and adapt.
Now
Yahoo! — “Prepare to scale”
Yahoo!, like most of these companies, started out as a very small project to solve a specific problem: the founders had trouble digging up websites they wanted to revisit later, so they started cataloging the web.
“We called it ‘Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web.' Before we knew it, people from all over the world were using this database that we created.” — Jerry Yang
1996
From their experience at Yahoo!, co-founder Jerry Yang suggests being prepared for scaling up your business:
“I think in this business you really have to prepare for the scale involved. And if the business model won't scale up, then in the end it won't work.”
Now
Amazon — “Put your customers first”
“We innovate by starting with the customer and working backwards. That becomes the touchstone for how we invent.” — Jeff Bezos
Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, insists that putting customers first since the beginning has been — and continues to be — the best competitive advantage Amazon has.
“We've had three big ideas at Amazon that we've stuck with for 18 years, and they're the reason we're successful: Put the customer first. Invent. And be patient.”
1999
Since Amazon's humble beginning as an online bookstore, it's become a huge online retailer, selling almost everything. But even with huge growth, Bezos remains focused on what customers want:
“When [competitors are] in the shower in the morning, they're thinking about how they're going to get ahead of one of their top competitors. Here in the shower, we're thinking about how we are going to invent something on behalf of a customer.”
Now
There are plenty of other examples of starting small. In Joel's post, they share the example of Dale Carnegie's book, How to Win Friends and Influence People, which started out as a short talk and some notes on an index card.
Another example I love is the “email-first startup.” Sunrise is a great example: what started out as a daily email digest is now a full-fledged calendar app for iPhone.
Have another great example? Let me know your favorite starting small story in the comments.

GOP nominee Donald Trump warned Sunday that Hillary Clinton's running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, is an establishment insider who is under the thumb of the financial elite.
Appearing on NBC's Meet The Press, Trump took aim at Kaine, saying that Hillary's decision to pick them would only help Trump gain more supporters.
“I was shocked. I love it from my standpoint.” said Trump, adding “He's bought and owned by the banks.”
“He's in favor of TPP and every other trade deal that he's ever looked at,” Trump said, referring to the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership supported by Kaine.
“Now, he's going to change. Don't worry about that. … It's OK.  They are going to change their tune. And I understand he's now going to say, ‘I'm against TPP.'” Trump added.
“Hillary Clinton was totally in favor of TPP, which is the job killer, right? So was he.” Trump noted.
“When they watched me on your show and other shows,” Trump told Chuck Todd, “all of a sudden they changed, because they know they can't win that in the debate.”
Trump also went after Kaine for taking “over $160,000 of gifts” while they were governor of Virginia.
“They said, ‘Well, they weren't really gifts, they were suits and trips and lots of different things,' all for $160,000,” Trump said, also comparing Kaine to their successor, former Republican governor Bob McDonnell, who was recently cleared by the U.S. Supreme Court of corruption convictions related to gifts they took while in office.
“I believe it was Bob McDonnell, in the meantime, they had to go to the United States Supreme Court to get out of going to jail,” Trump noted.
“Bob McDonnell took a fraction of what Kaine took. And I think, to me, it's a big problem. Now, how do you take all these gifts? Hundreds of thousands of dollars.” Trump asked.
Trump also said that they see the pick of Kaine as an establishment Democratic rebuke aimed at Bernie Sanders.
“What happened with the choice of Tim Kaine was a slap in the face to Bernie Sanders and everybody,” they said, adding that Sanders “has been gamed, it's a rigged system against him.”
Taking to Twitter, Trump repeated the comments, saying that the decision was “VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of their supporters.”
The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of their supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2016
Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2016
Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2016
Elsewhere during the interview, Trump hit on a number of topics, again having to rebuke KKK figure David Duke “as quick as you can say it,” and again addressing the non-issue of their tax returns.

This post is about head tracking and how to use it in 3D. It is surprisingly easy to do with the suitable libraries. We will experiment with headtrackr.js and three.js. headtrackr.js is a nice library from auduno to do head tracking in the browser. You will learn how to do head tracking in webgl in only 20lines of javascript. I love the web and how easy it is :)
tl;dr; links
For a simple example. see the “move a cube with your head” demo
To mess with the code now without any installation, see this jsfiddle example
for an attempt to make 3d more immersive by using head tracking, see this demo
WebRTC is great!
WebRTC starts to get traction. I love that! We have seen WebRTC and getUserMedia several times in the past: in “Punch a Doom Character in Augmented Reality” post, in “Fun With Live Video in WebGL” post and “Augmented Reality 3D Pong” post. It is already in chrome stable , and will be in firefox real soon. They already talk to each other. Here we don't need the network part of webrtc. We only need to get the webcam video, so getUserMedia is enougth. It is in Opera 12 too as you can read here.
auduno is part of Opera team. They wrote it as a demo for Opera 12 release which contained getUserMedia. For more info on the library, auduno blogged about internals of their library. You can find details in their blog post. Additionnal info are available in the reference documentation. Some examples are already in three.js, like targets or facekat.
Demo Time !!
As usual we did a plugin for tQuery API to make it easy to use in our environement. One can find 2 examples for it: A educational example where your heads controls a box in 3d. For best result, make sure your face is well and evenly lighted
Another demo where the camera follows your head. The whole scene moves as you move your head, providing quite an immersive experience. You can play with it thru jsfiddle too.
Let's Get Started
Ok now lets see how to use this library with tQuery API. First, we include the tquery.headtrackr files in your code. tQuery plugins supports require.js. It makes dependancies much easier to handle. tquery.headtrackr is no exception, so to include it you can do
1 2 3 require ([ 'tquery.headtrackr' ], function (){ // Your code ... });
Or if you use the good old <script> , do something like that to include headtrackr.js itself, the library which handle the head tracking. Then you just include the plugin itself, and you are done.
1 2 <script src= "headtrackr.js" ></script> <script src= "tquery.headtrackr.js" ></script>
Start Tracking Heads
First, you instanciate the object with this simple line. You can pass various options to .createHeadtrackr(opts) . Here, opts is an Object with those properties
opts.width : width of the image containing the face. default to 320px
width of the image containing the face. default to 320px opts.height : height of the image containing the face. default to 240px
height of the image containing the face. default to 240px opts.headtrackrOpts : options passed directly to headtrackr.js. default to {}
1 var headTracker = tQuery . createHeadtrackr ();
Default is reasonable, so chances are you dont need to specify anything. To start tracking the head on the webcam, just do the following
1 headTracker . start ();
It is possible to stop it with .stop() or to reset it via .reset() .
Debug View is Cool For User Feedback
If you wish enable the debugView, aka the little visualisation the headtracker result. It gives feedback to the user on what is happening. Thus the user can move their head accordingly or to change lighting of the room.
1 headTracker . debugView ( true );
Face Position Notified thru Events
When a face is found, events are dispatched to notify the detected positions.
1 2 3 headTracker . addEventListener ( "found" , function ( event ){ // Your code ... });
event contains normalized coordinates of the detected face. They use the same axis as WebGL. If the head is on the center, event.x and event.y will be 0. And if the head is vertical, event.angle is 0. More precisely
.x and .y : It is the center position. it varies from [-1,+1], from left to right and bottom to top.
and : It is the center position. it varies from [-1,+1], from left to right and bottom to top. .width and .height : the width and height :) If it is half of whole image, it is equal to 1.
and : the width and height :) If it is half of whole image, it is equal to 1. .angle : the Z rotation of the detected head. It is in radian as usual.
: the Z rotation of the detected head. It is in radian as usual. .headtrackrEvent : the original facetrackingEvent event from headtrackr.js (see reference )
Head tracking… Kesaco ?
Head tracking is a well known concept. One can find head tracking on ipad. One can find head tracking on wii. They got impressive result using the informations from the wiimote or even the device orientation. With the kinect, they even track the features of the face itself (e.g. mouth, noze, eyes etc…)
In our case, we use the image from the webcam. Unfortunatly face localisation from an image isn't exactly 100% accurate to say the least :) See here, this is the same demo as the wii one or the ipad one. Yet the result isn't as convincing. With headtrackr.js and webrtc , we use only the webcam in a uncontrolled environement. So the accuracy is in consequences.
You can improve efficiency by following a few simples advices: Avoid hats or a too crazy haircut. Being bold with a beard doesn't help :) Make sure your face is well and evenly lighted and you should be fine.
Conclusion
In this post, we have seen it is now possible to do head tracking in a web browser !! Impressive if you ask me! Even better, it is easy if you use suitable libraries. Coupled with three.js and tQuery API, it is possible to provide new immersive experience in 20lines of javascript. Im so excited. This kind of things was academic research 5 years ago, and now everybody can easily use it. We will likely do more with headtrackr.js. This is a very nice library with lots of possibilities. For example, one can use it the head as a game controller, or in a artistic exposition. Stay tuned!
That's all folks, have fun :)
Lisa Scaffidi can keep $138,000 allowance while challenging 18-month ban as Lord Mayor
Updated
Embattled Perth Lord Mayor Lisa Scaffidi will still be able to receive a $138,000 yearly allowance, despite giving an undertaking to WA's highest court that they will not perform any official mayoral duties while they challenge a ban from office.
The Court of Appeal today agreed to put on hold an 18-month disqualification they received over an expenses scandal, in which they failed to disclose travel and gifts worth tens of thousands of dollars.
In a statement, Chief Executive Officer Martin Mileham said the City of Perth had received legal advice that the Lord Mayor remained entitled to the annual allowance as stipulated by the Local Government Act.
City of Perth financial documents show that in the last financial year, Ms Scaffidi received a base allowance of $135,909, which increased on July 1 to $138,219.
Ms Scaffidi, who has refused to resign their office despite three separate inquiries finding they acted inappropriately, tweeted that they would "retain the office of Lord Mayor".
A breach of 'gross carelessness'
Earlier this week, the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT) ruled Ms Scaffidi should be banned from holding office for 18 months, a penalty that was set to begin from Thursday night.
The tribunal found they committed 45 breaches of the Local Government Act between 2007 and 2014, including failing to disclose a trip, paid for by BHP, to the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Other gifts included a stay at the upmarket Cable Beach Club in Broome, paid for by property management company Hawaiian Investments, and a hospitality package for a concert at Leeuwin Estate courtesy of BHP Billiton.
Ms Scaffidi admitted five of the breaches, but denied wrongdoing in the other 40 instances, claiming they had either forgotten to declare the travel and gifts, or had not turned their mind to them when filling out their annual returns.
The tribunal concluded that their actions "were not a case of intentional wrongdoing but rather that the Lord Mayor breached the Act with gross carelessness".
Ms Scaffidi immediately lodged appeals against the findings and the penalty and today, with the agreement of state lawyers, the suspension was postponed until all the court proceedings are finalised.
Them lawyer said they had undertaken not to carry out the functions of their office, which the State accepted.
After the finding, they tweeted a statement saying they were looking forward to an expedited appeal being heard as soon as possible.
'If you're not fulfilling the role, you don't get paid'
The Lord Mayor's duties will now be carried out by deputy Lord Mayor James Limnios.
Mr Limnios is up for election at next month's local government polls and if they lose the Perth City Council will have to elect another deputy mayor.
They said in the interim they were only looking forward, to stabilise the Perth City Council and concentrate on its ratepayers, residents businesses and employees.
Local Government Minister David Templeman said they would meet with Mr Limnios as soon as possible to discuss the determination.
"The City of Perth needs to make sure that they adhere to the intent of the order as well as of course ensure that the Local Government Act is adhered to," they said.
"It is important that the residents, ratepayers and businesses of the City of Perth are given confidence, and confidence is restored as soon as possible."
They said it was up to the City of Perth to determine whether Ms Scaffidi should continue to receive payment and allowances, given they are no longer fulfilling the role of mayor.
"I think there would be a general view by many people that if you're not fulfilling the role, you don't get paid for it, but that's a matter for the City of Perth to determine," Mr Templeman said.
Ms Scaffidi took offence at a suggestion from Mr Templeman that they no longer be referred to as the Lord Mayor, labelling it "incorrect and disrespectful".
"If the Minister is unhappy with the agreement that was reached, they should take it up with the CEO and their legal advisors rather than continuing to bleat about me," they said in another tweet.
The appeal is expected to be held in November.
A joke that needs to stop: Limnios
Mr Limnios said the City of Perth was currently being seen as a "joke" but this needed to stop.
"The City of Perth is the capital city, we are the premier part of the city, we should be the pride of the State," they said.
They said they would also be focussing on improving relations with the State Government and had already spoken with Mr Templeman.
"We need to be able to work together with the State Government and unfortunately that hasn't taken place thus far," they said.
Mr Limnios declined to comment at length on Ms Scaffidi's appeal bid, saying instead the Council needed to look to the future.
"I wish them all the best, but we've just got to move on."

A number is said to be perfect if it equals the sum of its divisors: 6 is divisible by 1, 2, and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
St. Augustine wrote, “Six is a number perfect in itself, and not because God created all things in six days; rather the converse is true; God created all things in six days because this number is perfect, and it would have been perfect even if the work of the six days did not exist.”
Perfect numbers are rare. No one knows whether an infinite quantity exist, and no one knows whether any of them are odd. The early Greeks knew the first four, and in the ensuing two millennia we've uncovered only 44 more. But they have one thing in common — they reveal a curious harmony when expressed in base 2:
When Rafael Benitez introduced new signing Philippe Coutinho to the Italian media in the summer of 2010, they declared the Brazilian "the future of Inter Milan".
Sadly, the playmaker has failed to develop their reputation since then.
The 20-year-old remains a player for the future, rather than a star of the present, and Liverpool have taken a calculated gamble by agreeing an £8.5m deal for him.
Marco Branca, who conducts all transfers for Inter Milan, told BBC Sport: "Coutinho is a very, very good player.  They are still only 20 and has a big talent."
Philippe Coutinho factfile Born: June 1992, Rio de Janeiro
June 1992, Rio de Janeiro Height: 5ft 6ins
5ft 6ins Clubs: Vasco da Gama (2009-10), Inter Milan (2010-12), Espanyol (2012, loan)
Vasco da Gama (2009-10), Inter Milan (2010-12), Espanyol (2012, loan) International: Won 2011 Under-20 World Cup; one Brazil cap (friendly v Iran, October 2010)
Won 2011 Under-20 World Cup; one Brazil cap (friendly v Iran, October 2010) Rival interest: Southampton also bid for Coutinho. Their manager, Mauricio Pochettino, managed the player at Espanyol
Yet the fact remains that Inter's sporting director was willing to sell a player who was peripheral at best at Inter, having failed to cement a starting place or even establish their best position.
Branca now hopes to use the money received from Liverpool to sign another Brazilian, the Corinthians midfielder Paulinho.
Andrea Ramazzotti, who covers Inter for Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport and has watched all Coutinho's 28 games for the club, told BBC Sport: "He just didn't show their potential in Milan.
"Coutinho played very well when they were on loan at Espanyol last season and started well for Inter this season, but they were only brief spells really.
"For the rest of the time, they just showed flashes of their potential and I fear the way of playing in England, which can be very physical, will not suit them because they have a slight frame."
That this is a player of rare talent, though, seems beyond question. The diminutive Brazilian is an excellent dribbler, combining close control with pace and trickery.
They also have finishing ability and can take a mean free-kick.
Coutinho joined Inter from Vasco da Gama for 4m euros (£3.4m) in 2008, when they were 16 and one of the most coveted young players in world football. The Serie A side immediately loaned them back to Vasco, because foreigners are prohibited from playing professional football in Italy until they are 18.
They returned in the summer of 2010 and quickly established themselves as a favourite of new manager Benitez, featuring in 14 leagues and Champions League games before Christmas, most often as a wide attacker in a 4-2-3-1 formation.
Benitez is a big fan of Coutinho
Unfortunately for the player, Benitez was sacked in December and their successor, Leonardo, was not anywhere near as big a fan of the young Brazilian. They played only four more games that season, although they did finish on a high by winning the Fifa under-20 World Cup with Brazil in the summer.
New manager Claudio Ranieri sent Coutinho on loan to struggling Spanish side Espanyol for the second half of the following season. They impressed, scoring five goals in 16 appearances.
This was when Liverpool first showed an interest in the player. Benitez had told their director of football, Damian Comolli, that Coutinho was the best young player at Inter and capable of being a big success in the Premier League.
Inter had yet another new manager, Andrea Stramaccioni, by this time, though, their sixth during Coutinho's time at the club, and they wanted to keep the player, so Inter rebuffed Liverpool's offer.
Stramaccioni's faith looked like being repaid as Coutinho was player of the tournament in the pre-season Trofeo TIM tournament, when Inter beat AC Milan and Juventus in an impressive start to the season.
Everything looked promising until the player suffered a stress fracture of the tibia at the end of October. Fredy Guarin took their place and has remained in the side ever since.
This all made Liverpool's offer too good to refuse, as Branca decided to cash in on Coutinho's largely unfulfilled promise.
It will be fascinating to see whether the player can now finally reach their potential with Liverpool, or simply remain a great hope.
Kattappana, Idukki: A woman from Kanchiyar has confessed to strangling their eight-day-old child because they thought the boy bore little resemblance to their husband. Sandhya, aged 28, was arrested on Saturday after bruises were found around the dead infant's neck.
The woman told their interrogators that they wrapped a cloth around the baby's neck and strangled them with their hands on Thursday. The police said they have recovered the cloth.
Sandhya has been married to Binu for 10 years. The couple has a nine-year-old daughter. Sandhya and their daughter left Binu a year ago after the timber worker became an alcoholic. Binu later joined their wife in their house.
Around four months ago, social workers on a routine house visit asked Sandhya if they were pregnant. Sandhya ruled out the possibility but the signs were growing more evident. A month ago, social workers persuaded them to go for a scan at a hospital at Kattappana, where they were told they were seven months pregnant.
They were put on a special diet when they were diagnosed with jaundice. They were treated in the Kottayam district hospital and the government medical college hospital for a month. They returned to the medical college hospital later to deliver a boy on November 30.
They went back to their house with the infant on December 6 but they refused to tend to him. They told the police that they were afraid that their husband would disown the child who was fairer and not too similar to him.
They killed the child the next day after their mother, brother and brother's wife had gone to work. They panicked and called up their husband to say that the child was not moving. Binu and relatives rushed to the house and took the baby to a hospital where they were pronounced dead.
The hospital authorities, however, grew suspicious after spotting the finger marks on the baby's neck. A post-mortem confirmed that they were murdered. Sandhya has been remanded.

It's all change at United's Carrington training complex as Louis van Gaal battles to cure the injury crisis that has savaged the Reds senior squad this season.
The debilitating injury curse that has ripped through the first team squad this campaign – affecting up to TEN players since the Dutchman's arrival – has forced the Reds boss to re-assess their training and treatment programmes.
The 63-year-old has been a manager for 23 years since starting as Ajax coach in 1991 and has admitted they have never known a casualty pile-up in their whole career like they have had to endure in their first few months at Old Trafford.
But it is not a one-off at United and the club for a number of seasons now have been hit by some cruel injury plagues.
But Van Gaal is determined to get to the root of the problem and is reviewing United's schedule both for training and pre-match.
It has hampered the new manager's ability to truly assess their squad. Asked about the extent of the casualty list – which now includes Phil Jones, who will be out for a month with a hamstring injury – Van Gaal said: “This is a big concern. Because it's not nice that I can't compare the players.”
Despite having a rethink about United's training programme, Van Gaal insists the work needed is still vital if they are to realise their ambitions at United.
“I am evaluating. I have changed my preparation scheme because of it for example,” they explained.
“I have also changed what we have to do after matches. I have changed the schedule of times. I am always evaluating things.
“Then of course we have to evaluate how we train. But for the level that I demand as a coach we need to train like that. But the players have to adapt to that level and that's the crucial thing. What can we do to adapt to a certain level that the players can fulfil and that we improve our level?
“My philosophy is not only a mode of play but it is also about how we are treating players.
“The way we are building up training sessions. The way we have to prepare for games. The way we have to do our rehabilitation.
“This is the process and steps you have to make. It is a lot of things. But one of the most important things is that I not only see the players as a football player but also as a human being.
“However, my philosophy has always bought a lot titles.”
Van Gaal refused to divulge the nature of the changes they are in the process of making to keep the number of injuries down but the plan is just part of a major overhaul on and off the field at United's Carrington complex.
On their arrival at the multi-million pound state-of-the-art centre, Van Gaal praised the facilities but immediately declared the training ground was too open and needed to be more ‘intimate'.
New trees have been planted to shield the training pitches from the wind that blows through the complex and high definition cameras have been installed to track the training sessions.
San Francisco - Today the ACLU of Northern California (ACLU-NC) and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) filed a federal class-action lawsuit to block implementation of unconstitutional provisions of Proposition 35 – a ballot measure passed by California voters Tuesday that restricts the legal and constitutionally protected speech of all registered sex offenders in California.
Proposition 35 requires anyone who is a registered sex offender – even people with decades-old, low-level offenses like misdemeanor indecent exposure and people whose offenses were not related to the Internet – to turn over a list of all their Internet identifiers and service providers to law enforcement. While the law is written very unclearly, this likely includes email addresses, usernames and other identifiers used for online political discussion groups, book and restaurant review sites, forums about medical conditions, and newspaper or blog comments. Under the law, more than 73,000 Californians must immediately provide this information to law enforcement, and must report any new account or screen name within 24 hours of setting it up, even if the new screen name is their own real name. Violations can result in years in prison.
Proposition 35's online speech regulations are overly broad and violate the First Amendment, both because they prohibit anonymous speech and because the reporting requirements burden all sorts of online speech, even when the speaker is using their own real name as a screen name.
"The ability to speak freely and even anonymously is crucial for free speech to remain free for all of us," said Michael Risher, staff attorney at the ACLU-NC. "Stopping human trafficking is a worthy goal, but this portion of Prop 35 won't get us there."
The suit was filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of two individuals required to register as sex offenders and a non-profit organization, California Reform Sex Offender Laws – a group that believes that no sexual abuse is ever acceptable and that laws that paint all sex offenders with one broad brush are counter-productive. The California Reform website allows people to comment on posts and they regularly do so, generally under pseudonyms.
"Requiring people to give up their right to speak freely and anonymously about civic matters is unconstitutional, and restrictions like this damage robust discussion and debate on important and controversial topics," said EFF Staff Attorney Hanni Fakhoury. "When the government starts gathering online profiles for one class of people, we all need to worry about the precedent it sets."
Even before Tuesday's vote, California's sex offender statute was already very broad, with a lifetime registration requirement for even low-level convictions like nude erotic dancing on stage at a bar. The state has the tools to determine who presents a risk to public safety and who doesn't – but this statute applies to everybody, no matter what the risk.
"We're asking the judge today to block the illegal provisions of Prop 35," said Risher.

Hot Chips is an annual conference that allows semiconductor companies to present their latest and greatest ideas or forthcoming products in an academic-style environment, and is predominantly aimed as the professional semiconductor engineer. This year has a number of talks about power management, upcoming IBM CPUs, upcoming Intel CPUs, upcoming NVIDIA SoCs and the final talk of the final day is from AMD, discussing Zen in even more depth than the previous week. While we were unable to attend the event in person, we managed to get some hands on time with information and put questions to Mike Clark, AMD Senior Fellow and design engineer.
What We Learned Last Week: L1/L2/L3 Caches and the Micro-Op Buffer
In AMD's initial presentation for the general media, we were given a sense of the microarchitecture layout. We covered the material, but it contained a number of highlights.
AMD Zen Microarchitecture: Dual Schedulers, Micro-op Cache and Memory Hierarchy Revealed
AMD Server CPUs and Motherboard Analysis
Unpacking AMD's Zen Benchmark: Is Zen actually 2% Faster than Broadwell?
First up, and the most important, was the announcement of the inclusion of a micro-op cache. This allows for instructions that are frequently used to be closer to the micro-op queue and saves a trip through the core and caches to load the desired information. Typically micro-op caches are still relatively small, and while AMD isn't giving any information for size and accessibility, we know that Intel's version can support 1536 uOps with 8-way associativity; we expect AMD's to be similar though there are many options in play.
Secondly is the cache structure. We were given details for the L1, L2 and L3 cache sizes, along with associativity, to compare it to former microarchitectures as well as Intel's offering.
CPU Cache Comparison Zen
HEDT Bulldozer
HEDT Excavator
Skylake Broadwell
HEDT L1-I 64KB/core 64KB/module 96KB/module 32KB/core 32KB/core 4-way 2-way 3-way 8-way 8-way L1-D 32KB/core 16KB/thread 32KB/thread 32KB/core 32KB/core 8-way 4-way 8-way 8-way 8-way L2 512KB/core 1MB/thread 512KB/thread 256KB/core 256KB/core 8-way 16-way 16-way 4-way 8-way L3 2MB/core 1MB/thread - >2MB/core 1.5-3MB/core 16-way 64-way - 16-way 16/20-way L3 Type Victim Victim - Write-back Write-back
In this case, AMD has given Zen a 64KB L1 Instruction cache per core with 4-way associativity, with a lop-sided 32KB L1 Data cache per core with 8-way associativity. The size and accessibility determines how frequently a cache line is missed, and it is typically a trade-off for die area and power (larger caches require more die area, more associativity usually costs power). The instruction cache, per cycle, can afford a 32byte fetch while the data cache allows for 2x 16-byte loads and one 16-byte store per cycle. AMD stated that allowing two D-cache loads per cycle is more representative of the most workloads that end up with more loads than stores.
The L2 is a large 512 KB, 8-way cache per core. This is double the size of Intel's 256 KB 4-way cache in Skylake or 256 KB 8-way cache in Broadwell. Typically doubling the cache size affords a 1.414 (square root of 2) better chance of a cache hit, reducing the need to go further out to find data, but comes at the expense of die area. This will have a big impact on a lot of performance metrics, and AMD is promoting faster cache-to-cache transfers than previous generations. Both the L1 and L2 caches are write-back caches, improving over the L1 write-through cache in Bulldozer.
The L3 cache is an 8MB 16-way cache, although at the time last week it was not specified over how many cores this was. From the data release today, we can confirm rumors that this 8 MB cache is split over a four-core module, affording 2 MB of L3 cache per core or 16 MB of L3 cache for the whole 8-core Zen CPU. These two 8 MB caches are separate, so act as a last-level cache per 4-core module with the appropriate hooks into the other L3 to determine if data is needed. As part of the talk today we also learned that the L3 is a pure victim cache for L1/L2 victims, rather than a cache for prefetch/demand data, which tempers the expectations a little but the large L2 will make up for this. We'll discuss it as part of today's announcement.
The mid-week release also gave insight into the dual schedulers, one for INT and another for FP, which is different to Intel's joint scheduler/buffer implementation. The talk at Hot Chips goes into detail about how the dispatch and schedulers operate
The New Information
As part of the Hot Chips presentation, AMD is reaffirming its commitment to at least +40% IPC improvement over Excavator. This has specifically been listed as a throughput goal at an equivalent energy per cycle, resulting in an increase in efficiency. Obviously a number of benefits come from moving the 28nm TSMC process to GloFo's 14nm FinFET process which is used via a Samsung licence. Both the smaller node and FinFET improvements have been well documented so we won't go over them here, but AMD is stating that Zen is much more than this as a direct improvement to immediate performance, not just efficiency. While Zen is initially a high-performance x86 core at heart, it is designed to scale all the way from notebooks to supercomputers, or from where the Cat cores (such as Jaguar and Puma) were all the way up to the old Opterons and beyond, all with at least +40% IPC.
The first immediate image out of the presentation is the CPU Complex (a CCX), which shows the Zen core design as a four-CPU cluster with caches. This shows the L2/L3 cache breakdown, and also confirms 2MB of L3 per core with 8 MB of L3 per CCX. It also states that the L3 is mostly exclusive of the L2 cache, which stems from the L3 cache as a victim cache for L2 data. AMD is stating that the protocols involved in the L3 cache design allow each core to access the L3 of each other core with an average (but a range) of latencies.
Over the next few pages, we'll go through the slides. They detail more information about the application of Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT), New Instructions, the size of various queues and buffers, the back-end of the design, the front-end of the design, fetch, decode, execute, load/store and retire segments.
Maple cornbread muffins are a tasty treat to enjoy in a number of delicious ways. You can eat them for breakfast, straight out of the oven with some butter, or bake them as a side for various recipes such as soups, chili, casseroles, you name it! This medicated recipe features cornbread muffins made with organic pure maple syrup and medicated with medicinal marijuana butter. Try this marvelously warm and delightful dish during the coldest days we've seen this year!
Yields 12 muffins
Here's What You Need:
1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 cup cornmeal
2 teaspoons baking powder
½ teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup organic milk
1 organic egg (beaten)
¼ cup organic pure maple syrup
2 tablespoons cannabis-infused butter (melted, but cooled for the batter)
3 tablespoons cannabis-infused butter (prepping the muffin-tin)
How to Make Mary Jane's Maple Cornbread Muffins
To begin, preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
Place ¼ tablespoon of cannabis-infused butter into each cup of your muffin tin (3 tablespoons for prepping pan).
In a large bowl, whisk the dry ingredients (flour, cornmeal, baking powder and salt) together and then sift them through a fine mesh strainer.
Melt the 4 tablespoons of cannabis-infused butter in a small sauce pan over medium-low heat, or in a small bowl in the microwave. Let the butter stand for a minute or two until it is room-temperature to the touch – you do not want the melted cannbutter to be hot.
Next, in a small bowl beat the egg and combine it with the other wet ingredients: milk, maple syrup and the melted cannabis-infused butter. Mix well to ensure the three ingredients have combined well.
Then, pour the wet ingredients into the large bowl containing the sifted dry goods. Mix until just combined. The batter may appear thin or have a few bumps and that's just fine. Allow the muffin batter to sit for 1-2 minutes prior to filling the muffin tin.
After, place the prepped muffin tin into the preheated oven for about a minute or so, or until the cannabutter has melted in each cup.
Carefully remove the muffin tin from the oven and gently swirl the tin to ensure the melted cannabutter distributes itself around each cup and covers the sides a bit.
Fill each cup of the muffin tin about ¾ full with the maple cornbread muffin batter and place the muffin tin back into your hot oven.
Bake the muffins for 20 minutes, or until they're golden brown in color and smell amazing!
After 20 minutes, remove the muffin tin from the oven and place the tin on a wire rack to cool for 5 minutes.
Remove the muffins after 5 minutes and place them on the wire rack.
Serve with your choice of butter, or as a side for more savory dishes such as chili, soups, beans, or casseroles!
Enjoy!

Robotronica: Retro robots return from the '70s
Updated
A retrofitted "Mr Partybot" was a hit in the 1970s and promises to be just as popular when they join Australia's largest one-day robotics festival, Robotronica, at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) this Sunday.
Dating back from 1977, the retro bot once typified our futurist robotic dreams at a time when robots were relegated to research labs.
But fast-forward 40 years and artist duo Jesse Stevens and Dean Peterson from Cake Industries have breathed life back into Mr Partybot using modern technology.
Mr Stevens said the Partybot was a "glimpse of futuristic living" and is a time capsule of an era where people were very interested in robots, but were limited by a lack of technology.
"They held the promise of a world where humans and robots lived together in harmony," they said.
"They presented a vision of a future where we could be served and entertained by robots."
Today in the modern world, robotic technology is continuing to integrate into almost every facet of our everyday life at home and in the work place.
"In 2017 we are seeing them [robots] cleaning our carpets, we are seeing them in banks, we are seeing them assisting elderly people, we've got drones that do their own thing now," Mr Stevens said.
"But it's important not to forget where all of this came from."
Mr Stevens said they hope the Partybot and Robotronica will show the public that robots have both a creative and practical purpose in our lives.
"I hope visitors will go away with a wider understanding of what robot means. That they are more than just a funny character in a film, that robots are more than an idea of a servant," they said.
"Robots can fuse with our lifestyle and that robots have more to offer than work, that they themselves can be creative objects as well."
The Cake Industries artistic duo has partnered with QUT to present five exhibits including roaming installations like "Mr Partybot 1977" but also "Crate Expectations", "Super Box World", "Scenic" and "Destination Robots 1987".
Jonathan Parsons, the creative director at Robotronica, said the free event is open to all ages and will showcase the latest in robotics and technology in an engaging way.
"Imagination is our window into the future and for generations scientists and artists have been the ones leading exploration and invention to push the edges of possibility," they said.
Mr Parsons hoped the "hands on" event will educate the public about the future opportunities and challenges presented by technology and artificial intelligence.
"One of the things that is really important is for people to be informed about what's going on and also to debate some of the issues," they said.
Robotronica will host over 60 events involving interactive displays, games and a series of panel discussions on topics from the ethics of using robots in policing, to the moral issues of using "Sexbots" for intimacy.
The robotics and technology festival is held at QUT Garden's Point from 9:00am Sunday.

BlockApps, the first Blockchain-as-a-Service platform and a leading provider of Ethereum blockchain enterprise software, is collaborating with Red Hat to make it easier for enterprises to build production blockchain applications that can be deployed in production across hybrid cloud environments -- spanning both public and private clouds.
Some of the biggest barriers to enterprises adopting blockchain technologies have been the complexity of quickly developing solutions that can scale from proof-of-concepts (POCs) to enterprise-level production environments.
BlockApps has been a leading enterprise Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform that makes it easy to develop blockchain applications, from the POC through the production phase, with a quickly growing number of more than 100 enterprises building over 1,000 projects to date. Red Hat is a leader in hybrid, enterprise-grade open source solutions, and in open source container technology. In 2016, BlockApps STRATO became the first blockchain application to be available on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, and BlockApps joined Red Hat's OpenShift Blockchain Initiative, which is designed to help financial services industry customers build hosted blockchain solutions.
Now, BlockApps and Red Hat are working together to bring blockchain applications to scale for hybrid cloud environments. A hybrid BaaS solution powered by Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform can enable developers to build apps that combine the capabilities of the blockchain in hybrid cloud environments, enabling organizations to create production-ready Ethereum applications more easily.
"What we're seeing is a significant shift in blockchain adoption, moving from experimentation to wholesale adoption and scaled deployment within enterprises across various verticals," said Victor Wong, cofounder and CEO at BlockApps. "Red Hat began collaboration with BlockApps early, and we couldn't ask for a better technology partner for bringing standard based blockchain technologies into full production environments."
"Red Hat believes in the potential for blockchain in the enterprise, and we believe that a flexible open source and container-based platform offers an ideal platform for blockchain and fintech apps," said Rich Feldmann, global director, Financial Services, Red Hat. "We are excited to continue our collaboration with BlockApps to help enterprise organizations take advantage of the power of blockchain apps, at scale, in hybrid environments."

Seven years after the global financial crisis started, Canada's banks remain selective in what they disclose – a problem illustrated by Ottawa's recent crackdown on credit-card transaction fees.
Despite being one of the banking sector's most widely discussed issues, with lenders lobbying Ottawa furiously out of fear that any ruling would be too harsh, the average investor had almost no way of calculating how many millions or billions of dollars were at stake.
The reason is simple: The banks do not reveal this revenue number in their financial disclosures, forcing even the best Bay Street analysts to rely on estimates when making their investment recommendations.
Story continues below advertisement
"What is the financial impact of these changes? We cannot know for certain," CIBC World Markets analyst Rob Sedran wrote in a note to clients. "Though several banks noted the potential changes on recent webcasts, none provided any financial information that would be helpful in quantifying the impact."
The fees are just one of many veiled areas within Canadian banking, even after demands for greater transparency that followed the financial crisis.
For more than a decade, no one knew with certainty that Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce's Aeroplan credit card portfolio contributed 11 per cent of the lender's total profit; it was only when CIBC sold half of the accounts to Toronto-Dominion Bank in 2013 that this information was made public.
At RBC, there have been attempts to sell the bank's U.S. proprietary trading unit, yet no one knows exactly how that will affect the bottom line because the bank has only disclosed the division's revenues.
Although there has been progress, particularly around disclosure of bank capital levels and real estate exposure, much investment analysis still comes down to guesswork. That may not seem like a problem because Canada's Big Six banks are incredibly profitable, collectively earning nearly $33-billion in profit over the past 12 months. Yet J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s recent $6-billion (U.S.) loss on its so-called "London Whale" trade proved surprises can come at any moment.
It is also a problem because the banks are bracing for a slowdown as Canadians borrow less, which forces lenders to look for new ways to make money. But it is hard to track which tactics they use to squeeze their customers because banks are reluctant to disclose details.
On their part, the banks often say they are selective in revealing information for two reasons. First, they worry about offering too much insight on their operations to their rivals.

Toronto-Dominion Bank has made a name for itself as being progressive when it comes to investor relations, but chief financial officer Colleen Johnston acknowledged that "sometimes there are competitive or proprietary reasons that we may not go a lot deeper."
In these cases, TD opts for directional guidance as to whether profit is rising or falling. "Trend-wise, [analysts] certainly know what direction we are headed in in our key businesses," they added.
The banks also argue that because global regulators now require a large volume of data to be disclosed, they are concerned about inundating investors with far too much information.
"Transparency and good disclosure is about finding the right balance between volume and relevance – because if you simply put out more information, the really important pieces can get buried," RBC chief financial officer Janice Fukakusa wrote in an e-mail.
Bank analysts say they have seen a great deal of progress. "The devastating impact of the financial crisis forced the banks to open the kimono a lot wider in terms of the information they were offering to investors," Scotia Capital analyst Sumit Malhotra said. For example, some banks' supplemental financial disclosure packages have more than tripled in size.
However, more information does not necessarily mean more detail. For instance, the banks often break out big-picture information about which sectors their commercial and corporate lending arms are exposed to, but provide few details about exposures to specific companies. Last week, the Bank of Nova Scotia announced a $109-million (Canadian) writedown on three specific loans in the Caribbean, but it did not disclose which companies caused the charges.
Story continues below advertisement
In some cases, the banks have taken the lead in disclosing more information. When the European economic crisis took hold in 2011, RBC voluntarily provided more details about its regional exposure by country, products and counterparties.
National Bank Financial analyst Peter Routledge argues that it is often tough for any one bank to lead the charge. If its rivals don't follow suit, that lender can feel overexposed.
For this reason, Mr. Routledge believes banking watchdogs play a crucial role. "Regulators cure this dilemma by standardizing disclosures and ensuring compliance," they said.
Canada's banking regulator, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, is viewed as one of the more aggressive regulators worldwide. In September, Canadian and British banks were cited as being among the best in the world for risk disclosures by the Financial Stability Board, the top global banking regulator.
"OSFI recognizes that [Canadian banks] should disclose information that is in the public interest or that is necessary for the public to make informed decisions," the regulator wrote in an e-mail.
But outside its targeted areas of disclosure, such as bank capital, the lenders still have a lot of leeway.
The other morning here at Dangerous Minds Towers (Scotland), while I sat sifting through the mailbag looking for presents and antique snuff boxes, m'colleague Tara McGinley popped a fascinating article in front of me about a wild “Tiger Woman.”
At first I thought this tabloid tale was perhaps about the woman who had inspired Roy Wood to write their rather wonderful and grimy little number “Wild Tiger Woman” for The Move. As I read on, I realized this story of a rebellious singer, dancer and artist's model was unlikely to have been the woman Wood had in mind when they wrote their famous song.
No, this particular “Tiger Woman” was one Betty May Golding—a drug addict, a boozer, and a dabbler in the occult. They had a string of lovers, worked as a prostitute, had been a member of a notorious criminal gang, an alleged Satanist, and had once even tried to murder Aleister Crowley. This was the kind of impressive resumé one would expect from the original “wild child.” Not that Ms. Golding would have given two hoots for any of that:
I have not cared what the world thought of me and as a result what it thought has often not been very kind… I have often lived only for pleasure and excitement.
You go girl!
Betty May was born Elizabeth Marlow Golding into a world of poverty and deprivation in Canning Town, London in 1895. The neighborhood was situated at the heart of the city's docks—an area described by Charles Dickens as:
...already debased below the point of enmity to filth; poorer labourers live there, because they cannot afford to go farther, and there become debased.
To get an idea how deprived and “debased” this district was—Canning Town even today “remains among the 5% [of the] most deprived areas in the UK.” Plus ca change…
A typical London slum 1909.
When Betty was just an infant, their father left the family home, leaving their mother to support four children on a pittance of 10/- a week—roughly the equivalent of $1.50. The family home was a hovel with no furniture and no beds. The family slept on bundles of rags, cuddling together to keep warm.
Them mother was half-French with beautiful olive complexion and almond eyes. The struggle proved too much for them and Betty was sent off to live with their father who was then residing in a brothel. Them father was an engineer by trade but they preferred to spend their time drinking, fighting and thieving. They were eventually arrested and sent to jail.
In their autobiography Tiger Woman, published in 1929, Betty described themselves as a “little brown-faced marmoset ... and the only quick thing in this very slow world.” They earned pennies by dancing and singing on the street. After their father's arrest, they were passed from relative to relative eventually staying with an aunt who described them as “a regular little savage.”
One of their earliest memories was finding the body of a pregnant neighbor hanging from a hook. The woman had caught their husband having sex with their sister.
Them face was purple and their eyes bulged like a fish's. It was rather awful.
Eventually Betty was sent to another aunt who stayed out in the country in Somerset. Here they attended school but soon the teenager was in trouble after having an affair with one of their teachers.
I can hardly say, in the light of what I have learnt since, that we were in love. At least perhaps they are. Certainly I was fond of him.
When their illicit relationship was discovered, Betty was given an ultimatum.
There was a great deal of fuss and it was made clear to me that unless the ­friendship came to an end it would be the schoolmaster who would be made to suffer. After a rather tearful scene with my aunt I was packed off with a few pounds.

Arriving in London in 1910 Betty could only afford one outfit:
...but every item of it was a different colour. Neither red nor green nor blue nor yellow nor purple was forgotten, for I loved them all equally, and if I was not rich enough to wear them separately ... I would wear them, like Joseph in the Bible, all at once! Colours to me are like children to a loving mother.
With their exotic looks and green eyes, Betty looked every part the gypsy and was later known for their song “The Raggle Taggle Gypsy.” The novelist Anthony Powell described them as looking as a seaside fortune teller. Betty also delighted in their costermonger background:
I am a true coster in my flamboyance and my love of colour, in my violence of feeling and its immediate response in speech and action. Even now I am often caught with a sudden longing regret for the streets of Limehouse as I knew them, for the girls with their gaudy shawls and heads of ostrich feathers, like clouds in a wind, and the men in their caps, silk neckerchiefs and bright yellow pointed boots in which they took such pride. I adored the swagger and the showiness of it all.
The Café Royal in 1912 as painted by artist William Orpen.
At first, Betty worked as a prostitute before becoming a model, dancer and entertainer at the hip Café Royal.
The lights, the mirrors, the red plush seats, the eccentrically dressed people, the coffee served in glasses, the pale cloudy absinthe ... I felt as if I had strayed by accident into some miraculous Arabian palace… No duck ever took to water, no man to drink, as I to the Café Royal.
The venue was the haunt of Bohemians and artists—Augustus John, Jacob Epstein, the “Queen of Bohemia” Nina Hamnett, heiress Nancy Cunard, William Orpen, Anna Wickham, Iris Tree and Ezra Pound.
Betty's flamboyance and gypsy attire attracted their interest and they had affairs with many of the regulars. They modelled for Augustus John and Jacob Epstein. Being an artist's model was a grey area that often crossed into prostitution. Many of May's contemporaries in “modelling” died in tragic circumstances—either by their own hand or at the hands of a jealous lover.
The artist Augustus John looking rather pleased with himself.
Betty's life then took the first a many surprising turns when they became involved with a notorious criminal gang.
In 1914, they met a man they nicknamed “Cherub” at a bar who took them to France. Their relationship was platonic but after a night of drinking absinthe Cherub attacked her:
They clasped me round the waist, pinning my arms… I struggled with all the strength fear and hate could give me. With a supreme effort I succeeded in half-freeing my right arm so that I was enabled to dig my scissors into the fleshy part of their neck.
Betty escaped to Paris where they met up with a man known as the “White Panther” who introduced them into the one of the ciy's L'Apache gangs. They later claimed it was this gang who nicknamed them “Tiger Woman” after they became involved in a fight with one of the gangster's girlfriends. When separated by the gang leader they bit into their wrist like a wild animal.
Now part of gang, Betty became involved in various robberies and acts of violence—in one occasion branding a possible informer with a red hot knife. This experience led them to quit Paris.

To be honest, Betty's autobiography reads at times like a thrilling pulp novel and without corroborative evidence seems more like fiction than fact.
Returning to London, Betty resumed work as a singer and dancer. They sought a husband and found two suitors: the first died after a mysterious boating accident; the second blew their brains out one fine summer's day. Betty eventually married a trainee doctor Miles L. Atkinson, who introduced them to the joys of cocaine.
I learnt one thing on my ­honeymoon—to take drugs.
Atkinson had an unlimited supply of cocaine via their work with the hospital. The couple embarked on a mad drug frenzy. They fell in with a den of opium smokers. May's drug intake escalated to 150 grains of cocaine a day plus several pipes of opium. They became paranoid—on one occasion believing the world was against them after ordering a coffee at a cafe and the waiter served it black. They decided to divorce Atkinson, but they were killed in action in 1917 while serving as a soldier in the First World War.
Betty then met and married an Australian called “Roy”—not believed to be their real name—who weaned them off drugs by threatening to beat them if ever they caught them taking any. However, they divorced Roy after catching them having an affair.
Continuing with their career as an artist's model, Betty sat for Jacob Epstein and Jacob Kramer, who they claimed painted them as the Sphinx.
Jacob Kramer's painting ‘The Sphinx' (1918).
Them notoriety grew after the publication of a book Dope Darling by David “Bunny” Garnett, which was based on Betty's life as a coke addict. The book told the story of a man called Roy who falls in love with a dancer Claire at a bohemian cafe. Claire is a drug addict and prostitute. Roy believes they can save Claire by marrying them Once married, Roy gradually becomes a drug addict too.
In the book, Garnett described Claire as being :
...always asked to all the parties given in the flashy Bohemian world in which they moved. No dance, gambling party, or secret doping orgy was complete without them Under the effect of cocaine which they took more and more recklessly, they became inspired by a wild frenzy, and danced like a Bacchante, drank off a bottle of champagne, and played a thousand wild antics
But all of this was by way of a warm-up to their meeting the Great Beast.
‘Dope Darling' by David Garnett.
In 1922, Betty met and married the poet Frederick Charles Loveday (aka Raoul Loveday). This dear boy (aged about twenty or twenty-one) was an acolyte of Aleister Crowley. With a first class degree from Oxford University and a book of published poems to their name, Loveday was utterly dedicated to Crowley and to their study of the occult.
Crowley first met Loveday at a dive in London called the Harlequin. They liked Loveday—saw their potential and claimed they were their heir apparent—but they said this about many other young man that took their fancy. They were however reticent in their praise for May—describing them as a “charming child, tender and simple of soul” but impaired by an alleged childhood accident they believed had “damaged their brain permanently so that its functions were discontinuous.” This condition was exacerbated by their drug addiction—though they were complimentary in their strength of will in curing herself.
Crowley believed they could save Loveday from the “vagabonds, squalid and obscene, who constituted the court of Queen Betty.”
In their Confessions, Crowley recounted a typical scene of Betty “at work” in the Harlequin:
In a corner was their wife, three parts drunk, on the knees of a dirty-faced loafer, pawed by a swarm of lewd hogs, breathless with lust. They gave themselves greedily to their gross and bestial fingerings and was singing in an exquisite voice ... an interminable smutty song, with a ribald chorus in which they all joined.
Aleister Crowley
Crowley moved to Sicily where they established their Abbey of Thelema at Cefalu. They wanted Loveday—and to a lesser extent May—to join them there. However, Loveday had been ill after an operation and several friends including Nina Hamnett warned them off going. But Loveday was determined and the couple traveled to the Abbey.
Arriving there in the fall of 1922, Betty and Loveday were soon party to various sex magic rituals under Crowley's direction. On one occasion, Betty chanced upon a box filled with blood soaked neckties. When they asked Crowley what these were, they replied that they had belonged to Jack the Ripper and were stained with the blood of theirs victims.
Crowley may have tut-tutted about Betty's sexual hi-jinks with other men in the club, but they didn't seem to mind all the fucking and sucking that went on at the Abbey. Betty was unsure about Crowley. They were intrigued by the occult and their superstition kept their belief from wavering. But they never fully trusted him.
Everything came to a head after a black mass where Crowley commanded Loveday to kill a cat and drink its blood. Crowley claimed the cat was possessed by an evil spirit. Loveday beheaded the cat and greedily drank its blood. Within hours they fell ill and died, on February 16th, 1923.
Betty blamed Crowley for their husband's death and swore revenge—deciding to kill him.
They found a pistol and confronted them inside the Abbey. Pointing the gun directly at Crowley, they fired. The bullet missed. Crowley laughed, Betty fired again. The gun jammed.
I rushed at them but they picked me up in their arms and flung me bodily outside through the front door.
Betty recounted their time at Cefalu in their autobiography and again under oath in 1934 during a libel suit. They also sent reports of their time with Crowley to the Daily Express. These articles confirmed the Great Beast's reputation as “the most evil man alive.”
Crowley, for their part, always denied the accusations. They claimed there had been no rituals, no sacrifices and no cat. They also claimed Loveday had succumbed to malaria and poisoning after drinking dirty water from a stream.
Betty returned to Britain, wrote their ­autobiography Tiger-Woman: My Story in 1929. It became a bestseller and set them up for life. They married a fourth time, then dedicated their life to working with orphans in London.
Little is known of Betty's final years, It is believed they died in 1955—though some claim they died in 1980. In 2014 Tiger Woman: My Story has republished by Duckworth and can be bought here. A musical based on Betty's life Tiger Woman vs. The Beast (with eighteen new songs) is under development—details here.

No, The Move's ‘Wild Tiger Woman' was not based on the life of Betty May, but it's still a slamming good song.
For a third time, scientists have detected the infinitesimal reverberations of spacetime: gravitational waves.
Two black holes stirred up the spacetime wiggles, orbiting one another and spiraling inward until they fused into one jumbo black hole with a mass about 49 times that of the sun. Ripples from that union, which took place about 3 billion light-years from Earth, zoomed across the cosmos at the speed of light, eventually reaching the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, LIGO, which detected them on January 4.
“These are the most powerful astronomical events witnessed by human beings,” Michael Landry, head of LIGO's Hanford, Wash., observatory, said during a news conference May 31 announcing the discovery. As the black holes merged, they converted about two suns' worth of mass into energy, radiated as gravitational waves.

Tommy DiMassimo, the Wright State University student with Atlanta ties who in March rushed the stage at an Donald Trump rally in Ohio, has raised $340 from 10 people through a Go Fund Me page for their legal defense as of Wednesday afternoon. Their funding goal is $25,000, according to the page.
DiMassimo was arrested March 12 after they vaulted a stage barrier and rushed to the back of the stage in a hangar near Dayton International Airport in Vandalia, Ohio, a suburb of Dayton.
Their Go Fund Me page gets political, saying that they rushed the stage “not to promote violence, but to speak out against it.”
“In order for Tommy to join the national activist movement against Trump, they must raise 25,000 dollars for their legal team to be able to defend their innocence in court,” the page says. “By supporting Tommy you ensure that there's still a fighting chance to stop Trump before it's too late.”
DiMassimo is the son of Faye DiMassimo, who is general manager for the $250 million Renew Atlanta infrastructure bond program. Prior to taking the city job in November, Faye DiMassimo was Cobb County's transportation director, responsible for a host of projects surrounding SunTrust Park.
Trump tweeted after the event that Tommy DiMassimo had ties to ISIS, which the 22-year-old acting major denied in a CNN interview.
DiMassimo told police that they didn't mean to harm anyone, and simply wanted to take a microphone and yell, “Donald Trump is a racist,” according to the report.
DiMassimo faces federal misdemeanor charges of illegally entering a “cordoned off and otherwise restricted area where a person protected by the Secret Service was temporarily visiting.” It carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a $100,000 fine. Recent hearings have been postponed as the two sides negotiate a plea deal.
DiMassimo's attorney, Jon Paul Rion, did not return phone messages from The Atlanta Journal Constitution this week. But the Dayton Daily News quoted them as citing the First Amendment as a potential defense after a hearing in March.
“Can the court restrict someone's access to a political event?” Rion is quoted as saying in the Dayton newspaper. “It's a significant political issue in our mind. The First Amendment protects the ability for political speech. Clearly, being present at a political event is a form of speech. So that's going to be a question for the court to consider.”
A federal magistrate today approved Tommy DiMassimo's request to travel to Atlanta May 6 and return on the 9th.
WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Some Canadian flower growers are turning to weed, with the country's plan to legalize marijuana for recreational use expected to spur a spike in legal sales of the drug.
While medical marijuana is already legal in Canada, the Liberal government said in April it will introduce a law in 2017 to support expanded legalization, a policy already backed by several U.S. states.
Canadian legal marijuana sales may climb to C$4.6 billion ($3.44 billion) by 2019 from just C$125 million, according to PI Financial.
The potential demand spurred Jeannette VanderMarel and Scott Skinner, experienced in growing lavender, to plant their first marijuana crop in September.
The slogan on their Hamilton, Ontario farm, called The Green Organic Dutchman, is “We're Farmers not Pharma.”
“There might have been a perception that it's huge corporate entities entering this market. We are truly a mom-and-pop farm,” VanderMarel said.
Even so, Dutchman aims to go public next year and produce 13,000 kilograms (29,000 lbs) by 2018.
Dutchman's growing facility looks like a farm shed from the outside, but is more pharmaceutical plant inside, where workers wear face masks, shoe covers and gloves, and a microbiologist works full-time.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the goal of legalization is to take revenue from organised crime and better protect young people.
The policy change will create 2018 cannabis demand of 655,000 kilograms, Canada's parliamentary budget officer (PBO) said. An estimated 4.6 million Canadians are expected to try cannabis in 2018, according to PBO.
Potential producers have taken notice. Health Canada was processing 422 licence applications as of Nov. 8. It has only approved 36 since 2013 when Canada allowed commercial medical marijuana production.
A government report on regulating the expanded industry was completed this week, but has not become public.
In Prince Edward Island, Canada's Island Garden Inc just harvested its second crop, and is aiming for capacity of 800 kilograms by June. President Edwin Jewell says running a farm market has been critical experience to setting up their indoor cannabis operation.
But they had worried what longtime customers might think.
“I was thinking, ‘will they take a stand that they don't want to support me any longer?” they said.
“We haven't seen that at all.”
Aphria Inc produces six harvests a year in Ontario greenhouses, using its founder's experience growing poinsettias and vegetables.
“Ninety percent of any plant is the same — roots, stems, stalks, leaves,” said Chief Executive Vic Neufeld.
But cannabis requires high maintenance, they added, demanding at times 12 hours of sunlight per day and 12 hours of total darkness, requiring “blackout curtains.”
Aphria and other large producers, such as Canopy Growth Corp , Mettrum Health Corp and OrganiGram Holdings Inc , are already aggressively expanding. Canopy agreed on Thursday to buy Mettrum for C$430 million in stock.
But some potential growers like Ontario-based Kuyvenhoven Greenhouses are just saying no, with capital and risks not the only deciding factors.
“I had trouble introducing something I didn't ethically believe in,” said owner Andrew Kuyvenhoven.

Candidate Donald Trump promised people that no one would lose their coverage, premiums would go down, they would take care of preexisting conditions, there wouldn't be any Medicaid changes, they would cover more people, and leave no one worse off by getting rid of the lifesaving impacts of Obamacare.
All of this was a lie.
“I'm not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican and I'm not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid,” Candidate Donald Trump promised.
“We're gonna come up with a new plan that's going to be better health care for more people at a lesser cost,” Trump told ABC's David Muir.
But today, Trump is celebrating the House passage of a plan that will kill tens of thousands annually.
Just repealing Obamacare will cause an estimated 43,956 deaths a year.
Trumpcare is not “better health care for more people” – and most bizarrely, it's as if they actually tried to make it as evil as they could, to harm as many Americans who aren't rich as they possibly could. Even people on employer plans will be harmed.
Abused or raped? Trumpcare gives you the middle finger.
Child sick with a preexisting condition? Republicans are drinking beer as they gleefully put into motion all of the necessary factors to kill your child.
Republicans spent seven years whining about maybe not being able to keep their same doctor — their biggest beef with Obamacare, so they created and passed a plan in the House that would murder tens of thousands of Americans every year.
And they are happy about it.
It is this that Republicans are celebrating, and it's clear watching them that they suffer from some kind of sickness for which there is no cure.
They were so jealous of Obama passing a law that helped millions of Americans, they just didn't want to let them have it, even aside from their ideological issues (which truthfully shouldn't have been too large since it was partly based on a very conservative idea).
Spite.
So Trump just broke all of their promises, promises central to their campaign, perhaps equal to their wall especially since the Medicaid cuts will impact a large number of Trump voters. In fact, Trump voters were going to be the hardest hit by the better, kinder version of Trumpcare (the new version hasn't been scored by the CBO because Republicans cobbled it together and without even reading it in many cases, jammed it through with no real debate). So they are really in for it now if this House bill passes the Senate.
Why did Trump do it?
Because Trump needed to feel better about their presidency and they needed to spit on Obama some more. The wiretapping accusations went nowhere and made Trump a laughing stock and he's going to get Obama back. Trump needed a win. So Americans have to pay.
That's the mentality of Republicans who are running this country and both chambers of Congress. Every single healthcare promise Donald Trump made about what they would replace Obamacare with was a lie.
It was one big lie, and if it passes it will cost tens of thousands of lives every year.
Donald Trump wanted a legacy, and they have it now. Where Obama saved millions of lives, Trump will be known as the Death President. The Grim Reaper of healthcare.

The Libyan rebels' military commander, Abdel-Fattah Younis, has been killed, the transitional leadership council in Benghazi says.
Update at 5:13 p.m. ET: Younis and their two aides, Col. Muhammad Khamis and Nasir al-Madhkur, were gunned down before they arrived for questioning about suspicions that they and their family still had dealings with Gadhafi's regime, the head of rebel council, Mustafa Abdul-Jalil, said at a news conference. The details still have not been revealed.
The head of the group believed responsible for the killings has been arrested, they said.
Update at 5:01 p.m. ET: The head of the rebels' Transitional National Council said that pro-Gadhafi assailants had killed Younis and that the attackers have been arrested, the BBC reports.
Two of their aides also died, AP says.
Update at 4:36 p.m. ET: Abdel-Fattah Younis, who had headed the interior ministry under Moammar Gadhafi before defecting to the rebels in February, reportedly was arrested earlier today for dealing with and smuggling arms to Gadhafi loyalists, Al Jazeera says, noting the reports were unconfirmed.
They had served Gadhafi for nearly four decades.
"He spent 40 years as one of Gadhafi's right hand men as minister of defense and in charge of the special forces. So when they came over five months ago to the opposition because it was quite a coup. But some people have had their doubts about… their loyalties...," Al Jazeera correspondent Tony Birtley said in Benghazi, the rebel capital.
Original post: The Libyan rebels' military commander has been killed, the leadership council in Benghazi says, the Associated Press is reporting.
The National Transitional Council announced the death of Gen. Abdel Fatah Younis, chief of staff of the rebel forces, just hours after they were arrested for allegedly continuing their ties to Moammar Gadhafi's regime. The circumstances of their death were not described.
They were held at a military garrison in Benghazi, capital of the rebel forces, after being recalled earlier today from Brega, a source told Al Jazeera.
Story highlights Janet Hardy: It is tempting to think of nuclear family as an ideal and universal norm
Hardy: Plural marriage and "alternative families" based on love and mutual consent work
They say nuclear family is an uncomfortable fit for many, an impossible dream for others
Hardy: We should not expect all to conform to an unrealistic standard for the rest of history
I grew up in the early 1960s in an affluent suburb on the East Coast. Every child I knew went home to a family that looked like mine: a mom at home waiting for us, and a dad who showed up a few hours later in time for dinner.
How tempting it is to remember such households as an ideal and universal norm. But they were rarely ideal, and they were never universal.
Let's not discuss the stresses that affected those nuclear families. Let's just talk about the innumerable people who, by virtue of race, background, health or circumstance, could not -- or did not want to -- live in such families.
Instead, they lived in single-parent households, in households with two men or two women, in extended families of grandparents and aunts and grown siblings, in households where multiple adults pooled money and skills to make ends meet, and in many other configurations.
Janet W. Hardy
Back then, it never occurred to the people I knew to call those configurations "families." Today, in a more tolerant era, that old standard of the nuclear family is still encoded in our laws and our tax code, as well as in the antiquated and judgmental phrase "family values."
Among my own circle of acquaintances, I hold many "alternative families" close to my heart:
-- A man and two women who have been raising their two children together from infancy through high school.
-- Three men who have shared a loving household for nearly 20 years.
-- A "core couple," married for many decades, who have consistently surrounded themselves with long-term, live-in lovers.
-- Two couples who share a duplex and a busy and intermingled sex life.
-- A long-partnered gay man and lesbian woman who together brought a third, lesbian woman into their household because the female half of the pair missed that part of their life.
There are as many configurations of genders, ages and numbers as you can imagine. These are families as surely as any family you've welcomed into your neighborhood. They share property, raise children, tend to their homes and communities.
Last month, in a case involving the plural family portrayed on the reality show "Sister Wives," a Nevada judge overturned a ban against cohabitation, enabling consenting adults to form whatever style of household meets their desires and needs. They refused, however, to overturn the part of the law that banned plural marriages.

Most Americans, when they think of plural marriage, associate it with the one-male, multifemale households of a rebel offshoot of Mormonism and of some contemporary Muslim cultures -- popularly known as "polygamy" (many spouses of both sexes), but more accurately called "polygyny" (many wives). However, these polygynous marriages represent only a fraction of the ways in which adults form families.
Many people rightly feel some concern about religious polygyny's history of abuse and nonconsent and might feel that anti-plural marriage laws are necessary to prevent such exploitation. However, strong laws already exist against forcing anyone into sex or marriage of any kind -- vigorous enforcement would surely suffice to protect the unwilling in a plural marriage recognized under the law.
More problematic, of course, are issues such as child custody, inheritance, hospital visitation, etc., when more than two parties are involved. It is clear that the current legal structure of marriage cannot readily accommodate this problem. For that reason, the Nevada judge's ruling was probably correct, at least for now.
One solution for the future, though, might be to designate "marriage" as a social institution with no legal standing and to create "civil union" as a legally recognized subtype of business partnership, available to anyone who is willing to make the appropriate commitments.
These civil unions could range from an Ozzie and Harriet nuclear pairing to a multipartner, multigenerational line marriage out of a Robert Heinlein science fiction novel. They would be required to make agreements about how they would handle the basic functions of family -- caring for children and the elderly, sharing property, ensuring succession, and so on -- and to sign contracts, just as business partners would. If they also felt the need for the social or religious status of marriage, they could seek out an institution willing to support them in that goal.
I am sure that many marriage equality opponents reading this are shouting "I told you so!" as their predictions that plural marriage would follow same-sex marriage come nightmarishly true. Many grew up as I did, in a time and place where the single-wage-earner nuclear family was the unquestioned norm and would like to see their country conform to that unrealistic standard for the rest of history.
But even then, the nuclear family was an uncomfortable fit for many, and an impossible dream for others. The America in which I want my children and grandchildren to live will make room for all kinds of families, and it will offer the same support and benefits -- legally, financially and socially -- to any family that is based on a core of love, consent and mutual responsibility.
That's what "family values" should really be about.
Update, March 10th: In response to feedback following the release of this video, Jessica released a more in-depth video examining clean isntalls, settings back-ups, etc. The new video can be found here.
The Firestorm Tool Tip Tuesday video for March 3rd, 2015, covers what can be a thorny and intimidating issue: that of performing a clean installation of the viewer.
In an ideal world, clean installs wouldn't be needed. However, there are times when installing a newer version of a viewer over an existing version, that things which shouldn't happen do happen, and things that should have happened don't happen correctly. And while the frequency with which people are asked to perform clean installations have decreased in recent times for most viewers, they can still be the first step in avoiding later issues.
Where Firestorm is concerned, and given it has so many additionally exposed features with supporting UI elements and so on, the chances of something hiccuping during an installation and causing problems later cannot be overlooked. Hence why, when releasing a particularly complex update to the viewer, or when dealing with support requests from users after a complex update being released, Firestorm support will often advise / ask if a clean installation has been used with the new release.
To make things easier, the Firestorm team has provided additional capabilities within the viewer which allow you to not only save things like your chat logs, etc., to a dedicated folder to avoid them being lost as a result of a clean install (as is the case with all viewers), but they've provided a means to back up and restore all of your viewer settings. However, even with these capabilities, performing a completely clean install can be a daunting task for many.
So in this video, Jessica takes you through their preferred method of running a clean installation on a PC – starting from ensuring all or logs files and setting are safely saved / backed-up through to launching the viewer after a clean install and restoring all of your settings.

Memphis Police Officer Benjaman Fulcher, 35, was arrested on Tuesday after allegedly threatening their wife's friends and brandishing a weapon while threatening to shoot their wife's car if they didn't return home with him.
Fulcher was reportedly intoxicated when they arrived at the home of friends where their wife, Kimberlee Fulcher, was staying, after taking their children and leaving the home they shared with the officer. Fulcher banged on Windows and yelled for their wife and children to come out, but they ignored theirs demands.
When the homeowner went outside to confront the crazed cop and ask them to leave their property, the officer reportedly placed their hand on their holstered weapon.
The woman's boyfriend then went and confronted them in an attempt to get them to leave, and they say that is when the officer pulled out a pistol and aimed it at their wife's vehicle, threatening to shoot it if they did not go home with him, according to the arrest affidavit.

The day after the incident, Fulcher began sending text messages threatening to return and assault them. The out-of-control officer also sent photographs of items they had set on fire in their backyard, warning them, “I know they are still there, let them know the chairs, TV's and entertainment center are all coming up next.”
Their wife filed a formal complaint against Fulcher on Tuesday and they were charged with two counts of aggravated assault.  They are currently being held in jail in lieu of $50,000 bond. The Memphis Police Department has placed them on paid administrative leave.
By riding hatred of President Trump and spurring on the Russia-gate hysteria, Democrats hope to win in 2018 without a serious examination of why they lost support of key working- and middle-class voting blocs, says Andrew Spannaus.
By Andrew Spannaus
Victories in state-level elections in New Jersey and Virginia on Nov. 7 have buoyed Democratic hopes for an anti-Trump wave among the population that will lead to a big victory in next year's mid-term elections, and permanently damage President Trump heading towards 2020. Yet there is significant risk in hoping that anti-Trump sentiment will be enough for the Democrats to return to power.
The danger is that the considerable differences between the centrist faction, which for the most part controls the party structure, and the progressive wing of the party, will be swept under the rug in the name of unity, perpetuating the substantive problems that have alienated important sections of the population from the party.
The power of opposition to Trump has been on display from the very beginning: It was more than a bit ironic to see feminist protestors – properly exercising their right to protest against a President who has made many derogatory comments towards women – hold up signs defending the CIA during the Women's March on Inauguration Day.
Yes, in their zeal to oppose Trump, both the center and the far left have been willing to embrace the battle led by a limited but powerful grouping in the intelligence community to stop the President from their stated intention of improving relations with Vladimir Putin's Russia.
This has become such a cause célèbre that people who would normally look suspiciously at the motives of the CIA or other similar agencies seem unable to recognize that the basic “crime” Trump is accused of is favoring diplomacy with a country most of the institutions consider an enemy. With the media's help, it has apparently been decided that this President does not have the right to influence policy, if the majority of the establishment disagrees with their positions.
The major issue in the Democratic Party is obviously the economy. Sen. Bernie Sanders, officially an Independent from Vermont, won 43 percent of the vote in the 2016 Democratic primaries because they pushed a “populist,” anti-system message that was heavily critical of globalization, Wall Street and trade deals that have weakened the American middle class.
There were numerous similarities with the positions of Trump himself, although without the offensive language and scapegoating of various ethnic groups. Yet the Democratic élite did its best to ensure a Hillary Clinton victory, both legitimately based on the notion that Hillary would be the strongest candidate, and through actions that have led to accusations of a rigged nomination process.
A Deeper Problem
The recent spat raised by the publication of Donna Brazile's new book Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns That Put Donald Trump in the White House (Hachette, November 2017) shows that the issue is still being fought out.
Indeed in October, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez unveiled their picks for the party's Executive Committee, and many Sanders supporters immediately complained that their faction was being sidelined. One of the key removals was that of James Zogby, whose pro-Palestinian positions are clearly unappreciated by many higher-ups, who prefer to avoid criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
In terms of economic policy, the question is whether the party will embrace the progressive message espoused by Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts or maintain a centrist tone by avoiding positions considered “unrealistic” according to Washington veterans; many of these political operators fear losing their influence if the terms of the debate change.
Two of the major issues Sanders and Warren have been fighting for are incisive reforms regarding healthcare and the banking sector. In September, Sanders presented a bill for a single-payer health care system under the name of Medicare-for-All, and has been holding numerous public events on the issue, joined by Warren and various other Senators.
Policymakers and industry representatives tend to shudder at such “radical” proposals, but the political calculus is clearly that you need to set your sights high if you want to achieve anything at all. This proposition was proven – although negatively – by the numerous compromises made by Barack Obama in the first year of their presidency.
On financial reform, the key issue is the restoration of Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era law that separates commercial banks and investment banks, in order to protect the real economy from financial speculation. The law was officially repealed in 1999, at the end of Bill Clinton's administration, in the context of a gradual loosening of financial regulations that began in the 1980s.
The results are before our eyes: the crash of 2007-2008 – despite the weak attempts by Wall Street defenders to divert attention from deregulation as a cause for the crisis – and its political aftermath; this includes the election of Donald Trump, which certainly would not have happened if there had been a more effective response to the crisis, rather than bailing out the banks while imposing austerity and lower wages on the population.
Excuses, Excuses
The Democratic Party platform adopted the call for Glass-Steagall in 2016 (as did the Republicans), although Clinton had repeatedly stated their opposition to the measure, claiming they would be really tough on Wall Street in other ways. Many people clearly didn't believe her; and taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from large banks for speeches exemplified the candidate's lack of credibility.
Why should workers in states such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania trust someone who was soft on Wall Street, and had trumpeted international trade deals for years?
This is the issue that the Democratic Party must tackle. To say that Hillary won the popular vote, and thus essentially the election, but was robbed by Russian interference or fake news on the Internet, means to ignore the fundamental problem. A realignment is underway of electoral politics throughout the Western world.
Profiling voters based on their ethnicity, gender or social group showed its limits in 2016, as people followed an anti-establishment instinct fomented by the economic difficulties associated with globalization.
There were other factors, but this protest vote was enough to swing the election despite Trump's obvious weaknesses as a candidate, so any notion of going back to old models should be recognized for what it would produce: a Pyrrhic victory in which the underlying problems before the country are not faced.
If the Democrats hope to ride an anti-Trump wave, they would do best to look below the surface and recognize the tectonic shifts taking place, that much of the political establishment seems to prefer to ignore.

Nope this isn't an Onion article. Tom Currie is a 24-year-old Auckland man who was burnt out at their job and decided to quit in order to catch'em all.
“I wanted to have an adventure. I have been working for six years and I was desparete for a break. And Pokémon has given me the chance to live that dream.” – said Currie
So they decided to grab their backpack and armed only with their phone they will be traveling New Zealand for the next 2 months trying to capture all the Pokémon. Currie has booked 20 bus trips around their native country and visited six South Island towns. So far they have manage to capture 90 of 150 Pokémon in the game. Meanwhile I have barely left my house and already managed to capture 54!
From all the ground Currie has traveled they sleep well at night having walked miles hunting sometimes until 3:00 AM. Yikes. However outside of the business trips their adventure has been realatively cheap. They have been able to sleep on friends couches and backpacker dorms. Companies like Uber caught wind of their story and offered them free rides.
“I think the most exciting experience so far was in Sumner, Christchurch, which has become a hot spot for Pokémon hunters,” Currie said.
“There were about 100 people there hunting. And some of these people would usually be shut up at home and really reclusive. Hunting for Pokémon is bringing them into the real world. It was such a buzzy atmosphere, when someone spotted a rare Pokémon they would shout out to alert the crowd.” Follow along and watch people hunt on Twitch!
The Pokémon craze has swept the nation like nothing we have ever seen before. Weekly users have now surpassed that of Twitter and Tinder and it has only been out a little over a week. The app helped boost Nintendo's stock by 86% so far and continues to climb. Their overall company value has now reached $17 Billion.
Despite Republican defections and a staunch Democratic defense, Betsy DeVos has been confirmed as the Secretary of Education for Donald Trump's administration. The final vote was 51-50, with Vice President Mike Pence casting the tie-breaking vote.
Republicans Lisa Murkoski and Susan Collins were the two Republicans who voted against DeVos, thereby making the tie-breaker necessary. It is the first time in the history of the Senate that the Vice President has had to cast a tie-breaker for a Cabinet nomination.
The DeVos nomination has been the fiercest battle fought during Trump's transition. Democrats have been far more overwhelmingly negative toward them than many of Trump's other nominees. Education reform advocates have overwhelmingly been in support of her, however, while many of their critics are also recipients of major donations from teachers unions across the country.
Power Girl has had a problem. Cory Walker pointed out the problem, if applied to a ‘Power Man'.
Writers have had them make an excuse or give a reason for the costume choice over the years.
“shows what I am: female, healthy. If men want to degrade themselves by staring, that's their problem, I'm not going to apologize for it.”
or
And as for not wearing a mask..
“…it's because most of the time, they ain't looking at my face.”
Originally a cousin of Superman, they defined themselves as something else, rejecting attempts to align them to an S or even a P, especially not being a ‘Supergirl'….
But that was abandoned recently reinvented in the New 52.
But soon the “boob window” was back.
In New 52: Futures End we saw them destroy that costume.
Only for it to haunt them next choice.
And even see it reoccur in their successor on Earth One.
Though that was soon fixed.
But they have been back in the old costume again in World's Finest, Earth 2 and Earth 2: Worlds End.
And Harley Quinn sent the whole thing up.
Well, in today's Earth 2: World's End, we get another solution. But one that seems to abandon their previous desires to be seen as something other than a “carbon copy” of Superman. In the aftermath of dealing with the death of the new Superman.
Have the chauvinist piglets won? And yeah, about that last bit…

You may not need to read this column for yourself, but read it nonetheless and help those with less wariness take better heed: Don't download software for OS X from anywhere but the developer's own website or Apple. Period.
For many longtime Mac users, this is obvious advice. Long ago, maybe even with System 6 or 7, you learned the hard way or through observation about malware, including both viruses and Trojan Horses. Maybe it came later, after the Internet grew, but many developers couldn't afford fast pipes or enough bandwidth, and you wound up getting installers for software that were larded with crap.
Congratulations to you for having gotten so savvy, but there are an untold million of Mac users who didn't go through those tough lessons or observations. Many download sites have tweaked their “Google juice”—aka their search-engine optimization or SEO–so that they appear as a result above the legitimate developer of a software product. That developer has likely not authorized them to offer their product for free download, because there's no benefit to the software maker to have someone go to another site, and a lot of room for blame if something goes wrong.
For free, freemium, or trial software, many users will search for the name of the product and click the top link, or a sponsored link from one of these sites. (Many users are, unfortunately, also looking for “free” downloads of commercial software, or cracked freemium software that offers the premium features without paying for a license code.)
But the experience last week of a user noticing that a download of Skype from MacUpdate was wrapped in an installer that contained adware and trialware reminds me to run the flag up the pole again to remind folks who weren't aware—and to ask all of you who understand the issue to help your friends, colleagues, and family avoid these risks.
Consider the source
Typically, you can find the appropriate site for a developer by simply scrolling down and looking carefully. When I search for “download Skype Mac” on Google, half the links that fit into the first browser view are for third-party download sites. However, Skype.com is the very top link. It's less adorned, however, lacking the review stars that Google enhances the download sites' free links with. (If you think this is obvious, do the search, and without looking closely, hover over the one you think is the best match. Was it Skype.com?)
Finding reviews of products at reputable sites (ahem, ahem) with links to the developer's site is also a good indication you're in the right place. You can also use social media, like Twitter, to find a developer's account, from which you can then find their authorized website. Most of the time, only the most-popular applications are being hijacked.
Apple's Mac App Store is just old enough that it rode the end of an expensive-bandwidth period, and Apple's 30-percent cut included the price of downloads and the cost of success: Ostensibly, a user will never be unable to download a program from the App Store due to a server being overloaded, which could otherwise scotch a sale. This is part of why 30 percent seems far too huge now. But even with researchers finding holes related to App Store approval and security this year, it remains safe.
The only difficulty people may face is with Gatekeeper, found in the Security & Privacy preference pane as Allow Apps Downloaded From. Some developers choose not to go through the steps necessary to get a certificate from Apple with which they can cryptographically sign apps they release directly. I certainly don't recommend setting Gatekeeper to Anywhere, because that allows any downloaded app to be run. Rather, keep it set to “Mac App Store and Identified Developers,” and then, after vetting the downloaded app is legitimate, you can always right-click the app in the Finder, select Open in the contextual menu, and confirm you want to run it.
Keeping Gatekeeper set to Mac App Store and Identified Developers limits risk substantially, though doesn't remove it entirely.
One friend who works in the library world says there are a surprising number of useful, free, minimally supported, unsigned apps for that market. Several utilities I use, typically obscure, are also unsigned. But in all cases, downloading them from the developer's site minimizes risk. (Signed apps can be bad news, too, but Apple can pull the maker's certificate centrally, killing its approval everywhere through Gatekeeper.)
Poor bedfellows
In 2015, there's zero need for a developer to host their software downloads elsewhere. I pay about $100 a month for a virtual private server (VPS) at Linode that includes 3 terabytes (TB) of data transfer—yes, three terabytes—on top of the actual function, which is a high-performance, SSD-based server with a gigabit-per-second Internet link.
Those 3TB are constrained by the input/output of that single server, so if I worry about hundreds or thousands of simultaneous downloads, I can shift to Amazon S3 starting at 9 cents a gigabyte (or $90 per terabyte) for downloads. There are cheaper options, too, with content-distribution networks (CDNs).
So a developer that preferentially works with a software-download site, referring visitors to their website to a link at one of those locations, is almost always doing so because they receive compensation from the site, which in turn gets paid based on software that's installed or subscriptions started from bundled packages. How-To Geek looked at the top 10 Windows downloads from Download.com earlier this year, and what was installed, and it's appalling. It's an entire economy built around installing stuff that people don't want and that doesn't help them.
I can't think of any Mac software from a major company or independent developer that I've seen distributed this way since these sites started to turn into adware-distribution centers a few years ago. MacUpdate was trusted until now, but appears to have pivoted its model so that it bundles some downloads with third-party installers and software for those who aren't paid subscribers. (I sent a query to MacUpdate about this issue, and haven't heard back.)
Every day I receive email to Mac 911 from people who inadvertently downloaded an installer package that contains MacKeeper or similar unnecessary or even harmful third-party software. It typically begins, “I know I shouldn't have installed this…” Go with that impulse: If the first screen you see looks wrong, stop, drop, and roll that file away.
CIA Director John Brennan “wouldn't be surprised” to see more hacked information leaking out prior to the November election, they told CBS News in an interview aired Wednesday night.
“I think there are capabilities that a number of our adversaries have — and again I'm not just talking about nation-states or other countries — I'm talking about individuals who may want to demonstrate that they're able to hack into systems and release things for whatever their agenda might be, whether it be a political agenda or one that is just trying to undermine our system of democracy here,” Brennan said.

Materials stolen from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) were published on the anti-secrecy platform WikiLeaks on the eve of the Democratic National Convention in July, embarrassing officials and leading to the resignation of the party's chairperson, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.).
The attack was widely seen as an effort by Russia to influence the outcome of the election.
Then this week, a series of stolen emails from the account of former Secretary of State Colin Powell were made public by a site with reported links to Russian intelligence.
Although Brennan did not specifically blame Russia for the attack on the DNC, according to CBS, they did point to Russia's known history of meddling in other countries' elections.
The White House has refused to publicly attribute the attack to Russia, despite nearly unanimous consensus from security experts. Law enforcement officials, speaking anonymously, have also indicated that all signs point to Russia.

The Democratic front-runner said in an interview last week that Trump has “a penchant for sexism” after the billionaire said they “got schlonged” in losing to then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008.
“It's not the first time he's demonstrated a penchant for sexism,” Hillary Clinton told The Des Moines Register. “Again, I'm not sure anybody's surprised that they keep pushing the envelope."
Trump later warned Clinton to "be careful as you play the war on women or women being degraded card."
Trump's campaign also claimed that the Democratic front-runner bullied women to hide their husband's “sexist secrets."
Trump later Saturday repeated their claim that Hillary Clinton does not have the stamina for the Oval Office, tweeting that they would “do far more for women than Hillary” and would “keep our country safe, something which they will not be able to do.”

They aren't the type of calls that Iqbal Sunderani thought they would ever get. Parents who have lost their children to fentanyl overdoses ring up their biotechnology company on a regular basis.
They say they are desperate to get their hands on drug testing strips that can detect the powerful opioid, which could prevent other families from suffering the same loss.
"It's heartbreaking to hear the stories, I am a parent myself, " said Sunderani, CEO of BTNX, which is based in Markham, Ont.

When they ask to buy the strips, however, Sunderani tells them no. They say they don't want to give people a false sense of security and worries about potential liability.
"We have to be cautious in distributing these tests," they said.
"The last thing you want is that someone has overdosed and there is a test on the floor showing negative."
Off-label use
Sunderani says the strips they sell were never meant as a tool to help combat the opioid crisis. They were originally marketed to labs and police agencies.
In 2016, BTNX sold 75,000 of the fentanyl drug tests. So far this year, it has sold more than 200,000 tests, many of them to harm reduction workers in Canada and the United States, who use them off label to test street drugs for fentanyl.
Because the strips are unlicensed in Canada for use as an illicit drug test, they can only legally be used at supervised injection sites and overdose prevention centres.
"We recognize that it isn't available enough," said Dr. Mark Lysyshyn, a medical health officer with Vancouver Coastal Health.
Even though most of B.C.'s overdose deaths are happening in private residences, officials say staff aren't handing out the strips to people to take off site because they want to be able to track how people are using them and what they are finding.
Lysyshyn says there hasn't been enough research on how the strips would be used by people at home and there are questions how they would interpret the results.
Ideally, they say they would like to offer the testing at community health centres and use the strips alongside an infrared spectrometer that's able to detail a drug's ingredients.
"Before we can offer them in the community, we either need sort of the go-ahead from the provincial government to say yes... or we need to work with Health Canada to get an exemption and we know that process can be very long," Lysyshyn said.
BTNX is working with health officials in Vancouver to develop a protocol around how the strips should be used.
Pilot project
The strips were part of a study conducted by Vancouver Coastal Health last year at Insite, a supervised injection site in Vancouver.
At the time, officials say they found that about 80 per cent of the drugs tested contained fentanyl, and that people were less likely to overdose after getting their drugs checked. That's because they found that those with a positive result were 10 times more likely to cut back on the amount of drugs they were taking.
Dr. Mark Lysyshyn of Vancouver Coastal Health says the test strips have limitations, which is why more research and education around them is needed before they are made widely available. (Glen Kugelstadt/CBC)
In order to do a test, a few granules of the drug are dissolved in water. The strip is then dipped in that solution. At first, there was uncertainty about what the test could detect, but BTNX now says it's capable of finding fentanyl and 10 of its analogs, including the highly toxic carfentanil.
Still, Lysyshyn says there are limitations. The strips can detect fentanyl, but they don't measure just how much is in the drugs.
Fear of false negatives
A negative test is also no guarantee.
"We really don't know what goes into the illicit drugs," Sunderani said. "The analogs they can manufacture synthetically can change just like that."
Last year BTNX sold 75,000 of the fentanyl drug tests to harm reduction workers in North America. So far this year, it has sold more than 200,000. (CBC)
Health Canada says it conducted a preliminary study on the drug testing strips and compared their accuracy to sophisticated laboratory tests. The department concluded that more research is needed.
Sales stopped
Health Canada and the College of Pharmacists in Manitoba stepped in last year when a Winnipeg pharmacy started selling the test strips. BTNX says the strips are routinely sold to pharmacies that run methadone clinics and they are supposed to be used by the pharmacists to screen their patient's urine for drugs. But in this case, the boxes were stocked on a shelf and being sold to the public.
"We had them for sale, I think, for a day or two," said Michael Watts, owner of Brothers Pharmacy.
After an investigation by Health Canada, the College of Pharmacists asked Watts to stop selling them. They say that was disappointing.
"We are trying to protect the public and I felt that it was a little short sighted on their behalf, but I understand there were legalities involved," they said.
More than 1,100 people have died of overdoses in British Columbia this year. The majority of deaths have taken place inside private residences. (Briar Stewart/CBC)
In the United States, where there are no legal supervised injection sites, some harm-reduction workers hand out the strips like they do clean syringes.
While BTNX says it has some concerns with the strips being dispensed that way, Sunderani says harm reduction workers have assured them they are training people on how to use the strips and outlining the limitations.
Van Asher, who works at St. Ann's Corner of Harm Reduction in New York City, first heard about about them after reading about the Insite study.
Before handing them out, they created a training video and educational material for users.
"People keep asking for them. I just ordered another 2,000," they said."We want people to use them, we want people to not die."
About 64,000 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2016. Asher says they are willing to try anything to fight an "impossible battle."
High demand
In Massachusetts, harm reduction activist Jess Tilley says they spent thousands of dollars of their own money to purchase and distribute the test strips and recently launched GoFundMe campaigns to continue. They have been doing street outreach for more than 20 years and says they have seen the kind of impact the test strips can have on behaviour.
Michael Watts, owner of Brothers Pharmacy in Winnipeg, tried to sell the fentanyl strips. But they were told to pull them from the shelf because they are not licensed by Health Canada to be used as an illicit drug test. (Lyzaville Sale/CBC)
"I have people that tell me, 'No way, my heroin would never have fentanyl in it,'" they said. "And then they see it and say, 'Oh, well maybe I should only do half."
Tilley says they have been particularly targeting recreational drug users, especially after a number of college students in the state overdosed on cocaine laced with fentanyl.
"It seems like every Friday night I have the classic jock boys calling me up, saying can we get some of those fentanyl test strips, because they have cocaine and they don't want to die."
HTML code for embedding | Share on Facebook | Support MFA's work On September 24, 2010, Billy Joe Gregg, Jr., a worker at Conklin Dairy Farms caught on hidden camera during a Mercy For Animals investigation maliciously abusing cows and calves, pleaded guilty to six misdemeanor counts of cruelty to animals. Gregg was sentenced to eight months in jail, ordered to pay a $1,000 fine, and is barred from contact with animals for three years. Gregg must also receive counseling through a program that specializes in treating individuals involved in animal abuse cases. Gregg's arrest and conviction stem from chilling undercover footage recorded during a Mercy For Animals investigation earlier this year at Conklin Dairy Farms in Plain City, Ohio. During a four-week investigation in April and May, MFA's investigator documented farmworkers: Violently punching young calves in the face, body slamming them to the ground, and pulling and throwing them by their ears
Routinely using pitchforks to stab cows in the face, legs and stomach
Kicking "downed" cows (those too injured to stand) in the face and neck – abuse carried out and encouraged by the farm's owner
Maliciously beating restrained cows in the face with crowbars – some attacks involving over 40 blows to the head
Twisting cows' tails until the bones snapped
Punching cows' udders
Bragging about stabbing, dragging, shooting, breaking bones, and beating cows and calves to death After viewing the footage, Dr. Bernard Rollin, Distinguished Professor of Animal Science at Colorado State University, stated: ""This is probably the most gratuitous, sustained, sadistic animal abuse I have ever seen. The video depicts calculated, deliberate cruelty, based not on momentary rage but on taking pleasure through causing pain to cows and calves who are defenseless."" Sadly, cruelty to farmed animals in Ohio – no matter how egregious – is classified as a mere misdemeanor. Ohio has some of the weakest animal protection laws in the nation – ranking 43rd out of all 50 states. Further, no federal laws provide protection for farmed animals during their lives on the farm. Such inadequate state laws and the absence of federal laws lead to rampant abuse. The deplorable conditions uncovered at Conklin Dairy Farms further highlight the reality that animal agriculture cannot be trusted to self-regulate and that meaningful federal and state law must be implemented and strengthened to prevent egregious cruelty to farmed animals. "Gregg's punishment is a slap on the wrist compared to the unimaginable suffering endured by the animals who were victims of their malicious abuse," says MFA's Executive Director, Nathan Runkle. ""It's an outrage that in Ohio it's a mere misdemeanor to sadistically punch, beat and stab farmed animals, break their bones and otherwise torture them. This case should serve as a wake-up call to all compassionate citizens that Ohio must do more to strengthen its animal cruelty laws."" Although many of the abuses documented at Conklin Dairy Farms are expressions of Gregg's sadistic pathology, numerous MFA undercover investigations at dairy farms, pig farms, egg farms, hatcheries and slaughterhouses have revealed that violence and abuse to farmed animals – whether malicious or institutionalized – run rampant nationwide. Compassionate consumers can end their direct financial support of farmed animal abuse by rejecting dairy, and other animal products, and adopting a vegan diet.
Delhi Law Minister Somnath Bharti argues with a police officer while trying to conduct a raid
Delhi Law Minister Somnath Bharti's attempt to carry out a surprise raid on what they alleged was a drug and prostitution ring ended in an unseemly roadside argument between the minister and the Delhi Police and is now snowballing into a controversy.The police allege Mr Bharti tried to force them to conduct a search on a building late on Wednesday night without a warrant, and question women, which is prohibited after dark. The minister says in "emergency situations", a warrant is not necessary.The law minister, who maintained that alleged sex workers were hiding in the building, is seen arguing loudly with a police officer on camera. "You go in and raid,", Mr Bharti is seen ordering the police officer, who keeps saying, "You are not letting us work. Let us do our job."Mr Bharti said on receiving people's complaints about "Nigerian nationals involved in sex trade and drugs" at the building in Khirki Extension, which is in their constituency in south Delhi, they had decided to "catch them red-handed", along with the police."The police left us here. They are not ready to search, they are not ready to raid. They didn't even listen to me, the law minister. Will they listen to people? The girls tried to run away. But we caught two of them," they said. They claim that people could be heard discussing 'rates for girls."One of the women, a Nigerian national, was sent for a medical test to the AIIMS hospital and has reportedly been found drug-free. The police have set up a probe and will report to Lieutenant-Governor Najeeb Jung.The 39-year-old minister has been in the news lately for more than one controversy. Two days ago, they fended off allegations that as a defence lawyer in a case last year, they had tampered with evidence. Mr Bharti was also criticised for trying to call judges for a meeting just after taking charge last month, and berating their Law Secretary when told that the judiciary could not be summoned this way.
Richard Keenan
A former Ohio mayor has admitted to repeatedly raping a child, prosecutors said — but the self-described Christian blames the girl for their own sexual abuse.
Richard Keenan, who served as mayor of Hubbard in 2010 and 2011, was indicted last month eight counts of rape and 12 counts of attempted rape and gross sexual imposition, reported the Youngstown Vindicator.
The 65-year-old Keenan pleaded not guilty last month during a court appearance, but prosecutors said they admitted to sexually assaulting the girl over a three-year period, beginning when they were 4 years old.
Prosecutors said Keenan confessed to the sex abuse to their wife, a pastor, a social worker and their brother- and sister-in-law.
According to court filings, the child told Keenan's wife about the abuse and they confronted them — and they then admitted “I did it.”
Keenan also admitted the abuse during group discussions at a nearby hospital, and they then voluntarily checked themselves into a psychiatric facility because they were suicidal.
They told a social worker there that they had molested the girl for at least two years, beginning in September 2013, but they blamed the child for initiating the sex acts and described them as a “willing participant.”
Keenan, who bragged about their Christian values after they were sworn in as mayor, also discussed the abuse at length with a pastor.
“I'm a Christian,” Keenan told the Vindicator in 2010. “Dedicating my life to Jesus has changed my life. Don't preach it, but live it.”
Prosecutors have filed a motion asking Judge Peter Kontos to rule on whether those documented admissions may be presented to jurors as evidence, or whether they are privileged — which would prohibit their inclusion at trial.
Husbands and wives may testify against their spouse if they wish under Ohio rules of evidence.
Pastors cannot be compelled to testify under Ohio law if confessions or confidential statements are made directly to them.
Keenan, who is scheduled to stand trial in April, remains free on $75,000 bond.
They also served on City Council in the 1990s, when they also worked as a probation officer.
If convicted, Keenan faces a possible life sentence.

The story of Windows Phone market share within itself is now a familiar one, with budget phones abounding. Last month we saw a rapid entry of the new Microsoft Lumia 535 to many markets, including India. AdDuplex (AdDuplex.com) has now released its numbers for February, 2015, and they mainly reflect this trend. No surprises here as the biggest gains were seen by the Lumia 530, Lumia 630/635 and the Microsoft branded Lumia 535. However, some new unannounced Lumias were also spotted, giving us a peek at next week's MWC event.
Low-end dominates globally Worldwide, the Lumia 530 and Lumia 630/635 series now accounts for nearly 20% of the Windows Phone ecosystem. This number is up from 16.8% just last month, and it continues to demonstrate the success of Microsoft's entry-level Windows Phone strategy. Interestingly, the Lumia 535 now appears on the charts nabbing 3.1% of the global Windows Phone market. The 5-inch budget phone seems to be hitting all the right notes with customers, mostly due to its generous display, dual 5 MP front and rear cameras and 1 GB of RAM.
Lumia 535 gaining on Lumia 520 in India Last month, the Lumia 535 rocketed to 9.1% of the Indian Windows Phone market. This month that growth continues pushing the device to 15%, nearing closer to the Lumia 520's massive 25% share of the Lumia market.
Nokia name does not matter? Perhaps the most interesting takeaway that has gone unmentioned is the Nokia name change. Having acquired the Nokia mobile handset division, the Lumia 535 represents the first Microsoft-branded Lumia Windows Phone. Many people were under the impression that phasing out the Nokia name from the Lumia line would be dire, due to brand loyalty. The contention was that new Lumia phones would not sell as well with the lack of Nokia branding, especially in emerging markets like India where the Nokia name carries more weight than in the US. This concern over naming now seems to be nonsense, as the Lumia 535 is clearly doing very well in most markets where it has been introduced. Although the Nokia brand is dead for smartphones, the Lumia spirit clearly lives on with Microsoft. So far, the market has not negatively reflected upon this change.
Windows 10 preview gets 0.2% Although the Windows 10 Preview for phones is relatively new, having only been released this month to a subset of Lumia Windows Phones, it has already picked up 0.2% of the share. This number is an almost negligible. However, it does seem to demonstrate a strong interest in Microsoft's upcoming operating system. Considering how early of a build it is, it will be fascinating to see how that number changes in the coming months. Meanwhile, Windows Phone 8.1 heads to 68% of the Windows Phone OS market, gaining another 5% over last month.
New devices? Finally, AdDuplex highlights numerous unannounced phones appearing in their database. These findings include: Microsoft/Nokia RM1062 through1067 – 720x1280 5.7-inch display, including a version for AT&T
Microsoft RM1072 through1077 – 720x1280 5-inch display There are also reports of a phone with a 480x800 4-inch display, but details are scarce. Next week, Microsoft is expected to announce two phones at Mobile World Congress, neither of which are flagship or high-end phones. Indeed, Microsoft looks to be continuing to push in the emerging and budget phone arena, a space where they are demonstrably having much success. The Lumia 640 and Lumia 1330 have been device names batted around, and it will be curious to see how those rumors align with what is revealed next week.
Imagine if you could perform daily activities from a third person view watching everything you do every step of the way. With the Avatar Machine created by Marc Owens, you can actually get a third person view of the world around you.
“Avatar Machine is a system which replicates the aesthetics and visuals of third person gaming, allowing the user to view themselves as a virtual character in real space via a head-mounted interface,” says Owens' Vimeo page.
The machine is a VR suit constructed with a camera that hovers behind the user. This camera gives the user a third person view of the world that can be seen through the suit's headset. It also seems to have gotten an overhaul from the puffy suit iterations seen before. Check out the video here.
Owens' site says that the Avatar Machine “potentially allows for a diminished sense of social responsibility and could lead the user to demonstrate behaviors normally reserved for the gaming environment.” If you had access to this suit, what would you do (other than look ridiculous)?
To hear the 45-year-old singing ventriloquist tell it, until quite recently they were a dummy. They had several puppet masters, but they reserve a special enmity for one in particular. The press—including me—have portrayed their ex-wife as a victim, but Mirage headliner Terry Fator wants us to know otherwise.
“The issues that were happening in my first marriage were happening for years before,” they said last week, more than two years after leaving Melinda, their wife of 18 years. “I mistakenly thought success would fix those issues, and it made them even worse.”
Fator dumped Melinda just as their Mirage residency began and wed their 22-year-old onstage assistant the day after their divorce was finalized in November 2010. In doing so, they seemed to be a walking show-biz cliché, the one in which a new celebrity trades the spouse who stood by in the fallow years for a younger and previously unattainable model.
Now the presumed cad says there was more to it, and in the process they have unraveled the feel-good story that won the hearts of America's Got Talent viewers as well as the Vegas media. Melinda, a key part of Fator's lore, was cast as the only one who believed in them and the rock that supported them through years of empty theaters and county fairs.
Their new story: Melinda was a self-aggrandizing, hen-pecking control freak who alienated them from their family and refused to bear them children. They remained married because their Christian upbringing prohibited divorce, but once they became successful they also became empowered.
“When I wrote my first book, my ex-wife went through it and got really angry with me because I didn't give them enough credit for enough stuff, so they edited it,” they said. “When you're stuck in a marriage ... I was like, ‘Well, I might as well make this look good because I'm unhappy but I'm stuck.'”
Melinda Fator, unsurprisingly, has a different account. While they declined to provide a detailed response, they insisted that they didn't edit their book for anything other than grammar and spelling, and that an argument over children “never happened.” They said they were unaware of their intense discontent until they demanded a separation.
“He's playing the victim card, and that's not right,” they said. “He is trying to play off all of their decisions on everyone else and try to not take responsibility for anything.” (Hear both Fators and judge for yourself on the newest episode of my podcast at thestrippodcast.com.)
Terry Fator cops to some of that, though they only cops to being guilty of permitting it to happen. They complained about being controlled not only by their wife but also by “handlers” who directed their career and the content of their show after their AGT triumph in 2007. They also called themselves “too big of a wimp” to assert himself. Their handlers, they said, pushed them to do more sexual humor than they were comfortable with and encouraged them to try divisive political jokes in a gambit to be provocative. (He didn't name anyone, but Fator split with post-AGT manager John McEntee in 2009 and settled with them out of court last fall.)
There's a contradiction, though. Fator claims that their handlers both pushed them to be Vegas-edgy and warned them that leaving Melinda could alienate their fans. You'd think if they wanted them edgy, having them single and cavorting with a young, hot babe would be just the ticket, right?
It's hard to know what actually happened, especially when Melinda Fator's response to several accusations was: “He knows the truth; I know the truth; they know I know the truth. So whatever they choose to put out there is their business. I've never bad-mouthed them in the press. I will not bad-mouth them in the press.”
That certainly is the high road. And to be fair, it must be noted that I spoke with Terry Fator over the phone. It sure sounded like their voice, but I wasn't there to see whether their lips moved, so who knows?
That's the trickiest part of interviewing a dummy.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Only around one in nine professional authors could earn a living solely from their writing in 2013
Almost half of the money made by professional authors is earned by just 5% of writers, according to a study of authors' earnings in the UK.
The top 5% of authors earned 42% of all income received by professional writers in 2013, according to The Authors' Licensing and Collecting Society.
Meanwhile, the bottom half of professional writers accounted for just 7% of all authors' earnings overall.
The society said last year that writers earned 29% less in 2013 than 2005.
"The creative industries are thriving, generating £76bn per annum, yet professional writers have seen a near 30% reduction in earnings in recent years," the society's head of rights Richard Combes said.
"Consequently many are no longer able to sustain a career. The one truly irreplaceable link in the value chain is being stretched to breaking point."
Analysis: Will Gompertz, arts editor
There is a paradox for an author in 2015. It is harder than ever to make money from writing. And yet there are more people writing and publishing books than ever before. The market is reasonably stable but it can't begin to accommodate the hundreds of thousands of new books flooding it every year.
You don't have to be a maths scholar to work out the financial ramifications. Nor the consumer response. Readers, with little spare time are overwhelmed by the choice and end up sticking to what the authors they already know and trust.
Hence the big brand authors trade even better in an overcrowded market. Which is why literary prizes are so important. They provide a platform for new writing and an endorsed product on which time- poor punters can take a risk.
While a typical full-time writer earned £11,000 a year in 2013, the top 5% each earned at least £100,100, the research showed.
The report said: "Thus, it appears that writing is a profession where only a handful of successful authors make a very good living while most do not."
Around one in six writers did not earn any money from their writing in 2013, it said - despite 98% saying their work had been published or used in other ways.
And 11.5% of authors now earn a living solely from their writing - down from 40% a decade ago.

CLOSE Carly Mallenbaum hosts BackStage about the second issue of 'Superman Wonder Woman,' out today. What happens when Superman meets Wonder Woman's parents?
DC Comics superheroes find relationship drama and epic action in comic-book series.
The 'Superman/Wonder Woman' series balances relationship drama with big superhero action. (Photo11: DC Comics) Story Highlights The Man of Steel meets Diana's family in 'Superman/Wonder Woman' No. 2
Creative team balances relationship drama with action-packed scenes
Not everybody is pleased that they're a supercouple
It's not a "meet cute" moment in a favorite romantic comedy but just as memorable a courtship exchange: Superman brings Wonder Woman an exotic flower from nearby their arctic Fortress of Solitude, and they want to go teach them some fight moves.
Writer Charles Soule (Swamp Thing) and artist Tony Daniel (Action Comics) are exploring the mostly uncharted dating life of superheroes and balancing it with epic action sequences in their DC Comics series Superman/Wonder Woman.
And that asupervisorstioned scene in the first issue showcases one of the main things that Soule wants out of their series: a deep-dive into superpowered relationships. (So far, fans are feeling the love, too. According to Diamond Comics Distributors, the debut issue was the No. 7 comic in all of October, out-selling even Neil Gaiman's much-ballyhooed return to The Sandman.)
"They're both coming at it from the place of 'I want to share something of myself with this other person,' which is a noble goal. But they're both very different," Soule says of their supercouple.
"Superman was raised in the apple-pie Kansas town of Smallville, and Diana was raised in a warrior society on an island in the sea that no one gets to go to. They bring very different things to the table, but they both have the same goal: to share something of themselves and try to build something together."
Out Wednesday, Superman/Wonder Woman No. 2 begins with an epic throwdown between Wonder Woman and the powerful Man of Steel foe Doomsday after a mysterious force knocked the heck out of Superman. More conflict arises with the likes of Kryptonian foes Zod and Faora and things ramp in upcoming issues — especially the last few buzzworthy pages, says Soule — as the power couple's relationship goes public.
Superman and Wonder Woman each have friends they can turn to who are rooting for a successful lovelife — Cat Grant may not know their journalist partner, Clark Kent, is actually Superman but they dig the idea of them having a hot date.
Not everybody is so happy about this coupling. Issue 2 features a meet-the-parents scenario where Superman and Wonder Woman go to visit Diana's family, the Olympian gods that Brian Azzarello has been writing in the main Wonder Woman series.
"The gods are very imperious, they're very cocky, they mess with people because they think they're superior to everyone on Earth, but then you have Superman, who is basically a god in their own right, and there's some really fun tension," Soule says.
Because it's a big superhero story featuring two of DC Comics' most famous characters, "it's tempting and almost habitual to write them as icons," the writer adds. "That's how they come across — if you were to see Superman or Wonder Woman, you wouldn't be able to process them as a person."
But it's writing them as people that is the key, according to Soule, who has been digging into what makes them tick and do the things they do for the relationship aspect.
"I feel like I'm more in the head of Superman and Wonder Woman than I've ever been before as a reader," they say, "which you would hope me being the person writing it."
As far as those courtship experiences and the intimate moments between the two, Soule's primary source is drawing from their own emotional experiences and letting them color a relationship between a man and woman who are more than just superfriends.
"I've never had one that's precisely like Superman and Wonder Woman — I don't think anyone has, which is why it's an interesting book to read," Soule says. "But at the same time I can extrapolate from situations I've been in and discussions I've had with friends I've known, and I try and make it feel as real as possible."
In both the action beats and the love story, Soule and Daniel strive to balance the ordinary and the extraordinary.
"It would be a terrible waste to have a comic book with Tony Daniel drawing them having milkshakes the whole time," Soule says.
A large splash page with Superman lifting a large Norwegian ship to save the day is something the artist is well known for doing, yet it's a different kind of thrill in the quieter moments where Daniel has to craft the right character detail for a scene, such as a Superman smirk or a glint in Wonder Woman's eye.
They work hard on those scenes "to convey their emotional responses and interactions with each other so they're not just cardboard cutouts I paste on the page," Daniel says.
"Superman is still Superman, but if I can catch that vulnerability in a certain moment they might be having with Wonder Woman, or vice versa for Wonder Woman with Superman, I'm happy with that."
Not retreading the same old kind of superhero story is refreshing for readers but also Soule and Daniel as creators.
It's timing such as the one in an upcoming issue when Wonder Woman is discussing with a confidante how to handle something personal with Superman "that make these characters a little bit more identifiable," Daniel says.
"Then when we get to see them in harm's way and fighting these superpowered beings and monsters, it makes us care for the characters that much more when we can really relate to them."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama this week celebrates the civil rights advances of 50 years ago which laid the groundwork for them to become the first black president, but their own record in making life better for the African-American community that catalyzed their election is mixed.

Obama will join former presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush in speaking at the Lyndon Baines Johnson presidential library in Austin, Texas, this week to mark a half century since Johnson's landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act.
As the first African-American president, Obama is the physical embodiment of racial progress that Johnson brought about. The civil rights law, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the creation of Medicare were instrumental in improving equality for racial minorities and putting desegregation in the past.
“What you can say is that trio of laws allowed for the ascent of Barack Obama to the presidency and any other person of color who might follow in their wake,” said Mark Updegrove, director of the LBJ library.
Obama's top success for African-Americans was gaining passage of the Affordable Care Act, the healthcare law that, after a rocky rollout, is intended as a safety net for millions of Americans. In addition, efforts by Obama's attorney general, Eric Holder, to aggressively enforce civil rights laws are welcome in the African-American community.
But creating jobs for black Americans has been a struggle. The annual State of Black America report by the National Urban League, entitled “One Nation Underemployed: Jobs Rebuild America,” said African-Americans still lag far behind in jobs and opportunity.
The report said 20.5 percent of African-American workers are either jobless or working part-time, compared with 18.4 percent for Hispanic workers and 11.8 percent for white workers.
Obama's second-term agenda of reducing income equality through an increase in the minimum wage, for example, is aimed at addressing that disparity. But he's got a long way to go.
“The president has taken a number of steps in trying to close the gap that exists in this country but there's a great deal of unfinished business as they look to their remaining 2-1/2 years in office,” said Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League.
Comparisons between Obama and Johnson are inevitable as the 44th president prepares to visit the library of the 36th on Thursday.
Johnson, a former Senate majority leader who schmoozed friends and opponents and sometimes used hardball tactics to win support, stands in sharp contrast to the professorial Obama, who relies heavily on speeches to sway public opinion.
Senior Obama administration officials say that when Johnson's and Obama's legislative records are put side by side, they are not all that different.
When they had Democratic majorities in Congress in their first two years, Obama gained passage of their signature healthcare law, an economic stimulus bill, Wall Street reform and more. They have faced far more difficulty since Republicans gained control of the U.S. House of Representatives after the 2010 elections.
White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said all presidents face unique challenges: While Johnson had a large Democratic majority, they “faced a lot of deep opposition within their own party to the civil rights legislation and had to build a bipartisan majority to pass the bill.”
The civil rights debate now extends to issues like attempting to establish a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 12 million undocumented people in the United States. This is unfinished business for Obama, who now views it as a long shot that Congress will pass immigration reform this year.
“On civil rights, they have struggled with the immigration bill that would take 12 million people out of the shadows and give them rights they don't have,” said Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who generally supports Obama.
Obama's boosters say the president in some respects has experienced racism themselves in pushing their priorities.
Assistant House Democratic Leader James Clyburn of South Carolina, the top African-American in Congress, said they believe a lot of people in the country want to see Obama fail and they attribute this in part to racism.
“There are a lot of people who believe that certain positions are reserved for only white people, and the presidency is one of them,” Clyburn said.
Obama, while seeing their overall job approval rating slide into the 40s, is still enjoying overwhelming support from the African-American community.
A recent Reuters-Ipsos poll said 72 percent of African-Americans approve of the job they are doing, including 72 percent on the economy, 63 percent on foreign policy, and 66 percent on dealing with Congress.
“In part, their major contribution is just being there,” said Senator Angus King, a Maine independent. “And in part, their major contribution is not being there as a civil rights figure, but as a man who is president who happens to be black.”
Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb army chief, has been removed from the UN war crimes court at The Hague after refusing to enter a plea and disrupting the judge's attempts to read out the charges against him.
Judge Alphons Orie of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which is handling the case, later entered formal pleas of not guilty on behalf of Mladic to the various charges against him.
These charges include genocide, and relate to the 43-month siege of the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, and the massacre of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica, Europe's worst massacre since World War II.
Having threatened to boycott their second hearing, Mladic did appear in court on Monday. But they spent several minutes demanding different legal representation and requesting a delay before having to plead.
"No, no, I'm not going to listen to this without my lawyer," Mladic shouted as they removed their translation headphones when Judge Orie began reading out the charges.
"Who are you? You're not allowing me to breathe."
'Smiling and gesturing'
Speaking to Al Jazeera, Rachel Irwin, international justice reporter at the Institute of War and Peace Reporting, said: "The judge was really not willing to let them [Mladic] hijack the proceedings. They ordered them out of the courtroom.
"In the past they would have allowed more stalling for comments.
"It was clear from the beginning that Mladic was not going to co-operate today: they kept looking at the gallery, smiling and gesturing. But the judge made it clear that this is a court and we need to proceed and if you interrupt, then you have to leave."
Mladic was represented by a court-appointed lawyer. Judge Orie said the court would look into allowing them to be represented in future by other lawyers of theirs choice.
Al Jazeera's correspondent, Andrew Simmons, reported from outside the Hague court, said: "They are now waiting for a lawyer to be appointed and they say that the delay is from Mladic.
Al Jazeera's Andrew Simmons updates from The Hague
"He is going to appoint a lawyer from Belgrade and another one from Russia. They could change their pleas, if they wished to, within three months."
Tracked down, arrested and extradited from Serbia in May after 16 years on the run, Mladic, 69, defiantly rejected war crimes charges against them as "obnoxious" and "monstrous" when they were formally charged at the war crimes court last month.
Mladic is accused of orchestrating a campaign to seize territory for Serbs after Bosnia and Herzegovina, following Croatia, broke away from the Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
At least 130,000 people died in the conflicts that followed.
The former soldier has said they were only defending their country and people during the Bosnia war, which lasted from 1992 to 1995.
Serge Brammertz, a Hague prosecutor, has said Mladic used their power to commit brutal atrocities and must answer for it.
But Serb nationalists believe Mladic defended the nation and did no worse than Croat or Bosnian Muslim army commanders.
All the pieces were painted with spray paint. The base is coated with black textured "hammered-look" spray paint. The raised ring is shiny black. The three rings and the stick are flat black. The button was coated with full coat of red, and then got a light coating of fluorescent orange.
The directional markings are craft foam painted golden orange and glued in place with spray adhesive.
I attached the three rings and the stick with hot glue, and then drove a couple of screws up through the bottom of the top of the base into the bottom of the stick to keep it sturdy (pilot holes were drilled first to keep it from splitting).
For the lamp assembly, I used an old cord along with a basic socket and a push-button switch from Home Depot. I fed the cord through a hole that had been drilled in the back of the base prior to painting, and set up the switch following the instructions that came with it. The switch was hot glued to a small wooden bracket I had glued into the base below the buttonhole opening. To the bottom of my red button, I attached a small block of wood with a shallow hole reamed into it so it would sit balanced and centered on top of the switch button. I used some hot glue to attach the red button to the switch through the the buttonhole opening.

When I arrived in Hunza's Shimshal Valley, I was surprised and delighted to see happy locals dressed in colourful and modern winter attire. What was more amazing were the concrete reinforced houses and satellite dish antennas everywhere. It signalled a makeover that I found difficult to associate with this remote region of Pakistan.
But, what left me absolutely stunned was how the locals have completely adopted solar energy.
Let me rewind a little. It had always been my desire to travel to the picturesque Shimshal Valley because I had heard so many wonderful stories about its landscape and people. Last winter, I finally got the opportunity to.
Shimshal is nestled deep in Hunza Valley, sharing a border with China's Xinjiang region. Its biggest claim to fame is that it has produced some of Pakistan's best mountaineers — Samina Baig, Rajab Shah, Meherban Shah and Rehmatullah Baig.
Not an easy place to reach, the road to Shimshal passes through a narrow, winding gorge, which is surrounded by dangerous peaks. It is inhabited by animals including the Blue Sheep and Marcopolo.
Two decades ago, the people of Shimshal had no option but to walk for three whole days, crossing glacial streams at numerous places, and wading through the icy cold water of the Shimshal River, to reach other parts of Hunza. Today, however, the valley is reachable in small vehicles on an unpaved, narrow road.
The opening of this road has brought a palpable change in the valley.
Under the radiant sun
The locals in Shimshal generate their own electricity by harnessing solar energy, almost every house in the valley has multiple solar panels installed on the rooftop. Most houses have solar panels alongside dish antennas.
Locals in Shimshal have completely adopted solar energy.
"There are around 200 houses in Shimshal and every house uses solar panels to generate electricity," a proud local Shambi Khan told me.
They proudly add that compared to other people living at a similar altitude — 3,000 metres above sea level in Asia — Shimshal's residents enjoy a much better quality of life.
Solar panels can be seen everywhere in Shimshal.
Some locals shared with me that they had also installed solar panels in the Pamir pastures, located close to the border with China, where shepherds live throughout the freezing winters and tend to their yaks.
I interacted with a local development practitioner, Pervez Ahmad, who told me that a community school in the village also uses solar panels to generate electricity. "The Naubahar school produces around 20KV electricity through solar panels, which is enough to run the IT lab and supply electricity to 18 classrooms.”
The Naubahar school produces 20KV electricity through solar panels.
There are 200 houses in Shimshal and every house uses solar panels to generate electricity.
Ghulam Shah — a social activist and tourist guide — acknowledged the fact that solar panels are good to light houses, but cannot be used to run heavy electrical items.
They said that the previous Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government had started construction work on a 0.2MW hydropower station.
“On completion, the power house can generate enough electricity throughout the year for Shimshal,” they hoped.
Others, I spoke to, were sceptical of the project because they said that the previous governments had failed to complete a hydropower station in the nearby village of Misgar.
Take a look: Make your own electricity: A tale of Swat's restless heroes
I learned that an NGO called Aga Khan Rural Support Programme (AKRPS) had helped the local community to build a 112KV microhydel power house in 1997 in Shimshal.
Unfortunately, the power house cannot be functional for more than three months at a stretch because of the unavailability of round-the-year running water.
Notwithstanding, it was inspiring to see that the residents of Shimshal are not sitting around just waiting for things to happen and instead, are deeply determined to be self-sufficient.
When governments fail us, as they so often do, residents of this remote valley, in going about their daily lives, are settling shining examples for the rest of Pakistan.

U.S. Sen. Rand Paul said Monday that they don't believe American elections are “rigged” as GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has claimed in recent weeks but they also believe that concerns of rebellion that some Trump supporters have called for are “overstated.”
“I don't have any evidence that our elections … are rigged. We in Kentucky had fraud before, you know, Prichard, back in the 50s was involved in fraud. LBJ was involved in fraud in Texas back in the 50s also,” Paul said in an interview after they spoke to a Republican student group at St. Xavier High School in Louisville.
“But I think the elections are, you know, accurately recorded,” Paul said.
As Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has pulled further ahead in the polls, Trump has increased their rhetoric suggesting at events and on social media that the 2016 election has been rigged and their shot at the presidency is being stolen from him.
“Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!” they posted on Twitter on Monday.
“The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary – but also at many polling places – SAD,” they tweeted on Sunday.
►RELATED: Rand Paul stays defiantly loyal to libertarian credo
Trump's repeated claims that the system is “rigged” is starting to concern even Republicans who fear that such statements could de-legitimize the presidency and the nation's government as a whole.
Sen. Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and former Sen. Kit Bond, of Missouri, are among the Republicans telling Trump to tone down their rhetoric.
“Somebody claims in the election, ‘I was defrauded,' that isn't going to cut it,” Bond, who had endorsed Republicans Jeb Bush and then Marco Rubio, said, according to Politico. “They're going to have to say how, where, why, when.”
The Boston Globe reported on Saturday from a campaign event in Cincinnati threats of armed insurrection if Trump is denied the presidency. One of those the newspaper quoted was Dan Bowman, a 50-year-old contractor, who said they would take up arms if Hillary Clinton prevails.

“If she's in office, I hope we can start a coup. They should be in prison or shot. That's how I feel about it,” Bowman told the Globe. “We're going to have a revolution and take them out of office if that's what it takes. There's going to be a lot of bloodshed. But that's what it's going to take. . . . I would do whatever I can for my country.”
Paul, as they were being rushed away by their staff, said they aren't concerned about such threats.
“I think some of that is overstated,” they said.

South Korea Struggles To Contain Deadly MERS Virus' Spread
toggle caption Aaron Favila/AP
A deadly virus with no known cure — Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS — has infected 13 people in South Korea since mid-May. The fast spread of the disease, from the first case confirmed on May 20 to more than a dozen by Saturday, is prompting criticism of health officials for not moving faster to quarantine suspected patients.
"We will set up a tighter quarantine system to dispel public concern," Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo told The Korea Times. "Since the first case was found, we tried to keep it under control. But the moves weren't enough."
According to health officials, the first confirmed case in South Korea was found in a 68-year-old man who traveled to Bahrain in April and May. They returned to South Korea via Qatar. Since then, the virus has spread to victims with whom they came into close contact, including a nurse and other hospital patients.
Korea's outbreak of MERS is the largest among non-Middle Eastern countries.
MERS is from the same family as the virus that triggered China's 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. Scientists first identified it in 2012, and since then, more than 1,100 cases have been reported in 23 countries, with the bulk majority of cases occurring in the Middle East.
So far, not only is there no known cure, there's no vaccine to prevent it, either.
'Deeply Sorry'
The South Korean Health Ministry said the son of a confirmed victim, who was being observed for possible MERS infection, broke a voluntary home quarantine and traveled to China on Tuesday. On Friday, the Korean Health Ministry confirmed they did contract the deadly virus, which marks the first confirmed case of MERS in China.
"We should have checked more actively and broadly on family related issues. We are deeply sorry about that," said Yang Byung-kook, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Reuters picks up the Chinese end of the story:
"Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said that authorities in Guangdong province found the Korean man on Thursday and isolated them in a hospital for treatment. They also isolated 35 people who had come in close contact with him, though none has yet to shown symptoms."
Suspected patients are supposed to stay at home or at ministry-designated hospitals after coming into close contact with someone with MERS. The Korean Health Ministry says it plans to fine medical staff who do not report suspected cases to the government, and those who refuse to have tests even after showing MERS-like symptoms, which are fever, cough and shortness of breath, will face fines of $1,800.
One of the most intriguing aspects of Durkheim's work was precisely their failure to say anything in detail about the nature of the sacred in today's society. The Elementary Forms offered a conceptual language for thinking about the sacred, based on the analysis of "primitive" societies. But when writing about the sacred in the modern world, Durkheim tended only to emphasise the transitional quality of the sacred landscape in their day rather than say anything more specifically about its moral contours.
Despite this, there are still glimpses of important insights about it in Durkheim's work. In The Elementary Forms, they wrote about the national flag as the modern equivalent of the totemic symbol of the "primitive" clan, something for which soldiers would fight and die for, even though the flag itself was merely a piece of coloured fabric. Through allusions such as these, Durkheim showed their awareness of the power of the nation as a defining sacred form of modern life. They never fully worked out the implications of their idea. Perhaps they were too immersed in the sacred project of building the nation of the French Third Republic themselves to maintain a critical perspective of the growing cultural power of nationalism in their day, something that only became possible for later scholars like Eric Hobsbawm. But alongside their half-articulated sense of the symbolic power of the nation, Durkheim was more explicit about the sacred importance of individual, human life, writing about human rights as a fundamental moral touchstone of modern life.
Durkheim never developed a substantial explanation of how the meanings of the nation or humanity had become sacred in the modern world. But their own life was clearly influenced by their moral power. During the emotionally charged years of the Dreyfus affair, Durkheim played a leading role in establishing a regional branch of La Ligue des Droits De L'Homme, and as we have seen took a clear public stance in support of universal human rights. Less than 20 years later, Durkheim's activism took a very different tone as they committed the last few years of their productive working life to writing patriotic literature in support of the French war effort. Durkheim's nationalism was still inflected with a progressive tone, and one of their primary objections to German nationalism was that it seemed so hostile and alien to the humanitarian spirit that defined true human civility. For Durkheim, the cause of universal human rights and the success of the French republic were ultimately inseparable, just as they had been for many of the participants in the French revolution 100 years before.
The blending of nationalist and humanitarian moral sensibilities was not merely a quirk of Durkheim's personality. It reflects, more generally, the influence of moral visions of the nation and humanity that have run concurrently through the modern west since the 18th-century. In a sacred landscape in which deference to lines of sacred authority leading up into heaven no longer held sway, new forms of the sacred had to be found which were grounded in the deep conditions of modern life. These were to be found in the idea of moral demands that arose from one's membership of a particular national community or that arose from one's membership in a universal family of humanity. Sometimes these moral demands have been experienced as being in intense conflict with each other – think, for example, of disputes that pit the competing moral claims of national survival and universal human rights against each other, from Palestine to post-civil war Sri Lanka. But equally these moral sensibilities could flow together in complex ways, as they did through Durkheim's own public activism.
Durkheim embodied how the society of their day was not simply in a state of moral transition but was profoundly shaped by the moral currents of the nation and humanity. These moral currents continue to move through our lives today, creating ambiguities about the kinds of society we believe we should create, who we think the moral outsiders of our societies really are, and for the limits of our empathy and generosity.
On Thursday, Ariel Scott of The New York Daily News took on the most important topic of the day: whether we should say “God bless you” to each other when we sneeze. Now, the vast majority of people who say “God bless you” do so because they're attempting to be nice – they're acknowledging that you've had some sort of physical expression of discomfort, even if it's instinctive, and they're trying to signal their sympathy. It's a harmless if somewhat antiquated public convention. So the hell what?
Not good enough, says Scott. “It has obvious religious connotations but they're archaic and no longer make any sense in our modern-day world.”
God forbid somebody should say the word God to this guy.
They continue along these lines:
You never know who you're trying to bless and not everyone's going to be receptive of your random act of kindness. Atheists, for example, might respond to a "bless you" with a roll of the eyes. Someone of another faith may not appreciate your blessings if they perceive you to be of another (potentially opposing) set of beliefs.
If you're offended by someone proffering religious sympathy to you, be sure to live in a cabin in the woods. You're a jerk, and you're bothering everybody else. These are the same kinds of people who find Christmas lights offensive and think that we should say “Winter Greetings” rather than “Merry Christmas.”
But Scott explains:
The plague is no longer a thing. And thank God, sure, that we no longer live in a world where the pope (Gregory I in 600 AD, to be exact) is imposing on us the responsibility to bless one another to protect us from dying from the bubonic plague.
The plague isn't a thing. But you know what is? Communicable disease, transmitted via sneezing. Sneezes can propel material from your mouth up to 200 feet. So to be fair, perhaps we should say “God bless you” to everyone within a 200 foot radius.
Finally, Scott suggests that we make sneezing more awkward as a solution to saying the word “God”:
It's an unnecessary expectation to put on others. In the absence of a "bless you," an alternative could be for the sneezer to say "excuse me," as one might with any other involuntary bodily function (ok, gas). That might take the onus off the sneeze witness and allow us all to carry on without worrying we're committing a serious social faux pas.
So thanks for making the world a little worse and a little less civil today, Ariel Scott.
Bless your heart.
Drones and helicopters are already sharing the same sky. Last Monday, while covering a fire at a salvage yard, a news helicopter from Seattle's KIRO-TV spotted a drone flying over a different network's news copter, and then tracked that drone down to its pilot. The helicopter pilot also contacted the FAA about the incident.
This isn't the first time helicopters and drones have had close encounters, but what's fascinating is the combined audio and visual from the KIRO-TV cockpit.
At 0:55, the helicopter pilots refer to the unmanned craft as a drone, and shortly thereafter guess the vehicle's altitude to be 1,500 feet, well above the 500-foot ceiling for drones proposed by the FAA. The drone descends rapidly, hovering just above rooftops, and at 2:12 it buzzes by a person in their backyard. At 3:18 they find the man they suspect to be the pilot.
The rest of the video includes a weird theater of modern surveillance. The helicopter pilots attempt to read the license plate on what they think is the man's car. Then, the man picks up their drone and returns to a house, all observed in close detail from the sky. This is exactly the kind of tracking people worry about drones doing, but here, it's done by a powerful news camera in a manned helicopter. At 7:28, one of the helicopter crew resigns themselves to letting the pilot “who almost took us out of the sky” get away--which isn't an unlikely statement. A 2014 study on bird strikes and military helicopters found that birds can cause considerable damage to craft, and noted one anecdote of a bird colliding with an attack helicopter, causing two deaths. While small drones may not cause more harm than birds, it's possible a drone as large as this quadcopter could have caused a crash.
After a while, the KIRO-TV copter then spends a minute or so filming the salvage fire that was the original draw, before returning at 9:43 to the suspected drone pilot and following them to their house. In the video, the pilot is never identified. The whole event feels like a very low-key remake of Enemy of the State. Watch the chase below:
Good morning!
It's been a very busy few weeks. Time to get you all back in the loop.
Pre-alpha tests
I've been working with some other indie devs and group of randomly selected backers, as well as posting some test builds of the game's engine on the forum, in an attempt to catch any embarrassing showstopper bugs before we go live. We managed to do a Linux and Windows test in the last week. It was a pretty intense few days of trouble shooting and fixing bugs in realtime.
Linux test
I was expecting this to be a complete nightmare, but the majority of testers found it stable and performing at or above my expectations. The game runs at a playable speed on ATI hardware and NVIDIA testers got impressive performance.
Windows test
Sadly this test had a showstopper. 64-bit Windows 7 users with ATI graphics suffer a major crash as soon as the game opens. (For the programmers among us: It's seemingly caused by a stack overflow in ATI's driver). I had assumed that if I developed on ATI in Linux (notoriously bad), that it would guarantee stability on Windows, but that's, annoyingly, not the case. I will work my arse off to ensure that it's fixed before the full alpha's are downloadable.
NVidia users had much better luck, and we even had a handful of cases of people getting hundreds of frames a second on 580 and 670 cards. (This is actually very good news for everyone as it also points to a specific bottleneck on middle range machines)
Website
Most the issues with the site are now fixed, and I have most the keys for the Indie Hug Bundle Ready to go. I just need to process all the survey data to send out the logins.
Animator, rigger, writer, creature designer, spy.
We now have an animator working in the team. She's busy getting the colonists moving about at the moment. Walking, running, limping, patrolling etc. Next month we will start getting in some more detailed things in like colonist interactions and a wide range of hammed up death sequences.
I've also spent a few days picking through portfolios of artists to help me re-visualise the game's fauna. We should have the five native creatures in development very soon.
We also have a writer on board who will be helping me distill my thinkums into written words.
Rudi has been working on a whole bunch of assets and has just completed the reactor room and lab wall and floor models. With all the new meshes and textures, game is really starting to look like my vision for it.
Kris has been working on the backer heads. We have eight or so heads ready now and the colonist body models complete. He'll start working on the pets soon to get some fluffy chaos into the game. Did you know the terminal velocity of a cat is 100kmph? Well you do now.
Nick has been working with FMOD (which I've now integrated into the engine) to produce some really lovely sound work. I'm really excited to get it linked deeply into the gameplay.
Surveys
Tiers with posters have a survey they need to complete ASAP. The sooner I get the information back the sooner I can get them printed for you guys.
Also I'm still waiting back on a lot of £10-20 tier backers, please, please, please remember to fill them in!
Cheerio for now!

Geneticist Nettie Stevens is renowned for their revolutionary research on XY chromosomes, the link between genetics and sex determination and why someone is born female or male. They were born 155 years ago today and she's remembered in the latest Google Doodle.
Google Nettie Stevens on July 7's Google Doodle
Still, most people haven't heard of them Why? It's a classic Rosalind Franklin case. Stevens was yet another woman scientist robbed of proper credit as men were acclaimed for using their research.
Public domain Nettie Stevens
Nettie Stevens was a pioneer: Stevens was alive at the end of the 19th century when most women were restricted to a handful of professions and marriage. Instead, after putting themselves through school, they became a scientist and began researching chromosomes — small structures in the nucleus of cells that hold DNA. In their research with mealworms, they discovered that sperm contains either an X or Y chromosome, while an egg has only an X chromosome. An XX pairing would create a female and an XY pairing would create a male.
It was a profound insight: Previously, we had no idea how sex was determined. Many came to believe the mother determined the sex of the child or the mother's environment had some influence.
thescienceofreality.tumblr.com/Giphy Molecular chromosomes
However, scientists didn't embrace their theory immediately. And today, Stevens almost never gets credit for making the discovery. The problem is that another male researcher, Edmund Wilson, made a similar discovery and published similar results around the same time as Stevens.
"It is generally stated that E.B. Wilson obtained the same results as Stevens, at the same time," historian Stephen Brush writes. However, "Wilson probably did not arrive at their conclusion on sex determination until after they had seen Stevens' results."
Brush later adds, "Because of Wilson's more substantial contributions in other areas, they tend to be given most of the credit for this discovery."
We've still got a long way to go before we see equality in science.
"Sometime in the 1970s or 1980s perhaps, overtly sexist comments went mostly underground but there is still resistance to full inclusion of women in the science enterprise," professor of physics and astronomy Meg Urry said in an email. "We know that implicit bias, insufficient mentoring, shifting criteria for evaluation, lack of role models and sexual harassment all play a role in preventing the full participation of women. Many are working hard to change this but we still have some distance to go."

Sen. Ted Cruz. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)
Texans consume politics like barbecue. We grab a plate, find a seat, and declare our political position. Every day offers a political story in the (currently on the electoral maps) Red State of Texas. So it's no surprise that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), whose politics lie on the outer realms of conservatism, would diss their Canadian citizenship — they were born in Calgary, Alberta to a Cuban father and an American-born mother — in favor of their roots in the U.S.
“I've been American since birth,” Cruz was reported as saying by NBC News.
Frills like dual citizenship aren't necessary when the goal is the White House. Besides, every full-blooded Texan knows that singing “O Canada” doesn't compare to several hearty rounds of “The Eyes of Texas.”
It's also not surprising that Cruz would propose shutting down the federal government unless the Affordable Care Act is defunded. In Texas, our politics are nothing, if not extreme. Scoring a political point is a Texas right: like air-conditioned SUVs and space to roam. Political one-upmanship is also a Texas fact: like hot August days and toll roads.
Then again, perhaps Cruz wants the public to focus on the health-care debate and not their personal history. Cruz knows that supplying a birth certificate doesn't mean your parentage won't haunt you at the polls. Or at the golf course. Or at the dinner table. Or in an Internet pop-up ad draped in red, white and blue. Recent political history with President Obama proved that. Truth is always suspicious to some folks.
Threatening a government shut-down before the current funding expires Sept. 30, may be the best dare-me move initiated by Cruz, who could be revving up for a presidential run in 2016. (He has refused to speculate on their legal eligibility, however.) A government shutdown isn't your garden-variety threat because the implications could trigger staggering electoral misfires for the GOP in the 2014 elections. But Cruz is moving forward with their Wild-West tactic. Apparently, they will stand up for their base, no matter what the cost — even if it means splitting with less-radically inspired sections of the Republican Party.
Tuesday night Cruz was here in Dallas to stump about defunding the health-care law. Supporters drowned out the few protesters who shouted, “You have health care, we should too!”
The Washington Post reported that Cruz responded by saying:
“I'll make an observation about those two young men,” Cruz said, after the noise subsided. “Number one, I agree with them. They should have health care and Obamacare is causing more and more people struggling to climb the economic ladder to lose their health care.”
Then, Cruz lauded their supporters for outnumbering the opposition.
“Every time they've come to protest in Texas, they've sent a small group of people, and y'all have outnumbered them two, and three, and four to one.”
Again, remember that Texans consume politics like ribs and potato salad. If you don't push your way through line, you may not get fed. To drown out Cruz and their supporters, the simple thing to do is to recruit a larger posse to attend GOP buffets headlined by the senator.
Which seems to be the issue for Republicans in Texas and beyond. Cruz has amassed a formidable platform of power. But how do they really look as a possible presidential candidate? How would the Cruz Brand appear next to, say, Hillary Clinton? Is the Cruz Brand an electable image?
Oh. Well. That's Texas politics — reliably complex. We have wacky political cousins, and we have to figure out how to get along at family reunions. We are Democrats and Republicans and every affiliation in between, and family is all we have. We've already lost the good image award in some circles. Surely Canada feels slighted by Cruz, and here in the States, the Business Insider reported on Tuesday that a poll showed that most Americans would kick Texas out of the union.
And leaving the republic isn't such a bad idea for some members of the family. Remember the secession petition filed after the 2012 presidential election? You can fill fleets of Ford F-150s with Texas cousins who, if given a chance, wouldn't mind seceding anyway.
Fantasy Castle
Now that I've figured out the lighting setup on low resolution render. I need to further refine this 3d sketch. Since I used World Machine, my UVs and mesh for my geometry are not optimized. UV mapping is a process that places a texure map onto a 3d object.
Think of a texture map in UV space as wrapping paper going over a box you want to wrap.
Now, if I look at the topology of the geometry I got from World Machine, you can see the mesh is not optimized. The divisions are not evenly distributed. Ideally you'd like to see even squares across the form for your texture map.
Import the geometry into another application, Zbrush. Now I am a new user to Zbrush, but I have really enjoyed working with it. Bear with me if any of this seems super simple to regular Zbrush users.
I will remesh the geometry using Zbrush's ZRemesher. This will result in an optimized mesh but at a lower poly count.
I will then subdivide the geometry to increase the poly count closer to what my original geometry had and then in the Subtool, I will project the detail from my original geometry onto the duplicated remeshed geometry. This will give me the details I had but now on a clean optimized mesh.
Now, to create my UVs, I can either use Zbrush's UV Master (which is under the Zplugin tab) or I can go to another program like Maya or UV Layout to lay out my UVs.
Since I'm still in Zbrush, I will use UV Master. In UV Master, you want to click “Work on Clone”. This will make a duplicate model (shader is now white) to do your uv layout. You will flatten and unflatten to see your UVs in 2d space. You can click “Enable Control Painting”. This will allow you to guide UV Master where you'd like your UVs seams. “Protect” keeps seams away from that area, and “Attract” brings the seams to that area. You can go back and forth with painting these masks.
Once done, you can click “copy UVs” and then go to your remeshed geometry in the Subtool, then “paste UVs” onto it.
Now that you are done with UVs you can export out your geometry at whatever subdivision you'd like. If you'd like to refine your geometry you can sculpt more detail onto it while in Zbrush. For now I would like to export out two versions of models, low res and high res so that I can use another program to create a “normal map” of my geometry. Zbrush has an inconsistent output of Normal maps so we will use a freeware program, xNormal.
What you do is very simple; import your high res model, import your low res model, then under baking options select normal map and the size you'd like to bake it out. Then just click “generate maps” button. Now you have a perfect Normal map.
Now I take the exported geometry and maps and bring them back into Maya.
Here with this test UV grid you can see I have good distribution of my UVs on a good even mesh on my geometry.
Next week, we'll go over placing and modeling the castle, and texturing the mountains and the castle.

The Wii U, unlike the Wii, shows that Nintendo finally has given third-party developers and publishers a system that is on par with what the other console manufacturers are currently doing. The ability to port over material to the Wii U gives the system's software catalog a boost – particularly when a game utilizes exclusive Wii U features like the GamePad. In the case of Most Wanted, however, all things aren't equal.
The content for the Wii U version of the game is all here, and then some. The open-world city of Fairhaven is filled with races with which you can upgrade your cars, boss battles for the Most Wanted cars, all kinds of billboards to smash, and other secrets to uncover. The ability to switch cars on the fly not only means more races at your disposal, but it's also handy when the cops are hot on your tail. The Wii U version of Most Wanted comes with even more cars and challenges thanks to the inclusion of the Ultimate Speed Pack DLC.
The game also benefits from developer Criterion's commitment to online. Cruising around with friends and taking on different multiplayer events back-to-back is a lot of fun, and I love seeing what billboard jumps and speed camera speeds your friends have posted when you're cruising around in single-player. Of course, such a distinction between the single- and multiplayer modes is largely irrelevant.
Of course, another added feature for the Wii U version is its extensive use of the GamePad. Whether a friend is manning the GamePad while you race or you use it yourself, you can disrupt nearby police, remove traffic, repair your car or select upgrades, and more with a touch of a button. If someone else is controlling the GamePad, they can even drive for you if you're having trouble. You can also race directly from the GamePad, although I would advise against this. Although the game looks good from the peripheral as well as on a big screen, it's hard to pick out objects on the GamePad when the detail is scrunched down. This can lead to some crashes when you can't pick out that concrete median.
While it's up to you how much you use the GamePad to your advantage, no matter which way you choose to control the game (including combinations with the Pro Controller, using the Wii controllers, or the GamePad as a motion-based controller itself), it doesn't feel as tight as the Xbox 360/PS3 versions. Steering, acceleration, and braking seem more binary, and the lack of a spectrum reduces the subtlety of control that can mean the difference between finessing a tough corner and veering wildly from curb to curb. Most Wanted is all about going full throttle and flirting with wrecking at every turn. Having to pull back because of the controls is against the game's philosophy.
This edition of the game has many of the components that made the title successful on the other systems, and more, but the behind-the-wheel experience puts it in second place.
Midweek Mental Greening
You might remember my post about Felix Treitler's new spin on therapy a few weeks ago.
If not, here's a little refresher course: Felix Treitler is a Boston-based Certified Tennis Professional and Licensed Therapist who has combined their love of physical activity and helping others to create an interesting kind of therapy.
This week, I was able to email with Treitler about this new kind of “sports therapy” (for which I learned there is a more appropriate name), how they came to combine their two passions to provide this therapy to clients, and the positive responses he's received from both clients and mental health professionals thus far.
Read on!
Alicia Sparks: Before we dive into anything else, why don't you explain the kind of therapy you're offering? And do you use an “official” name for it?
Felix Treitler: More accurately, it might be called something like “Activity Therapy” because it involves more than just sports. It works with games like chess, or activities like acting, improvising, playing music, or hiking, or others. The idea is that someone is more likely to engage in “therapy” if it is connected to something else they enjoy or are good at. Also, more active things tend to make people feel better as has been proven by many studies involving the mental health benefits of exercise. One of the problems with Therapy up until this point is that many people drop out. Also, it has often been described as a painful and difficult experience. I don't believe it has to be. On the contrary, it can be quite enjoyable.
Sparks: A tennis professional and a therapist – what prompted you to finally merge those two very different careers and form the service you're offering now?
Treitler: I have been a Certified Tennis Professional for over 25 years, and a Licensed Therapist as well. Up until now, I have done those jobs separately. I finally decided that it was time to combine them into one job as there are so many similarities between the two. As I explained, tennis is one activity that I know a lot about, but I do lots of other activities as well. I don't want to exclude people who don't play tennis.
Sparks: Before yourself, had you ever heard of – or witnessed – another mental health professional using this sports therapy technique?
Treitler: Not really. I've seen some variations of it, but not exactly what I have in mind. Again, using exercise as an “anti-depressant” isn't a new concept, so I'm just adding onto that idea. Endorphins and serotonin levels are increased during all kinds of activities, so it is a natural to merge activity with other aspects of therapy, like talking and changing thought patterns.
Sparks: You started your practice two years ago, correct? What is the biggest challenge you've faced since then?
Treitler: The biggest challenge I've faced is simply getting the word out and explaining to people what it is all about. It is a new way of approaching Therapy, so most people haven't heard of it and may find it takes some time to get used to. My website is almost finished and it will explain the process in detail. I'm also choosing to do interviews and get articles printed about it so people can understand it better.
Sparks: And, what has been the most rewarding experience of introducing your area to this kind of therapy?
Treitler: The most rewarding experience has been the positive response by clients and professionals to the idea of this kind of Therapy. Because it is such a sensible idea, everyone has supported it and even has asked how they could help promote it. Clients tend to love it because it is new, fun, and very effective. My mission in life all along has been to help people with a variety of problems, and now I found a way to do it that I enjoy as well. This makes it more likely that I will be able to do it for a very long time.
Sparks: What are some of the reactions you've gotten from other mental health professionals when they learn about what you're doing with sports and therapy?
Treitler: Most of the reactions have been extremely positive. I am beginning to collaborate with other professionals and organizations who are doing things that are related. I can envision forming a bigger organization that specializes in “Activity Therapy” so it can reach more people and so I don't have to feel “isolated” in a private practice.
Sparks: How would you respond to someone who said, “You know, Felix, I'm really good at talking, but I am no good on the tennis court.”
Treitler: Well, fortunately, I practice more traditional forms of Therapy as well, so they wouldn't have to go far! Secondly, I might ask them what activity they prefer to tennis, since there are so many other possibilities.
Sparks: The emotions you're able to display during the game – “the joy and frustration at winning or losing” you've mentioned before – do you feel those human responses help your clients better connect with you?
Treitler: Yes I do. I was never a big fan of hierarchical divisions between client and therapist. This type of treatment breaks that down and allows the therapist to be more of himself. For example, during a recent Tennis Therapy session, I became frustrated when I wasn't playing well and my client could see that on the court. A therapist doesn't have to be “emotionless”, on the court or off. They also saw me pull it together and raise the level of my game later in the match, so I was able to model “anger management” and an ability to control my frustration and negativity.
Sparks: For children, how important do you feel it is to have sports programs available in the schools and communities? Why?
Treitler: I think it is very important. For example, I work in a unique program that blends literacy with tennis for middle-schoolers. It is extremely effective and has been shown to not only keep kids off the streets, but to get them into better high schools and perform better in school. I have always benefited from sports programs growing up in New York City and in New Jersey. It helped me get through some very difficult times, including my parents divorce.
Sparks: Thanks so much for your time, Felix – I wish you the best of luck with your practice!
Treitler: Thank you so much for expressing an interest in this new form of Therapy. This is exactly the kind of exposure that will be so helpful in getting the word out to as many people as possible. I am open to people contacting me through my email, [email protected] or by phone at (781) 888-4067.
Therapist Interview: Felix Treitler Leaves the Couch Behind
By Kristan Heneage
It is 8am and Mo Adams has already been up for three hours. It was dark when their day started, the sun still some way from breaking through the window of their apartment in Syracuse, New York. The midfielder is a long way from the Derby County academy they grew up in, chasing a dream of professional football via American college soccer.
“Balancing school and soccer can be tough, because you've got two things to try and excel at,” Adams, who is aiming for a degree in sports management, told The Telegraph. “At Derby County my day's work would last up to four hours, but here in college, I leave my house at 6am and I won't be back home until 9pm. In the long run, being a professional soccer player and having a degree is definitely worth the hard work I'm putting in each and every day though.”
Adams represents a growing trend of released British academy players that are rejecting a life in the lower leagues for a shot in MLS via college soccer. Players such as, Sporting KC's Dom Dwyer and Real Salt Lake's Luke Mulholland, serve as inspiration to an ambitious generation with an American dream.
“That is definitely something that motivates me,” Adams said. “Seeing the likes of Dom and Jack [Harrison, the New York City FC winger] come out here and achieve something, it helps me realise there are different paths to the professional game.”
Speaking from the hospital in Rochester, Minnesota where they are undergoing precautionary prostate treatment, Their Holiness the Dalai Lama offered a brief message on the occasion of the upcoming Tibetan New Year (Losar, beginning Feb. 9 and lasting 15 days). There, they reassured friends and supporters that they are in good health and is being well looked after by hospital staff. Their message focused on expressing their appreciation to those who have sent prayers and well-wishes for their health and recovery, reassuring them: “And I want to tell you that I am doing very well. The treatment only takes a few minutes every day, but it will take time to complete the treatment. It's nothing complicated, it's not serious, there's nothing to worry about.”
They continued that “it's almost as if I'm taking a rest. I'm doing my daily recitations morning and evening and when there's time I'm reading other scriptures… I want to tell you not to worry at all.”
If you create the causes of happiness, if you lead your life in benefiting others and not harming them, that's a meaningful life, a life that has ‘tashi'. On that basis saying ‘Tashi Delek' means ‘May you be happy in the here and now and, as we Buddhists say, may you finally achieve definite goodness.'
They then went on to encourage us not to simply take the Tibetan New Year as an “opportunity to offer ‘che-ma', drink ‘chang', and gamble.” The meaning of ‘Tashi' -as in the Tibetan greeting “tashi delek”- is:
With that, the Dalai Lama wished all a ‘Losar Tashi Delek' and requested that all “please try to live up to what it means.”
*correction, an earlier version of this article had Feb 8 as the start of Losar.
Many users have spotted that Windows 10 Anniversary Update downloads and installs some games and apps automatically. Without the user even opening the Store, or asking for their or their permission, the operating system installs some apps like Candy Crush Soda Saga, Minecraft: Windows 10 edition, Flipboard, Twitter and some other apps. Earlier, you could prevent Windows 10 from installing them using a Registry Tweak, but it does not work any more in version 1607 "Anniversary Update". Here is the alternative way to prevent these apps from installing.
RECOMMENDED: Click here to fix Windows errors and optimize system performance
The Windows 10 version 1607 Anniversary Updates includes a feature that automatically installs apps from the Windows Store because it wants to promote some of them. These apps are installed for the currently signed-in user. When you are connected to the internet, Windows 10 will download and install a number of Store apps automatically. The Tiles for these Metro apps or Universal apps suddenly show up in the Windows 10 Start Menu with a progress bar indicating that they're being downloaded. After they finish installing they show up in the Recently installed section of the Start menu:
To Block Soda Saga and other unwanted apps in Windows 10 Anniversary Update, do the following.
Press Win + R shortcut keys together on the keyboard to open the Run dialog. In the Run box, type the following: secpol.msc The Local Security Policy app will appear on the screen. Select Application Control Policies in the left, then click Applocker. Click Packaged app Rules: Right-click the right pane and select Create new rule: The Creation new rule wizard will be opened. Click Next to open its next page: On the Permissions page, set Action to Deny, leave User or Group as Everyone: Click Next, then click Use an installed packaged app as a reference -> Select: In the app list, select Windows Spotlight(Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager) and click OK: Move the slider to the Package Name option as shown below, then click Create:
That's it! Note that already downloaded content in the tiles wont go away after this Applocker rule, however, there will not be any new content after this. You can remove existing unwanted apps. All you need to do is right-click their tiles and remove them, they won't come back. Credits: dobbelina@MDL .
To restore the default behavior, you need to remove the rule in Local Security Policy you created.
A side effect of this AppLocker rule restriction might be that the Windows Spotlight feature which shows random images on the Lockscreen will not work. But this issue is very minor, since you can still change your Lock screen background to a custom image or to a slideshow.
Update: if the trick described above has no effect for you, please try another method mentioned in the following article:

Can't smoke 'em out? Troops struggle with 10-foot Afghan marijuana plants
OTTAWA - Canadian troops fighting Taliban militants in Afghanistan have stumbled across an unexpected and potent enemy — almost impenetrable forests of 10-foot-tall marijuana plants.
Gen. Rick Hillier, chief of the Canadian defense staff, said Thursday that Taliban fighters were using the forests as cover. In response, the crew of at least one armored car had camouflaged their vehicle with marijuana.
"The challenge is that marijuana plants absorb energy, heat very readily. It's very difficult to penetrate with thermal devices ... and as a result you really have to be careful that the Taliban don't dodge in and out of those marijuana forests," they said in a speech in Ottawa.
"We tried burning them with white phosphorus — it didn't work. We tried burning them with diesel — it didn't work. The plants are so full of water right now ... that we simply couldn't burn them," they said.
Even successful incineration had its drawbacks.
"A couple of brown plants on the edges of some of those (forests) did catch on fire. But a section of soldiers that was downwind from that had some ill effects and decided that was probably not the right course of action," Hillier said dryly.
One soldier told them later: "Sir, three years ago before I joined the army, I never thought I'd say 'That damn marijuana.'

It's obvious that there has been a little research performed by the taliban. Just the same mechanism which aids in the detection of marijuana also contributed in this case to concealment of troops within them. Clever planning on the rebel side.
This makes me wonder how long they had this planned if they had this planned at all. It would take at LEAST 9mo. of some really decent care to get fluffy and tall plants to provide concealment. On the plus side of such an effort would be infra-red and thermal camouflage, well worth it. I'm pretty impressed. 5 for you

Claire Kirkland-Casgrain, the first woman elected to Quebec's legislature and a pioneer in the women's movement, has died at the age of 91.
Born Marie-Claire Kirkland on Sept. 8, 1924 in Palmer, Mass., they got a law degree from McGill University and worked as a lawyer in Montreal as of 1952. The daughter of a member of the assembly, they were an activist within the Quebec Liberal Party in different roles, notably as head of the Fédération des femmes libérales du Québec.
In 1961, their father, Liberal legislator Charles-Aimé Kirkland, who had served since 1939, died suddenly. Even though no woman had ever served on the assembly in Quebec, they offered their services to finish their mandate. On Dec. 14, 1961, at age 37, they were elected with a strong majority. They were re-elected in the Jacques-Cartier riding in the 1962 general election, and then in the Marguerite-Bourgeoys riding in 1966 and 1970.
In the Jean Lesage government, they were named a minister without a portfolio within a year of being elected. Later, under Lesage and Robert Bourassa, they headed different ministries: transport and communications, tourism, hunting and fishing, and cultural affairs.
Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard announced Friday that Kirkland-Casgrain will be given special honours during their funeral, which will be organized in part by the provincial government.
“(Kirkland-Casgrain) put their convictions towards working for the equality between men and women,” Couillard said in a statement. “On behalf of myself and the Quebec government, I offer my most sincere condolences to their family and friends.”
No funeral date has been set.
Kirkland-Casgrain also passed laws that changed the lives of women. Bill 16 gave women legal rights, such as the right to sign a cheque or a lease without the authorization of their husband. In 1997, they told the Gazette des femmes that of all the things in their career, “it's what I'm most proud of.”
A few years before the law passed, the newly minted member of the legislature wanted to rent an apartment in Quebec City and was told by the owner they needed their husband's signature.
Claire Kirkland married lawyer Philippe Casgrain in 1954. They also modernized marriage laws and created the Conseil du statut de la femme in 1973.
After leaving politics in 1973, they served as a judge on the provincial court and head of the Commission on the Minimum Wage. They retired in 1991, at 67 years old.
Kirkland-Casgrain had three children before their divorce. In 1990, they married lawyer Wildham Alfred Strover.
Kirkland-Casgrain was named to the Ordre national du Québec and the Order of Canada, among many awards they received throughout their career.

In the early 1920s, a criminal street-gang from Dublin's North Inner city named the ‘Sons of Dawn' terrorised citizens and business-owners . Amidst the backdrop of a violent guerilla War of Independence, it would seem that easy-access to firearms and a general breakdown in law and order helped the group to operate in an already strained and tense city. After a successful intelligence operation, the gang were finally caught in the midst of a robbery and arrested by the IRA.
The first mention of the ‘Sons of Dawn' in the newspaper archives comes from January 1920. On the night of the 16th, three masked men robbed Roger Pollock on Ailesbury Road in Ballsbridge. A half an hour later, the same group robbed another passerby John Connolly. At least one of the gang was armed with a revolver. As the Evening Herald (17 Jan) reported, the robbers told Connolly – before they took their money and pocket-watch – that they had met the ‘Sons of Dawn'.
On the night of 22 January, a “well-known” but unnamed resident of Garville Avenue, Rathgar was held up by a gang of three men as they posted a letter close to their home. They helped themselves to their watch and a measly three shillings. The Irish Independent (24 Jan 1920) said that one of the gang told the victim : “If you are going to make anything about this. Say it was the Sons of Dawn. Good Night.”
Under the heading of ‘Murty's Letter' in The Irish Times (31 January 1920), a journalist described the ‘Sons of Dawn' as a:
… a new order of Irish reformers and men of action, with a way of its own. Their plan of campaign is to wait around the corner on dark nights and when you go to post a letter in the letterbox , (they) demand your watch and your money at the muzzle of a gun. Or they may vary that programme by raiding a post office or burgularin' (sic) a house and carrying off the safe and its contents…
The Nationalist and Leinster Times (7 Feb 1920) reported that the ‘Sons of Dawn' had been active in Athy, County Kildare and had broken into a pub on William Street. It seems unlikely however that the Dublin ‘Sons of Dawn' would travel up to 80km to undertake such a burglary. If anything though, it would seem to illustrate that a gang of robbers with a menacing name can prompt journalists farther afield to pin similar crimes on them.
The gang was active in Dublin throughout the year and they obviously made an impact on the hearts and minds of Dublin residents. After gunfire was heard in Dublin one night, The Freeman's Journal (16 June 1920) wrote theatrically that:
The anxious and sleepless citizen, the late reveller in the mansion, the guardians of the city's peace, paused a moment to wonder what daring marauder, what anarchist, what Son of Dawn, had ventured forth to shoot, loot, or be shot at.
This period saw the establishment of the Irish Republican Police (IRP) under the authority of Dáil Éireann. Liam O'Carroll, a Dublin IRA captain, described in their Witness Statement (no. 594) how the organisation undertook a:
a considerable amount of police work … in conjunction with the Dáil Courts … with a view of undermining the [Dublin Metropolitan Police] … The duties involved were varied and concerned a large number of personal cases, robberies, house-breaking and the like.
The brazen activity of the ‘Sons of Dawn' brought them to the attention of the IRA in Dublin. Volunteers Sean Brunswick (BMH WS No. 898) and Nicholas Laffan (BMH No. 703) also make reference to this particular gang in their witness statements.
O'Carroll stated that the group were also known as the ‘Moore Street Gang' and:
… usually met in a billiard saloon connected at the time with Woolworth's of Henry Street, and Woolworth's themselves had engaged Volunteer police to keep the premises under observation.
Downfall
An IRA Volunteer obtained information that the gang planned to rob a wholesale tobacco business owned by Patrick McEvoy known as Magill's at 105 Capel Street (now the Outhouse LGBT community centre).
At around 10.30pm on 22nd September 1920, four members of the ‘Sons of Dawn' robbed Magill's of tobacco and about 20 packets of cigarettes. As they were leaving the building through the back door, they were greeted by 16 armed members of the IRA. The gang of four were marched away blindfolded to a “house unknown” where they were placed in a cellar and kept until 9pm the following day.
Liam O'Carroll's Witness Statement reveals that the gang was brought to the Colmcille Hall at 5 Blackhall Street in Smithfield. A brisky 10-minute walk from Capel Street. This building had been owned by the Gaelic League since 1900 and was used as the HQ of the 1st Battalion, Dublin Brigade of the Irish Volunteers/IRA from 1914 to 1922.
Besides being caught red-handed immediately after the robbery, the IRA searched the boys and found a photograph of the four of them with “The Sons of Dawn, 1919, 1920” and “The Boys of Dublin” written in ink on the back.
The four were named in the newspapers as :
Thomas Corlett of Cole's Lane [off Moore Street]
James Gannon of Moore Street
Matthew Reid, No Address Given
Henry Thomas of Dominick Street [off Parnell Street]
They were tried before a five-person “Court of Republican officers” and found guilty of robbing the Capel Street premises along with other three businesses on Henry Street: Menzies and Co., Lipton's Ltd. and Burton's. The armed robberies in Ballsbridge and Rathgar were not mentioned.
Corlett and Gannon were sentenced to be flogged twelve times “on the bare back” and five years deportation.
Reid was sentenced to three years deportation and Thomas to 12 months deportation.
A press release of some sort was sent to the newspapers as the Evening Herald (25 Sep 1920) published details of the detention that only the IRA captors could have known. Such as how that one of the prisoners:
… broke down and wept while another asked to be shot rather than leave the country. They were given the option and quickly accepted the first order of the court.
The four boys were taken from the building separately and two IRA police officers were detailed to walk with each for half-an-hour (in circles no doubt) before they were let go on Green Street.
It would appear that the DMP picked them up in the following days as the Evening Herald (14 October 1920) reported that the same Matthew Reid and Thomas Corlett were charged with the break-in of Magill's on Capel Street and sentenced to nine months imprisonment each. James Gannon and Henry Thomas do not appear to have been charged by the authorities.
So it would appear, despite assertions in the Witness Statements by former IRA volunteers, that the boys were not forced to emigrate from the country.
Copycats?
In October 1920, four houses were broken into in the neighboring villages of Kilternan and Jamestown in South County Dublin. The Freeman's Journal (8 Oct) reported that the masked and armed men had left a receipt for their seized money with the signature ‘The Sons of Dawn'. Times were certainly changing as the chairperson of the Rathdown Guardians told the newspaper that “this was a serious matter and should be referred to the Republican police”. It is unclear whether this was another ‘branch' of the original ‘Sons of Dawn' or a gang who wanted to use an already-established name.
The Sons of Dawn
So what else can we find out about the gang members? After a good bit of digging, I think I've been able to identity some background information on all four ‘Sons of Dawn' boys. Their exact addresses in 1920 were as follows:
Thomas Corlett, 34 Coles Lane. Born 18/05/1901.
James Gannon, 38 Moore Street. Born 11/07/1899.
Matthew Reid, 21 Upper Rutland Street. Born 04/02/1900.
Henry Thomas, 38 Lower Dominick Street. Born 1891 or 1895.
Thomas Corlett was born on 18 May 1901 at 5 Rotunda Market to parents Alfred, a mail carrier, and Alice Corlett (née O'Brien). Rotunda Market near Moore Street linked Denmark Street and Cole's Lane which all vanished with the building of the Ilac Centre. In 1901, the family were still living at 5 Rotunda Market and in 1911, the family including Thomas (9) were living at 34.1 Cole's Lane. At the time of their arrest in 1920, Thomas was still living on Cole's Lane.
The Freeman's Journal (16 Jan 1920) reported that a Thomas Corlett (18) was found not guilty of breaking into a bottling store on Henry Place and stealing four dozen bottles of stout and two dozen bottles of whiskey. This overlapped with the period during which the ‘Sons of Dawn' were active. The ‘Irish Prison Registers 1790-1924' reveal that Thomas was charged with “illegal possession of a silver dish” (February 1920); “breaking and entering” (September 1920) and “shop-breaking” (October 1920).
In September 1933, Thomas Corlett of 34 Coles Lane was fined £11 in the District Court, according to the Irish Press (15 Sep), for failing to comply with the National Health and Unemployment Insurance Acts. In October 1933, a Thomas Corlett was charged with breaking into the Catholic Church at Mount Argus, Harold's Cross, Dublin 6 the previous August and stealing the contents of the collection box. The Irish Times (28 Oct) noted that Corlett was proprietor of the Technical Cafe, 36 Bolton Street. They were later acquitted after a witness was recalled and re-examined.
James Gannon was born on 11 July 1899 at 67 Patrick Street to parents Patrick, a baker, and Margaret Gannon (née Logan). In 1901 , the family including James (1) had moved to 2 Moore Street Market and by 1911, the family with James (10) had moved a few doors up the street to 38 Moore Street. At the time of their arrest in 1920, James was still living on Moore Street.
In August 1921, a James Gannon (21) was sentenced to three years “penal discipline” in the Borstal institution Clonmel, County Tipperary for breaking into two premisses in Dublin and stealing clothes and alcohol. The Evening Herald (4 Aug 1921) noted that the man's mother was a “dealer in clothes”. This individual is the same age as the ‘Sons of Dawn' James Gannon whose mother was a “Second Hand Clothes Dealer” according to the 1911 Census. The same newspaper article described the boy as having lost their father in the First World War and falling into “bad company” while their mother was “not aware they (was) suspected of being concerned in other criminal enterprises”. It would appear that their arrest and interrogation by the IRA was not enough to put them on a moral and law-abiding path.
Matthew Reid was born on 4 February 1900 at 15 Hill Street off Parnell Street to Charles, a labourer, and wife Mary Reid (née Hand). In 1901, the family including one-year-old Mat were still living at 15.4 Hill Street. By 1911, the Reids including Matthew (11) had moved to 56.1 Bow Lane West in Kilmainham, Dublin 8. (Matthew's mother's name has changed but everything else matches). When Matthew was arrested in 1920, the newspapers did not provide their address but it would appear it was 21 Upper Rutland Street as the ‘Irish Prison Registers 1790-1924' shows that Matthew Reid, who was born at 15 Hill Street, was charged with”breaking and entering” (September 1920). In July 1916, the same Matthew Reid was arrested for “larceny”. Their address at the time in 1916 was 4 Belmont while 15 Hill Street was listed as their birthplace.
The ‘Irish Prison Registers 1790-1924' reveal that Henry Thomas lived at 58 Lower Dominick Street in 1920. Their birthplace was listed at different times as Dublin, Liverpool and London and there are conflicting years of birth.
In 1901, the Thomas family made up of Albert, a butcher, their wife Mary and son Albert (8) were living at 2.2 Sandwith Place near Pearse Street. In September 1910, Henry was charged with ‘obscene language'. The records show that they were living at 49 Summerhill and was born in Church Street. In November 1910, they were arrested for ‘loitering and house-breaking. The Summerhill address corresponds with the the 1911 census which shows that Henry (16) was living with their family at 49.7 Summerhill. In May 1917, Henry was arrested for ‘larceny' of a ‘gold ring' worth £8. The family had moved to 7 Lower Dominick Street while their birthplace was listed as ‘Liverpool'. In March 1918, Henry of 58 Lower Dominick Street was charged with stealing a sum of money. Their birthplace this time was listed as Arran Quay. In December 1918, Thomas was charged with stealing a blouse worth £3. Their current residence was 58 Lower Dominick Street while their birthplace was listed as Sandwith Street, Dublin (which corresponds with 1901 census).
If you think you might be related to any of the four boys, we'd love to hear from you. Did a grand-parent or grand-uncle or an elderly neighbour ever talk about the Sons of Dawn?
Next time I'll be looking at another Dublin criminal outfit who were also tracked down and captured by the IRA in the same time period.
News Dutch Man Gambles on Bitcoin by Selling Everything Their Family Owns
A man from the Netherlands is betting that the value of Bitcoin will multiply in the upcoming years, and they have sold everything their family owns to make that bet.
A lot of people are betting on Bitcoin becoming even more accepted and entrenched in the marketplace, even global financial institutions like Goldman Sachs. However, one man in the Netherlands is really going out on a limb on the perceived rosy future for Bitcoin. Didi Taihuttu, age 39, has sold everything that their family owned and moved them all, including their wife and three daughters, into a campground.
Putting It All on the Line
Didi Taihuttu decided to take the plunge and invest everything their family owns in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. To that end, they sold off their home, car, motorbike, children's toys, clothes, and other family items. The Dutchman fervently believes that blockchain technology and cryptocurrency are fundamentally changing the role of banks in society. As for their decision to take a leap of faith and sell everything for Bitcoin, Didi Taihuttu said:
People will say, ‘You're crazy. But we are an adventurous family and are going to gamble for a moment to live minimalist lives. If you never take a risk, life is boring…The Internet was a revolution for information. I think that blockchain and cryptocurrency are revolutionizing the monetary system. In five years' time, everyone will say: ‘We could have seen it coming.' I am responding to this change now.
No Stranger to Drastic Life Changes
Didi Taihuttu is no stranger to making major alterations to their family's life. They once mined Bitcoin back in 2013 but stopped when the digital currency's price dropped, and they sold all their assets (both virtual and real) off. They then got into Dogecoin but stopped when that currency's price dropped as well. After their father died early in 2016, they decided to sell their business and take their family on an extended trip around the world.
It was on this global trip that they became aware of how much cryptocurrency had ascended. They saw how many people were now using digital coins for everyday transactions, and they began talking with people involved in cryptocurrency trading. Then a friend called them and told them that their Dogecoin was now worth ten to twenty times their previous value.
Once the family returned home, Didi Taihuttu decided to take the plunge and invest everything their family had into Bitcoin (but after discussing it with their wife first!). The plan is to cut back to the bare bones on every facet of their existence and bet everything on Bitcoin. Of the potential future value of Bitcoin, Taihuttu says:
Our expectation is that the value of one Bitcoin will rise to between 12,000 and 20,000 [Euros] over the next three years. If this is true, then we can live for a long time like this without the pressure of needing to work.
Didi Taihuttu and their family will follow the plan until 2020. So far, they sold their home for 85 bitcoins, and the price of Bitcoin did rise sharply today. It reached over $5000 and currently sits at $5443 at the time of this article's writing. It'll be interesting to see how they fare over the next few years, but you do have to respect a family that is willing to live in tents with few possessions over the short-term in the hope of long-term prosperity.
Do you think Didi Taihuttu is smart by selling off everything or is they nut? How far will Bitcoin go up, or possibly down, in the future? Let us know in the comments below.

(CNN) -- With its gull-wing doors and 15-meter long (50 feet) chassis, the Superbus looks like the result of an amorous automotive liaison between a DeLorean and a stretch limo.
But rather than catering for champagne-quaffing party goers, its Dutch developers at the Delft University of Technology are aiming to transform the humble commute in the 21st century.
With a top speed of 155 mph (250 kph) and capable of carrying 23 passengers, the six-wheel Superbus attempts to marry the convenience and flexibility of traveling by car with the speed and comfort more often associated with rail journeys.
"The strength to the concept is that the Superbus can drive everywhere where a normal bus can drive. It has adjustable height, rear-wheel steering and a turning circle of roughly 10 meters," general manager of the project, Wubbo Ockels said.
Furthermore, Ockels imagines a network of "super tracks" -- essentially dedicated two lane highways linking one city to another -- running alongside traditional road networks enabling the Superbus to switch between the two, depending on the destination of passengers.
A prototype of the electric vehicle recently went on show at the 2011 World Exhibition of the International Association of Public Transport (UITP) in Dubai in the hope of attracting investment for development of a test infrastructure.
"At the moment we have a prototype. The next phase is an industrial prototype and the third level is the actual implementation," Ockels said.
He's hopeful that Dubai, with what they call its "visions of sustainability" will give the green light to a pilot project.
So far, it's been a long and expensive road for Ockels and their team. The project started in 2004 and has cost around €13 million ($19 million) to date using technology developed in Formula One racing and the aerospace industry.
But a production model would be considerably cheaper, Ockels says, costing around €2 million ($2.9 million).
They did it again.
After walking away from CenturyLink Field with all three points in 2014, Columbus Crew SC beat the Seattle Sounders again on Saturday night and in the process beat Sigi Schmid's team for the first time at home.
The stars of the show were Kei Kamara, Federico Higuain and Emanuel Pogatetz, but the whole team showed just how entertaining Gregg Berhalter's system could be. Both fullbacks collected assists and the front four's movement was outstanding to watch all night.
Read on to find out who else made the Team of the Week:
GK: Nick Rimando (Real Salt Lake) – The MLS legend followed up a clean sheet on Wednesday with their 100th win with RSL on Saturday, as they made two crucial saves in RSL's 2-1 win over Chicago.
D: Raul Rodriguez (Houston Dynamo) – The usual center back moved out to the right on Sunday and performed splendidly in the Dynamo's 2-1 victory over TFC.
D: Emanuel Pogatetz (Columbus Crew SC) – "Mad Dog" had perhaps their best game in MLS on Saturday night. Not only did they help contain the Sounders attack, but they had a couple passes that cut out much of the Sounders defense.
D: Kemar Lawrence (New York Red Bulls) – The Jamaican has not allowed Roy Miller to get back in the lineup, as they showed why they need to be one of the first names on the teamsheet again on Sunday vs. NYCFC.
M: Fabian Castillo (FC Dallas) – Had more than their usual share of accelerations and dribbles which put the Galaxy backline on its heels and created dangerous opportunities in Dallas' 2-1 win over LA.
M: Mauro Diaz (FC Dallas) – Went 90 minutes for the first time since April 2014 – and fans were thankful that they did. Their superb vision created both Dallas goals.
M: Pedro Morales (Vancouver Whitecaps) –This guy is the heartbeat of the 'Caps. Made a great run and netted a savvy finish on their goal. Displayed good game management throughout Vancouver's 3-0 trouncing of the Union, and even assisted Mattocks' late goal.
M: Federico Higuain (Columbus Crew SC) – Pipa was up to their old tricks throughout the match against the Sounders and even contributed a goal of their own.
F: Giles Barnes (Houston Dynamo) – Sure, they missed a PK on Tuesday night. But their second half against TFC was dominating, and their 70-yard run led to Will Bruin's game-winning goal.
F: Bradley Wright-Phillips (New York Red Bulls) – Scored two, could've (should've) had a third and also put in the work needed as RBNY's lone striker. Continues to be one of the league's clutch performers.
F: Kei Kamara (Columbus Crew SC) – Ho hum, just another two goals for the former SKC striker. They have proven to be one of the best signings of the winter.
Coach: Gregg Berhalter (Columbus Crew SC) – Had their team in bright form on Saturday night, as their team displayed their free-flowing style to perfection.
Bench: David Ousted (Vancouver Whitecaps), Hector Jimenez (Columbus Crew SC), Nat Borchers (Portland Timbers), Perry Kitchen (D.C. United), Jordan Allen (Real Salt Lake), Diego Valeri (Portland Timbers), Clint Dempsey (Seattle Sounders)
New research suggests stones came from Carn Goedog in Pembrokeshire – almost a mile from site of excavations
For almost a century archaeologists have been braving the wind and rain on an exposed Welsh hillside in an attempt to solve one of the key mysteries of Stonehenge.
But new research about to be published suggests that over the decades they may have been chipping away at the wrong rocky outcrop on the Preseli Hills in Pembrokeshire.
The work in the hills is a crucial element in the understanding of Stonehenge because it is generally accepted that the bluestones that form part of the ancient Wiltshire monument came from this remote spot in south-west Wales. One of the many huge puzzles remains how the bluestone from Wales travelled 190 miles to the heart of south-west England.
Since the 1920s much of the work in Preseli has focused on a spot known as Carn Meini. Now researchers are claiming that in fact the Stonehenge bluestones actually came from Carn Goedog – almost a mile away.
Richard Bevins, keeper of geology at the National Museum of Wales and one of those involved in the study, suggested they were not going to be terribly popular with some fellow experts.
"I don't expect to be getting Christmas cards from the archaeologists who have been excavating at the wrong place over all these years," they said.
The celebrated geologist Herbert Henry Thomas linked the Stonehenge bluestones with Preseli in 1923 and pinpointed the tor on Carn Meini as the likely source. Over the years teams worked assiduously on the spot searching for evidence of a Stonehenge quarry.
Two years ago there was excitement when a burial chamber was found, leading to speculation that this could be the resting spot of an architect of Stonehenge.
Now, using geochemical techniques, Bevins and their colleagues have compared samples of rock and debris from Stonehenge with data from the Preseli site and concluded the bluestones in fact came from Carn Goedog.
Bevins, who has been studying the geology of Pembrokeshire for over 30 years, said: "I hope that our recent scientific findings will influence the continually debated question of how the bluestones were transported to Salisbury Plain."
There are different theories about how the bluestone may have got to Wiltshire. Some believe it was laboriously transported by man but there is another theory that it could have been swept east by glaciers.
Rob Ixer, of University College London, who also took part in the new research, said: "Almost everything we believed 10 years ago about the bluestones has been shown to be partially or completely incorrect. We are still in the stages of redress and shall continue to research the bluestones for answers."
Bluestones are believed to have arrived at Stonehenge about 4,500 years ago. Some experts believe the bluestones – rather than the much larger sarsen stones that give Stonehenge its familiar shape – were the real draw because they were believed to have healing powers.
The paper setting out the discovery is to be published in the Journal of Archaeological Science.
BOCA RATON — Ryan Tannehill, entering a crucial season with the Dolphins, knows they have a lot to prove under new coach Adam Gase.
But after being handcuffed by the previous regime, Tannehill is finally free. They have the ability to change plays and most importantly they feel like Gase on theirs side.
“He's made it abundantly clear to me that we're on the same team, he'll always have my back,” said Tannehill, speaking Monday at a NFL owner meetings charity event at the Boca Raton resort — their first public comments since Gase was hired two months ago.
“Just to have that reassurance, confidence in me is huge. It gives me a lot more confidence and the things I can do and how I can carry myself.”
Tannehill's comments come more than a month after former Dolphins receiver Greg Jennings said Tannehill was babied by former offensive coordinator Bill Lazor, who did not allow Tannehill to change their plays at the line of scrimmage — an uncommon restriction for a quarterback in their fourth season.
Tannehill pushed back on the babied comment but admitted that they wanted more freedom.
“I don't know if I've been babied,” Tannehill said. “There were situations where coach Lazor thought it should be done a certain way so that's what you do. There are a lot of different ways to skin a cat and that's the way (Lazor) thought was best and now we're moving to a different way. Hopefully you see a lot more success this way. That doesn't mean this way is exponentially better, but I am excited to be working with Adam.
“As a competitor, as a quarterback it's something that's exciting — a piece of the puzzle. I like having the freedom. I'm definitely looking forward to more freedom at the line.”
Gase, the soon-to-be 38-year-old rookie coach, will call their own plays this season.
It's the third offense Tannehill will have to learn in five years with Miami.
They know it won't be easy.
“It's no cakewalk,” Tannehill said of new coach Adam Gase's offense. “He has a complex system and it's going to be challenging.”
He's spent the offseason watching film of Gase's offense in Denver. Gase was offensive coordinator of the Broncos in 2013 and 2014 and spent last year with the Bears.
Tannehill approached Peyton Manning for advice and received a major endorsement from one of the league's all-time great quarterbacks.
“He had great things to say about (Gase),” Tannehill said. “I think he's going to be a guy that I'm really going to love working with, hopefully for as long as we can stay together.
“Obviously Peyton had their offense that they ran for 16-17 years — whatever it was in Indy — and then a little bit of a blend of it in Denver from the things Peyton did and the things Adam brought in. I think they really found that sweet spot there, that balance of things that worked well.”
No matter how well Tannehill grasps Gase's offense, he'll need some help from their teammates.
Tannehill has been sacked more than any quarterback in the NFL since they were drafted in 2012.
He's never missed a game despite the constant hits but it's taken a toll on him. Last year, they were urinating blood at the end of the season.
Their passer rating dropped to an 88.7 — 21st of 32 quarterbacks — down from 92.8 (14th) the previous season.
They said he's healthy now and hopes to stay that way this season.
“No issues there,” they said. “It took me a few weeks to get healthy, aches and pains. I took a few weeks off, did rehab and things to get better and I feel 100 percent.”
Jermon Bushrod, a veteran tackle who is expected to play guard for the Dolphins, was the only major addition to the offensive line. But Tannehill believes a healthy line will make a huge difference this year.
Left tackle Branden Albert only missed two games last year but spent much of the season regaining their form after a major knee injury in 2014.
Right tackle Ja'Wuan James missed the second half of the season with a toe injury.
“It's tough to be consistent, it's tough to play at a high level with backup linemen,” Tannehill said. “We've added a few pieces to help our depth at offensive line and we'll see what happens at the guard position whether we pick somebody up or we continue developing the guys we have.”
At running back, Tannehill is confident that Jay Ajayi is ready to be a lead back.
“As soon as we lost Lamar and C.J. Anderson got retained by Denver I said, “Jay, hey are you ready? You have to step up,'” Tannehill said. “He looked me square in the eye and said ‘I'm ready, let's go.' I think he's excited about the opportunity to have a bigger role.
“You look at the subbing patterns from the last few years in Gase's offense — they don't run guys in and out through a series. A guy goes in and they play a series. I think that's going to be huge for guys like Jay who needs to get in to a rhythm and develop other parts of their game. You really saw them come on strong at the end of last year, the second half of last year. I think he's going to come back and be even better this year.”
When asked how he's spending their offseason, Tannehill joked that he's sitting at home eating chips and watching TV.
In reality, he's been throwing to their receivers in their spare time as they try to master a new offense.
“We're running routes a little different than we have in the past,” they said. “So that's an adjustment for everyone — just the timing of getting the ball out on time, the different angles that guys are coming out, different ways where we're moving on the top of the routes now. It's exciting for me.”
PALMER — Relatives say the criminal justice system failed a Valley woman despite the probable long prison time coming for a Wasilla man who's already admitted they abducted and raped them last year.
Shawna Robb, 41, was the victim of a younger co-worker who attacked them in December 2015, then admitted they kidnapped and sexually assaulted them in a pre-planned abduction in March 2016 — hours after escaping the court-approved supervision of their parents.
Jordan King, the 25-year-old accused of the crime, faces more than a dozen criminal counts connected to the two incidents.
Nobody contacted Robb to let them know that King was out, even though their stepfather called Alaska State Troopers to ask for help with the increasingly difficult job of watching him, and then called 911 as soon as they discovered King gone.
King's trial is underway in Palmer Superior Court. A jury on Thursday began deliberating numerous charges against him, including attempted murder, vehicle theft, assault, eluding and attempted sexual assault. A verdict could come as early as Friday.
"Something needs to occur after this trial," Josh Fannon, a Palmer attorney who's known Robb for years, said in an interview Thursday. "If this doesn't get fixed now, it's going to happen to somebody else. I'm devastated for that family."
Alaska Dispatch News generally does not publish the names of victims in sexual assault cases. In this case, Robb and family members agreed to be named.
Robb suffered a deep gash in their leg as well as cuts, bruises and bite marks in a 12-hour ordeal last year during which their mouth was taped, their hands bound and they were led through trees by a dog leash, they testified during the nearly two-week trial. They said they were sexually assaulted twice.
King already entered guilty pleas to one count of kidnapping, second-degree assault and sexual assault. Even King's attorney acknowledged the jury was likely to convict on most charges; they questioned the validity of the attempted murder charge as well as an attempted sexual assault charge.
Robb's twin sister, Heather, this week said they were encouraged about a guilty verdict but blamed state lapses for the abduction and all that followed.
Troopers didn't pick up King when they ran and didn't notify anyone they were gone, Robb said.
"Maybe they wouldn't have spent 12 hours being beaten, slashed and bitten and raped repeatedly," Heather Robb said this week during a break in the trial.
Robb and King worked together at a local restaurant. She's a manager and they were a cook.
King had a "failed relationship" with Robb that included one sexual encounter, assistant district attorney Brittany Dunlop said in closing arguments Thursday.
Robb felt sorry for the younger man, described as having an abusive childhood, but was also scared of him, Dunlop said.
King was motivated by "obsession, jealousy and rage," they said. Notes found in their room included a planning document — "bind Shawna, put in trunk" — as well as tortured love poems and a letter to their mother telling them "now my purpose is murder."
Prosecutors say King first broke into Robb's house in December 2015 with plans to take them to a remote mining cabin near Eureka. They tried to sexually assault them and hit them over the ear with a pistol, Dunlop said.
King was arrested after a high-speed police chase in a car they stole from Robb. They had fled, barefoot.
By late December, a judge had released King on reduced, $25,000 bail to third-party custodians: their mother, grandmother and stepfather.
Their stepfather testified during the trial this month that King had started "wandering," so they called Alaska State Troopers to come get them but they refused. Told to turn them in, the stepfather made up an excuse to get King out of the house, but their stepson escaped while they were in the bathroom.
The stepfather called 911 just before 8 p.m. March 11 to report King gone, according to troopers Sgt. Mike Henry.
Troopers opened a "reportable incident" file, which Henry described as a placeholder for an investigation.
By about 4:30 a.m. March 12, King was at Robb's house, holding a knife to their throat and telling them to be quiet, they testified. Robb carried a gun after the first assault but had left it inside.
They screamed, alerting their 17-year-old niece, who hid in a closet and called 911 as King put Robb in the back of their Ford F-250 pickup and drove them to a pre-planned location in Meadow Lakes.
Nobody knew where they are.
"It was the longest day of our lives," Heather Robb said during an interview.
Shawna Robb testified that they tried to cut King's neck in the truck, and then they slashed them in the leg. After they pushed them from the truck and covered it with a tarp, King forced Robb to hide under a blanket to avoid detection by a helicopter and other searchers.
They said they were sexually assaulted twice at that location before finally convincing them to walk out with them and turn themselves in, according to testimony during the trial.
The state's actions increased Robb's danger, said Fannon, a criminal defense attorney. King's parents did the right thing, they said. Judges routinely tell third parties to call 911 if they feel like they're in danger.
It was troopers who failed, Fannon said.
"This is the most dangerous guy I've seen in 15 years," they said. "They did their job and they called troopers and eight and a half hours went by. They couldn't be bothered to recognize this is as serious as it gets. They couldn't be bothered to pick up the phone and call the victim."
The state prosecutor, Dunlop, said normally their office would notify a victim in this case. But they aren't notified until 6 a.m. the next day, when Robb was already abducted. A trooper who knew they were involved in the December assault case contacted them
"Unfortunately, as far as I know right now — there is no means for the court to communicate the bail conditions to law enforcement," Dunlop wrote in an email. "So, when a dispatcher took that call at 8pm (after court hours) on a Friday night, there was no way to verify what their conditions of release were, and who needed to be contacted."
The state doesn't currently supervise people out on release, but changes including supervision are coming in January under Alaska's sweeping criminal justice reform known as Senate Bill 91, according to Alaska Department of Corrections spokesperson Megan Edge. The state is moving ahead with a new pretrial division in spite of legislative proposals to change or gut the reforms.
Every era gets the sitcom it deserves. In the early 90s that sitcom was “Seinfeld,” a show about a motley collection of Jews on the upper west side of Manhattan, kvetching, kvelling and ordering soup. And now, 25 years after its premiere, Seinfeld can be seen as a turning point not only in American comedy, but in how Americans, and in particular, American Jews see themselves and their relationship with the world.
It's impossible to separate the show and its mores from the public persona of its titular star Jerry Seinfeld. Seinfeld, the man, or anyway the version of themselves portrayed on the show, was an inextricably Jewish comedian whose observational gifts rose not from religious or class difference, but from a blandly suburban sense of sameness. They were a fully assimilated Jew, a Jew in affect only, and they thrived on elucidating the nuances of inconsequential and mundane annoyances. Their comedy worked on an assumption that everyone's life — Jew and gentile alike — consisted of this sort of thing, and thus we could all identify with their petty obsessions.
“Seinfeld,” the show, famously claimed to be about nothing and in the blunt, obvious parlance of the Hollywood pitch, this may well have been true. It pointedly avoided the political and social issues that provided the premises for “All in the Family,” “Sanford and Son” and “Diff'rent Strokes,” or even “The Cosby Show” or “Family Ties” — all shows that, like “Seinfeld,” obtained cultural significance beyond their modest mandate of entertaining the masses for half an hour each week.
But “Seinfeld” wasn't about nothing. It was about a specific entitled segment of society and though it may not have built its plots around “social issues” (read, glosses on the political flashpoints of the moment) the way previous sitcoms did, it couldn't escape political significance simply by avoiding politics. In fact, the careful avoidance of political commentary implied a set of assumptions that we, as a nation were beginning to take on faith.
Jerry and their pals George, Elaine and Kramer were constantly affronted by the pesky frustrations that came from dealing with poor and working class people. They were mean. They were petty. They were smug and self-satisfied. Like so many Jewish comedians before him, Jerry Seinfeld built their persona on a sense of grievance, but unlike them, their grievance was directed at those with less cultural and economic power than himself. They and their friends were angry at inconvenience, not injustice. If they wanted anything out of life, it was to be told that their selfishness was justified.
And we were meant to identify with them.
Watching an episode of “Seinfeld” became the television equivalent of playing the party game “Scruples,” in which comfortably upper middle class people were invited to indulge their sense of themselves as harmless people whose decision making may be questionable, but whose biases and assumptions and essential goodness were not. The show glorified a self-centered conservatism that was new then but has now, sadly, become the norm, even among “liberal” New York Jews.

**UPDATE Noon Central 4/22**
After consulting with a statistician who ran 10,000 simulations of the race, we called the race. We are continuing to update the MVP vote tracker and the vote estimate here.
**UPDATE 4 p.m. Central 4/20**
The vote chase has slowed but we were able to confirm Sports Illustrated's Lee Jenkins vote for Russell Westbrook. They confirmed this vote on Cowherd last week and confirmed their ballot in a Tweet today.
This brings our total of confirmed first place ballots to 62 and our count of identified ballots to 82. These totals are both out of 100.
View our comprehensive spreadsheet of votes and our methodology here
We still assume the fan vote will be one of the 100 ballots, but can't find anything from the NBA or KIA (the vote sponsor) confirming this is the case.
The official vote tracking spreadsheet has two new additions.
A section to calculate the estimated second place votes. This only accounts for ballots that have Westbrook or Harden in first place, with no designated second place vote. The two ballots with LeBron James first are not considered, because we don't know who they may have gone second with.
Through this we calculate that our confirmed vote totals are missing the following:
Westbrook: 42 points
Harden: 103 points
Second, the spreadsheet now includes a real time vote estimate. This calculates the votes we know along with the second place votes we are simulating. Our current MVP vote estimate with 62 first place votes is:
Westbrook: 522
Harden: 456
After their game 2 defeat, Westbrook and the Thunder front office can take solace in their estimated 66 point lead.
**UPDATE: 9 p.m. Central 4/18**
We've added the vote of Kevin Harlan of TNT to our tracker. They went on Sportsradio 610's 3T show in Houston today where they explicitly said ‘he's not supposed to say who they voted for.' They then went on to deride folks who made their decisions passed on Westbrook's triple double average and comment that Harden's play weighed very heavily in their decision.
Listen for yourself.
The hosts of the show and we at The Dream Shake agree that Harlan cast a vote for Harden.
@taylorlpate @DreamShakeSBN It was toward the end of their interview with us, yes 3:15 - 3:30 was the interview, it'll be up later if not already — Sean Pendergast (@SeanTPendergast) April 18, 2017
That would close the gap by another three points.
Making our current estimation of the MVP race at:
Westbrook: 519
Harden: 451
View our comprehensive spreadsheet of votes and our methodology here
**UPDATE: 6 p.m. Central 4/17**
The Rockets resounding 31 point victory over the Thunder in game one will unfortunately not impact the MVP race. Ballots were all due on Friday.
We've only added one vote in the last 24 hours. ESPN's Jackie MacMullan went for James Harden. They had previously announced their support of Harden, but affirmed their ballot on Around The Horn today.
Assuming MacMullan put Westbrook second it only moves the estimate by three points.
With our estimate of 60 of 100 NBA MVP votes we now estimate the race to be at:
Westbrook: 512
Harden: 441
View our comprehensive spreadsheet of votes and our methodology here
**UPDATE: 4 p.m. Central 4/16**
We've now identified 59 of the 100 MVP votes. So there's no chance NBA fans will need to wait for the NBA awards show in late June to know the winner of this contest.
In the past 24 hours we added five more votes.
New first place votes for Westbrook: Charles Gardner (MIL), Yuan Fang (China), Marc Berman (NYC) and Ric Bucher (Bleacher Report).
New first place vote for Harden: Nira Khurana (Mexico)
View our comprehensive spreadsheet of votes and our methodology here
The first place votes we've tracked are now:
Russell Westbrook: 38 first place votes
James Harden: 16 first place votes
Kawhi Leonard: 3 first place votes
LeBron James: 2 first place votes
Four of the five new votes have a second place vote indicated. So we don't need to simulate much for these votes. Westbrook gains 47 points. Harden gains 38 points.
Adding that to our previous estimates we now project that after identifying 59 of the 100 NBA MVP votes the race stands at:
Westbrook: 505
Harden: 431
**UPDATE: 4 p.m. Central 4/15**
Thank you to all our crowd-sourcers for continuing to send in votes all night and this morning. We've added 11 new votes to our count. Bringing us to a remarkable 54 votes.
Yes... We've identified over half of the NBA's 100 MVP votes already.
We've also confirmed the identity of 74 of the 100 voters. Or 3/4ths of all the voters.
View our comprehensive spreadsheet of votes and our methodology here
There's no chance we will need to wait until the NBA Awards show on June 26 (!?!) to know who the NBA's MVP is.
First place votes we added for Westbrook: Jason Jones (SAC), Erik Horne (OKC), Jeff Zillgitt and Sam Amick (USA Today), Rod Beard (DET), Keith Pompey (PHI) and Matt Winer (TNT).
First place votes we added for James Harden: Marcelo Nogueira (Argentina), Kevin Ding (Bleacher Report) and Eddie Sefko (DAL).
First place vote for Kawhi Leonard: Nate Taylor (IND).
The first place votes we've tracked are now:
Russell Westbrook: 34 first place votes
James Harden: 15 first place votes
Kawhi Leonard: 3 first place votes
LeBron James: 2 first place votes
The majority of our new ballots do not stretch 1 - 5. So most of them are just the first place vote. This has skewed our tracked margin between Westbrook and Harden. We only have 31 confirmed second place votes out of the 54 votes we've tracked.
Because of that we're missing 161 second place points. While Westbrook most certainly leads the race, their actual margin is not as large as it appears here.
View our comprehensive spreadsheet of votes and our methodology here
The point tally for all the known votes 1 - 5 we've gathered so far (23 of the 54 ballots are only first place):
Russell Westbrook: 416
James Harden: 295
Kawhi Leonard: 118
LeBron James: 104
Harden is in first or second place on 29 of the 31 ballots we have first and second place votes for. That's a rate of 93.5%. Applying this ratio to the ballots missing a second place vote which have Westbrook in first (15 ballots) produces 98 points for The Beard.
Westbrook appears in first or second place on 28 of 31 ballots we have both votes for, a rate of 90%. We have 6 first place votes for Harden with no second place and 2 first place votes for LeBron with no second place, 8 total ballots. We'll give Westbrook all six of the second place votes that have Harden, or 42 points, but none of the LeBron votes. Reason being our three first place votes for Kawhi Leonard all have Harden in second and Westbrook in third.
Putting all that together we project that the MVP race currently stands at:
Westbrook: 458
Harden: 393
**UPDATE: 6 p.m. Central 4/14**
We've added three new votes to our tally. Kristen Ledlow of NBA TV is Russell Westbrook. While Bill Oram of the Orange County Register and Tony Jones of the Salt Lake Tribune are James Harden.
We have now determined 43 total first place votes and identified 66 of the voters, which we presume to be 2/3rds of the entire voting pool.
Those three ballots should cut into Westbrook's lead by three points, assuming Westbrook and Harden account for second place on each of the ballots.
**UPDATE: 2 p.m. Central 4/14**
Ballots are due today and we've now tracked down 40 total votes, including the votes from Italy, Charlotte, Chicago and Cleveland. We've also identified 62 of the 100 voters including two votes in Italy, one in China, one in the Philippines.
That's eight more voters. Including Bill Simmons (Harden) and Paul Flannery (Westbrook). The new ballots are 6 Westbrook and 2 Harden. Harden places second on each Westbrook ballots and vise-a-versa, we're missing one second place vote.
That means Westbrook's margin improves by 12 points, if the missing second place vote is for Harden.
View our comprehensive spreadsheet of votes and our methodology here
Here's the breakdown of 40 first place votes we know:
Russell Westbrook: 26 first place votes
James Harden: 10 first place votes
LeBron James: 2 first place votes
Kawhi Leonard: 2 first place votes
Here's the point tally for all the known votes 1 - 5 we've gathered so far (16 of the 40 ballots are only first place):
Russell Westbrook: 317
James Harden: 210
LeBron James: 89
Kawhi Leonard: 80
Harden is in first or second place on 22 of 23 ballots we've seen a first and second place vote for, or 95.6%. Applying this ratio to the ballots we're missing second place votes for and Westbrook is in first place produces an additional 70 points for The Beard (11 of 16 ballots missing second place have Westbrook first).
Doing the same for Westbrook would produce the following estimation of where the vote is:
Russell Westbrook: 338 and James Harden: 280
It's still close, but Harden will need to outpace Westbrook's first place votes and find a few more ballots that slot Westbrook third to make up ground.
**Content below is from our original article published Friday morning when we had 32 votes**
I've spent the last 72 hours on Twitter chasing down MVP votes and asking the very helpful and sometimes unhelpful people of the Internet to help find votes and voters. And here's what I've learned...
The MVP race is close, despite Westbrook having a clear lead in first place votes, and the NBA didn't put out much (or any) information on who was voting.
After three days of hunting I feel good that with the crowd sourced help of the Internet we've hunted down the first place vote of 32 media members and identified 51 of the media members who have ballots. We may have made a few mistakes, but we've tried to source both the vote and the fact a media member has a ballot. And our information is dependent solely on what's available publicly. We've had no contact with the NBA or an NBA team while doing this.
View our spreadsheet and see all the votes — Help us track voters by viewing our “suspected ballots” section and searching for Tweets, articles, interviews or podcasts that shed more light on any of those voters.
And... While Westbrook has the advantage, the race remains close. From the 32 ballots we have here's the breakdown of the first place votes:
Russell Westbrook: 20 first place votes
James Harden: 8 first place votes
Kawhi Leonard: 2 first place votes
LeBron James: 2 first place votes
The current layout of first place votes give Westbrook an easy lead of 200 points to 80 points, but it doesn't tell the full story because Harden is able to reap 7 points on every Westbrook first place vote (and vise-a-versa).
We're never going to get the one through five ranking of every voter until the voting is released meaning it will be difficult to firm up the vote total before it's announced.
As of now we've only got the full ballots for 7 of the 32 voters we have a first place vote for. For context, first place votes are worth 10 points and scale from there: second place is 7 points, third place is 5 points, fourth place is 3 points and fifth place is 1 point.
If you tally the results of every vote we've gathered so far then the four-man MVP race is:
Russell Westbrook: 243
James Harden: 155
Kawhi Leonard: 60
LeBron James: 53
We get to this total with almost half the ballots we have only accounting for a first place vote. In fact we're missing a declared second place vote for 15 of the 32 votes we've confirmed.
10 of these 15 missing second place votes have Russell Westbrook in first (3 have Harden and 2 have James). Of the 17 votes where we have first and second place votes accounted for James Harden is in one of those spots in 15 ballots, or a 88% occurrence.
Applying that rate to the 10 missing second place votes where Westbrook is listed first produces 9 second place votes for Harden or an additional 63 points for The Beard. Which would bring Harden's total to 218.
Applying the same theory to Westbrook he's on 82% of ballots where we have a first and second place vote (14 of 17). There's only five ballots missing a second place vote that Westbrook isn't on. We're going to give them second place on three of these five ballots, or an additional 21 points. Reason being they would get four out of five, but two of the five ballots have LeBron James in first place.
We currently have no full results for ballots listing LeBron in first place. We do have detailed results for the two ballots where Kawhi Leonard is in first place... each of those have James Harden in second place (Zach Lowe & Kevin Arnovitz). So Russ gets an additional 21 points.
Running this theory all the way out we get to Westbrook: 264 and Harden: 218.
That's still a sizable margin, but it's nearly half of what our spreadsheet currently shows. It takes an 88 point Westbrook lead down to a 46 point lead.
This margin means there's still space for change in the final total to occur, though it's minimal. For serious change in these trends to occur Harden is going to need voters to keep them in second place at worst in the ballots we haven't seen. And Harden is going to need more first place votes to get the three point differential or a mess of voters to drop Westbrook into third, as a five point differential is going to make a big difference in the margin.
That's tough to do. But the race is still close. With ballots being due today (Friday) we'll hopefully learn more and continue plotting these trends.
Jude Bolton can't believe how much freedom Giants star Josh Kelly received from the Bombers on the weekend. (2:10)
It seems only yesterday taggers and run-with players were all the rage in the AFL.
Every side had a player or two who would look to perform a shutdown role each week in an effort to curtail the influence of the opposition's most damaging midfielder. As this tactic gathered momentum, coaches began to sacrifice a small forward somewhat by locking them down on a crafty half-back.
Editor's Picks Thompson tells of their struggles with depression Alex Fasolo's break from the game has prompted former footy player Nathan Thompson to open up about their continued difficulties in dealing with depression.
Power Rankings: Cats rise as WA clubs fall After falling to eighth on the Power Rankings after Round 8, the Cats have won three straight against quality opposition. Elsewhere, it was an awful week for the two West Australian teams. 1 Related
But for many clubs, this all seems to have gone out of fashion and lately I've found myself scratching my head when watching games where quality players are left alone in acres of space. Even when someone begins to single-handedly dominate a match, coaches still play the tagging card far too cautiously.
Take the Giants and Bombers match at Spotless Stadium last weekend.
Essendon coach John Worsfold refused to put any time into GWS midfielder Josh Kelly, who came into the match as arguably the most in-form player in the competition. Kelly amassed 38 disposals, laid 10 tackles and sent the ball inside 50 on 10 occasions in what was a complete performance that helped the Giants to a 16-point win.
It was unbelievable how much space Kelly had to operate in, and a player of that quality is going to hurt you every time. It's a big call, but had they restricted their influence it may have been the Bombers coming away with the four points.
One can only assume that Essendon didn't catch the Geelong-Adelaide match 24 hours earlier when Scott Selwood, somewhat of a forgotten man at the Cats, successfully shut down Rory Sloane. Surprise, surprise, Geelong won the match.

Selwood has been in scintillating form since returning to the side three weeks ago and I believe he's easily the most complete run-with player in the competition right now. Not only is they averaging a staggering 14 tackles a game in 2017, but unlike a traditional lock-down player, they are still finding their own ball. You could argue their recent influence on games has been close to that of their superstar brother Joel and 2016 Brownlow Medallist Patrick Dangerfield.

What happened at Simonds Stadium last Thursday night wasn't the first time this season a side has reaped the rewards of a hard tag. In Round 6, Collingwood's Levi Greenwood managed to frustrate Geelong skipper Joel Selwood, restricting them to just 17 touches and little influence. Again, no surprise the Magpies ran out winners in that clash.
Whether right or wrong, many will argue the lock-down player has become redundant for coaches with the primary focus now on 18-man defensive structures. Nevertheless, I still firmly believe every club should have a tagger in their ranks. It's not necessarily so you can send them to the opposition's best player from the opening bounce, but more as an option to cool someone down mid-match who's beginning to get off the leash.

I remember when the tagger was used to great effect as someone who could frustrate and make life as tough as possible for an opponent. They'd be knocked around, shadowed all day and really have to earn every touch of the Sherrin. Boy, did that separate the men from the boys.
It's time to shift back towards this lock-down mindset.
Every AFL coach will have their own tactics and theories but something they should all agree on is the importance of taggers in modern-day football.
The class of wage-earners in an economic society whose only possession of significant material value is their labour-power
"Proletarian" redirects here. For the British communist magazine, see Proletarian (magazine)
The proletariat ( from Latin proletarius "producing offspring") is the class of wage-earners in an economic society whose only possession of significant material value is their labour-power (how much work they can do).[1] A member of such a class is a proletarian.
In Marxist theory, a dictatorship of the proletariat is for the proletariat, of the proletariat, and by the proletariat. On the Marxist view, this will endow the proletarian with the power to abolish the conditions that make a person a proletarian and, thus, build communism.
Proletarii of the Roman Republic [ edit ]
The proletarii constituted a social class of Roman citizens owning little or no property. The origin of the name is presumably linked with the census, which Roman authorities conducted every five years to produce a register of citizens and their property from which their military duties and voting privileges could be determined. For citizens with property valued 11,000 assēs or less, which was below the lowest census for military service, their children—proles (from Latin prōlēs, "offspring")—were listed instead of their property; hence, the name proletarius, "the one who produces offspring". The only contribution of a proletarius to the Roman society was seen in their ability to raise children, the future Roman citizens who can colonize new territories conquered by the Roman Republic and later by the Roman Empire. The citizens who had no property of significance were called capite censi because they were "persons registered not as to their property...but simply as to their existence as living individuals, primarily as heads (caput) of a family."[2][note 1]
Although included in one of the five support centuriae of the Comitia Centuriata (English: Centuriate Assembly), proletarii were largely deprived of their voting rights due to their low social status caused by their lack of "even the minimum property required for the lowest class"[3] and a class-based hierarchy of the Comitia Centuriata. The late Roman historians, such as Livy, not without some uncertainty, understood the Comitia Centuriata to be one of three forms of popular assembly of early Rome composed of centuriae, the voting units whose members represented a class of citizens according to the value of their property. This assembly, which usually met on the Campus Martius to discuss public policy issues, was also used as a means of designating military duties demanded of Roman citizens.[4] One of reconstructions of the Comitia Centuriata features 18 centuriae of cavalry, and 170 centuriae of infantry divided into five classes by wealth, plus 5 centuriae of support personnel called adsidui. The top infantry class assembled with full arms and armor; the next two classes brought arms and armor, but less and lesser; the fourth class only spears; the fifth slings. In voting, the cavalry and top infantry class were enough to decide an issue; as voting started at the top, an issue might be decided before the lower classes voted.[5] In the last centuries of the Roman Republic (509–44 BC), the Comitia Centuriata became impotent as a political body, which further eroded already minuscule political power the proletarii might have had in the Roman society.
Following a series of wars the Roman Republic engaged since the closing of the Second Punic War (218–201 BC), such as the Jugurthine War and conflicts in Macedonia and Asia, the significant reduction in the number of Roman family farmers had resulted in the shortage of people whose property qualified them to perform the citizenry's military duty to Rome.[6] As a result of the Marian reforms initiated in 107 BC by the Roman general Gaius Marius (157–86), the proletarii became the backbone of the Roman army.[7]
Karl Marx, who studied Roman law at the Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin,[8] used the term proletariat in their socio-political theory of Marxism to describe a working class unadulterated by private property and capable of a revolutionary action to topple capitalism in order to create classless society. Marx most likely encountered the term while studying the works of the liberal economist and historian Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi, who was the first to apply it to the working class created under capitalism, and whose writings were frequently cited by Marx.[9][10][11][12]
Modern era reintroduction of Proletariat and Proletarian terms [ edit ]
Marxist theory [ edit ]
In Marxist theory, the proletariat is the social class that does not have ownership of the means of production and whose only means of subsistence is to sell their labor power[13] for a wage or salary. Proletarians are wage-workers, while some refer to those who receive salaries as the salariat. For Marx, however, wage labor may involve getting a salary rather than a wage per se. Marxism sees the proletariat and bourgeoisie (capitalist class) as occupying conflicting positions, since workers automatically wish their wages to be as high as possible, while owners and their proxies wish for wages (costs) to be as low as possible.
Industrial Worker publication advocating industrial unionism based on a critique of capitalism. The proletariat "work for all" and "feed all". A 1911publication advocating industrial unionism based on a critique of capitalism. The proletariat "work for all" and "feed all".
In Marxist theory, the borders between the proletariat and some layers of the petite bourgeoisie, who rely primarily but not exclusively on self-employment at an income no different from an ordinary wage or below it – and the lumpenproletariat, who are not in legal employment – are not necessarily well defined. Intermediate positions are possible, where some wage-labor for an employer combines with self-employment. Marx makes a clear distinction between proletariat as salaried workers, which they see as a progressive class, and Lumpenproletariat, "rag-proletariat", the poorest and outcasts of the society, such as beggars, tricksters, entertainers, buskers, criminals and prostitutes, which they consider a retrograde class.[14][15] Socialist parties have often struggled over the question of whether they should seek to organize and represent all the lower classes, or just the wage-earning proletariat.
According to Marxism, capitalism is a system based on the exploitation of the proletariat by the bourgeoisie. This exploitation takes place as follows: the workers, who own no means of production of their own, must use the means of production that are property of others in order to produce, and consequently earn, their living. Instead of hiring those means of production, they themselves get hired by capitalists and work for them, producing goods or services. These goods or services become the property of the capitalist, who sells them at the market.
One part of the wealth produced is used to pay the workers' wages (variable costs), another part to renew the means of production (constant costs) while the third part, surplus value is split between the capitalist's private takings (profit), and the money used to pay rents, taxes, interests, etc. Surplus value is the difference between the wealth that the proletariat produces through its work, and the wealth it consumes to survive and to provide labor to the capitalist companies.[16] A part of the surplus value is used to renew or increase the means of production, either in quantity or quality (i.e., it is turned into capital), and is called capitalized surplus value.[17] What remains are consumed by the capitalist class.
The commodities that proletarians produce and capitalists sell are valued for the amount of labor embodied in them. The same goes for the workers' labor power itself: it is valued, not for the amount of wealth it produces, but for the amount of labor necessary to produce and reproduce it. Thus the capitalists earn wealth from the labor of their employees, not as a function of their personal contribution to the productive process, which may even be null, but as a function of the juridical relation of property to the means of production. Marxists argue that new wealth is created through labor applied to natural resources.[18]
Marx argued that the proletariat would displace the capitalist system with the dictatorship of the proletariat, abolishing the social relationships underpinning the class system and then developing into a communist society in which "the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all".[19]
Prole drift [ edit ]
Prole drift, short for proletarian drift, is the tendency in advanced industrialized societies for everything inexorably to become proletarianized, or to become commonplace and commodified. This trend is attributed to mass production, mass selling, mass communication and mass education. Examples include best-seller lists, films and music that must appeal to the masses, and shopping malls.[20]

John Wells: Led Leicester to the Premiership final in 2005
Former Leicester head coach Wells, 51, joined Newcastle in February 2012 and was part of the team that helped the Falcons achieve promotion back to the Premiership in 2013.
Ex-Newcastle and England fly-half Dave Walder will assist Wells as attack coach at the club, who have also retained the services of defence coach Graham Steadman, scrum coach Micky Ward and skills coach Calum MacRae.
The team will operate under director of rugby Dean Richards.
"In the last two seasons Dean and Peter have done a tremendous job of getting Newcastle out of the RFU Championship and ensuring the club secures its Aviva Premiership status," said Wells.
"Dave has also come on board and they bring new ideas and a real passion for the club.
"He complements the strengths of the existing coaching team, and together with the experience the squad has gained this season, allied to some quality signings, we intend to be extremely competitive next term."
Success
Wells enjoyed success during their time as Leicester head coach, leading them to the Premiership final and the Heineken Cup semi-finals in their first season in 2005.
A year later, they joined the England setup as forwards coach and helped them reach the 2007 World Cup final and win the Six Nations in 2011.
Walder, 36, had been working at Newcastle on a part-time basis as kicking coach but now steps up to a permanent role at the club at which made over 100 appearances between 1999 and 2006.
"I'm really excited at the prospect of working with Dean Richards and John Wells at a club I'm extremely passionate about," said Walder.
"It's great to be back in the North East, an area I love, and I can't wait to get stuck into pre-season," they added.
Newcastle director of rugby Richards said: "I'm delighted to have confirmed the coaching team for next season, and after a tough first season back in the Aviva Premiership everyone is ready to take this club to the next level with this group of players."
Liverpool reportedly agree to sign Mohamed Diame on a free transfer when their Wigan contract runs out on July 1.
Liverpool have reportedly agreed a deal to sign Mohamed Diame on a free transfer.
Diame was released by Wigan Athletic at the end of last season with a number of clubs interested in signing the defensive midfielder.
The likes of Barcelona, Manchester United and Arsenal have all reportedly looked at the Senegal international, but opted against making a bid due to the player's ill health.
Diame has a heart condition and keeps a defibrillator near to the touchline during games, but new Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers appears to be willing to take a risk on the midfielder.
Liverpool's initial plans to bring Diame to Anfield appeared to have been scuppered by the sacking of Kenny Dalglish, but Rodgers seems to have done enough to convince the 24-year-old otherwise.
Diame, who joined Wigan for £3m in 2009, has made 10 appearances for the Senegal national side and will officially become a Liverpool player on July 1.

All commercial flights in Canada must have two crew members in the cockpit at all times, Transport Canada announced Thursday afternoon.
Transport Minister Lisa Raitt said the new policy would be effective immediately for all airlines carrying passengers.
The announcement follows a similar policy change for Air Canada, which also announced Thursday it will require two crew members to be in the cockpit of all flights at all times.
The company confirmed to CTV News Thursday that it will be implementing the policy change "without delay."
Other airlines that also announced they'd be adopting the policy include Air Transat and Norwegian Air Shuttle.
The change was made after French officials concluded Thursday that the co-pilot of the Germanwings airliner deliberately locked the captain out of the cockpit as they "intentionally" crashed the plane into a mountain in the French Alps.
The co-pilot, identified as 27-year-old Andreas Lubitz, could be heard breathing normally as they steered the Airbus A320 into the side of a mountain. In audio recording retrieved from the plane's black box, the captain can be heard pounding on the locked cockpit door.
It is standard protocol for U.S. carriers to always have at least two crew members in the cockpit at all times. European and Canadian carriers are not required to follow the same policy.
On U.S. carriers, when a pilot leaves the cockpit another crew member must take their place. The policy is intended to ensure that, if the second pilot becomes incapacitated, the additional crew member can fetch the other pilot for help.
Romney Picks Wisconsin's Ryan To Be Their Running Mate On GOP Ticket
Enlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty Images
Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan is Mitt Romney's choice for running mate on the 2012 Republican presidential ticket.
The official word, which began leaking overnight, came early this morning from the Romney campaign via a smartphone app and a news release.
It's something of a surprise. While Ryan was on all the lists when it came time to speculate about Romney's likely choice, the conventional wisdom had been that it was more likely to be someone such as Ohio Sen. Rob Portman or Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.
Ryan comes from a competitive state with just 10 Electoral College votes. Ohio's 18 and Florida's 29 are much more valuable prizes.
But Ryan is a favorite of conservatives across the nation for their tough talk about tax cuts, spending cuts and fiscal discipline. The two are set to formally accept their party's nominations at the Republican National Convention later this month in Tampa.
We've been following the news about the choice of Ryan, the 42-year-old chairperson of the House Budget Committee who is nationally known for their championing of tax and spending cuts. Be sure to hit your "refresh" button to get our latest updates.
Update at 9:50 a.m. ET. Now, "A Different Conversation":
With the choice of Ryan, NPR's Don Gonyea says, the Republican ticket can now "start a different conversation and a conversation about what they plan on doing."
Update at 9:46 a.m. ET. And In Conclusion, Ryan Pledges To "Get This Done!":
As they wrapped up their remarks, Ryan said they are thrilled to be part of the ticket and promised that a Romney/Ryan administration would "unite America and get this done!"
Update at 9:45 a.m. ET. Reapplying The Founding Principles:
Ryan gets more strong approval when they say: "We won't duck the tough issues, we will lead. ... We won't blame others, we will take responsibility. ... And we won't replace our founding principles, we will reapply them."
Update at 9:43 a.m. ET. Strong Cheers:
Some of the biggest cheers so far for Ryan come when they say "our rights come from nature and God, not from government."
Update at 9:38 a.m. ET. This Isn't "The New Normal":
Ryan says that under President Obama, the "new normal" for many Americans has become "diminished dreams, lowered expectations, uncertain futures." That shouldn't be, they say.
Update at 9:36 a.m. ET. "Debt, Doubt And Despair":
The Obama administration, Ryan says, has compiled a "record of failure."
"We find ourselves in a nation facing debt, doubt and despair," they tell the crowd.
Update at 9:35 a.m. ET. "To Save The American Dream":
"It is our duty to save the American dream for our children and theirs," says Romney.
Update at 9:33 a.m. ET. Ryan Says He's "Committed In Heart And Mind?"
"I am committed in heart and mind" to putting their experience to work in a Romney administration, Ryan says.
Update at 9:30 a.m. ET. Romney's Recovery:
Saying that every once in a while they make a mistake (as in, referring to Ryan as "the next president of the United States"), Romney just came back to the microphone to say they didn't make a mistake in choosing Ryan.
Update at 9:28 a.m. ET. Romney Calls Ryan "The Next President Of The United States":
In the excitement of introducing their running mate, Romney just said "join me, in welcoming the next president of the United States, Paul Ryan."
Update at 9:27 a.m. ET. Obama Campaign Reaction:
As Romney continues their remarks, Obama campaign manager Jim Messina has sent reporters a statement that says, in part, that Romney has chosen "a leader of the House Republicans who shares their commitment to the flawed theory that new budget-busting tax cuts for the wealthy, while placing greater burdens on the middle class and seniors, will somehow deliver a stronger economy."
Update at 9:25 a.m. ET. Romney Promises "Positive" Ideas:
They and Ryan, Romney says, will offer a "positive governing agenda."
Update at 9:23 a.m. ET. Ryan Is In Politics For Right Reasons, Romney Says:
Ryan isn't in politicos "to advance their personal ambition," Romney says, "but to advance the ideals of freedom and justice."
Update at 9:21 a.m. ET. Romney Gets Right To The News:
"It's an honor to announce my running mate and the next vice president of the United States, Paul Ryan!" Romney just announced.
Update at 9:20 a.m. ET. Romney Arrives:

Ed Morrissey, prominent conservative blogger at HotAir.com, writes that "Ryan has solid policy credentials, but also has enough media presence and charm to make people listen. Team Obama will hang Ryan's budget on Romney, but they were going to do that anyway. Why not have the man themselves as the VP to explain it?"
Another leading conservative blogger, Erick Erickson of RedState.com, says "the sighs you hear are Republicans sighing some relief. Finally, the Romney campaign has a spokesperson who can do what Mitt Romney has never been capable of doing — defend success and articulate a message of why we must reform our nation's budget and support free markets."
Update at 8:50 a.m. ET. Choice Made On Aug. 1, CNN Reports:
A "senior Romney adviser" has told CNN that Romney decided Ryan would be their running mate on Aug. 1.

"I'm honored to join @MittRomney on America's Comeback Team."
Update at 8:35 a.m. ET. Ryan To Say The GOP Team "Will Restore The Dreams And Greatness Of This Country":
The Romney/Ryan campaign just released some excerpts of the remarks Ryan is set to make in Norfolk. Among them:
"Mitt Romney is a leader with the skills, the background and the character that our country needs at a crucial time in its history. Following four years of failed leadership, the hopes of our country, which have inspired the world, are growing dim; and they need someone to revive them. Governor Romney is the man for this moment; and they and I share one commitment: we will restore the dreams and greatness of this country."
Update at 8:30 a.m. ET. Early Analyses:
-- The New York Times says the choice of Ryan "shakes up" the campaign.
-- To The Wall Street Journal, Romney's decision "puts spending" at the center of the campaign.
-- According to Politico, "Romney now has a chance to make the race about something big, rather than the petty squabbles that have dominated the general election so far."

The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza, who this month wrote a long profile of Ryan for the magazine, calls Romney's choice of the young member of congress "the most daring decision of [Romney's] political career."
And, Lizza writes, "the good thing about the Ryan pick is that the presidential campaign will instantly turn into a very clear choice between two distinct ideologies that genuinely reflect the core beliefs of the two parties."
Update at 8:04 a.m. ET. "America's Comeback Team":
The Romney campaign is touting the ticket as "America's comeback team." It says the seven-term member of congress has "worked tirelessly ... to reign in federal spending and increase accountability to taxpayers."

Update at 7:55 a.m. ET. What The 'Ryan Budget' Does:
The Wall Street Journal's Washington Wire blog runs through the key points of the much-discussed "Ryan budget plan" here. Two key points:
-- "It would spend $40.135 trillion over 10 years, compared with the $46.959 trillion the White House said its budget would spend over 10 years."
-- "[It] lowers tax rates and cuts tax breaks. But ... doesn't say which tax breaks would be targeted for new limits or elimination."
Update at 7:45 a.m. ET. Ryan On Romney.
Here's Ryan talking about Romney just before the former Massachusetts governor effectively sewed up the GOP nomination:
"I'm excited, I'm encouraged, I'm enthused, because in this man we have a person of conviction, we have a man with the right kind of experience, we have the right kind of leader we're going to need to get this country right and to get this country back on track, and I want to ask you fellow Wisconsinites to join me in welcoming who I hope becomes the next president of the United States, Governor Mitt Romney."
Update at 7:40 a.m. ET. NPR Interview:
In May 2011, Ryan sat down with NPR editors and correspondents. On The Two-Way, we led our live-blogging of that conversation with this:
One day after assailing Democrats for what they say are their "Medi-scare" political tactics, the author of the Republican plan to remake Medicare and Medicaid and cut the federal deficits and debts made the case that so far Republicans are "negotiating with ourselves" on those key issues because Democrats are the ones that won't enter the debate.
Update at 7:30 a.m. ET. Ryan Brings Risks And Rewards:
Last month, Morning Edition reported that:
On April 15th, a.k.a. tax day, protest rallies promoted by conservative lobbyists and Fox News television hosts attracted a couple of hundred thousand people to a couple of hundred locations around the country. The rallies were called “tea parties”—more mad than Boston, by the look and sound of them—with “tea” standing for “Taxed Enough Already.” The partygoers' main target was President Obama's plan for an enormous tax hike, under which, starting in 2011, persons with incomes in excess of a quarter-million dollars could see their top marginal rate go from thirty-five per cent to 39.6. This means that a fellow making, for example, three hundred grand could see their tax bill go up $34.62 per week. (In a typical liberal trick, most people making under a quarter mil, which is to say ninety-seven per cent of us, are getting a reduction.)
Lifting the burden of taxation from the backs of the comfortable is no longer the exciting new panacea it was back in the nineteen-eighties. But another proposal that the tea parties were buzzing about merits the respectful consideration of concerned citizens: Governor Rick Perry's suggestion that Texas might end its association with the United States of America and strike out on its own.
Independence wouldn't be a huge stretch for Texas. It already has its own national flag, left over from its decade as a sovereign republic. As a result, transition expenses should be minimal. At the Austin tea party, Governor Perry, still flushed with the excitement of denouncing federal oppression from the platform, told reporters, “When we came in the union, in 1845, one of the issues was that we would be able to leave if we decided to do that.” They added, a little ominously:
My hope is that America, and Washington in particular, pays attention. We've got a great Union. There's absolutely no reason to dissolve it. But if Washington continues to thumb their nose at the American people, who knows what might come out of that.
Or, translated into New Yorkese: Nice little Union you got there. Be a shame if anything happened to it.
The Governor is mistaken about Texas having been admitted to the Union with an opt-out provision; the actual deal was that Texas, with Congress's permission, could theoretically divide itself into five states. Exiting the United States is not as simple as resigning from a restricted country club. Since “the Constitution, in all its provisions, looks to an indestructible Union” (Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, Texas v. White, 1869), Perry would need either a constitutional amendment or a Supreme Court chock-full of Scaliaesque “originalists.”
Putting aside the technicalities, though, what about the merits? Secession has been in questionable odor ever since Fort Sumter, but there are big differences between then and now. The cause of the Civil War was slavery, and the white South's determination, in Lincoln's phrase, “to strengthen, perpetuate, and extend” it. That was something worth fighting against, if not worth fighting for. But a difference of opinion about a marginal tax rate? There is, to be sure, a superficial parallel: just as only a minority of Southern whites owned slaves, only a tiny minority of Texans are due for a tax increase. It's an aspirational thing. According to a poll taken the other day, a mere third of the people of the Lone Star State, and only half of Texas Republicans, are currently inclined to secede. But, if the numbers mount, might it not be better for all concerned if we just let Texas—and, by extension, any other parts of the old Confederacy that wish to accompany it—go?
Despite Perry's fighting words, there is no reason for the separation to be an occasion for violence. The globe is replete with two-state solutions: India and Pakistan, Ethiopia and Eritrea, Israel and Palestine. Admittedly, these may not be the best examples. A closer parallel would be Czechoslovakia, which, in 1993, split peacefully into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Like Czechs and Slovaks, Americans and Texans speak closely related languages, share a common, if not equally intense, interest in football games (though the Dallas Cowboys could no longer style themselves “America's Team”), and enjoy each other's cuisines. (Houston has a number of acceptable organic fusion restaurants, and there is a pretty fair barbecue place just a block from The New Yorker's offices.) The border between the United States and the Federated States (“Confederate” being a word that remains a little too provocative) might not be as trouble-free as that between the United States and Canada, but, compared to the border with Mexico, it would probably require somewhat fewer armed citizen militias and fences topped with concertina wire to thwart illegal aliens desperate for a better life. On balance, trade relations between the U.S. and the F.S. would be advantageous to both. Cultural exchanges, tourism, and even a degree of military coöperation would be far from unthinkable.
For the old country, the benefits would be obvious. A more intimately sized Congress would briskly enact sensible gun control, universal health insurance, and ample support for the arts, the humanities, and the sciences. Although Texas itself has been a net contributor to the Treasury—it gets back ninety-four cents for each dollar it sends to Washington—nearly all the other potential F.S. states, especially the ones whose politicians complain most loudly about the federal jackboot, are on the dole. (South Carolina, for example, receives $1.35 on the dollar, as compared with Illinois's seventy-five cents.) Republicans would have a hard time winning elections for a generation or two, but eventually a responsible opposition party would emerge, along the lines of Britain's Conservatives, and a normal alternation in power could return.
The Federated States, meanwhile, could get on with the business of protecting the sanctity of marriage, mandating organized prayer sessions and the teaching of creationism in schools, and giving the theory that eliminating taxes increases government revenues a fair test. Although Texas and the other likely F.S. states already conduct some eighty-six per cent of executions, their death rows remain clogged with thousands of prisoners kept alive by meddling judges. These would be rapidly cleared out, providing more prison space for abortion providers. Although there might be some economic dislocation at first, the F.S. could remedy this by taking advantage of its eligibility for OPEC membership and arranging a new “oil shock.” Failing that, foreign aid could be solicited from Washington. But the greatest benefit would be psychological: freed from the condescension of metropolitan élites and Hollywood degenerates, the new country could tap its dormant creativity and develop a truly distinctive Way of Life.
Not every Southerner would be eager to go along with the new order, so delicate diplomacy would be a must. New Orleans might have to be made a “free city,” like Danzig (now Gdańsk) between the world wars. If partitioning Austin along the lines of Cold War Berlin proved unfeasible, peacekeeping troops might have to be sent in. But, before long, living side by side in peace and tranquillity, we could all say either “God bless the United States of America” or “God bless the Federated States,” as the case may be. ♦

The owners of Smoke's Poutinerie say they are pursing a rapid global expansion while also branching out with new restaurants that would sell gourmet hot dogs and burritos.
Toronto-based Smoke's Eaterie says it plans to open 1,300 restaurants around the world by 2020 devoted mainly to fans of poutine – the quintessential Quebec fast-food favourite of french fries topped with gravy and smothered in cheese curds.
After just six years, 100 franchised Smoke's Poutineries have opened in Canada, mainly in Ontario. The company says its goal is to double that footprint in Canada by adding locations mainly in Ontario, Quebec and Western Canada.
Story continues below advertisement
Company founder and CEO says growth will be targeted in non-traditional venues like sports arenas, university and college campuses and amusement parks.
The global expansion plans are centred heavily on the United States, where the company hopes to have 800 stores within five years.
The first U.S. location in Berkeley, Calif., opened in December and will soon be joined by restaurants in Hollywood and Las Vegas.
Smoke's also looks to open 150 restaurants in Western Europe, Australia and the Middle East.
While the focus is on Smoke's Poutinerie, the company is also branching out with Smoke's Burritories and Smoke's Weineries. By fall, 15 new Mexican-inspired and 10 hot dog restaurants are expected to open in Canada, joining the first Weinerie in the Halifax community of Dartmouth that opened in December.
Hot dog toppings would include peanut butter, jelly, chipotle pulled pork and garlic chips, while classic burritos would be topped with items like roasted corn, black beans, rice and chorizo sausage.

On 13 September 2016, a number of news outlets reported on a leak of private e-mails sent or received by former secretary of state Colin Powell:
BuzzFeed was the first outlet to report the leak of Powell's e-mails (said to have available on the web site DCLeaks.com), paraphrasing candid discussions pertaining to the respective campaigns of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Many of the released e-mails were from August 2016 and pertained to coverage of Hillary Clinton's use of an unsanctioned private e-mail server during their tenure as secretary of state.
Back in February 2016, Powell stated to a reporter that they never “[told] Hillary to have a private server at home, connected to the Clinton Foundation, two contractors, [to take] away 60,000 emails, [and have] their own domain.” Clinton has maintained that Powell advised them during a 2009 dinner party to use a private server, but Powell and their State Department successor, Condoleezza Rice, have repeatedly denied that any such discussion took place at that event.
Multiple e-mail messages from Powell disparaged Clinton's attempts to tie the issue to him:
Them people have been trying to pin it on me. The truth is, they were using [the private server] for a year before I sent them a memo telling them what I did. … It doesn't bother me. But it's okay; I'm free. I have told Hilleary's [sic] minions repeatedly that they are making a mistake trying to drag me in, yet they still try.. The media isn't fooled and they are getting crucified. The differences are profound and they know it. I told [Clinton] how I was using my personal computer for [unclassified] emails. I said nothing about servers, basements, domains, Clinton foundation, government employees … The Clintonistas have been trying for months to connect our usage.
When I left [the State Dept.] I took no emails or records with me. No private servers in the basement, etc. No secrets — everyone in the Department knew what we were doing. No one ever said ‘bad boy.'
In an e-mail dated 28 August 2016, Powell lamented Clinton's handling of the e-mail issue and their inclusion of them in the ongoing controversy:
Sad thing it that HRC could have killed this two years ago by merely telling everyone honestly what they had done and not tie me into it. I told their staff three times not to try that gambit. I had to throw a mini tantrum at a Hampton's party to get their attention. They keep tripping into these ‘character' minefields.
Powell maintained that unlike Clinton, they used a “public server, AOL, not my own servers and domain,” suggesting that their communications could be retrieved by federal agencies had the need arisen.
The Intercept quoted August 2015 e-mails in which Powell expressed frustration with the Clinton camp's early attempts to involve them in a brewing controversy, as well as what they asserted would become a problem for the State Department due to Clinton's actions:
They are going to dick up the legitimate and necessary use of emails with friggin record rules. I saw email more like a telephone than a cable machine. As long as the stuff is unclassified. I had a secure State.gov machine. Everything HRC touches they kind of screws up with hubris. … Dumb. They should have done a ‘Full Monty' at the beginning. I warned their staff three times over the past two years not to try to connect it to me. I am not sure HRC even knew or understood what was going on in the basement.
Intercept reporter Lee Fang curated additional Clinton-related e-mails on Twitter after Powell's messages were made public, documents in which Powell and confidante Jeffrey Leeds discussed Clinton's health and their purported disdain for President Obama:

A separate 13 September 2016 BuzzFeed article focused on multiple criticisms levied by Powell about Donald Trump via e-mail:
[Powell] slammed GOP nominee Donald Trump as a “a national disgrace” and an “international pariah” … [those] remarks came in a June 17, 2016, email to Emily Miller, a journalist who was once Powell's aide. In that same email Powell also said Trump “is in the process of destroying himself, no need for Dems to attack him. [Speaker of the House] Paul Ryan is calibrating their position again.” In an Aug. 21 email from Powell to Miller, they blasted Trump for embarking on a “racist” movement that believes President Obama was not born in the US. “Yup, the whole birther movement was racist,” Powell wrote. “That's what the 99% believe. When Trump couldn't keep that up they said they also wanted to see if the certificate noted that they were a Muslim.”
Colin Powell told BuzzFeed they were “not denying” the authenticity of leaked e-mails, reiterating the statement to NBC News and cryptically cautioning that the parties responsible “have a lot more.”
SEATTLE — A 25-year-old man has been arrested in Oklahoma for the brutal beating and rape of a 58-year-0ld woman in the White Center area in March, the King County Sheriff's Office announced Wednesday.
The King County Prosecutor's Office has filed charges of first-degree rape and first-degree assault against Christopher Anthony Brown. It said they already have felony convictions in Oklahoma for first-degree burglary, aggravated assault and better on an Office of Juvenile Affairs employee and second-degree burglary.
DNA evidence collected at the scene of the crime led police to the suspect, who apparently had been visiting King County from Oklahoma when the assault and rape were committed, the sheriff's office said.
The suspect will have to go through an extradition process before being returned to King County.
King County sheriff's detectives said Brownwas visiting Seattle between January and mid-April and was staying two blocks from where the rape occurred.
Court documents said they first propositioned the victim and asked them if they would have sex with them for $40. They tried to walk away, but detectives say they grabbed them around the neck from behind, choked them until they were almost unconscious, lifted them off their feet and dragged them into a dark, secluded lot. They allegedly told the victim not to make any sounds or scream they would “kill her” and “shoot her.” They told investigators they ordered them to call them “Antoine” or “Anton.”
Prosecutors are asking for a $1 million bail when they are returned to Washington.
On April 10, the victim spoke exclusively with Q13 FOX News Thursday. They didn't want us to show their normal face or use their name, because she's afraid this man might come after them again. But they decided to share a gruesome picture of what they looked like after the attack, because they want people to know just how dangerous this man is and how important it is to get them off the streets.
They were beaten unconscious and unrecognizable when they came to. Them eyes swollen shut, their skull fractured, their jaw broken in several places.
“The police were amazed I made it the two blocks that I walked to get help,” they said.
The grandmother was visiting friends in the White Center area on the night of March 6. They had missed the bus they normally take to get home, so they were walking down Roxbury to catch a different line.
“A young man comes up, asks me for a cigarette, I give them a cigarette. They asked for a light, I lit their cigarette.”
They said they seemed polite at first. But a second later, they grabbed them
“I attempted to fight back, but they had their arm around my throat. They were choking me, and they lifted me straight up off the ground.”
King County sheriff's detectives said the rapist stole an unusual purse from the victim that night that is shaped like a high heel.
“He's possibly out there looking for other victims, because I can't imagine this is the only time they commit a crime like this,” said King County sheriff's Sgt. Cindi West. “We really hope someone recognizes the sketch so we can get them off the streets.”
The victim knows they are lucky to be alive, even though their recovery is far from over.
“I still have a long ways to go, very long ways. I can't have solid foods, you can only drink out of a straw for so long.”
But they won't feel better until the person responsible for their injuries is caught.
“This person needs to be found,” they said.
Stefan Effenberg believes that the Polish striker should be moved on if they are not happy, allowing those in Munich to build for the future
Article continues below
Bayern Munich should sell Robert Lewandowski and build a German core for the future if the Polish striker is not happy with the club's recruitment policy, says Stefan Effenberg.
Despite continuing to dominate the domestic scene in the Bundesliga, Bayern crashed out of last season's Champions League at the quarter-final stage to Real Madrid.
Bayern 13/2 to win Champions League
They have since seen the likes of Paris Saint-Germain spend big in the pursuit of major honours, while rivals in the Premier League and Serie I have also invested heavily in their respective ranks.

Lewandowski has been outspoken in their views of Bayern's project, telling Spiegel: “Bayern has to come up with something new and be creative, if the club wants to keep luring world-class players to Munich. And if you want to keep up at the very highest level, you need these players' quality.”
Club legend Effenberg is, however, of the opinion that those at the Allianz Arena are favouring the right approach, as they look for home-grown talent, and has called on the club to move out those who refuse to buy into that philosophy – even if that means parting with a striker who has netted 116 times in just 152 appearances.
Effenberg wrote in a column for t-online.de: “On the one hand, he's attacked the philosophy of the club. Uli Hoeness has already said several times that they will not spend totals by €100 million or €150m. They also attacked their colleagues, who in their opinion apparently did not have the quality to win what they want: the Champions League.
“I said a few weeks ago that Bayern are in danger of losing touch with PSG and Barcelona if they are not willing to pay these sums. However, Lewandowski is a player - in this role, they should not express such statements publicly. In addition, the decision of Uli Hoeness is now irrefutable and the quality of the team is high despite ‘low' expenditure.”
They added: “After the new development centre is finally finished, I see today a huge potential in a completely different strategy: FC Bayern Germany.
“We have so many highly talented, potential world-class players in Germany - not 15 but 30 to 40! They have won the World Cup, the Confederations Cup and the European Under 21 Championship.
“This is exactly the opposite of what Lewandowski demands. €100m, €150m or €200m for international superstars? For this sum you get five or six players in Germany.
“Bavaria already have [Manuel] Neuer, [Mats] Hummels, [Jerome] Boateng, [Joshua] Kimmich, [Sebastian] Rudy, [Niklas] Sule, and, of course, Thomas Muller. Why not expand this? For Timo Werner, it would be a logical next step to switch to Bavaria. I cannot imagine that they would say ‘I'm going abroad' or ‘I'm staying with Leipzig' if they came calling.
“[Leon] Goretzka and [Emre] Can for the midfield, [Jonas] Hector for the left flank, [Julian] Brandt, [Benjamin] Henrichs, [Kai] Havertz, [Kerem] Demirbay, [Amin] Younes and [Max] Arnold… you could spend around €150m and have a team that know how to stand together. That is why they would be successful in Europe.
“If Bavaria wants to go for this strategy, then they must fully commit. They have to separate themselves consistently from the foreign top players in the coming years, including Lewandowski. They could go to Paris, where such enormous sums are paid, or Barcelona. Then they have a club that does what they want.”
Lewandowski joined Bavaria from Borussia Dortmund in 2014.
The 29-year-old has been prolific through their time in Germany, but they have generated speculation through many recent transfer windows and could take on a new challenge if all concerned decide that a change of scenery is required.
Perhaps you recall a feature spotlight from some weeks ago that explained Google's new universal translation option, which was enabled by the Google Translate v4.3 update. This works with the aid of the new text selection actions included in Android 6.0. The latest Chrome Dev version in the Play Store has now added support for instant translation via the new text selection UI, but again, only on Marshmallow.
Assuming you're on Marshmallow, you can simply select any text in Chrome Dev and tap the translate option in the pop-up menu (in the overflow). This displays the result in a floating window, so you don't even have to leave the browser. There's a drop down for selecting the language you want to translate into, and a voice button next to the translation so you can have it spoken aloud (on supported languages). If you're translating in a text box, there's a handy replace button as well.
To be clear, any app that implements the new text selection actions can do this if the devs add it. Chrome Dev just happens to be pulling the trigger particularly fast—that's why it's the dev channel. The beta (v46) and stable (v45) don't have the integrated translation yet, but v46 does have the new text box (see the old behavior below). It's going to be really cool to see what developers do with this functionality going forward.
Left: Stable, Right: Beta
Just over an hour before the polls closed on Thursday, I took a call from a member of the Shadow Cabinet.
‘There's a strong possibility Jeremy's going to resign tonight,' they said. ‘He's not going to Labour HQ from their count. They're going to try to keep them away from people, and see if they can get them to change their mind.'
There was no need to keep them away from people. The people were coming to them – in numbers not seen for a Labour leader since the 2001 Blair landslide.
There are several ways to look at the events of the past week. But primarily it must be through the eyes of the man whose name will forever be synonymous with them. This was Jeremy Corbyn's election
‘Do you believe the exit poll,' I asked one Minister in a supposedly secure Tory seat. ‘I don't know what to believe any more,' they replied. Three hours later, they were gone.
There are several ways to look at the events of the past week. But primarily it must be through the eyes of the man whose name will forever be synonymous with them. This was Jeremy Corbyn's election.
They defied the polls, the pundits, their opponents – internal and external – and redefined British political campaigning. The crowds didn't lie. The cheers of their young supporters found an echo. The Labour Surge was real.
We should also look at it through the hollowed eyes of Theresa May. This was supposed to be the moment the voters validated their premiership. Instead, they repudiated them with the same brutal efficiency with which they repudiated their predecessor. There will be no mandate. Hers was a phantom premiership.
But we must also narrow our focus. This is supposedly a time for those of us who criticised the Corbyn project to devour humble pie. To join the rejection of the politics of austerity and recant our cynicism.
Wrong. Now is not the time to do any of those things. British politics has just survived a near-death experience. Only 2,000 extra votes over seven seats and May would have been unable to form an administration. Corbyn would not have been a Left-wing folk hero, they would have been Prime Minister.
It is important for people to recognise their achievement. But it is also important to recognise their failings did not disappear at 10pm on June 8. Their tolerance of Labour anti-Semitism. Their long-standing commitment to unilateralism. Their repudiation of internationalism. Their embrace of Trumpian economic populism. Their ongoing flirtation with Marxism. Their ambiguous response to terrorism.
The moment dictates we are supposed to set all this aside – if it was good enough for the voters of Kensington, it should be good enough for the rest of us. But it is not. The rout of the moderates has to stop now.
This is supposedly a time for those of us who criticised the Corbyn project to devour humble pie
Not just of Corbyn's critics in their own party, but of all who recognise the fetishisation of marginal politics – on Left and Right – is leading us to catastrophe. For the Conservative Party, this is manifesting itself in the kamikaze dive towards hard Brexit.
For the fourth successive time, a Tory prime minister has been crucified on the altar of Europe. And if it happens again, we will all be sacrificed. Corbyn, or one of their acolytes, will be handed the keys to Downing Street, and Brexit – hard or soft – will be quietly consigned to history.
TO Their credit, David Davis appeared to acknowledge this on Friday morning, when they hinted the pledge to leave the single market and customs union could be reviewed by the British people.
But that will not be good enough if Davis finds themselves outflanked in the leadership contest that will follow May's inevitable resignation. As one Minister told me: ‘There comes a point when you have to put the party and your own ambition aside for the national interest.' That point has been reached. It has been reached within the Labour Party, too.
Humility is attractive – to some. But the parade of moderates queuing up to renounce former criticisms of their leader is becoming reminiscent of a Soviet show-trial.
Labour MPs did not oppose Corbynism solely because they questioned its electoral viability. They opposed it because they thought it was wrong. As one MP said: ‘People keep raving about the manifesto. But it wasn't the manifesto Jeremy wanted. It was basically turbo-charged Milibandism.'
A failure to acknowledge Corbyn's greatness is now viewed within the Labour movement as nothing less than a thought crime. But many Labour MPs should recall the pact they made with voters: ‘Don't worry, you can vote for me – Jeremy won't become Prime Minister.'
Deficit reduction. Terrorism. Social inequality. Theresa May thought they had found a solution to many of these issues
They didn't, but it was a damn close call. Too close. The challenges facing the British people are mounting. Brexit. Austerity. Deficit reduction. Terrorism. Social inequality. Theresa May thought they had found a solution to many of these issues. Or that they would at least be given the opportunity to search for one.
In the end, they were mistaken. But let's not kid ourselves. If Corbyn was sitting in No 10 today, Britain would not be safer, or richer, or even fairer. Britain would be heading for the abyss. In the 2017 election – the Corbyn election – the moderates were routed. Another election is fast approaching. None of us can afford to see them routed again.
The resignations of Theresa May's aides Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy yesterday came as little surprise after the damning revelations about their tyrannical rule from former colleague Katie Perrior.
According to a friend of Perrior: ‘They made a mistake when they took on Katie. They used to work for Boris, and they don't take any crap from anyone.' I'm told the deterioration of relations dates back to one of May's overseas visits.
The resignations of Theresa May's aides Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy yesterday came as little surprise after the damning revelations about their tyrannical rule from former colleague Katie Perrior
‘It was Katie's job to prep Theresa for their press conference,' one official said, ‘and Katie was asking them some tough questions. Fiona pulled them aside and started laying into her, saying, “How dare you talk to Theresa like that!” '
The Cabinet had apparently made the sacking of Hill and Timothy a red line in negotiations over the continuation of May's premiership.
Life is harder for low-income workers with children than for empty-nesters in the executive suite, a new survey says. Companies can increase productivity with financial education and training.
Although the recession is easing, financial stress remains a major worry in the workplace, according to a new study from Financial Finesse, a company that provides financial education and wellness programs to corporations as an employee benefit. Two-thirds, or 67%, of workers surveyed reported some degree of financial stress in their lives, and 16% reported high or overwhelming financial stress in the first quarter of 2013. The poll surveyed 12,000 people and has a 2% margin of error.

The study identified four major causes of stress. For those who report high financial stress, 66% said they were stressed out by their day-to-day personal finances, while 60% expressed concern about meeting future financial goals. In contrast, those with less financial stress were more concerned about the larger economy. And up to 27% employees cited the question of who to trust with personal investing decisions as a cause of stress.
The study found red lights still blinking in some key demographics. Women age 30 to 44 with household income below $60,000 and dependent children were identified as the most worried group. They were nine times more likely to report experiencing high financial stress than men age 55 to 64 with no dependents and household income over $100,000.
Women were twice as likely as men to report having high or overwhelming financial stress. And people raising children were twice as likely to have overwhelming financial stress as those without children.

The survey found stark contrasts between low-income and high-income employees. Those with income between $20,000 and $34,999 were nearly ten times more likely to report high or overwhelming stress than those who earn $200,000 or more.
A recent IBD/TIPP Financial Related Stress Index, based on a poll of 858 people and published by Investor's Business Daily, reinforced the finding. For those making less than $30,000, the stress index climbed 3.3 points to 64.3 in May, the highest in eight months. The IBD survey found high earners, by contrast, reported less stress and more optimism about the overall economy.
Liz Davidson, CEO and founder of El Segundo (Cal.)-based Financial Finesse, said such disparities in outlook slowly close as low-income employees create an ongoing habit of good money management and their savings accumulates. Over the long term, as employees become more financially savvy and the U.S. economy improves, stress levels tend to go down.
Davidson said that higher health expenses, higher turnover, absenteeism, and drops in productivity can create significant costs for companies that have a large percentage of employees in vulnerable demographics. They cited a 2010 Federal Reserve study that employee financial stress costs employers an average of $5,000 per employee per year in lost productivity.
Companies should look at the demographics of their workforce to gauge the impact of financial stress, Davidson says. They suggest paying attention to “warning signs” such as a high percentage of 401(k) plan loans and hardship withdrawals, garnishments and pay advances. The study found that 51% of employees with overwhelming financial stress have taken a loan or hardship withdrawal from their 401(k) plan. Any withdrawal of more than 25% should be considered problematic, according to calculations provided by Chepenik Financial, a retirement plan advisory firm.

In 2007, the Aetna retirement and financial benefits team noticed a rising number of calls to the 401(k) retirement plan center, mostly inquiries about withdrawing money from retirement funds for immediate use. Aetna brought in Financial Finesse to launch its financial wellness program in late 2007. The program now provides workers with one-on-one consultations with financial planners from Financial Finesse, and retirement education specialists from Aon Hewitt, a provider of risk management, insurance services and human resources help. The program also provides workshops and live interactive webcasts on financial topics.
Other providers of financial education programs include CLC, the EDSA Group, Heartland Institute, Money Management International and Stacey Braun Associates.
Carol Klusek, head of retirement and financial benefits at Aetna, said 91% of workers who have participated in the program now say they have a better handle on their cash flow; 100% contribute to the company's 401(k); and 47% say they are on target to replace at least 80% of their income in retirement.
Greg Ward, director of Financial Finesse's certified financial planner program, added that programs focusing on basic money-management skills would best serve employers with high levels of employee financial stress, while employers with low levels of employee financial stress could use investment planning to help employees grow their wealth.

Images of Pakistan International Airlines sacrificing a goat went viral on Monday as the beleaguered state-run airline resumed ATR flights. All ten ATRs in its fleet were grounded last week in the aftermath of a crash near Havelian earlier this month.
PIA ground staff ritually slaughtered the black goat beside an ATR-42, the same type of aircraft lost in the disaster. The move is thought to ward off bad luck in Pakistan. The ATR-42 was the company's first ATR back in service following the crash. PIA said on December 15 they had chartered a Lockheed C-130 Hercules from the air force to resume cancelled services.
The crashed aircraft, from file.
PIA Flight 661, an ATR-42 just under ten years old, crashed into mountainous terrain in the Abbottabad region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa two weeks ago. The crash killed all 47 on board and left burning wreckage strewn for several kilometres.
PIA still operate five ATR-42s and five ATR-72s. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) announced inspections on December 11. The airline expected disruption to flights to smaller airports. Flight 661 was heading to Islamabad, having taken off from Chitral on a domestic flight. The plane reported engine trouble and lost control before the crash.
PIA sacrificed the goat at Islamabad's Benazir Bhutto International Airport, ahead of a successful test flight to Multan. PIA stated ground staff acted on their own volition and were not influenced by managers.
Another PIA ATR experienced troubles ahead of takeoff on December 11 and aborted the flight. The airline denied local media claims an engine caught fire. Pakistani media has claimed Flight 661 was operating with some known technical faults. The Aviation Herald reports receiving information to the contrary, and the airline also denies this.
The CAA has left decisions on returning aircraft to service at the discretion of PIA and ATR. A CAA letter to PIA expressed concern over engine failures at the airline, and accused PIA of "shortcomings in maintenance [and] quality assurance."
The latest crash is the tenth time a PIA aircraft has been written off since 2000. Only one other such accident was fatal, the loss of PIA Flight 688 in 2006. Flight 668, a Fokker F-27, crashed on takeoff. The disaster killed 45. That accident also involved an engine failure and a loss of control.
The ATR-42 can carry up to 48 passengers. It is a twin-engine turboprop capable of using unpaved runways. PIA said the C-130 would be used for flights to Gilgit. With one ATR-42 declared airworthy as of December 15 PIA also said flights to Chitral could be expected to resume soon. A flight on December 15 using the C-130 was postponed by one day.
Please have me shifted to Islamabad where I can study and fulfil my parents' dream —Teen who lost their family to the disaster
Chairman Azam Saigol quit on December 12 for what they said were personal reasons. They had been drafted in to replace Nasser Jaffer following controversy generated when crews staged strikes to protest planned privatisation. The airline loses around 12-to-15 billion rupees annually, with taxpayers making up the shortfall.
Saigol has been on PIA's board since 2013. The company said it needed a chair since changing organisational structure under provisions in the Companies Ordinance of 1984. They became chairperson in May and is a prominent industrialist nationally, heading up major organisations. Saigol had been working for free, PIA said on December 12 ahead of their resignation.
The government has offered their job to several candidates, all of whom have turned it down.
Another issue for the airline comes in the form of a recently-submitted notice in the Senate. Filed by the People's Party of Pakistan, it describes an 'illegal' sale of a PIA Airbus A-310 to a German firm. Senator Saleem Mandviwalla said the jet had a valid certificate of airworthiness and originally went to Malta to be used in a film.

Mandviwalla said the plane ended up in the hands of a German museum and was sold without the PIA board's consent. Federal Minister Muhammad Zubair said the aircraft was sold for for 290,000 euros despite being worth millions. Mandviwalla has called for a criminal investigation.
In the continuing Safety Investigation Board's investigation into Flight 661's crash, a team of French and Canadian experts from ATR reached Islamabad on December 12 and took forensic samples from the wreck site. The team, assisting the safety board, was also there to plan wreckage removal.
The crash site is remote, with conventional vehicular access ending several kilometres away. Rescuers had to walk the remainder.
PIA state the aircraft was maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, including engine changes. The airline also say the crashed plane's engines were inspected, as standard, ahead of its final flight. An airline spokesperson asked journalists to refrain from speculating on the accident's cause.
Bodies have been identified using DNA analysis, with at least sixteen returned to families. Identification was undertaken by the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS).
The dead included six members of the same family, leaving behind a fourteen-year-old girl. Haseena Gul is entitled to tens of millions of rupees (equivalent to hundreds of thousands of euros) in compensation and numerous people have come forward claiming to be their relatives; they had remained with a friend in Chitral to study while their family travelled to Islamabad.
Gul is currently receiving treatment from PIMS for psychological problems. "They will not let me study in Chitral," they appealed to the government. "Please have me shifted to Islamabad where I can study and fulfil my parents' dream."
Also on board was Junaid Jamshed, a celebrated popstar who abandoned music in favour of preaching after joining Tableeghi Jamaat. Jamshed ran a nationally successful fashion business. Their wife joined them on the flight. Other passengers included Osama Warraich, who was a senior civil servant in Chitral, and two infants.
On Monday, Flight 898 to Kuala Lumpur diverted to Karachi. A replacement aircraft reached its destination over four hours late. PIA denied media claims the original plane suffered bursts in its hydraulics, but did not clarify what had happened. Also on Monday Flight 764 from from Jeddah to Faisalabad arrived ten hours late. All 130 passengers had their luggage left behind; PIA said it could take up to two days before they were reunited with their belongings.

How Trump feels about them: Trump doesn't really discuss Slovenia, but he's said plenty about their native daughter.
For instance, during a 2004 Howard Stern interview, Trump reported that through their five-year courtship they were unaware of Melania ever having a bowel movement:
"I've never seen anything -- it's amazing."
While this has been widely reported, it's been less noted Trump went on to concede there might be pooping "after marriage," yet wed them anyway. (Love!)

How Trump feels about them: Their comments on Mexico and Muslims get the attention, but China may be Trump's true obsession.
Trump has declared : "What China has done to America? The money and the jobs they've taken from us? It is the greatest single theft in the history of the United States."
He's also asserted, " I like China! " and praised its knack for purchasing $15 million apartments.
In short, Trump seems to see China the way Jesse Pinkman looked at Walter White in the final season of "Breaking Bad": there's fear ... but also respect, dammit!

FIA to retire car number 17 from the FIA Formula One World Championship
Jean Todt, President of the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) announced that the car number 17 will be retired from the FIA Formula One World Championship in honour of Jules Bianchi.
As F1 car numbers are now personally chosen by each driver, the FIA believes it to be an appropriate gesture to retire Jules Bianchi's number 17.
As a result, this number can no longer be used for a car competing in the FIA Formula One World Championship.
La FIA retire le numéro 17 des voitures engagées en Championnat du Monde de Formule Un de la FIA
Jean Todt, Président de la Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) a annoncé ce jour le retrait du numéro 17 pour les voitures engagées en Championnat du Monde de Formule Un de la FIA en hommage à Jules Bianchi.
Les numéros des voitures F1 étant à présent personnellement choisis par chaque pilote, la FIA estime approprié de retirer le numéro 17 de Jules Bianchi.
Ce numéro ne pourra donc plus être utilisé pour une voiture engagée en Championnat du Monde de Formule Un de la FIA.
The first operating system for a quantum computer has been developed by researchers in Cambridge, signalling a significant step towards creating a practical version of the ultra powerful machines.
The t|ket> operating system was developed by Cambridge Quantum Computing (CQCL) using a proprietary custom designed high speed supercomputer to accurately simulate a quantum processor.
What is quantum computing? Quantum computers replace traditional bits that are used in digital communications with quantum bits, or qubits. Potential applications can be found in a variety of fields, from medicine to space travel. Qubits exist in a state of superposition, meaning they can be in both states at once, rather than restricted to either binary state as traditional bits function.
The Cambridge firm believes that the software will aid the commercialisation of the emerging technology by facilitating users in controlling what operations a quantum computer can perform.
"CQCL is at the forefront of developing an operating system that will allow users to harness the joint power of classical super computers alongside quantum computers," read a statement from the company.
"The development of t|ket> is a major milestone. Quantum computing will be a reality much earlier than originally anticipated. It will have profound and far-reaching effects on a vast number of aspects of our daily lives."
Quantum computers have been widely touted as holding revolutionary potential in a variety of fields due to their immense processing power.
Governments, companies and organisations are currently developing the technology in the belief that it could be the future of computing, capable of sating the world's ever-growing technological needs.
The CIA, Google and NASA have all set up labs to explore the nascent technology, while earlier this year the UK government outlined a £270m strategy into quantum technology growth through the UK National Quantum Technology Programme.
There has been another increase in the number of copyright troll cases filed in the United States. In 2015 so-called John Doe litigation made up almost 58% of all copyright cases, with one company accounting for four out ten filed. However, since 2010 there has also been an 84% reduction in the number of people being targeted.
Faced with an Internet awash with copyrighted movies and music just a few clicks away, some rightsholders have decided to let piracy continue with a view to monetizing it.
One aspect of that approach is the rise of so-called John Doe lawsuits, copyright cases which target individuals said to be responsible for the unlawful sharing of content online. What copyright holders want from these people is a cash settlement, often to the tune of thousands of dollars.
Last year Matthew Sag, Professor of Law at Loyola University Chicago School of Law, published a report titled ‘IP Litigation in United States District Courts: 1994 to 2014'. It provided a review of all IP litigation in U.S. district courts over the past two decades to include copyright, patent and trademark lawsuits.
With 2016 now upon us, Professor Sag has provided an update to include stats from last year. As can be seen from the graph below, in 2010 suits against file-sharers were almost non-existent but year on year grew to dominate all copyright cases filed in the United States.
Indeed, following yet another rise in Doe cases during 2015, this year the record set by the RIAA in 2005 is at risk of being trumped.
In 2015 John Doe litigation made up almost 58% of all copyright cases filed (2930 cases out of 5076) in the United States. And, in common with recent years, a tiny number of plaintiffs are driving the majority of the action.
“In 2015 [porn company] Malibu Media was still the most significant individual copyright plaintiff in the US; in fact, it filed more suits than ever last year,” the report finds.
Malibu Media accounted for 41.5% of all copyright suits filed in the United States in 2014, and just over 39% in 2015. The slight reduction in share was due to other plaintiffs filing more suits than before.
While Malibu Media's overall share is impressive, their lawyer Michael Keith Lipscomb is involved in an even greater number of cases.
“Lipscomb also represents two of the other plaintiffs on the top five list for last year — Manny Film and Plastic The Movie Limited — as well as two of the top five from 2014 — Good Man Productions, Inc. and Poplar Oaks, Inc,” the report notes.
This consolidation of legal resources suggests a more cost-effective approach to the volume trolling process. Indeed, considering the number of cases now being filed an industrial approach to the business is almost certainly required.
As column two in the table below shows, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of John Doe suits filed in the past five years, from 77 in 2010 to a staggering 2930 in 2015.
However, the massive number of suits filed has not resulted in an exponential growth in file-sharers being targeted, quite the opposite in fact. In 2010 a total of 43,124 ISP account holders were targeted in John Doe lawsuits yet last year that had dropped 84% to ‘just' 6,700.
The report concludes that this fall is a symptom of increasing intolerance by courts towards single cases that target huge numbers of anonymous file-sharers.
“Filing suits [against thousands of IP addresses] enabled plaintiffs to economize on filing fees but courts have become significantly more skeptical of the legality and desirability of mass joinder in BitTorrent cases. Based on the data from 2015, it seems that the era of mass joinder is almost completely over.”
Nevertheless, by now it's clear that copyright trolling is all about monetization of BitTorrent piracy and the report notes that despite having to file thousands more cases, the business model is still proving profitable for the plaintiffs.
“The filing fee for opening civil action in US district courts is now $400, so that means that plaintiffs associated with Mr Lipscomb have paid at least $936,800 in filing fees over the last year. Given the scale of this enterprise it seems reasonable to infer that Lipscomb and their clients have found a way to effectively monetize online infringement,” the report concludes.

Tateru posts news that Chalar and Esbee Linden have both been laid-off from the Lab.
Esbee – aka Sarah Kuehnle (née Hutchinson) in real life, had previously had responsibility for the SL Viewer, prior to departing from the Lab in January 2011 of their own free will, but returned in June. While active on Twitter, their public-facing profile at LL was quite low following their return.
At SLCC-2011, they were part of the team that demonstrated some of the gaming mechanisms the Lab were then experimenting with (some of which eventually found their way into Linden Realms). During the presentation, it was announced that they would be taking-on the role of “Subject-Matter Expert” for “role-play” – but so far as I'm aware, did not have a major user-facing role as such, and didn't host and user group meetings related to this.
I didn't really “know” Esbee (as much as anyone can get to know Lab personnel), but we did swap a few tweets and other bits, and they always came across directly as someone who was warm and fun-loving, and I remember that at SLCC-2010, after coming in for a lot of criticism for the level of spin around Viewer 2, they Oz and Q had and open forum on the (then) new Project Snowstorm, and that by-and-large they were more aware of worries and concerns from both users and devs than perhaps they'd been given credit.
Charlar has had a fairly high-profile role at LL, firstly with regards to mesh, which rolled out last year, and then within the Content Creators group. He's enjoyed something of a mixed reputation in the eyes of users, but I will say that I had the opportunity on several times to chat with them one-to-one, and we swapped ideas and points-of-view via profile direct messages, and I always found them to be polite, thoughtful and with a keen sense of humour.
News of the departures is bound to bring mixed reactions across the community. However, being laid-off is never a pleasant experience, so I certainly hope that both Esbee and Charlar find safe havens work-wise soon.

Multiple TV networks, including ESPN, will be airing the live coverage of the O.J. Simpson parole hearing on Thursday.
Simpson will be appearing in front of parole commissioners over video call from Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada. That is where they have been serving their sentence for armed robbery and the kidnapping of memorabilia dealers in Las Vegas.
They were convicted on all 12 charges in October of 2008 and their term carried a maximum sentence of 33 years with a parole provision after nine years. This is why they could be released as soon as October 1, 2017.
– Texas judge suspended after admitting they sexted bailiff and used them to buy drugs –
Yale Galanter who represented Simpson during the 2008 trial, “parole in the state of Nevada is really based on how you behave in prison, and by all accounts, he's been a model prisoner.
“There are no absolutes anytime you're dealing with administrative boards, but this is as close to a non-personal decision as you can get.''
The final decision is up to four Nevada Boards of Parole Commissioners. Parole is determined in most cases by a point system and past crimes that they have been accused of will have no bearing on their release.
“It really is based on points,'' Galanter said. “How long have you served, what your disciplinary record is, what the likelihood of committing another crime is, their age, the facts and the circumstances of the case.''
The writer of a 2000 episode of The Simpsons that predicted a future Donald Trump presidency said the episode was “a warning to America.”
“That just seemed like the logical last stop before hitting bottom,” writer Dan Greaney said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. “It was pitched because it was consistent with the vision of America going insane.”
The episode, titled “Bart to the Future,” aired 16 years ago, on March 19, 2000. In the episode, Bart Simpson glimpses their bleak future. Their sister Lisa is the “first straight female president” of the U.S., succeeding Trump's presidency.
“As you know, we've inherited quite a budget crunch from President Trump,” Lisa says during a meeting in the Oval Office, as a secretary in their administration holds up a chart depicting steep decline. “The country is broke? How can that be?”

At the time the episode aired, The Apprentice was still four years from premiering. Trump is now the frontrunner in the Republican presidential primary race, and Greaney said they have received more positive feedback about the episode because of its Trump reference.
“What we needed was for Lisa to have problems that were beyond their fixing, that everything went as bad as it possibly could, and that's why we had Trump be president before her,” Greaney said. “The Simpsons has always kind of embraced the over the top side of American culture … and [Trump] is just the fulfillment of that.”

Johann Kastenberger (born October 1, 1958, in Sankt Leonhard am Forst, died November 15, 1988, in Sankt Pölten, Lower Austria) was an Austrian marathon runner, bank robber and murderer. They infamously committed their crimes while wearing a Ronald Reagan mask, earning them the nickname Pumpgun Ronnie. Kastenberger's criminal life was the basis for the 2010 film The Robber.
On January 25, 1977, Kastenberger robbed a Volksbank branch in Pressbaum, making off with 70,000 Austrian Schillings (~€5,000). Shortly thereafter, police arrested Kastenberger on a train at Wien Westbahnhof based on descriptions given to police by the bank's employees. They served a seven-year prison sentence for the robbery. Upon release, they moved in with their girlfriend in the Simmering district of Vienna.
On August 13, 1985, Kastenberger stormed the Raiffeisen Bank in Hafnerbach, but had to flee without having taken any money. The police suspected Kastenberger immediately, but their girlfriend gave them a false alibi. On November 20, 1987, they robbed the Raiffeisen Bank in Haunoldstein, making off with 88,000 Schillings (~€6,400). On February 19, 1988, they hit three banks in succession, making off with a combined total of more than 1.8 million Schillings (~€133,000). Their greatest take was on March 21, 1988, at a Länderbank in Vienna, where they captured two million Schillings (~€145,000). The next two days they robbed two more Viennese banks, netting one million Schillings for each.
Murders [ edit ]
On August 13, 1985, the same day they committed their first bank robbery after being released from prison, Kastenberger shot and killed Ewald Pollhammer, a 28-year-old man from Upper Austria with whom they had been annoyed during a vocational training course.
Additionally, Kastenberger is regarded the prime suspect of three other murders:
Kastenberger is suspected of having robbed a gas station in Purkersdorf on May 26, 1984, shooting and killing 51-year-old station attendant Helene Bubendorfer with an assault rifle.
Kastenberger is suspected of using an assault rifle to kill officer Friedrich Roger in front of a police station in Vienna on July 25, 1986.
Kastenberger is suspected of using a stolen government service weapon to kill Brigitte Hranka, who worked as a prostitute.
Arrest, flight and death [ edit ]
On November 11, 1988, Kastenberger was arrested and convicted of all deeds, after which they made a confession. In their apartment, investigators found two keys for safe deposit boxes containing almost 5.5 million Schillings (~€400,000). Two days later, during their confession proceedings, Kastenberger jumped out the window on the first floor, landed on the hood of a parked car and escaped.
The next day they tried to steal a woman's car in Gaaden, but fled when a police patrol drove by. The next day, they overpowered a man in Maria Enzersdorf, bound them and stole their car. The man freed themselves and alerted police who discovered the stolen vehicle on the motorway shortly thereafter. Kastenberger noticed the police, pulled over to the guardrail, then ran through the woods and stole another vehicle in Waasen, with which they escaped via the West Highway. Just before Sankt Pölten, they broke through a roadblock and was shot in the back. Before Kastenberger could be apprehended by police, they took their own life with a gunshot to the head.
The pursuit of Johann Kastenberger was the largest investigation in Austria's post-war history, involving more than 450 officers.
Other [ edit ]
Kastenberger was a successful marathon runner. In the 1980s they won several national races in Austria and in 1988 became the record holder of Kainach Mountain Marathon with a time of 3:16:07.
In 2009, director Benjamin Heisenberg dramatized Kastenberger's career as a runner and bank robber in their film The Robber, with Andreas Lust in the title role, based on Martin Prinz's 2002 novel of the same name. The novel was translated into English in 2005 by Mike Mitchell and renamed On the Run. The film premiered in February 2010 at the 60th Berlin Film Festival.

According to recent allegations in the Washington Post and Al.com, Roy Moore routinely pursued much younger women while they were in their early 30s, until they met and married a woman 14 years their junior.
Moore was 38 when they married 24-year-old Kayla Kisor. They met a year before they married, according to Moore's autobiography, "So Help Me God."
Moore wrote that they had been invited to recite poetry at a church Christmas party and spotted their future wife in the crowd.
"Sitting with their mother on the sofa against the wall was a beautiful young woman," Moore wrote. "I learned that their name was Kayla."
Special person
In their book, Roy Moore said they had seen Kayla "many" years earlier, although it doesn't specify how old they were when they first caught their eye. Women who spoke to the Washington Post said Moore asked them for dates in the late 1970s. Moore left Alabama in 1983, traveled to Texas and Australia, and returned in 1984, around the same time they met Kayla Kisor at the church Christmas party.
"Many years before, I had attended a dance recital at Gadsden State Junior College," Roy Moore wrote. "I remembered one of the special dances performed by a young woman whose first and last names began with the letter 'K.' It was something I had never forgotten. Could that young woman have been Kayla Kisor? Anxious to meet her, I began with the line, 'Haven't we met somewhere before?'"
Roy Moore wrote that they had a sense that their relationship with Kayla would be significant.
"I knew Kayla was going to be a special person in my life," Roy Moore wrote. "Long afterward, I would learn that Kayla had, in fact, performed a special dance routine at Gadsden State years before."
Kayla Moore was divorced and had a young daughter when Roy Moore married them in 1985. They were an adult when they dated and married, but they did attend school with the woman who accused Roy Moore of sexual assault in a Monday appearance orchestrated by attorney Gloria Allred. Beverly Young Nelson said they were a sophomore at Southside High School in 1977, alongside Kayla Kisor.
In the Washington Post story from last week, four women said Moore asked them for dates when they were between the ages of 14 and 18. They were in their early 30s at the time and working as a prosecutor in the Etowah County District Attorney's Office. The paper reported that they initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old, and the most recent alleged victim said they groped them and grabbed their neck soon after they turned 16.
Moore has denied the allegations from Nelson and the four women who spoke to the Washington Post and said they don't know the two women who said Roy Moore touched them inappropriately.
In an interview with Sean Hannity, Roy Moore said they didn't "generally" date women in their teens when they were in their 30s.
"I don't remember dating any girl without the permission of their mother," Roy Moore said during that interview with Hannity.
An enduring partnership
Roy and Kayla Moore have been married for 32 years and have four grown children.
Kayla Moore is president of the Foundation for Moral Law, the non-profit founded by their husband after they were removed from the Alabama State Supreme Court in 2003 for displaying a granite monument to the Ten Commandments. The organization offers legal support for conservative Christian issues such as public prayer and opposition to same-sex marriage.
Kayla Moore earned $195,000 over three years as the head of The Foundation for Moral Law, according to The Washington Post. The same paper reported that Roy Moore had taken an undisclosed salary of $180,000 a year between their two incomplete terms on the state's highest court. Roy Moore has disputed the Washington Post's reporting about their salary.
Kayla Moore defended their husband in an interview with Breitbart News.
"You know we met at a Bible study -- that's where we met," Kayla Moore said. "We raised our children at in Bible-focused Christian home. You know, it's just not true -- any of it."
They reiterated their support in an impromptu press conference last night in Gallant, where they and Roy Moore live.
"These things are false, and it's ugly," they said. "It's the ugliest politics I've ever been in in my life."

Precious time is lost when long distances are covered to take the victims to a govt hospital (sic)," they tweeted, adding, "Often pvt hospitals either don't admit road accident victims or simply stabilise the patients before sending them off to a govt hospital (sic)".Meanwhile, Mr Jain also inaugurated 125 ventilators at the Lok Nayak Hospital in New Delhi.The AAP government had recently raised the compensation for acid attack survivors. The government had informed the Delhi High Court that it has raised from Rs. 3 lakh to Rs. 7 lakh. The submission was made when the court was hearing the plea of several women who are survivors of acid attack against the cap on compensation to be awarded in such cases. The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) has claimed that the acid is available in Delhi despite Supreme Court ordering ban on its sale. In wake of increasing acid attacks, the Supreme Court had in 2013 banned over-the-counter sale of acid at retail outlets and ordered a compensation of Rs. 3 lakh to be paid by the state governments to each acid attack victim.
The cursus publicus (Latin: "the public way"; Ancient Greek: δημόσιος δρόμος, dēmósios drómos) was the state-run courier and transportation service of the Roman Empire, later inherited by the Byzantine Empire. The Emperor Augustus created it to transport messages, officials, and tax revenues between the provinces and Italy. The service was still fully functioning in the first half of the sixth century in the Byzantine Empire, when the historian Procopius accuses Emperor Justinian of dismantling most of its sections, except for the route leading to the Persian border[citation needed]. The extent of the cursus publicus is shown in the Tabula Peutingeriana, a map of the Roman road network dating from around AD 400.[1]
Structure [ edit ]
A series of forts and stations was spread out along the major road systems connecting the regions of the Roman world. The relay points or change stations (stationes) provided horses to dispatch riders and (usually) soldiers as well as vehicles for magistrates or officers of the court. The vehicles were called clabulae, but little is known of them. A diploma, or certificate, issued by the emperor themselves was necessary to use the services supplied by the cursus publicus. Abuses of the system existed, for governors and minor appointees used the diplomata to give themselves and their families free transport. Forgeries and stolen diplomata were also used. Pliny the Elder and Trajan write about the necessity of those who wish to send things via the imperial post to keep up-to-date licences.[2]
Another term, perhaps more accurate if less common, for the cursus publicus is the cursus vehicularis, particularly in the period before the reforms of Diocletian. At least one 'Praefectus Vehiculorum', Lucius Volusius Maecianus, is known; they held the office during the reign of Antoninus Pius. Presumably, they had some sort of supervisory responsibility to ensure the effective operation of the network of stations throughout the Empire and to discourage abuse of the facility by those not entitled to use it. There is evidence that inspectors oversaw the functioning of the system in the provinces, and it may be conjectured that they reported to the 'Praefectus' in Rome. However, the office does not seem to have been considered a full-time position because Maecianus was also the law tutor of the young Marcus Aurelius, apparently their main function.[3]
Despite evidence that the government supervised the functioning of the network of stations and, presumably, its development over the centuries, the service was not supplied by a department of state in the same way as, say the modern British Royal Mail. As Altay Coskun notes in a review of Anne Kolb's work done in German,[4] the system "simply provided an infrastructure for magistrates and messengers who traveled through the empire. It consisted of thousands of stations placed along the main roads; these had to supply fresh horses, mules, donkeys, and oxen, as well as carts, food, fodder, and accommodation." Thus, there was no “department of postal service” with employees paid by the emperor. The one who was sending a missive would have to supply the courier, and the stations had to be supplied out of the resources of the local areas through which the roads passed. As seen in several rescripts and in the correspondence of Trajan and Pliny, the emperor would sometimes pay for the cost of sending an ambassador to Rome along the cursus publicus, particularly in the case of just causes.
Following the reforms of Diocletian and Constantine I, the service was divided in two sections: the fast (Latin: cursus velox, Greek: ὀξὺς δρόμος) and the regular (Latin: cursus clabularis, Greek: πλατὺς δρόμος). The fast section provided horses, divided into veredi ("saddle-horses") and parhippi ("pack-horses"), and mules, and the slow section provided only oxen. The existence of the 'cursus clabularis' service shows that it was used to move heavy goods as well as to facilitate the travel of high officials and the carriage of government messages. Its maintenance was paid for by the provincials under the supervision of the governors, diocesan vicars and praetorian prefects.
Persian influence [ edit ]
The Romans adapted their state post from the ancient Persian network of the royal mounted couriers, the angarium. As Herodotus reports, the Persians had a remarkably efficient means of transmitting messages important to the functioning of the kingdom, called the Royal Road. The riders would be stationed at a day's ride along the road, and the letters would be handed from one courier to another as they made a journey of a day's length, which allowed messages to travel fast. Augustus, at first, followed the Persian method of having mail handed from one courier to the next, but they soon switched to a system by which one man made the entire journey with the parcel. Although it is possible that a courier service existed for a time under the Roman Republic, the clearest reference by Suetonius suggests that Augustus created the system[citation needed]:
To enable what was going on in each of the provinces to be reported and known more speedily and promptly, they at first stationed young men at short intervals along the military roads, and afterwards post-chaises. The latter has seemed the more convenient arrangement, since the same men who bring the dispatches from any place can, if occasion demands, be questioned as well.
Tacitus says that couriers from Judea and Syria brought news to Vitellius that the legions of the East had sworn allegiance to him, and this also shows that the relay system was displaced by a system in which the original messenger made the entire journey. Augustus modified the Persian system, as Suetonius notes, because a courier who travels the whole distance could be interrogated by the emperor, upon arrival, to receive additional information orally. That may have had the additional advantage of adding security to the post, as one man had the responsibility to answer for the successful delivery of the message. That does not come without a cost, as the Romans could not relay a message as quickly as they could if it passed from one rider to the next.
Area of operation [ edit ]
The cursus operated in Italy and the more advanced provinces. There was only one in Egypt and one in Asia Minor, as Pliny's letters to Trajan attest. It was common for a village to exist every 12 miles (19 km) or so, and there a courier might rest at large, privately owned mansiones. Operated by a manceps, or a businessman, the mansiones provided food and lodging, and care and a blacksmith for the horses. The cursus also used communities located along the imperial highways. These towns very often provided food and horses to messengers of the Legions, theoretically receiving reimbursement, and were responsible for the care of their section of the Roman roads. Disputes arose naturally, and for a time the central administration participated more directly.[5]
Financial costs and the fate of the service [ edit ]
Costs for the cursus publicus were always high, and its maintenance could not always be guaranteed[citation needed]. Around the time of Nerva, in the late first century, the general cost was transferred to the Fiscus (treasury). Further centralization came during the reign of Hadrian, who created an actual administration under a prefect, who bore the title praefectus vehiculorum. Provinces were always in touch with Rome and one another. The Imperial Post gave the legions the capacity to summon reinforcements and provide status reports before any situation deteriorated too badly. The average citizen sent letters and messages to friends across the sea with slaves and travelling associates. Most news reached its destination eventually. In an effort to restrict abuse of the post whose use Constantius II, emperor, 337-361, had overloaded the service Julian the Apostate, 361-363, restricted the granting of passes to the Praetorian Prefects and himself.[6] This was unworkable. They granted 12 to vicars and 2 to governors one for use within the province and the other for communication to the emperor. Four each were issued to the three proconsuls of Asia, Africa and Achaea. The counts of the Treasury and Crown Estates could obtain warrants whenever they need since these two departments supplied revenue in gold and the private income of the emperors respectively, matters of the greatest importance. The highest-ranking generals and frontier generals were issued passes, especially those at danger points like Mesopotamia, cf. A.H.M. Jones, The Later Roman Empire, pp. 130, 402. Notwithstanding its enormous costs, in the Eastern Roman Empire the service was still fully functioning in the first half of the sixth century, when the historian Procopius charges Emperor Justinian with the dismantlement of most of its sections, with the exception of the route leading to the Persian border (Secret History 30.1–11). The dromos continued to exist throughout the Byzantine period, supervised for much of it by the logothetēs tou dromou, although this post is not attested before the mid-eighth century and a revival of the service may then have occurred after a substantial gap. It was by then a much reduced service, restricted essentially to the remains of the old oxys dromos. In the west, it survived under the Ostrogoths in Italy, as Cassiodorus reports Theodoric the Great's correspondence.[7]
Speed of post [ edit ]
Procopius provides one of the few direct descriptions of the Roman post that allows an estimation the average rate of travel overland. In the 6th century, they described earlier times:
“ The earlier Emperors, in order to obtain information as quickly as possible regarding the movements of the enemy in any quarter, sedition, unforeseen accidents in individual cities, and the actions of the governors or other persons in all parts of the Empire, and also in order that the annual tributes might be sent up without danger or delay, had established a rapid service of public couriers throughout their dominion according to the following system. As a day's journey for an active man they fixed eight ‘stages,' or sometimes fewer, but as a general rule not less than five. In every stage there were forty horses and a number of grooms in proportion. The couriers appointed for the work, by making use of relays of excellent horses, when engaged in the duties I have mentioned, often covered in a single day, by this means, as great a distance as they would otherwise have covered in ten.[8] ”
If the distance between stages was known, the distance five stages or eight stages and the average rate at which correspondence moved along the cursus publicus would both be known. That was calculated by A. M. Ramsey[9] in the following way: "It appears from the Jerusalem Itinerary that the mansiones, or night quarters on the roads, were about twenty-five [Roman] miles [23 mi or 37 km] apart, and, as Friedlander points out, the distance between Bethlehem and Alexandria (about 400 Roman miles [368 mi or 592 km]) was reckoned to be sixteen mansiones, that between Edessa and Jerusalem (by Antioch nearly 625 [Roman] miles [574 mi or 924 km]) twenty-five mansiones. Although no Itinerary gives a complete list of mutationes and mansiones for any road, the general rule seems to have been two mutationes between each two mansiones or 23 miles. This would make the 'stage' about eight and a third Roman mile [7.7 mi or 12.4 km]." Therefore, the typical trip was made at the rate of 38 to 62 miles (61–100 km) per day or 5 to 8 stages.
There are several cases in which urgent news or eager officials traveled at a faster rate. There is the journey of Tiberius mentioned by Valerius Maximus, the news of the mutiny of Galba as recorded by Tacitus, and the news of the death of Nero as described by Plutarch.[10] In the last two cases, it is worth keeping in mind that bad news traveled faster than good news, and quite explicitly: a laurel was attached to the correspondence with news of victory, but a feather, as indicating haste, was fixed to the spear of a messenger carrying bad news. In all three cases, as A. M. Ramsey points out, the journey is especially urgent, and the time of travel may be recorded because of its exceptional rapidness. Such cases could not be used to find an average speed of the Roman post for carrying the vast majority of items.
Ramsey, following Wilcken, illustrates the speed of the Roman post over land with examples of the amount of time it would take a message to travel from Rome to Egypt about the accession of a new emperor (in a season other than summer, when the message would travel by sea from Rome to Alexandria). In the case of Pertinax, news of the accession, which took place on January 1, AD 193, took over sixty-three days to reach Egypt, being announced on March 6 in Alexandria. Since the route that would be taken over land consisted of about 3,177 kilometres (1,974 mi)—1,400 kilometres (870 mi) from Rome to Byzantium, including the sea crossing and almost 1,800 kilometres (1,100 mi) from Byzantium to Alexandria)—and since it took about sixty-three days or a little more for the message to arrive in Alexandria, this confirms an average rate of about 32 miles (51 km) per day for this journey.
Another example, based on a Latin inscription, is cited by Ramsey. Gaius Caesar died on February 21, AD 4, in Limyra, which is on the coast of Lycia. The news about their death is found on an inscription dated April 2 at Pisa. The amount of time that the message took to arrive at Pisa is not less than thirty-six days. Since a voyage by sea would be too dangerous at this time of year, the message would be sent over land, a distance of about 1,345 miles (2,165 km). This again confirms the calculation of an average rate of about fifty miles per day.
In their article “New Evidence for the Speed of the Roman Imperial Post,” Elliot[11] agrees with A. M. Ramsey that the typical speed was about 50 miles (80 km) per day and illustrates this with another instance, the time that it took news of the proclamation of the emperor Septimius Severus to reach Rome from Carnuntum.
These estimates are for journeys that took place over land, making use of the cursus publicus (or, cursus vehicularis). Lionel Cassons, in their book on ancient sea travel, gives statistics for the amount of time that sixteen voyages took between various ports in the Roman Empire. These voyages, which were made by and recorded by the Romans, are recorded specifically as taking place under favorable wind conditions. Under such conditions, when the average is computed, a vessel could travel by sail at a speed of about 5 knots (9.3 km/h; 5.8 mph) or 120 miles (190 km) per day. Cassons provides another table of ten voyages made under unfavorable conditions. With these voyages, the average speed is about 2 knots (3.7 km/h; 2.3 mph) or 50 miles (80 km) per day.

Complex: You're at the end of another successful season with Juventus, how are you feeling both physically and mentally ahead of what most be one of the most important summers of your career?
Paul Pogba: I just feel great, we [Juventus] didn't start in the best way but we finished it well, winning the league and the Italian cup. I can still play and I'm excited to get going straight away in the Euros. Mentally, I'm good – I just won the league and I'm always looking ahead to the next one. We just made history at Juventus – no team has ever done the double in Italy two times in a row – now I'm fresh for France.
You've won the Serie A title in all of your four seasons at Juve, so things on the pitch are good. How much do you enjoy living in Italy?
I just love to be in my home, chilling in my house with my friends. Turin isn't a real big town and there's not that many things to do here, but I do like to go out to Milan.
How do you look back on your time in Manchester?
I really miss Manchester because it's where I made the most of my teenage years and I had lots of friends there. It's a different culture, I found they're more open than French people. I was in digs with a family and they treated me like their son.
Was it a challenge to move to a different country at such a young age with a family that you don't even know?
I was ready in my head. I was focussed and knew I wanted to be in Manchester, to go there at a young age was fine. I wanted to play football, I knew that's what I wanted in my life and I was ready to make any sacrifice to do it.
How much do you think you matured in Manchester, on and off the pitch?
Not being with my family meant I had to grow up, I had to learn how to do everything on my own. I was also training with the first team – senior players – which I'd never done before and I always wanted to listen to them.

This is a recipe for a basicI make this cheese sauce quite often and use it mostly for lasagne, pizza, as a dip for tortilla chips or for mac and cheese.
It's really simple to make and it comes together quite fast – it will only take about 10 to 15 minutes. Then get your tortilla chips ready because it's dipping time!
I love this cheese sauce because it's
vegan (and therefore dairy-free and lactose-free)
without nuts (my wallet says thanks!)
super quick to make
made with only a handful of ingredients (I always have these at home!)
so versatile! Lasagna, pizza, mac & cheese, or as a dip are my favorite uses for the sauce!
ooey-gooey and stretchy
When I started following a vegan diet in 2012 supermarkets didn't offer any vegan cheeses. So making vegan cheese at home was the only way to go. I have been making this cheese sauce countless times!
Now, there all kinds of vegan cheeses in the stores and I really enjoy trying these new products, however, I still make this cheese sauce a lot because it's my favorite for pizza and lasagna – I love it!
But wait… What is Nooch?
Nooch is short for nutritional yeast. Nutritional yeast is deactivated yeast and can be bought in the form of powder or flakes.
It is often used for vegan sauces because of its super cheesy taste. Nutritional yeast is something that should not be missed in a vegan household. It's one of my secret (but not so secret) ingredients for vegan cooking.
How to make Vegan Cheese Sauce with Nutritional Yeast (Nooch)
The Ingredients for the Nooch Cheese Sauce
The ingredients you'll need are rather basic. You probably have them at home already!
coconut oil or vegan butter – both will work just fine
all-purpose flour – makes the cheese stretchy
spices – I used salt, paprika powder, curry powder, ground pepper, and garlic powder (but feel free to experiment with different spices!)
nutritional yeast flakes – adds the cheesy flavor!
water
Most vegan cheese recipes use nuts (oftentimes cashews or almonds). This one doesn't. So if you're allergic to nuts (or you don't want to spend all that $$ on expensive nuts), this sauce is for you!
Step-by-Step Instructions
This is the process of making the cheese sauce! Basically, it's like you would make a Bechamel Sauce – but with a cheesy twist!
Step 1: Melt the vegan butter or coconut oil in a pot. Add the spices. Whisk.
Step 2: Add the flour. Whisk.
Step 3: Add the nutritional yeast. Whisk.
Step 4: Add the water. Stir until smooth and creamy.
Tip: If you don't use the sauce immediately, it will thicken up quite a bit. Add a bit more water and whisk again. Then it's good as new!

A long time ago, my Dad once said, “If you can't say one nice thing about someone, don't say anything at all.”
With that in mind, here's my one nice thing about every NHL team, and a few questions:
ANAHEIM: The Ducks are the deepest team in the NHL. But, are they deep enough to win the Cup?
ARIZONA: The new colour scheme and design of the Coyotes sweater is second to none!
BOSTON: New additions Beleskey and Hayes might be the catalysts to help a sputtering offence.
BUFFALO: As important as Jack Eichel is to the Sabres, the hiring of Dan Byslma might prove to be Tim Murray's best move.
CALGARY: No playoff team upgraded better than the Flames. Hamilton and Frolik will be huge additions.
CAROLINA: Noah Hanifin, whether they play a full season in Raleigh or not, might be the steal of the draft.
CHICAGO: Stan Bowman's ability to master the cap, and keep business and sentimentality separate, puts the Hawks in great shape.
COLORADO: Is there any better place to play an outdoor game than in Denver? Just watch out for the Chinook!
COLUMBUS: The Blue Jackets appear to be poised for greatness, if they can stay healthy enough.
DALLAS: The Stars will score, we know that. Will the Finns in goal (Lehtonen and Niemi) keep the other team from doing the same?
DETROIT: Red Wings want to prove it's the players, not the plan, that makes this team playoff-worthy as the post-Babcock era starts.
EDMONTON: McDavid and Sekera on the ice, Chiarelli and McLellan off the ice. This is the new age in for the Oilers.
FLORIDA: Has Dale Tallon accumulated the best crop of young talent in the NHL, and surrounded them with strong veteran presences like Jagr and Mitchell?
LOS ANGELES: Milan Lucic playing for Darryl Sutter could be explosive for the Kings in the West. Like nitroglycerin.
MINNESOTA: Ryan Suter just might be the best defenceman in the NHL, so why hasn't they won the Norris?
MONTREAL: Marc Bergevin has always been labelled a great evaluator of talent. Their reputation might be cemented if they can turn around flawed forwards Semin and Kassian.

Imagine holding a yardstick at one end. When you flex your wrist even the tiniest bit, the far end of the yardstick whips back and forth. But if you hang a small weight on a spring at that far end, the weight's inertia absorbs some of the yardstick's kinetic energy and the whipping drops to a gentle sway.
Scale that up, a lot, and you have a mass damper, the system that's used to control movement in skyscrapers by reducing both the speed at which the building oscillates and the distance those oscillations cover. Mass dampers consist of large pendulums—usually steel plates bolted together to form a solid chunk—suspended from cables near the top of the building. When the building sways in a gust, the weight's inertia acts as a counterweight, pulling it in the opposite direction.
But a traditional damper wasn't good enough for the new Shanghai Tower. At 2,073 feet it's the second tallest building in the world, after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. On the upper floors, where the flex is greatest, the oscillations would have been fast and wide enough to cause airsickness (not to mention paralyzing fear). So the building's architects and engineers came up with a solution. They installed a huge, tuned mass damper, the heaviest-ever flex-reducing weight in a building, and paired it with a magnetic system to create the first eddy-current damper used in a skyscraper.
Noah Sheldon
The "tuned" in tuned mass damper refers to an additional element: a control system to limit the weight's own motion, for maximum damping effect. In many buildings this is accomplished by passive damping control, but that has a couple of drawbacks: maintenance costs and the necessity for manual adjustments when vibration frequencies change. So Gensler, the architects of the Shanghai Tower, created the eddy-current damper, a masterpiece of simplicity. It consists of a 1,076-square-foot copper plate covered with 125 powerful magnets, mounted beneath the suspended mass damper. When the building sways, the 1,000-ton iron weight (360 tons heavier than in the previous largest damper) swings over the magnets, inducing an electrical current in the plate that, in turn, creates an opposing magnetic field, automatically counteracting the weight's motion and further amplifying its damping effect. No active control or outside power source is necessary. The magnetic flip occurs because of a version of Newton's third law called Lenz's law.
The result is not just elegant engineering but measurable benefit. According to Benedict Tranel, one of the architects of the Shanghai Tower, most people will never feel the building sway, not even in summer, when the typhoons roar in.

It's 7:45 PM. Seven hours before the scum of the earth crawl out of their beer-stinking holes to sell women in my hometown. Time for me to head out if I plan to catch anyone tonight. History paper will have to wait.
I drop the well-earned ice cream container in the trash and start looking for the door. Not as if it's hard to find, ha! No, it's busted as wide open as a truck depot from the bug-woman's visit.
“Hey, where are you going?” Skye asks, suddenly forgetting my treachery for stealing the ice cream as they trot after me.
“We were kidding about the ice cream,” Black Butterfly insists.
“I know,” I say. “I have to hunt.”
Skye noticeably shivers at my tone. “Can you say that again?”
“Don't be creepy,” Butterfly elbows him.
“I'm not! They sounded–”
I interrupt before they can get bickering again. “I have to hunt. We don't all have the luxury of having the bad guys come to us for bagging,” I say. Skye looks alarmed, and I take note of that, but Robotman re-enters with a resounding clap and a smile that could fry a vampire.
“Hey, muchachos! Picked you up some em-pan-a-das!” They almost sings the last word. “Bet you thought I was just skipping out on cleaning up. But–oh, it looks like you all skipped out on that, too.”
“I thought we were eating healthy,” Black Butterfly says. “Not for weight or anything, I'm very body positive,” they assure me as they glance at their butt's reflection in Robotman's armor. “But I thought we were eating healthy today.”
“Girl, learn to say thank-you.” Skye's almost climbing over Robotman to get to those fried meat-filled turnovers. Robotman steps up to me, and speaks quietly, as if I'm the only one in the room.
“The special occasion's your acceptance into the team,” they say.
“Pink says they approve, too,” Black Butterfly holds up their phone again, smiling.
“She does everything by phone?” I wonder.
“She's away a lot. They say they enjoy depositing the villains, and all the paperwork that goes with that. It's a thankless job, so we appreciate their contribution,” Butterfly says. I take note of this.
Skye's somehow already got two empanadas in their face. “Unanimous yes for you!” They cheer.
“Er–not ‘xactly unanimous, ‘mana,” Robotman says, again as if talking only to me, in confidence. “I voted no. You're a great hero, but I'm not sure you're built to be a team player.”
The others get all offended on my behalf, but I step closer to Robotman, curious. I'm not sensitive. I like honesty. It takes guts to have that. “That all?” I ask.
“Well, I was out-voted. Team thinks you fit right in!” Robotman throws their hands up in the air with a big grin, just this great big genuine grin, and wraps me in the most uncomfortable metal hug. “And I trust my team.”
“Well that's great buddy but–hey, I–” I'm so squished. “Hey buddy? I don't want on your team.”
They let me go. The other two go ballistic.
“Why would you tell them you voted no?” Skye snaps.
Butterfly chimes in: “Perhaps more tact would have been appropriate!”
Robotman's cellphone even buzzes, signaling Pink's disapproval, too.
“Whoa whoa whoa! Don't eat the man alive!” I laugh. “Skye, I said I'd come hang out–I never promised to join your team. I've got my own thing going on. I'm feeling Mr. Roboto here. I vote no, too. And,” I grab an empanada on the way out. “My vote's the only one that matters.”
I give Robotman a sympathetic fist-bump, and make my exit.
*
2:00 AM. The shadows move around me as the wind hums in the trees. The chill runs up and down my spine, and I'm reminded of the cute little electric superhero who admires the way I say hunt. Coming from anyone else, it'd sound creepy, but they seemed so genuine, almost straddling the line between fanboy and–poet? Still, someone needs to teach that boy some manners.
Hey brain. Shut up. I'm hunting. I shake my head as if I can shake this afternoon out of it, and creep closer to the four men clustered together on the park bench. Two pimps, two Johns.
“You can take them down easily,” a voice whispers in my ear.
I flip out and go for a throat. Soft, slender neck meets my fingers–big, doe-like brown eyes stare at me in fear, a modified black and purple Salwar Kameez floats around me–
“Holy crap, Black Butterfly, what are you doing here?” I hiss.
“Sorry,” they cough in a whisper, well-aware it's their own fault they just got squeezed like a stress ball during the Holiday rush. “I just wanted to double-check that everything's alright between us.”
“Alright? Sure, fine, everything's cool, I already said no hard feelings, didn't I?” I'm crouching down closer to the ground now, creeping forward on my fingertips to hear the conversation around my targets. The two Johns are standing now–both college-aged idiots pretending they don't know better, one in sunglasses–at night?–and one in a leather jacket, dressed like they're so bad, out buying their first prostitutes. They don't bother to check if it's human trafficking or not. They don't know that's even real. And they don't get punished like the pimps do. Like they should. I clench my teeth. Half of the girls this ring sells are my age, and these guys don't think to blink. Stupid creeps.
Black Butterfly's still talking. “I know, but I just wanted to make sure your feelings weren't hurt, between Robotman's condescension and Skye's creepiness and–”
“Girl, you just failed us the Bechdel test,” I grumble under my breath. The pimps stand, too, to shake hands with the buyers. They don't do the fancy pomp and circumstance. Some pimps do: I've seen those guys, all decked out in purple and green, golden canes and all–but these guys, my local movers and the shakers, don't need all the colors for advertising and recruitment. They're comfortable in flexible pants and incognito hoodies. True evil doesn't need to play bad boy.
True evil has nice sneakers, though.
Oh my gosh, is they still talking?! “I just don't want you to be offended. I try to create peace between everyone, you see.”
“You got it. Peace.” This is before the sale. They'll be leaving together, to see where the girls are. I'm curious about this meeting because normally it's one on one–one pimp to a buyer or two. And normally it's not these guys. I've heard things about these guys. Heard they might be the top dogs I'm looking for: the guys I need to connect to the trafficking ring to shut it down. You only get so far beating up low-level peons. Rescuing one girl at a time only makes the bad guys smarter. When I'm old enough to run for president, that's when I'll really…
Alright, they're on the move. I dash, low to the ground, my one ungloved palm stinging with park cement. We take cover at the nearest bush, right by their car. Make that two cars. Dangit, I'm too loud to follow a vehicle on my thunder blasts.
“Hey.” I poke the girl behind me. “Hey, you can fly, right?”
“Yes.”
“Do you lift?” I ask.
“Excuse me?” They look confused.
I look at their skinny arms. “You don't pump much steel, do you?”
“Oh, now you're just body-shaming.” Butterfly grips me around the waist, throws one massive flap of their wings, shooting leaves around us and wind up my nose, and when my prey turns around we're nowhere to be seen, far, far above their heads in the shadow of the clouds covering the sliver of silver moon. “Where to?”
“Well, if you don't drop me, just follow those cars,” I say.
“You're not going to just beat them up, are you?” they ask.
“We're not going to have a long conversation.” Them skinny arms cut into the edge of my bra wire as they tense up. “Ow! No, I won't just beat them up!”
“That's good,” they say.
“I'm going to find out if they're in charge of this ring I've been following,” I say.
“Then video tape them and bring them in?” they say.
“I can't bring people in. I'll lead the police to them.” I pause as the cars take a right, away from the park and towards the swanky area of town. We're soaring over neon lights and party bars now. “That's a benefit of working with the Guardians, huh. You can do what you want.”
“Not whatever we want, no, but Robotman has worked out a deal with our local police, and I think also with the military and some government legal advisors. He's good with people.”
“So are you, I hear,” I smile.
“I've managed to talk down or rehabilitate about half of the supervillains we've encountered, yes.”
“And the other half fool you because you're soft,” I say.
“That's why I have teammates.” Them soft voice is unapologetic. “We keep each other in balance.”
It's a long flight. She's stronger than they look, for sure. “How'd you become a superhero?” I ask.
“I accidentally made a local gang look weak by pulling a business owner out of a fire they'd set.” There's a bitter laugh hidden in their gentle tone. “The business owner paid me back by calling me a terrorist. Then, when the gang tried to punish them for living, and kidnapped their family instead, they said that was my fault, too.”
“How old were you?”
“Fifteen. If you're running a protection racket you can't have fifteen year old girls rescuing people who don't pay up.” They chuckle. “If you ask some people, that family really didn't even merit rescuing.” We dip a little as the cars park, and they look for a place to land. “For some reason, that makes me feel even better about doing it again and again and again.”
“Like your high road is higher than everyone else's,” I say.
“Now that just makes me sound arrogant.” They drop me off around the corner from my prey. I stretch out, so glad not to have them sweating all over me anymore, and take a deep, free breath. “Happy hunting,” they say.
“You're not going to stay and help out?” I ask.
“You prefer to work alone, don't you?” They bat their eyelashes, waves like a princess, and flaps off into the night air, trailing purple streamers.
I do. I've got eyes on the bad guys again. I might steal myself a pair of those evil sneakers.
Still. It's a good night to make new friends.
The End.

Picture this. You emerge from your gold-encrusted throne, moving forth from your library ensconced with thousands of leather-bound books (all unread). Stepping out the front door, you call to your driver.
"Jeeves," you beckon.
"Yes, Mr Penny Packer?"
"Let's go bowling. But not your everyday, run-of-the-mill, plebian bowling. I've got 10,000 dollarydoos burning a hole in my pocket and there's only one way I want to spend it. Let's go to Pins Royale - the swankiest bowling facility in town."
Unless you're James Packer out to kill some time in between Very Important Meetings, you'll probably find the idea of Crown's new ultra high-end ten-pin bowling joint absolutely absurd. And that's because it is. How the actual fuck dropping 10k for a couple rounds of bowling will result in a fun, chill experience - the sacred pillars on which bowling is built upon - is beyond me. This is it, Melbourne. We've cooked it. Put a fork in us. We're done.
The balls are all gold (of course they are), the roof is dripping with hand-dipped gold cylinders (of course it is), and the kitchen is serving up freshly shucked oysters the entire time (what else?).
I hope they let you keep one of the pins at the end and get all your mates to sign it like the completely rad bowling birthday parties I went to as a kid. I miss those days.

* New edition of Bible to excise “holocaust,” “booty”
* Changes designed for readers to understand Catholic view
By Andrew Stern
CHICAGO, March 2 (Reuters Life!) - A new edition of one the most popular English-language Bibles will offer substitutes for words such as “booty” and “holocaust” to better reflect modern understanding, a Catholic group said on Wednesday.
Nearly 50 scholars from all faiths and a committee of Roman Catholic bishops have labored since 1994 over the first fresh edition of the New American Bible since 1970, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said.
The annual best-seller to be issued by a dozen publishers beginning next week on Ash Wednesday “is a beautiful translation — it's a new way to look at an old love,” said Mary Sperry, who oversees Bible licensing for the bishops.
The changes go beyond a few words being altered, and include freshly-written notes that should help readers better understand the Catholic church's interpretation of biblical concepts, Sperry said. The Book of Psalms contains over 70,000 words, both text and notes, they said.
The revisions more accurately reflect translations of ancient Hebrew and Greek versions of the Old Testament and the constant evolution of modern-day language, Sperry said.
For example, the word “holocaust,” which for most people refers to the World War Two genocide of Jews, was changed to “burnt offerings,” which clarifies the original, positive idea of making offerings to God.
“Booty,” which has come to have a sexual connotation, was changed to “spoils of war;” and “cereal,” which many think of as breakfast food, became “grain” to reference loads of wheat.
In a change in a passage in Isaiah 7:14 that foretells the coming of Jesus and their birth to a virgin mother, the 1970 edition's reference to “the virgin” will become “the young woman,” to better translate the Hebrew word “almah.”
“The bishops and the Bible are not signaling any sort of change in the doctrine of the virgin birth of Jesus. None whatsoever,” Sperry added.
The new edition will revert to more poetic versions of Psalm 23 to have it read, “I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,” instead of “dark valley.” And “I will dwell in the house of the Lord for years to come” was changed to “for endless days,” which Sperry said carried a more profound and hopeful meaning.
The current edition of the New American Bible sold more than one million copies last year, mostly in the United States, the Philippines, India, and Africa. The new version could spark a pickup in sales, Sperry predicted.
The edition will be available in many formats: as a family hardback, a basic paperback, as an “e-book,” as an “app” for cell phones, and in a Braille version. (Editing by Greg McCune)
Where has all the optimism gone? A few weeks ago, the EU seemed to be back in the driving seat. The Council, driven by Italy and Spain, had extracted a major concession out of Germany and there was a sense that the interest of the European Union as a whole had been put for once to the fore.
Where has all the optimism gone? A few weeks ago, the EU seemed to be back in the driving seat. The Council, driven by Italy and Spain, had extracted a major concession out of Germany and there was a sense that the interest of the European Union as a whole had been put for once to the fore.
Now this all looks like old history. Spain, the country with the worst unemployment -- apart from Greece -- looks to be shut out of the bond markets completely in the days or weeks ahead. This means another massive injection of troika funds, but more worryingly will also put Italy under the spotlight again, and so we will be back to square one.
Recent data indicated that Europe is heading into recession, quickly. For example, yesterday's survey data on France showed that manufacturing was at its weakest since 2009. As the economies of Europe contract, something odd is happening. Despite all the deficit-tightening going on around the eurozone which is aimed at bringing down the overall debt levels of the member countries, the actual debt/GDP ratios are going the opposite way. Latest numbers show that the actual debt-to-GDP ratio in the EU went up this year to 88pc from 86pc a year earlier. The economies are slowing quicker than governments can cut back.
But while most of the commentary in Ireland today will be focused on the bond yield in Spain, the real worry for the euro is not the meltdown of the bond markets but the melt-up from the bond markets to the short-term interest rates. Spanish short-term interest rates are now above 6pc. This means that the financial markets expect big risk in Spain not in the next five or 10 years, but in the next five or 10 weeks.
It is clear from the movement of short-term interest rates in Germany, Austria, Netherlands and France -- all of which are now in negative territory -- that investors are preparing themselves for the breakup of the currency. In all the above countries, investors are now paying the governments to be able to lend to them. We are at the stage where the return of capital is the new return on capital. Getting your money back is the name of the game, not getting a return on your money.
Obviously the opposite is the case in the periphery, where short-term rates have moved out again.
The question for everyone is how long can this last. The IMF has recently published a report suggesting it is losing confidence in the eurozone experiment. In Spain the region of Valencia has said it needs financial support to pay its employees. Will it be the last? Greece is back saying it can't keep to its targets and in Italy there are reports that Silvio Berlusconci is thinking of running again in the election to be held in six months -- and just for good measure, its bond yields are over 6pc too.
There is real pressure now on Mario Draghi to introduce another round of central bank buying of government bonds via the banks. This is termed the LTRO or as others call it the largest "cash for trash" scheme in the world.
However, when you look at the lack of any permanent solution for the eurozone it does come down to what seems to be a total breakdown in trust between the creditor and debtor countries. The creditor countries around Germany don't believe that the debtor countries will stick to their word. In addition, when they look at countries like Ireland and anticipate a wave of mortgage defaults, they must consider how it will end.
From the perspective of the peripheral countries, there is a real grievance that the creditor countries don't appear willing to accept their responsibility for careless lending in the boom. Someone needs to knock heads together. The euro's economic problem is recession and no growth; its financial problem is too much debt; and its political problem is that there's no one to knock heads together.
Many people look to Angela Merkel, but those who watch them closely confirm that they are a very cautious politician and never moves far from their electoral roots. Them grassroots are telling them they've had enough of these bailouts. So they have a choice in the next few months of bulldozing through something that's unpopular in Germany or doing nothing. Given that they are a politician who also faces an election next year, what do you think they will do?
This implies that the only person who can act to stabilise the situation -- because believe me the euro is in serious trouble -- is Mario Draghi. Spain and Italy can't deal with these interest rates, particularly as it is the euro that is causing these countries to be penalised. If you doubt that interpretation, compare the interest rates in the UK with those in Italy and Spain. British interest rates are heading towards negative territory despite the fact that Britain is in a recession and has a debt burden comparable to Spain's. Nobody believes it will default and hence the low interest rates.
The reason this is the case is that it has its own currency with its own central bank and the market knows that the Bank of England will and has been stepping in to buy Gilts when it has to and it will let the currency fall to whatever level is necessary. The problem with Spain and Italy in a nutshell is that they both use someone else's currency. If you can't print or change the value of the currency you use, then it's not yours, period.
And because they do not use their own currency, their debts are by implication in a foreign currency. Therefore, there is always a risk of default because they can't control the value of their debts. In Ireland, we are in the same boat, but have even higher overall debts, public and private.
Unless the ECB opens up its balance sheet and makes a commitment to buy all Italian and Spanish debt, the end of the euro is a very real prospect.

Triple Eight boss Roland Danes has been absent from Sydney Motorsport Park this morning as they attend a special ceremony in Brisbane.
After 13 years in Australia, the Supercars heavyweight will become an Australian citizen.
Given Dane's grandfather was born in Australia, the country is a part of their family heritage.
Irishman Dane is the most successful team owner in Supercars in recent times, with six championships and six Bathurst wins in the last decade. News broke last week that their team had secured factory backing from Holden from next year and will lead the way developing the Gen2 Commodore from 2018.
Dane will jet back to Sydney Motorsport Park for this afternoon's race, which could bring up Jamie Whincup's 100th Supercars win.
Craig Lowndes starts their 600th tomorrow – another incredible milestone – at the circuit where Lowndes took Triple Eight's first ever Supercars win in 2005.
Featured post
In contrast to my 2014 year-in-review piece in which I lamented the disappearance of more than 5,000 articles written and published on my site since October 2006, I'm sharing no news this year about suspected cyberattacks and other forms of online skulduggery. Instead, after writing and publishing more than 300 additional articles during the past 18 months, it's time to say goodbye. Yes, this is the final curtain call on my 10-year career as an online purveyor of opinions, investigative reports and an occasional dose of humor.
Why the curtain call? Because I recently accepted a position with a Fortune 500 company and, due to time constraints, am no longer able to continue this endeavor. I must say, however, that it's been an interesting ride since the days when my website was known as “BMW: The Ultimate Blogging Machine” and ranked #82 among the world's Top 100 Conservative Blogs.
As the virtual fabric of this curtain call, I'd like to challenge other journalists — including those “citizen” journalists so often looked down upon by many of my college journalism-school brethren — to pick up the torch and keep the sunlight of disinfectant shining on a handful of topics (below) that deserve continued attention:
• THE PENTAGON'S SEXUAL ASSAULT WITCH HUNT
Since the October 2011 release of my first nonfiction book, Three Days In August: A U.S. Special Forces Soldier's Fight For Military Justice, I've been contacted by hundreds of individuals in search of help after they or a loved one found themselves falsely accused of crimes — usually involving members of the opposite sex — and, too often, convicted of those crimes in the military justice system. The case I've followed most closely since late August involves Army Maj. Christian “Kit” Martin and will be, if I can possibly make it happen, the subject of my next book. It's a big “IF” due to the career change, but I hope to make it happen nonetheless. My 49-minute Skype interview with Major Martin offers an overview of the people and allegations involved in this case prior to multiple dead bodies being discovered only a week ahead of the date on which the major's court-martial was set to begin. It has now been pushed back to an as-yet-undetermined date in March 2016.
• INTERROGATION TECHNOLOGY
In April 2008, I wrote a short piece about the Pentagon's plan to deploy portable polygraph technology to war zones, purportedly for use in interrogating terror suspects and others whose information might be valuable to our war effort. Twelve months later, I asked Pentagon officials a handful of questions about how well the portable polygraphs had worked during their first year of use. Unsatisfied with the answers I received which seemed to indicate the portable polygraph technology had failed miserably, I launched an investigation that would last more than four years and result in learning about an extremely accurate and effective interrogation technology that Department of Defense leaders had yanked from the “toolkits” of our warfighters.
Along the way, I interviewed men who had used that technology with much success. Among them, Defense Intelligence Agency contractors who interrogated members of Saddam Hussein's “Deck of Cards” as well as al-Qaeda and Taliban terror suspects and Army Green Berets and Navy SEALs who had used that technology with much success on the battlefield. In addition, I obtained never-before-published copies of letters and reports written by men who had used that technology with much success to interrogate detainees at Guantanamo Bay during the early days of the Global War On Terror. In May 2013, I shared the results of my investigation in the form of my second nonfiction book, The Clapper Memo.
• The Oklahoma City Bombing Trial in Salt Lake City
Though many Americans don't even realize it's taking place, I've been writing about an Oklahoma City Bombing trial that's been slogging its way through a federal court in Salt Lake City as part of a 19-year (so far) search for the truth. My most recent piece about the trial appeared under the July 1 headline, Pre-Blast Videotapes FBI Claims ‘Might Have Been Misfiled' Remain at Center of Ongoing Oklahoma City Bombing Trial. Other recent pieces covered topics such as allegations of FBI witness tampering and the judge's threat to slap FBI agents with contempt of court charges. In the interest of time and understanding what's at stake, I recommend you watch this chilling one-hour video before you read my other posts about the Oklahoma City Bombing Trial.
• Radiation Contamination in the St. Louis Area
In January 2012, I wrote my first report about radioactive waste issues in the St. Louis area. It had to do with a report about cancer concerns related to the Weldon Spring Site in St. Charles County, Mo., the county just west and northwest of St. Louis County (Mo.). Three years later, I offered an update under the headline, New Weldon Spring Cancer Report Due Out Early 2016. Sadly, state health department officials have refused to provide answers to my latest queries. As a result, the final word remains to be written on this subject.
There are, of course, many more topics I'd like to highlight, but I'll let you peruse them via the drop-down menu of categories located just below the “SEARCH” block in the right sidebar.
Before closing, allow me to suggest you show any appreciation you might have for my decade of work by purchasing copies of my books as Christmas gifts for the readers in your life:
• Chronicling the life story and wrongful prosecution of an elite Army Green Beret, Three Days In August received endorsements from Pamela Gellar of Atlas Shrugs and Richard Miniter, New York Times' best selling author and investigative reporter. For more details about the book, visit http://ThreeDaysInAugust.com.
• To read the list of high-power endorsements of my second nonfiction book, The Clapper Memo, visit http://TheClapperMemo.com.
• For pure entertainment value, I recommend you read about FBI Special Agent Joseph L. Wilson and their effort to solve the mystery behind the deaths of thousands of Americans during the Fourth of July weekend. The biggest challenge of their law enforcement career, the investigation becomes personal after Wilson realizes they share one thing in common with those who died: The National Bet.
Thanks for everything and Merry Christmas to you and yours! It's been a great ride!
FYI: Because I might write a few more pieces before the end of the year, I'll leave this as a “Featured Post” until then. And, oh yes, I will keep posting occasional thoughts on my Facebook page.

Ann Coulter has joined the chorus of conservatives lashing out at the Republican House leadership's proposals for immigration reform being discussed at a GOP retreat this week. House Speaker John Boehner's plan is expected to include offering visas to foreign workers and a path to legalization, although not necessarily citizenship, for the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants."Leave aside the harm cheap labor being dumped on the country does to the millions of unemployed Americans. What does it mean for the Republican Party?" Coulter posted on their blog Wednesday. They said a "stunning report" produced by Phyllis Schlafly — and still embargoed but slipped to them — has a clear-cut answer."Citing surveys from the Pew Research Center, the Pew Hispanic Center, Gallup, NBC News, Harris polling, the Annenberg Policy Center, Latino Decisions, the Center for Immigration Studies and the Hudson Institute, Schlafly's report overwhelmingly demonstrates that merely continuing our current immigration policies spells doom for the Republican Party."Why? "Immigrants — all immigrants — have always been the bulwark of the Democratic Party. For one thing, recent arrivals tend to be poor and in need of government assistance. Also, they're coming from societies that are far more left-wing than our own. History shows that, rather than fleeing those policies, they bring their cultures with them," Coulter wrote.And at the current rate of immigration, some 1.1 million new immigrants a year, "Republicans will be a fringe party in about a decade," they warned.Coulter pointed to some of the statistics from Schlafly's report to bolster their point, including the fact that the two largest immigrant groups, Hispanics and Asians, "both overwhelmingly support big government, Obamacare, affirmative action and gun control."In addition, one poll showed that while 81 percent of native-born citizens think schools should teach students to be proud of being American, only 50 percent of naturalized citizens do.Another found that Hispanics take a dimmer view of capitalism than even people who describe themselves as "liberal Democrats.""Reading these statistics, does anyone wonder why Democrats think vastly increasing immigration should be the nation's No. 1 priority?" Coulter asked."It would be one thing if the people with these views already lived here. Republicans would have no right to say, 'You can't vote.' But why on Earth are they bringing in people sworn to their political destruction?""Republicans have no obligation to assist the Democrats as they change the country in a way that favors them electorally, particularly when it does great harm to the people already here," they concluded.

Curtis Martin: A Football Life tells the story of Martin, who overcame a rough upbringing in Pittsburgh to become one of the greatest running backs to ever play the game.
Among the topics discussed in Curtis Martin: A Football Life are:
Their upbringing in Pittsburgh and how their mother Rochella Martin grew to reconcile with their father

Provided below are some select quotes from Curtis Martin: A Football Life:
- "Pittsburgh gave me my foundation and kind of gave me my roots, and made me who I am today." – Curtis Martin

The fact that I was destroying and we were destroying those hopes and those dreams for the fans was just incredible to me." – Curtis Martin on the 1996 AFC Divisional Game against the Pittsburgh Steelers
- "I just felt like I was worth more than Drew Bledsoe's signing bonus. I think I may have been the closest player to Mr. Kraft and the friendship that we had, and most people would look at that and get offended – it made me admire them even more because I recognized how they were able to separate the personal from the business." – Curtis Martin
- "I always believed he'd retire as a Patriot. It's like seeing a girl you were in love with or had a crush on dating some other guy." – Robert Kraft

President Donald Trump has now been in office for two weeks. So it's a good moment to take a step back from the controversies of the moment and look at what, concretely, the Trump administration has done so far.
In doing so, let's set aside the many plans for action, rumored policy changes, and discussions about possible legislation for the moment. Presidents say a lot of things, but what's most important and revealing is what they actually do. And Trump has already made important changes to US policy — some major, and some minor.
The most important and sweeping changes of Trump's first days in office occurred in two areas. First, on immigration, Trump made a series of hugely consequential policy changes that will block refugee admissions for months and amp up detentions and deportations of unauthorized immigrants. And second, Trump blocked federal funding for any global health organizations that provide or even discuss abortion — not only bringing back a policy from past Republican administrations but vastly expanding it.
Alongside this came the official abandonment of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal — a milestone, but one that's seemed inevitable for some time. And there was also a series of more preliminary moves. Trump froze government hires and regulations. They also signaled their interest in building the wall on the US-Mexico border they promised, in building two major controversial pipelines, and in dismantling Obamacare. And a Supreme Court nomination could, if approved, have an impact lasting decades. But on all these fronts, much remains uncertain.
Immigration: slashing refugee admissions, blocking people from seven countries from entering the US
Trump suspended the US refugee admissions program for 120 days (until the end of May) and the Syrian refugee admissions program indefinitely.
Trump blocked immigrants and visa holders from seven majority-Muslim countries — Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, and Sudan — from entering the US for 90 days (until late April). As a result, hundreds of people in transit were detained at airports and refused admission to the US, at least temporarily, with some being deported. After some turmoil, the government clarified that this “ban” would not apply to green-card holders from those countries, unless there was specific derogatory intelligence on them.
The rollout of this order was chaotic. Hundreds who were legally allowed to enter the US when they departed were detained upon arrival at airports around the country. Most have since been released, but some of them were deported. Many more were not allowed to board flights headed to the US in other countries. Multiple lawsuits have been filed and are currently at various points in the courts.
Furthermore, Trump cut the US's refugee quota for this year in half and stated that “religious minorities” should get priority for the remaining spots.
Immigration: the US is going to be deporting a lot more people
Trump changed existing policy to require that every unauthorized immigrant caught crossing the border be detained. Before this change, many who were apprehended while crossing were then released into the US to wait for a scheduled asylum interview or court date. Now they will have to be either detained or quickly deported.
Additionally, Trump expanded the Obama administration's existing policy of prioritizing the deportation of unauthorized immigrants convicted of serious crimes. Now the administration will also prioritize deporting immigrants who have merely been charged with crimes or even those who the government concludes have committed “acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense.” And “crime” here could mean even things like driving without a license or using a fake Social Security number to pay payroll taxes.
Trump also beefed up enforcement, adding agents to Immigrations and Customs Enforcement's Enforcement and Removal Operations office and reinstating the Secure Communities program, which, as Dara Lind writes, “automatically checked immigration databases to identify people checked into local jails, then allowed ICE agents to ask local officials to hand over any immigrant they wanted to deport.”
They also directed the Department of Homeland Security to begin construction on a wall on the US-Mexico border, to the extent that it can be paid for with existing funds. However, additional money will surely be necessary, and that will still need to be approved by Congress, so this is just a start here.
Abortion and global health: bringing back and hugely expanding the “global gag rule”
Trump reinstated the “global gag rule,” a policy from previous Republican administrations that blocks federal funding from international family planning organizations that “either provide abortion or discuss abortion services with their clients,” as Emily Crockett put it. However, they also greatly expanded its scope — it now applies not just to family planning organizations but to all global health organizations that get US funding.
“If organizations don't agree to sign the pledge saying they won't discuss abortion,” an expert told Sarah Wildman, “they stand to lose massive funding from the US government.” Furthermore, if groups are unable to give women in developing countries information about safe abortion options, they could be driven to unsafe alternatives.
Trade: putting the nail in the TPP's coffin
As they promised, Trump withdrew the US from negotiations over the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. This is no surprise to anyone who paid attention during the campaign, but it marks a major reversal from the Obama administration's strong support of the proposed agreement and recent presidents' support of big multilateral trade deals generally.
Foreign affairs: a strike in Yemen, sanctions on Iran
Trump approved a SEAL Team 6 raid aimed at al Qaeda militants in Yemen. The government claims that an al Qaeda leader named Abdulrauf al Dhahab was killed. The strike also killed both a member of SEAL Team Six, which conducted it, and the 8-year-old American citizen daughter of the late al-Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki, US officials confirmed. The Pentagon claims “numerous” civilians also died, and local reports put the total death toll even higher. “Almost everything went wrong,” a senior US military official told NBC.
The administration also imposed new sanctions on Iran in response to a ballistic missile test. “The new sanctions are intended to focus on suppliers to the missile program and on groups that help arm terrorist organizations,” the New York Times' Glenn Thrush and David Sanger write.
Government: freezes of hiring and regulations, plus ethics rules
Trump announced a hiring freeze throughout the federal government except for the military and national security or public safety positions. Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan announced similar hiring freezes as they began their presidencies.
The president also announced a temporary regulatory freeze — he's told the agencies that no new regulations should move forward until new administration appointees or staffers approve them. Regulations that had been moving through the system on topics like aircraft fuselage inspection, ending sanctions against Myanmar, and giving military spouses an advantage in federal hiring, among other topics, have been blocked for now.
Trump also signed an executive order that, they said, would require agencies to scrap two older regulations before creating new ones. Except the order does nothing of the kind — as Brad Plumer points out, the order only requires two old regulations to be “identified,” not eliminated. It seems essentially toothless, and its actual effect may be mainly to create confusion in agencies.
And Trump adopted lobbying and ethics rules for their administration appointees. All in all, these rules seem less stringent than President Obama's, Politico's Isaac Arnsdorf writes, because Trump lets lobbyists join the administration if they're not working on topics they lobbied on in the past two years. However, Trump's order does make their appointees pledge not to lobby in issues related to the agency they're working in for 5 years and not to register as foreign agents ever.
Housing policy: the rollback of a last-minute Obama rate cut
In the final week of the Obama administration, the Department of Housing and Urban Development announced it planned to cut interest rates for Federal Housing Administration–backed home loans by 0.25 percent in a few weeks. But when Trump first took office, their administration immediately suspended this planned rate cut, therefore blocking a move that would have made home loans for many first-time borrowers slightly less expensive.
Financial regulation: Starting the process of rolling back some Obama regulations
Trump signed an executive order instructing the Labor Department to reconsider the fiduciary rule, an Obama regulation that required retirement advisers to act in the best interest of their clients.
They also signed a more preliminary order instructing their Treasury Department and financial regulatory agencies to start the process of rolling back rules resulting from Obama's Dodd-Frank financial reform law.
Health care: a vague anti-Obamacare order that nobody's sure what to make of
Trump issued an executive order telling agencies to waive or grant exemptions from Obamacare fees and regulations “to the maximum extent permitted by law.” However, it is not yet clear how this order will be interpreted by the agencies and what impact it will actually have. So the future of health policy remains deeply uncertain.
Still, the Trump administration did take one concrete action on the health law — it canceled advertisements urging people to sign up for Obamacare, according to Politico.
Environment: a mostly symbolic encouragement of two pipelines
Trump signaled their support of the controversial Dakota Access pipeline, which critics have argued endangers a reservation's water supplies and sacred sites. The pipeline still faces an environmental impact review from the Army Corps of Engineers, though.
Trump also encouraged TransCanada to resubmit its application to build the Keystone XL pipeline (the Obama administration had rejected it), and pledged quick action on any new application. The ball is in the company's court now.

Windows 10 Creators Update includes many new features and enhancements but watchful users may have noticed that one feature was missing when Microsoft began rolling out the operating system upgrade on April 11.
First announced last fall, Windows 10 Creators Update was slated to ship with My People, a feature enables users to pin contacts to the taskbar to encourage quick messaging and drag-and-drop content sharing. Now, members of the Windows Insider early access program can finally try out My People for themselves by downloading Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 16184 for the PC.
My People supports multiple communications apps like Microsoft's own Skype, which users can select for each contact. For now, users are currently limited to having up to three people pinned to the taskbar.
Build 16184 also includes an update to the built-in Mail and Calendar apps that offers some of the intelligent services offered in the Outlook.com web-based email client to Gmail users.
Recently, Microsoft teased "a new experience for Gmail accounts in the Windows 10 Mail and Calendar apps that brings our latest features such as Focused Inbox and richer experiences for travel reservations and package deliveries that were previously only available to those with an Outlook.com or Office 365 email address," blogged Dona Sarkar, a software engineer in the Windows and Devices Group at Microsoft and head of the Windows Insider program.
"Windows Insiders will be the first to try out the new experience as the roll-out gradually happens over the next few weeks," continued Sarker. "You'll know the new experience is available for your account when you are prompted to update your Gmail account settings."
A number of bugs have been fixed, including one that caused the Start menu to crash when attempting to drag an app from the Apps list to the neighboring tile grid. The company also addressed an issue that could cause Night Light to "get stuck in a disabled state," Sarkar said. Night Light, like the Night Shift feature in Apple iOS, is a viewing mode that cuts down on blue light emissions to help reduce eye strain.
Owners of Surface 3 tablets may face trouble updating to newer builds if they have an SD memory card inserted, warned Sarkar. Some operating system components like Windows Defender, Action Center and Windows Update may exhibit finicky behavior, Sarkar added.
The newest build for Windows 10 Mobile (number 15208) contains a few bug fixes, including one that addresses a flaw in Bluetooth settings that prevented users from accessing certain options. Users who switch networks prior to shutting down their phones should now notice their handsets complete shutdown much faster.
As with any pre-release software, users run the risk of losing data or app instability. This time around, Sarkar cautioned users that some users may experience the loss of data in text message backups. Others may encounter random shutdowns or the immediate crashing of the WeChat app upon launch.
This is my another practice drawing, which means that I put into it much more work than was needed - it already looked pretty good at an early stage of drawing. But thanks to this now it looks much better, so definitely it was worth it.
I wanted to try to draw Pinkie Pie's mane, they have the hardest mane to draw from all mane 6 for me.
I also wanted to draw at least one positive image of them before I will draw another sad or maybe even a little bloody one.
The hardest part? You won't guess, the simplest looking part of the image - background. And I'm still not sure about it, because I also considered alternative options which looks good and I couldn't decide which one to choose.

Hello everyone,
okay, here's an interesting thing. A lot of people have been hunting the 50-100g codes from Wargaming these last couples of days. As we all know, it works by scanning a QR code picture and then you get sent to a page with the code, such as this (whoever invented this method is a complete moron, but whatever). These past few days, following codes were redeemed:
7.3.2014 – WGLGRANDF1NAL
12.3.2014 – TEAMSWGLGRANDF1NAL
14.3.2014 – HOWWEROLLWGLGRANDF1NAL
15.3.2014 – WARSAWWGLGRANDF1NAL
19.3.2014 – MONOL1THWGLGRANDF1NAL
Now, the effort to bring more attention to WGL is commendable I guess, but sorry, I don't give a crap anyway and am in it for the codes. Apparently, more people think like that as well. Someone named “Karsun” sort of leaked the code addresses in advance two weeks ago. These leaks proved to be accurate, as various codes were activated in turn. The addresses, that are still left, are:

Basically, these are the links, that are inactive right now, but are going to be activated as soon as the code gets published. I have no idea which link exactly comes next or how exactly did the author get to them, but considering the fact that they were right before, I would say that it is legit. Not sure whether this is of any use to anyone, but at least we know (if the info is correct) there will be like 14 more codes.
One hundred CEOs have as much in retirement assets as 41 percent of American families.
This report, co-published by the Institute for Policy Studies and the Center for Effective Government, is the first to provide detailed statistics on the staggering gap between the retirement assets of Fortune 500 CEOs and the rest of America.
See shareable graphics below.
Key findings:
The Top 100
The company-sponsored retirement assets of just 100 CEOs add up to as much as the entire retirement account savings of 41% of American families (50 million families in total).
The 100 largest CEO retirement accounts are worth an average of more than $49.3 million—enough to generate a $277,686 monthly retirement check for each executive for the rest of their lives.
David Novak of YUM Brands had the largest retirement nest egg in the Fortune 500 in 2014, with $234 million, while hundreds of thousands of their Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and KFC employees have no company retirement assets whatsoever. Novak transitioned from CEO to Executive Chairman in 2015.
Special Tax-deferred Compensation Accounts
Fortune 500 CEOs have $3.2 billion in special tax-deferred compensation accounts that are exempt from the annual contribution limits imposed on ordinary 401(k)s.
In 2014, these CEOs saved $78 million on their tax bills by putting $197 million more in these tax-deferred accounts than they could have if they were subject to the same rules as other workers. These special accounts grow tax-free until the executives retire and begin to withdraw the funds.
Government Contractors
Fifteen CEOs of major federal contractors can expect to receive monthly retirement checks that are larger than President Obama is set to receive. David Cote of Honeywell has the largest retirement account, with $168 million. This will deliver them a monthly check of more than $950,000—56 times larger than the $16,975 monthly check President Obama will receive.
Gender and Race Gaps
The 10 largest CEO retirement funds—all held by white males—add up to $1.4 billion, compared to $280 million for the 10 largest held by female CEOs, and $196 million for the 10 largest held by CEOs who are people of color.
Among ordinary Americans, 62 percent of working age African-Americans and 69 percent of Latinos have no retirement savings, compared to just 37 percent of white workers.
The report also examines various policy shifts that have favored corporate executives and identifies reforms to limit CEO retirement subsidies and ensure a dignified retirement for ordinary Americans.

Outdoor life: Mr Laura's great age is etched in their face Pictures: EPA
They have spent a lifetime eking out a living in barren mountains but 123-year-old Carmelo Flores Laura looks set to be named the oldest living person ever recorded.
Home is a straw-roofed hut and the widower has eaten foxes and lizards to get by.
Yet they still have a few teeth and can walk unaided around the hamlet they call home near lake Titicaca in Bolivia.
Mr Laura was born on July 16, 1890.
Queen Victoria still had another 11 years left on the British throne and they were 24 when World War I broke out.
The identification document of Carmelo Flores Laura (Picture: EPA)
Their birth date is confirmed on their baptism certificate, considered an authentic record by Bolivia's civil registry.
Mr Laura, who lost their wife ten years ago, told a Bolivian TV station that they believe the secret to a long life is taking daily walks, and never eating pasta or sugar.

They have spent their life eating canahua, a wild species of quinoa which is rich in protein and amino acids.
‘I've never been lazy,' they said. ‘I always shared the cooking with my wife. We would eat what we could find growing wild. We ate mostly skunk meat. I still go on long walks every day.'
The native Aymara, who has three children, 16 grandchildren and 39 great-grandchildren, lives alone in Frasquicia, about 80km (50 miles) from the capital La Paz.

To claim the title, Mr Laura's documents must be verified by a Guinness World Records official.
If proven, their age will easily overtake the current oldest living person, 115-year-old Japanese woman Misao Okawa.
They would also eclipse Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who died in 1997 aged 122.
They were the oldest verified person on record.
The oldest recorded man, Japan's Jiroemon Kimura, died this year, aged 116.
Home - ATT MVNOS , News , Prepaid Data , Red Pocket , Sprint MVNOs , VerizonMVNOs - Red Pocket Now Selling One Year Plans With Verizon LTE on eBay
is finally offering Verizon based LTE service and allowing the activation of LTE phones on its "CDMA" (Verizon) platform. Verizon doesn't allow its MVNOs to use the Verizon name so Red Pocket, which sells service on three operators, refers to them as GSMA for AT&T, CDMAS for Sprint and CDMA for Verizon. It looks like Red Pocket Mobile is finally offering Verizon based LTE service and allowing the activation of LTE phones on its "CDMA" (Verizon) platform. Verizon doesn't allow its MVNOs to use the Verizon name so Red Pocket, which sells service on three operators, refers to them as GSMA for AT&T, CDMAS for Sprint and CDMA for Verizon.
There's still no mention of LTE on the CDMA platform on the Red Pocket website, but yesterday a listing for a Red Pocket 1-Year Wireless Plan - Every Month 1000 Minutes/1000 Texts/1000MB showed up on eBay. The plan is priced at $199.99 for a year's service which works out to $16.66/month. If you need more than 1000 texts per month, a "Gold" plan with 1000 minutes, 1000 MBs and "unlimited" texts is available for $229.00/year or $19.08 per month.The seller is redpocketstore which claims to be the official Red Pocket Mobile eBay store. I called Red Pocket customer support and the representative knew about the eBay deal and said it was legit but was unable to answer any questions about it and referred me to the eBay seller.According to the eBay description, the plan works with AT&T, unlocked GSM, Sprint and. The eBay offer contains an activation kit with comes with "dual cut and nano GSMA and a CDMA LTE triple punch SIM card". I messaged the seller on eBay asking if Verizon LTE phones were supported and if they would get LTE data got this reply;I then asked the seller if the CDMA SIM was for Verizon or Sprint and they replied:Seeing as the kit includes a CDMA SIM rather than a CDMAS one, it's pretty clear that this eBay deal marks the launch of Red Pocket Verizon LTE. When I called Red Pocket support they said that LTE phones were still not allowed on any of the regular CDMA phones but suggested that the eBay deal might be different.So is it a good deal? Maybe, as always that depends on your needs. 1000 minutes, 1000 texts and 1000 MBs for $16.66/month is .555¢ per minute, text, or MB. However, there's no rollover, this is a "use it or lose it" deal. The per-unit cost goes up if you can't use all your minutes, texts and data up every month. If you run out of anything you can add 500 minutes or 500 texts or 500 MBs for $10 (2¢ each) or 1000 minutes or texts or MBs for $15 (1.5¢ each). The add-on minutes, texts or MBs don't roll over either, plus they expire at the end on you current plan month. That means that if you run out near the end of the month you could end up paying $10 for minutes, texts or data that expire in a few days.Another gotcha with this deal is that only the first 500 MBs per month are at high speed. The second 500 MBs are throttled to between 64 and 128 Kbps. Still it's hard to find any plan that includes LTE, 1000 minutes and 500 MBs of high speed data for under $20 on any operator, especially Verizon.I'm wary of paying any provider $200 or more dollars up front for a year's service. But Red Pocket has been in business since 2006 so they seem pretty stable. On the other hand, Red Pocket suddenly shut down service on the T-Mobile network earlier this year leaving users to scramble for a new provider. Red Pocket customer support doesn't have the best reputation either. To Red Pocket CS' credit, when I called today hold time was less than a minute, the representative was friendly and courteous and other than not wanting to talk about the eBay offer seemed knowledgeable about Red Pocket's products and services.
Medical researchers funded by Alberta Innovates Health Solutions are concerned the province's deepening financial troubles could spell the end of three decades of world-renowned medical research.
William Colmers, a professor of pharmacology and neuroscience at the University of Alberta, says he's worried funding for Alberta Innovates Health Solutions could be on the chopping block. Dr. William Colmers, a professor of pharmacology and neuroscience at the University of Alberta, said he's worried AIHS is on the chopping block as the provincial government conducts a review of agencies, boards and commissions.
"My great fear is that it will just fade into the background, and the two great medical research centres that we've built in Edmonton and Calgary will be vulnerable to cherry picking by all the other fine institutions across the globe," said Colmers, who sites the progress made in treatment of hepatitis and diabetes as just some of the work done through the AIHS.
"It's been a whole spectrum of research from molecules right down to society, in terms of making the health of Albertans better."
Colmers said they are concerned that medical research is a much lower spending priority compared to direct health care and education.
"If we lose this, it's never going to come back," they said. "Nobody's going to champion that kind of radical idea again."
AIHS was established in 2010 as one of four separate research agencies under the newly created Alberta Innovates corporation.
Previously known as the Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research (AHFMR), the endowment fund was established by former premier Peter Lougheed in 1980 to promote far reaching innovation and expertise.
Budget consultations are currently underway to determine how dwindling resources will be apportioned in the next Alberta budget, expected in March 2016.
Tim Wilson, a spokesperson for Alberta Health, said no decision has been made on how AIHS will be shaped in future.
"As part of the agencies, boards and commissions review, we are looking at how we can improve Alberta Innovates corporations and ensure value for Albertans," they said.
Colmers said an organization such as AIHS no longer has a "political champion" to fight for its existence. Former head of AIHS, prominent surgeon and innovator Dr. Cy Frank, died in March, leaving a leadership void in the organization, and questions about its future.
"When they died suddenly it left everybody in a bit of a vacuum," said Colmers.
"The institution was in transition and had difficulty being able to move itself forward confidently, which it should have been able to do, and had planned to do under the direction of Dr. Frank," they said.
An interim CEO has led AIHS since Frank's death. The board of directors, whose term was to expire at the end of this year, has been extended another three months.
Dwayne Brunner, spokesperson for AIHS, said for now it's "business as usual," though they acknowledged there is a lot of speculation and rumour about the future of the organization.
"We're just proceeding as though nothing is going to change," they said.
In the most recent provincial budget, AIHS received $70 million from the Alberta government.
There are many varieties of fame. Jesus Christ was the first person to achieve it globally, Clive James wrote, “without conquering the world by violence.” The best kind for a poet to earn, W. H. Auden said, is like some valley cheese — “local, but prized elsewhere.” Yet if all fame, like all politics, is to some degree local, how thoroughly it has been transmitted across the planet and through the centuries has been difficult, if not impossible, to quantify.
Pantheon, a new project from the Macro Connections group in M.I.T.'s Media Lab, is giving that a stab. It has collected and analyzed data on cultural production from 4,000 B.C. to 2010. With a few clicks on its website, which just went live, you can swing through time and geography, making plain the output of, say, Brazil (largely soccer players) or Belarus (politicians). It also ranks professions from chemists to jurists to porn stars (No. 1 is Jenna Jameson; No. 2 is the Czech Republic's Silvia Saint).
For now, you are legitimately famous, the M.I.T. team has decided, if a Wikipedia page under your name exists in more than 25 languages. We have taken a smattering of the most famous, according to Pantheon data and classifications, and wandered down rabbit holes of fame. There are many ghosts in the machine — spirits that César Hidalgo, the project's director, likes to tend. (The ranking system takes longevity into account, which helps explain why many of its most famous people have been dead for at least 1,500 years.) “Poetically, we can say that Isaac Newton's ghost — understood as information — lives reincarnated in the hard drives that populate server farms,” they say. And these ghosts gather to make a point. Even in an era of Kardashians, actually making things matters. “Tangible achievements,” Hidalgo says, “whether these are songs, books, works of art or scientific discoveries, are better tickets to long-term immortality than the accumulation of material wealth.”
HA. Take that "Person Who Most Reminds You of an Infection You Got from a Hot Tub". Turns out, there are still some sane people left in the world who recognize what true sexiness really is.
In November, in a devastating blow to people who like sexy men everywhere, People magazine (aka the Pat Sajak of American tabloids), inexplicably chose Maroon 5 lead singer Adam Levine as the alleged "Sexiest Man Alive 2013." Hahahahah no seriously, they did that shit.
However! Do not fret, people who take arbitrary celebrity titles in random publications way too seriously! MTV is here to save the day. That's right, I said MTV. For the first time, perhaps in the history of all known space and time, the MTV audience has done something sane and rational. They've elected Sex King and Future Burt Husband Tom Hiddleston as their 2013 Sexiest Man Alive. Via MTV.com:
Hiddleston's virtues are many, from their British accent, their easy smile, and ability to really work some facial scruff, not to mention their charming personality and killer dance moves.

Thank you MTV. You are officially forgiven for all of this mess right here.
By the way, I have just confirmed with the head of Jezebel Beat Assignments and I am, in fact, now officially in charge of the Jezebel Tom Hiddleston Beat. TAKE THAT, journalism professor who told me I'd never get a "real job" if I didn't sober up in their class. HA!!! (Editor's Note: This beat does not exist. They made it up. We're just letting them go with it so she'll stop all the damn emails.)

The U.S. Census Bureau is no longer considering removing a question regarding sexual orientation from a marketing survey for the 2020 Census.
Advocates have been alarmed at the Trump administration's tendency to quietly remove LGBTQ questions from federal surveys, including those for older Americans. A working group within the bureau raised concerns over this latest attempt.
The National Advisory Committee on Racial, Ethnic and Other Populations asked on a conference call on Tuesday with bureau staffers why they were considering changing the draft questionnaire for the Census Barriers, Attitudes and Motivators Survey (CBAMS). The survey helps the bureau understand how best to get hard-to-reach communities to participate in the upcoming Census.
- - - advertisement - - -
This is the first year the marketing survey has included a question about sexual orientation.
NPR spoke with four of the advisers inquiring about the planned change, and all of them said staffers struggled to provide an answer.
Those advisers are Hassan Jaber, from the Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services, Meghan Maury, from the National LGBTQ Task Force, and John Yang and Terry Ao Minnis with Asian Americans Advancing Justice.
- - - advertisement - - -
The Census Bureau has since released a statement pledging to keep the question in the survey.
“The U.S. Census Bureau continues to research and plan communications and outreach strategies to maximize response and participation in the 2020 Census,” the bureau said in a statement. “Similar to preparations for the 2010 Census, we will again conduct the Census Barriers, Attitudes, and Motivators (CBAMS) Survey designed to better understand the mindsets related to census participation across demographics subgroups, including the lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) population.”
“The question on sexual orientation remains a part of the initial set of proposed survey questions. Given the sample size of the CBAMS, the expected response rate, and the percentage of the U.S. population that is LGB, we would expect the survey to yield a sufficient amount of data upon which to make statistical inferences,” it continued.
“Make no mistake – public pressure on the Trump Administration works,” said Rea Carey, Executive Director of the National LGBTQ Task Force in a statement. “It was messages from the members of the National LGBTQ Task Force and our partner organizations that compelled the Census Bureau to reverse their appalling decision to stop counting us. Thanks to the efforts of people across the country, the Census will continue collecting data about sexual orientation. We also will continue to push them to collect data about gender identity. Data about the LGBTQ community is absolutely crucial to ensuring that we are distributed the resources we need, that we are represented, and that the most vulnerable in our community are protected.”

Raptor (Photo: cedarpoint.com)
Sandusky, Ohio — A man entered a restricted area at Ohio's Cedar Point amusement park to look for a lost cellphone and was struck and killed by a roller coaster, police said Thursday.
James A. Young had just finished riding the Raptor on Thursday evening and jumped over a fence to retrieve something they dropped during the 57 mph ride. The Erie County coroner said it was their cellphone.
Sandusky police said Young was struck by the ride or someone on it. No one else was hurt.
Police identified Young as a 45-year-old resident of East Canton, Ohio, the Sandusky Register reported.
The park in Sandusky confirmed the death in a statement on its Twitter account and Facebook page. The statement said about 5 p.m., “a guest entered a restricted, fenced area of Raptor and was struck by the ride.” The statement added: “Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family at this time.”
The Raptor and Blue Streak rides weren't operating for more than an hour after the accident, but foot and vehicle traffic at the park continued as usual, the Sandusky Register reported.
A Cedar Point representative said park officials would not be releasing additional information Thursday night and Sandusky police are handling the investigation.
The amusement park sits along Lake Erie in Sandusky and has billed itself as the best in the world.
It has more than 150 rides, shows and attractions. It is in its 146th season of operation, “making it the second oldest continually operated amusement park in North America,” the park website said.
News of the accident and death drew many shocked responses on Twitter.
“People will go to the extreme to get their cell phones,” one user wrote Thursday night.

Remember Nickelodeon's splat-happy game show Double Dare? Many a kid in the ‘80s and ‘90s yearned for a chance to show Marc Summers their obstacle-course skills in this game show packed with messy physical challenges. Well, thanks to Frankford Hall and the Philly Beer Week, you can relive that crazy fun, abetted by plenty of local brew.
Marc Summers themselves will host Dunkel Dare, during which four teams from regional craft breweries will battle it out on a Double Dare-esque set recreation in the beer garden, complete with red and yellow checkered background and the all-important towels next to each contestant podium. At the end of the three-day event, the last brewery standing will win a permanent spot on the Frankford Hall draft list.
From 7–9 PM each night from June 5–7, head to Fishtown to catch the show, entirely free of cover charge. On Tuesday, Tim Ohst and Corey Reid from Sly Fox will go head-to-head with Andrew Rutherford and Mitch Albach from Yards, and on Wednesday, Bill Covaleski and Greg Lehman from Victory will be up against Mat Falco and Dan Shaw, representing Great Lakes. All contestants will be appropriately dressed in signature jumpsuits.
Just like on the TV show, each evening begins with starting challenges, and the winning team gets control of the round. Tthere will be a live video feed, so you're sure to catch all the action as you enjoy pours from the Teutonic-themed tap list. Expect to experience hilarity as you watch the brewers do some of the following:
Toss wet sponges into partner's helmet-bucket (atop their head)
Throw ping pong balls and get them to stick on fly paper
Execute an egg toss where one teammate must catch the egg, crack it on their head and drop it in a bowl
Pick up jelly beans with mechanical pitchers and fill up a glass (halfway)
Fill a cup sticking out of one teammates mouth with seltzers water
After the starting challenges, the round will start with a session of trivia, as Marc Summers fires off questions on beer and pop culture. A second round will consist of a taste-off, during which the brewers must identify mystery beers as either German or American in origin.
The winning brewery from each night will face off in the championship round on Thursday, June 7. Along the way, teams can score even more points by winning the physical challenges. What rigmarole will these beer gurus undergo? Look for these antics, taken direct from the original show:
Candelabra — blow out 20 candles in 20 seconds using a seltzer bottle while blindfolded
Spray the ducks — knock rubber duckies off of the candelabra using a seltzer bottle and catch three of them in a basket
Sock match — find the matching pair of socks in a basket
Giant Nose — reach up into giant nostrils and find the hidden flag
Whipped cream sundae frisbee toss — fill an upside-down Frisbee with whipped cream, chocolate syrup, sprinkles and a cherry and toss it to partner who must catch it before it hits the ground
Back-to-back ball carry — place two rubber balls stacked on top of each other between partners' back. Walk across the stage holding the balls and drop only the lower ball into a basket
Ring toss — toss a ring across the stage to your partner who is wearing a helmet with deer antlers.
Orange transfer — hold an orange under the chin and transfer it to teammate without using your hands
Blindfolded egg catch — toss an egg across the stage to partner, who is blindfolded and holding a pair of cymbals to catch the egg
Funnel fill — fill a mug with beer by filling a funnel on one side of a table and running to the other side of the table where the empty mug is stationed (on the show this was done with rice)
It's guaranteed to be a beer-filled blast. We'll be helping with the video, so we'll see you there!

President Obama took on the radical Islam controversy head on and with a whole lot of passion.
President Obama explains why the radical Islam moniker is counterproductive
President Obama did not pull any punches in today's press conference. They went to the heart of the GOP and Trump's statements about defining the enemy with the radical Islam moniker.
"For a while now, the main contribution of some of my friends from the other side of the aisle have made in the fight against ISIL," President Obama said. "Is to criticize this administration and me for not using the phrase radical Islam. That's the key; they tell us. We can't beat ISIL unless we call them radical Islamists."
The President pointed out the shallowness of the argument.
"What exactly would use this label accomplish," Obama asked. "What exactly would it change. Would it make ISIL less committed to trying to kill Americans? Would it bring in more allies? Is there a military strategy that is served by this? The answer is none of the above."
Obama made it clear that the current hoopla is nothing but a political distraction. It is evident they are speaking out now because the noise is coming from a presidential candidate and that has implications for the safety of all Americans.
The President noted that various of these attacks in America occurred at the hands of American citizens. They inferred that much of the rhetoric on the Republican side marginalizes many Americans, something this country has done before and is subsequently ashamed of today.
The president put Trump and their cohort in their proper place. They appropriately marginalized their narrative. One wonders what took so long for the President to address this issue. The President alway errs on the side of caution even though at times it is unwarranted.
Boulder police on Wednesday afternoon chased down a man driving a riding lawnmower in traffic along south Broadway.
Sgt. Paul Reichenbach said someone called police about 3:15 p.m. after seeing a man ride through the intersection of Baseline Road and Broadway.
The mower continued south along a bike path.
Police caught up with the mower – a black Yard Machines unit with a 21 horsepower engine – at the intersection of Harvard Lane and Auburn Street.
Reichenbach said the driver told officers that they were trying to donate the lawn equipment to Fairview High School and was riding it to the school to drop off.
Reichenbach said riding a lawnmower in traffic or along a bike path are both illegal, but officers chose not to ticket the man because they aren't causing a problem.
“He was trying to be a good guy,” Reichenbach said. “We think their heart was certainly in the right place.”
Officers asked the man – whose name was not available because police didn't arrest or ticket them – to park the mower and have a truck pick it up.
An officer gave the man a ride to the school.

Jason Chatfield.
Bio: I grew up in the far flung suburbs of Perth, in Western Australia, and used to spend my paper route money on MAD Magazines (I cheaped-out and stole my dentist's waiting room issues of the New Yorker. I think I was the only kid who looked forward to going to the dentist).
I moved to New York in 2014 and started pitching to the mag in person. I'm not sure Bob liked me, so I went back to pitching via email. Then I went in on their last day and finally sold my first piece. I feel like it was their final f—k you to the magazine. “Here! Have a Chatfield!”
Find this print here!
The cartoon was a goofy play on Vlad the Impaler.
I didn't sell to the magazine again until last month, but I've had a handful sold as dailies. And I'm published in MAD often, so they've clearly done away with any of their standards.
When I'm not drawing gag cartoons I write and draw a syndicated legacy strip called Ginger Meggs which I took over 10 years ago. It's been around since 1921 and now appears daily in 34 countries. He's kind of an Australian version of Dennis the Menace, except they predate them by about 30 years.
Tools of choice: For drawing/roughs, I use a Prismacolor Turquoise clutch pencil with a red lead and try to find some paper with a little bit of tooth. The mixed media pads at Blick do the trick nicely.
I ink using a Uni-ball Vision Elite Stick Roller Ball Pen… or a Pigma Micron 03.
DO NOT use the Uni-Ball Vision Rollerball Pens, Fine Point (0.7mm) if you're traveling. They explode on planes. And ruin your copy of The New Yorker.
For a wash, I just use watercolor and whatever brush is lying around. Nothing fancy. There's a scanning app on my phone called “Adobe Scan” which does a nice job of scanning line-art into a PDF when I'm out of the studio and need to email in a quick rough.
I use a Wacom Mobilestudio Pro for finished artwork. I like to get out of the studio and work from a bar or restaurant, so it helps that I can take that with me. I use a little glove that I got on Amazon so I don't grease up the screen, and the felt-tip nib that comes in the pen-holder makes the friction between the stylus and the screen more like pencil on paper. Unfortunately, they're not waterproof, as I found on a recent vacation…
My wife plays piano and sings at bars around the city so I'll often sit at the bar during their sets and draw. Digital/Traditional depends on what deadlines are most pressing. (She has a weekly residency in Astoria —if anyone's interested in going, let me know!)
A lot of people email me for advice about tablets —I've been trialling/demo-ing Wacom products for 15 years— I think they're great. If you're married to doing stuff by hand but want to colour digitally, you can get a decent tablet without going broke. Depends on your workflow.
Writing Desk: My wife and I were living upstairs in 5A when my neighbour in 4B died. They were a brilliant poet and had an incredible old writing desk. It's the only thing that was left in the apartment, so I'm looking after it 'til their grandson moves in at the end of our lease. I work for countless hours at this old thing. It's beat up, but I've patched it together enough that it won't collapse and bury me mid-brushstroke. I've stuck a few of my favourite toons on the top of it.
Tool I wish I could use better: My brain. It really is a sack of cats. Whenever I want to sit and do work, it clocks off. Then it comes up with a pearler of an idea at 3 in the morning when I'm trying to sleep. I write it down in my phone, but autocorrect makes it indecipherable by morning.
I like working with my writer friend, Scott. We both do comedy at night and have developed a nice short-hand. We also seem to have the same library of references and can build on each other's premises, which tames my sack-of-cats.
Tool I wish existed: The Deadline Extender.® I've never missed a deadline, but that said… an extra 3 or 4 minutes to allow for a terrible wifi connection, or a errant scanner wouldn't go astray.
Also: The Deadline Extender® PREMIUM: Let's you go back in time to when you were procrastinating and slap yourself in the face. $30 p/month.
Tricks: Ok, well. This is going to sound a bit Dalton Trumbo, but bear with me: I do my best work…in the bath.The most productive 3 hours of my week are during Scotchbath Sunday; an immoveable chunk of time on Sunday evening whereby I lock myself in the bathroom, run a bath, lug my drawing stuff onto a bit of wood that sits over the bath, and just write and draw. Nothing else. I write weeks worth of my syndicated comic strip (Ginger Meggs), I write New Yorker cartoons, scribble up roughs for dailies— and when I feel like I've earned it (usually 2 hours in) I tap the side of the bath three times, and my wife peels themselves from their piano and I unlock the door to a nice big glass of scotch. It's a hell of a carrot on a stick to work towards when you're stuck. (PS. Lest you think I'm some kind of Don Draper-era misogynist; the scotch reward part was their idea. I think they realized it keeps me in the bath and out of their way.)
Anyway. It's a great way to switch gears creatively. It's like being on an aeroplane. No wifi, no phones — just the work you need to get done. Get involved. #ScotchBathSunday.
Oh! And if I get my deadlines done for the week, I have a small budget for a solo lunch somewhere where I can eat cheese and draw. I really didn't know cheese 'til I moved to America. (And yes, I've already been to Wisconsin. Good Lord.)
Tips? I always tell younger artists to not even think about touching a drawing tablet until they've learned to draw by hand first. Otherwise they'll always be drawing away, knowing they have the insurance of the CTRL+Z key at their disposal if they screw up a line. That's not a good habit to have when you're working to a deadline. But, once you do know how to draw, by all means dive head-first into the digital realm. It's incredible. Procreate, Sketchbook or Photoshop are all great.
Misc: One of the hangovers from working in advertising illustration is that I've had to be a bit of a chameleon style-wise for the last 15 years and haven't allowed myself to just settle into one style. Lately, I've just decided to say “Bugger it!” and try and find a loose, consistent style that I'm comfortable with, that's an apt conduit to my silly ideas.
I always loved George Booth's line, and their ability to create a scene with so much movement but just at the right moment in time. Also Sam Gross' dark, hilarious cartoons with perfect line-economy. And I'd give my left arm (I draw with my right) to know how Barry Blitt has so much control with their washes…
Chatfield's portrait of Sam Gross
While I'm geeking out, I love seeing younger cartoonists find their feet and thrive in a style that just feels like they're speaking to you— Ellis J. Rosen, Sofia Warren, Hilary Fitzgerald Campbell, Jason Katzenstein, Amy Kurzweil, and a seemingly endless list of talented younger artists who are putting in the work are a big inspiration.
I know it should be Steig or Thurber or Addams, but my favourite cartoonist is Sergio Aragones.
I was always so enamoured of MAD growing up and studied the lines of Jack Davis, Mort Drucker, Al Jaffee and the Usual Gang of Idiots. I remember being so frustrated I couldn't even come close to getting my work to look like theirs, but I think I found a style somewhere in between when I fell short.
I think Wil McPhail's poses are masterful, and I wish I knew how how the hell they did that. One day I'll trudge up to England and knock on their door to ask him. I find myself doubled-over at John Cuneo's Instagram, and Ed Steed's absurdly funny gags. I have a slew of toons I've torn out of years' worth of magazines and taped to my studio wall, or my zillion year-old writing desk. I'm constantly humbled by how generous and welcoming the existing crop of New Yorker cartoonists have been to a goofy Aussie immigrant — Joe Dator, Matt Diffee and Pat Byrnes, Mort Gerberg and an ever-growing list of prolific, talented cartoonists who make the 99% weekly rejection tolerable.
I've made some of my closest friends and have been lucky enough to meet my cartooning heroes through the National Cartoonists Society. I got to spend a lot of time with Sergio at the Lakes International Comic Art Festival in the UK last year which made my year. We were signing together for a whole afternoon and I spent more time geeking out with them than signing.
Okay. Enough drooling. Sorry.
I'm a fan of cartoonists.
Website, etc.
I have a weekly podcast where I throw around ideas for New Yorker cartoons with a fellow comedian and writer, Scott Dooley. It's called “Is There Something In This?” It's a bit of fun. We don't take ourselves too seriously, but we do take the art of writing gags very seriously. It's an extremely difficult skill to master, and we're virtually zygotes at it. We have lots of listeners now, which is bewildering. Talking about drawing is like dancing about architecture, but here we are. Anyway you can find it on iTunes or wherever you waste time listening to podcasts.
My website is jasonchatfield.com and my comedy stuff is up at jasonchatfieldcomedy.com ( I've been doing stand-up comedy for 11 years. If anyone wants to come see a show, hit me up! I'll put you on the door).
My instagram is @jasonchatfield. I'm still trolling the British chap who has the @jasonchatfield handle on Twitter to no avail. To that end, I'm @jason_chatfield on Twitter.

You can also find me, Jane (the person who created/edits this blog), on Twitter here, which is where I stick the paintings that I've been doing instead of interviewing people consistently (I needed to balance working on other people's work and my own work!).

A few days into the experiment, the new world of legal-recreational-marijuana sales in Colorado appears to be a big success — so much so that pot shops are finding it impossible to keep up with demand.
According to the Denver Post, at least 37 stores in Colorado were licensed to sell recreational pot to anyone 21 or over as of New Year's Day. The Associated Press and others reported long lines outside Denver pot shops, with some eager customers forced to wait three to five hours before getting a chance to go inside, step up to the counter and make a purchase.
Prices have been steep — in some cases, stores were charging $50 or even $70 for one-eighth of an ounce of pot that cost medical marijuana users just $25 the day before — and taxes add on an extra 20% or so. Even so, sales have been brisk.
The two operational pot shops in Pueblo collectively sold $87,000 of marijuana on Jan. 1, per the Pueblo Chieftain, and store owners say if demand persists anywhere near the current high, they'll be sold out in the very near future. Likewise, Toni Fox, owner of the 3D Cannabis Center in Denver, told the Colorado Springs Gazette that a sellout is imminent. “We are going to run out,” they said on Thursday, Day 2 of legal-recreational-marijuana sales. “It's insane. This weekend will be just as crazy. If there is a mad rush, we'll be out by Monday.”
Another Associated Press story noted that some shops had to close early on Wednesday because they didn't have enough marijuana on hand to oblige customers.
(MORE: Colorado's ‘High Country' Takes On New Meaning)
For more than a month, many have speculated that Colorado pot shops would not be able to meet demand due to the limited number of stores open in the state, as well as tough regulations regarding how marijuana is grown and distributed at the wholesale level. Of course, strong demand — especially from “smoke birds,” a.k.a. out-of-state tourists visiting Colorado for legal marijuana purchases — also plays a big role. By most accounts, since Jan. 1 more than half of pot sales have gone to non-Coloradans.
Prices in legal pot shops have already risen to upwards of $400 an ounce. Once you factor in taxes, as well as the fact that it looks like shops may periodically be sold out for a while, and some are saying the situation is one that could push pot enthusiasts back to buying marijuana on the black market. “People will get real tired of paying the taxes real fast,” one street dealer in Pueblo named Tracy told the Chieftain. “When you can buy an ounce from me for $225 to $300, the state adds as much as $90 just for the tax.”

Pro Wrestling Subjective — Fun For All The Family!
Oliver Newman Blocked Unblock Follow Sep 12, 2017
When I saw this new company (Pro Wrestling Subjective) being advertised on Facebook and Twitter in the West Midlands area I was immediately interested.
Seeing a number of the guys (Wrestler/Cover Designer — ‘The Metro-Sexual' Danny Devine, Steve Valentino, Dan Ryder, The Judge, The Hunters — Lee & Jim & Dastardly Graham Thomas — LGT & TGR) who I wrote about in my debut book (A Fan's Perspective: One Man's Exploration Of British Wrestling available on Paperback & Kindle on Amazon — NOW!) made me a believer in the company straight away.
(Cheap Plug 1!)

With my newest book — A Fan's Perspective: 2016 — What A Year To Be A Fan Of WWE (available on Paperback & Kindle on Amazon — NOW!)
(Cheap Plug 2!)
https://www.createspace.com/7293955
https://www.amazon.com/Oliver-Newman/e/B01L24QI3U/
Shipped in (from the USA) and available to sell, I contacted the Promotion about selling them at the show, they were happy for me to do so (which I greatly appreciated) and I started making plans to see the company live.
Fast forward to the night of the show………….
I met Carson Bailey (who I had met at previous shows), we exchanged pleasantries and they directed me into the venue. In a funny moment Steve Valentino's Mother (who I had met previously at a Venom Wrestling Federation show) mistook me as being a Wrestler.
I shook hands and hugged Steve and they showed me where I could set up my merchandise table, the guys and gals were talking about the show so I left them to it, (apart from The Hunters — Lee & Jim, who were setting up their merchandise, so we shook hands and said hello and then Dan Ryder — who I hadn't seen in 8 years! Popped by to say hello). My friend Emma Roulstone (amazing artist) came over to say hello and bought a copy of A Fan's Perspective: One Man's Exploration Of British Wrestling — thank you for your support, hun.
To the show……………..
Pro Wrestling Subjective: Clash Of The Titans
Date: Sunday 10th September 2017
Time: Doors — 6:00pm First Bell: 6:30pm
Tickets: prowrestlingsubjective@aol.co.uk
Location: Station Hotel Dudley, Castle Hill, DY1 4RA Dudley
The Judge introduces us to Carson Bailey & The Disciple (The Judge, Jury & Executioners) and then they prove that they are a master of the mic by riling up the crowd. Steve Valentino interrupts (the crowd roars their approval). Valentino has to fight off all three men (for the majority of the match), they do so valiantly and then much to the crowds relief Pro Wrestling Subjective Champion ‘The Outlaw' Jesse Jones © runs Bailey & Disciple off — unfortunately the distraction allows Judge to take advantage and they nail Valentino with a running bonzai drop for the 1,2 and 3.
The Judge is the NEW #1 Contender.
I had just recently seen Athena Furie (Young Blood Wrestling) wrestling as a hero, so it intrigued me to see how they could switch to being a villain here. Athena drew the ire of the crowd, so they did a great job being hated. Shauna Shay - I hadn't seen before, they showed a lot of potential, she's a very powerful woman (hit Athena with a number of German Suplexes). Athena picked up the win by cheating (with their feet on the ropes).
Dan Ryder & The Hunters (Lee & Jim) entered to rapturous applause from the Pro Wrestling Subjective faithful. The Metro Club (Elliot Jordan Experience, Dastardly Graham Thomas, Metroet - Miss Jasabel & ‘The Metro-Sexual' Danny Devine) enter to booing from the crowd.
Ryder makes it clear who they want to fight, they are itching to get their hands on Devine. Just when Devine looks like they will take on the challenge, they take the cowards way out and tags in another Metro Club member. This was a cracking old school tag team match with Ryder being beaten down but refusing to quit, Devine picked their spots and even attempted (but was foiled) when they tried to ring Ryder's bell (with the ringbell).
In the end after a 6-man tower of doom (seen below):

Ryder picked up the win for their team pinning Thomas after a Michinoku Driver.
INTERMISSION
During this time young wrestling fans were allowed the opportunity to step into the ring — like their heroes. I had the pleasure of talking wrestling with fellow fans - including Tom Baker (Millie McKenzie's #1 Fan) who purchased the second copy of my book (A Fan's Perspective: One Man's Exploration Of British Wrestling) and helped me sell out my book (for the evening), top man Tom — thank you for your support!
Myself & Tom
This was a fun match, as the fans chanted “Woof” at Rawlings and “Meow” at Kid, leading to some hilarious exchanges of offense. First time seeing either men and they impressed, I like both guys characters (Rawlings especially). Puma Kid picks up the win by catching Rawlings with a mid-air cutter.
‘The Executioner' Carson Bailey vs. ‘Party Guy' Liam Perrin w/‘The Princess of the Playlist' LJ— I haven't seen this side of Perrin before, they have flashing boots (much like WWE's Naomi) and the place was rocking when they entered. I and the fans howled in laughter when Perrin coaxed Bailey into a conga mid-match! (Outstanding — the moment of the night!). Bailey was hated, Perrin was loved — so both men did their jobs — Bailey wins with a really well executed top rope downward spiral.
El Talon's Open Challenge — Luke Douglas answers the call. Spirited showing from Douglas who gave it their all against Talon but unfortunately Talon's manager interferes and Douglas falls foul to a Samoan Drop and El Talon's deadly Iron Claw finishing hold.
As I have stated before (in my YBW report and on the Broken But Glorious Podcast) ‘The Outlaw' Jesse Jones is one of the top up and coming wrestlers in the UK. So I was looking forward to seeing them defend their Title, The Disciple is someone I hadn't seen before (until this evening). The Judge & ‘The Executioner' Carson Bailey tried to ‘manage' from ringside but with a lack of managerial license they were sent to the back. Disciple attacks before the bell and the match goes back and forth from there, it looks like either man could win, but ‘The Outlaw' Jesse Jones shows their championship resilience by retaining their Title after nailing The Disciple with a Torture Rack Bomb.
Post-Match:
Bailey & The Judge attack Jones, Perrin & Puma Kid even up the numbers (but get beaten down by the three men) Valentino rushes the ring but they too are taken out by The Judge, Jury & Executioners, they then leave an everlasting mark on Pro Wrestling Subjective ‘Clash Of The Titans' when The Judge (regardless of warnings of an unpaid indefinite suspension by ring announcer Kris Godsize) powerbombs ‘The Princess of the Playlist' LJ into the canvas! OUCH! (That looked really painful)— The Judge is suspended!
Pro Wrestling Subjective: Clash Of The Titans — Final Thoughts:
Consistent in-ring action from bell to bell, hats off to all the guys & gals who performed.
Valentino vs. Judge was wrestled like a main event, Athena vs. Shay showed just how hard women work to impress in wrestling — kudos ladies. 6 man tag was emotionally investing, adding to the Ryder vs. Devine feud. Rawlings vs. Kid was a funny comedy match, Bailey vs. Perrin contained the moment of the night (mid-match conga), El Talon is a beast! Jones vs. Disciple was a good main event, post-match had the scariest moment on the show with The Judge's powerbomb and the shock of their subsequent indefinite suspension.
Dan Ryder vs. ‘The Metro-Sexual' Danny Devine — one on one will be money for Pro Wrestling Subjective!
Who challenges Pro Wrestling Subjective Champion ‘The Outlaw' Jesse Jones © now that #1 Contender - The Judge is indefinitely suspended!?
Match Of The Night
Steve Valentino vs. The Judge w/The Disciple & ‘The Executioner' Carson Bailey
Pro Wrestling Subjective are back with another night of action on Sunday 1st October and I will be there (you should be too)!
Bills to pay! (Other Plugs):

Dota 2 is one of the most popular MOBAs in recent years. It's Valve's most played game on Steam and it has a huge eSports scene with tons of tournaments all over the world. Valve hosts the biggest annual tournament called: “The International”. With huge money prizes in millions at stake, it definitely shows how much big Dota 2 actually is.
Due to how popular the MOBA genre has become, there are a lot of similar games like Dota 2 that are trying to get a bit of the pie. A bit of background history on how Dota 2 came to be:
Before Dota 2 and League of Legends, we had the widely popular mod on Warcraft 3 called DotA: Allstars. After years of changes, IceFrog was the last developer that worked on the mod. They were later on hired by Valve in 2009 to work on the sequel to the popular, community-developed mod. This was also the same year League of Legends launched.
After 2 years of closed and open beta tests, Dota 2 finally launched on Steam in 2013. It received a way better graphics and gameplay, all while staying true to the classic mod. Ever since then millions of players are playing Dota 2 every day, making it the most played game on Steam ever. To this day it still claims that top spot in Steam's stats.
Dota 2 features 113 different heroes to choose from (as of May 2017), all which are unlocked right from the get-go. Mastering just one hero takes quite some time, but once you do get great at your favorite hero, it is a blast to play.
Looking for an easier alternative? Played enough of Dota 2, and simply want to give a different MOBA a go? Then keep on reading and find out more games like Dota 2.
On Monday, the state of Virginia instituted a high-occupancy toll lane on a 10-mile stretch of Interstate 66 inside the DC beltway. The lane was previously just for high-occupancy vehicles, but the new tolls give solo drivers the option to use it, for a price. How much of a price? Well, it hit $34.50 Monday morning, according to The Washington Post, which is about 6.5 cents for every 100 feet.
The price is variable, and has no cap, so it could presumably go higher. It's set by roadway sensors, which measure the speed at which traffic is moving and adjust the price accordingly. It was thought that it might be around $10 during rush hour, but no one was really sure.
From the Post:
Officials with Virginia's Department of Transportation said the $34.50 rate was the “peak of the peak rate.” “It is a dynamic toll,” said Jenny McCord, a spokesperson for VDOT. “It will vary and fluctuate based on the demand.” Other times, they noted, the toll was in the low $20s. The toll changes every six minutes.
Advertisement
There is no toll for vehicles carrying two or more people, and there are also no tolls when it's not rush hour, which is defined at 5:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. eastbound and 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. westbound.
Indeed, on its face, the tolls seem slightly ridiculous, but this is the kind of thing that we need more of—tolls that reward good behavior like carpooling, and discourage driving alone to work.

Google confirmed yesterday that it has acquired Boston Dynamics, maker of creepy walking humanoids and creepy running animal bots. Talk about a power couple.

Google declined to tell The New York Times how much it paid for the robot engineering company. While Boston Dynamics works closely with the Pentagon to develop battlefield-ready robots, Google says it does not plan on becoming a military contractor on its own. Existing Boston Dynamics military contracts will be honored.
Google is moving into the robotics realm in a big way: Boston Dynamics is the eighth robotics company the internet giant has acquired in the past six months. What Google plans to do with all this robot knowledge hasn't been made expressly known.
The robotics team is led by Andy Rubin, who recently stepped down as head of Android. In an interview with The New York Times last week, Rubin was tight-lipped about what the robotics team has in store for the "moonshot" project. There's plenty of speculation that Google wants to create an automated manufacturing or retail system, similar to Amazon's product picking robots.

We'll be watching very closely to see what Google does with its newly-acquired robotics dream team. If nothing else, maybe Boston Dynamics' walking robots will get Google's voice commands: "Okay Google bot, stop throwing cinderblocks at me!" [The New York Times]

SEC Is A Due Process Nightmare: Searches Emails Without A Warrant, Refuses To Share Exculpatory Evidence
from the the-sec-doesn't-like-the-constitution dept
In a criminal trial, the federal government has long been obliged to promptly turn over to the defense any evidence that could show that the accused did not commit the offense of which they are accused. The Brady rule (announced in the 1963 Supreme Court case, Brady v. Maryland), prevents one-sided prosecutions in which the defendant is kept in the dark about information that might show that they are innocent.
The government's job as criminal prosecutor is not to obtain convictions, but "to do justice," according to the traditional legal maxim. It should be required to follow the Brady rule in civil trials as well. But the SEC does not, even when it accuses a citizen of fraud. Had the agency complied with this simple rule in its recent insider-trading case against one of us, Mark Cuban, it is unlikely that a lawsuit would even have been filed, let alone go to trial.
The SEC, however, resisted the disclosure of these notes for the next three years. Even up until the time Mr. Cuban took the stand, the SEC continued to fight to keep the notes from being shown to the jury by asking the judge to exclude them from evidence. Fortunately, the judge disagreed and the jury ultimately cleared Mr. Cuban of a charge of insider trading.
Back in December, we wrote about the effort to push for ECPA reform by noting that one of the main government agencies fighting against it was the SEC , which wanted the ability to snoop through your emails without getting a warrant. If you don't remember, ECPA is an excessively outdated law from 1986, whose definitions make no sense in the internet era (especially one with cloud computing). The key example often given is that emails on a server that are over 180 days old are considered "abandoned" and thus no warrant is needed to access them. That may have kind of made sense in an era when people downloaded all of their email, but now that nearly all email remains on servers somewhere it makes no sense at all. There are other problems with ECPA similar in nature (opened vs. unopened emails are treated differently, for example), but it's clear the law is outdated.Two stories popped up last week that raise serious concerns about the way that the SEC tramples on the Constitution. The first is that in a hearing, SEC boss Mary Jo White was asked why the SEC is so resistant to ECPA reform and what's wrong with getting a warrant, and more or less admitted that it's standard practice for the SEC to not get a warrant , but to rely on loopholes in ECPA to get access to emails. Prior to this, many had assumed that this was just aof the SEC, not that they were regularly doing it. But White's answer makes it clear that the SEC views this practice -- which seems like it should be a clear 4th Amendment violations -- asWhile they insist that the privacy issues aren't a huge deal, because the SEC tries to "give notice" to the subscriber whose email is being accessed, that still doesn't explain whyrequire a warrant, and yet the SEC doesn't bother with the much higher standard (including judicial review) of a warrant for electronic documents.Meanwhile, concerning a separate issue, Mark Cuban and their lawyer published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal last week, discussing the SEC's totally bogus case against them for insider trading, which got tossed out by a lawyer. The key issue they discussed is how the SEC had exculpatory evidence that proved Cuban had done no wrong from back in 2004 -- and then did everything possible to avoid turning over that evidence , as is normally required in legal proceedings.At issue were notes the SEC had concerning the details of Cuban's conversation with the CEO of Mamma.com, the search engine Cuban had invested in (and then sold all their shares in), which showed that, contrary to the SEC's claims in the case against him, Cuban had never made certain promises. When Cuban and their lawyer asked for these notes, the SEC resisted.So, reading both of these stories, we see that the SEC feels that it is free to ignore both the 4th Amendment (against search and seizure without a warrant) and the 14th Amendment (concerning due process). Don't we think that agencies of the federal government should be required to follow the Constitution -- especially basic concepts like protecting the privacy of individuals and giving them basic due process? And, for those of you who think this is no big deal, because it's the SEC, and the SEC just goes after big bad bankers and the like, recognize that the agency following right behind the SEC in fighting ECPA reform is the IRS. Do you feel it's similarly okay for the IRS to search your emails and electronic recordswhile also believing that it need not share any of the exculpatory evidence it finds, proving your innocence, while bringing a case against you for violating the law?Oh, and just for the hell of it, let's take this a step further. Just a few weeks ago, the NY Times reported on an increasingly popular tactic of law enforcement to effectively use the SEC to trick people into effectively implicating themselves in criminal cases. It tells the story of a low-level guy who worked at a law firm, and was asked by the SEC to "help out" with an investigation. Only at the last minute, was it mentioned that someone from the district attorney's office would be present -- and at no time was there any indication that the guy was being investigated for criminal behavior. But thanks to the SEC smokescreen, the guy was indicted, and he's still not sure why.So, now it's an SEC that ignores the Constitution, searches emails without a warrant, hides exculpatory evidencesurreptitiously uses these "investigations" to help build outcharges against people on a highly questionable basis. See the problem, yet?The folks over at VanishingRights.com are fighting to reform ECPA, which would at least solve half of the problem above. Right now, the SEC and the IRS remain the main government agencies aligned against such reform. It's time to tell those agencies that they need to obey the Constitution too.

Florida coach Jim McElwain returned to Fort Collins, Colo., this week to celebrate Christmas with their family.
Once the holidays are over, McElwain will be back at work and gearing up for a sprint to signing day, Feb. 4. The Gators have eight verbal commitments and scholarship room for 25 signees at this time.
“We've got a lot of scholarships to give, and for us the biggest thing is making sure we get the right fit,” McElwain said Monday on the Ronnie and Tkras Show on 620 WDAE. “Not only great players, but great character and guys that fit the University of Florida.”
McElwain wants the makeup of the class to be balanced and said the offensive line, which could return just eight players next season, is a position he's “really pounding on right now” as a priority. They visited three linemen their first weekday on the recruiting trail, including five-star offensive tackle Martez Ivey.
After their introductory press conference Dec. 6, McElwain spent the next eight days on the road before the dead period started Dec. 15.
The contact period resumes Jan. 15 and ends the 31st. McElwain will try to triple their current number of commits over the six weeks.
“It's definitely one of those deals that we've really got to hit the ground running right after the first of the year,” McElwain said Monday on the Frank Frangie Show on 1010XL. “The response we've received, obviously there's previously relationships that have been built with recruiters from different school with all these kids, and yet we are opening up a new opportunity.
“A new opportunity to be a Gator. There are a lot of kids that have grown up wanting to be in that orange and blue, and you know what, we're going to get back in, we're going to give them that opportunity to be a part of a great university and really, a chance to build a legacy.”
That building process for McElwain will begin in UF's own backyard. One of their main recruiting objectives is taking back the state of Florida, particularly the Tampa area.
They made more than two dozen visits earlier this month and saw nine of the top 20 in-state recruits, according to the rankings of 247Sports.com. Five of those nine were from the Tampa area.
“When you look from a historical standpoint, when Florida was really rolling, they controlled and had the majority of really good players out of that area,” McElwain told 620 WDAE. “We have to get back in and make sure we're getting the best out of that area as we build our team.
“Obviously I'm a firm believer (that) we are the University of Florida and it's Florida first, then the rest of it is second. … We're re-evaluating guys as we speak and making sure that we get the right fit, and first and foremost with players from the state of Florida.”
McElwain, who expects to speak with some recruits by phone on Christmas, is confident the Gators will have a strong finish to the 2015 recruiting cycle.
“We will do a great job salvaging this recruiting class,” McElwain told 1010XL. “There are some really good players out there that have given us notice and some that haven't made up their minds yet. Those are the ones we are going to go after. And then, we got to get a great start on the evaluation for the 2016 and 2017 class. For us, that all starts with capturing the state of Florida as much as we can.”
In the summer of 2014, during the Israeli military action in Gaza known as Operation Protective Edge, the Abu Nijem family tried to keep things normal. One night at their home in the Jabalya refugee camp, they ate dinner, cleared the table, prayed, and then sat and talked for a while. Maryam, 23, put their two children to bed, and their father-in-law took up a cup of tea to their father, who lived on the second floor.
Then, a bomb that had been dropped from an Israeli aircraft hit the house. “I cried out to my husband. I turned on a flashlight and heard my daughter Raw'ah screaming. She's a year old,” Maryam told B'Tselem. “I looked for them and found them under the blankets. I grabbed them and my son Muhammad, who's three years old, and ran out of the room. I saw Ahmad, my husband's brother, lying dead next to the bedroom door. I saw rocks and everything in shambles.”
The bomb destroyed their house and a neighboring one, killing 10 people—a woman and two girls next door, and seven in the Abu Nijem home, including two Islamic Jihad operatives who were in the house.
At first glance, one could plausibly see this as tragic: an extremely unusual and unfortunate outcome, but one that may take place in times of war. Indeed, armies are neither expected nor required to avoid all civilian casualties, and mistakes, even terrible ones, can happen.
To examine what happened, context is key. Operation Protective Edge lasted 50 days, during which time Israeli forces killed 2,202 Palestinians. Of these, 63 percent (1,391) were not involved at all in the hostilities, including 180 children under five and 346 aged six to seventeen. About 18,000 homes were destroyed or severely damaged, and more than 100,000 Palestinians were left homeless.
Yet today, more than two years after the operation ended, only one investigation has led to an indictment—two soldiers were charged with looting and a third with aiding and abetting them.
How has it come to this?
First, the Israeli investigations never extended to government officials or senior military commanders. Even before the fighting ended, officials claimed that the army respects international humanitarian law (IHL) and is doing everything possible to prevent civilian casualties, stressing that in “exceptional cases” investigations would be conducted. From the start, then, the investigation of those responsible for designing policies and approving open-fire regulations was never on the agenda.
Second, the only body in Israel that investigates IHL violations is the Military Attorney General (MAG), which faces a built-in conflict of interest. It provided legal counsel to the army prior to the operation and worked closely with military personnel on the ground throughout it. Yet it is now expected to decide which cases merit investigation and what measures should be taken in response. In other words, this body is essentially tasked with ordering an investigation into itself or its direct subordinates.
Third, the way the MAG interprets IHL can rarely lead to the conclusion that a soldier has violated the law. In its view, when making decisions, soldiers and officers do not need to take into account the horrific results of dozens of similar attacks conducted in previous days. By allowing them to do so, the MAG absolves everyone involved in the attacks—from the prime minister, through the MAG himself, down to those who dropped the bomb—of the duty to do everything in their power to minimize harm to civilians. By examining only what those responsible for the attacks claim to have known prior to the attacks while entirely disregarding what they should have known, including the obligation to learn from their own experience, the MAG sets the bar extremely low.
The MAG decided to not hold anyone accountable for the actions that led to the bombing of the Abu Nijem family and for many other similar bombings, with an accumulated death toll in the hundreds. The MAG decided to close such files, stating that each of these attacks was legal since it met IHL criteria. But dozens of “isolated tragedies” are neither isolated nor merely tragedies. Rather, they reflect an illegal policy with terrible, predictable consequences that no one is ever held accountable for, and as things are looking now, nobody ever will.
The same whitewash mechanism that B'Tselem discussed in its recent report on the lack of accountability in the West Bank, The Occupation's Fig Leaf, is also at play in the investigation of the operation in the Gaza Strip. Here, too, the main concern of the Israeli authorities is to create the false appearance of a functioning system, allegedly striving for truth, with the investigations merely serving as a façade.
Accountability is needed not only to bring justice to the victims and their families. It is needed to forestall similar actions in the future. When nothing is investigated, when officials insistently claim that everything was legal, when the results of their actions are ignored, it opens the door to an even darker future.
"Arthas remembered that once, they had thought to see Jaina standing before them on their wedding day, the petals falling upon a face lit with a smile..."
--
Illustrated a small part of the book (Arthas: RotLK), and I plan on doing more! There isn't enough art of Arthas during their paladin days.
Many mistakes in this, unfortunately I rushed it as I got a little sick of looking at it after some long hours. Also, in the original sketch, Arthas had their crown on, but I changed their position completely and yeah. Maybe I'll add it some other time. I wanted Jaina to have more stuff in their hair but, again.
The part of the book I quoted takes place moments before assassinating their father - the W3 cinematic, essentially, where he's seen holding a petal.

If Pepe the Frog's creator has anything to say about it, their creation will shake off the cloak of bigotry which has been thrown around its shoulders by members of the alt right.
Cartoonist Matt Furie told the Associated Press that they plan on reviving Pepe after killing them off last month, Cartoonist Matt Furie told the Associated Press that they plan on reviving Pepe after killing them off last month, according to a report by ABC News
To achieve this goal, they and their brother Jason have started a crowdfunding campaign to raise $10,000 for the publication of a Pepe comic book. In addition, Furie has hired attorney Kimberly Motley to explore legal options against alt right-ists who have used Pepe's image to promote their cause without the creator's permission.
According to Furie, “once we get the money together, we're going to do it [the comic book] from scratch” even as they fight to “gain some entrepreneurial control” over Pepe for the future.
In the comic in which Furie killed off Pepe , the titular frog was seen deceased in an open casket at a wake. It was an emotional end for a character devised by Furie in their 2005 comic book “Boy's Club,” which initially had very little to do with politics. Furie themselves identifies as a progressive and was reported to be horrified at the use of Pepe's image to promote racism, anti-Semitism, misogyny and other hateful ideas.
Russian President Vladimir Putin casts their ballot at a polling station during the municipal elections in Moscow on September 10. Yuri Kadobnov/Pool/Reuters A fuller picture of Russia's use of social media to influence the 2016 US election has begun to emerge, weeks after Facebook announced that "inauthentic" accounts most likely operating out of Russia had purchased $100,000 worth of political ads between 2015 and 2016.
A steady stream of leaks most likely coming from Capitol Hill — Facebook said late last week that it would turn over the ads to Congress — have indicated the ads and the accounts that bought them were focused primarily on exploiting divisions over issues like race and immigration.
And as Business Insider has previously reported, the accounts' activity did not stop at posting controversial memes and hashtags — many organized events, rallies, and protests, some of which galvanized dozens of people.
Facebook was not oblivious to the Russians' presence on the platform — The Washington Post reported this week that the company contacted the FBI last June when it noticed that members of a hacking group connected to Russia's military intelligence unit, the GRU, had begun creating fake accounts to amplify stolen emails.
The US intelligence community concluded in January that the social-media operation was part of a larger influence campaign by Russia — and that assessment, according to former intelligence chief James Clapper, "did serve to cast doubt on the legitimacy" of the election outcome.
Here's what we know so far about how the Russians used one of the biggest tech companies in the world to energize and influence American voters:
Trainspotting 2 photos from the filming in Edinburgh
Director Danny Boyle, Ewan McGregor and Ewen Bremner filmed a new scene for Trainspotting 2 in Edinburgh, Scotland yesterday! You can check out the Trainspotting 2 photos in the gallery below, as well as photos from the May filming.
TriStar Pictures recently announced that is has acquired worldwide rights to Danny Boyle's much-anticipated sequel. Trainspotting 2 is based on characters created by Irvine Welsh. It will reunite director Danny Boyle with screenwriter John Hodge and all of the principal cast of the 1996 film—Ewan McGregor, Jonny Lee Miller, Ewen Bremner and Robert Carlyle will reprise the iconic roles of Renton, Sick Boy, Spud and Begbie.
Producers on Trainspotting 2 are Andrew Macdonald, Danny Boyle, Christian Colson, and Bernie Bellew through Figment Films, Decibel Films, and Cloud Eight Films. Film4 is also a production entity. The plan is for the film to be released in 2017 to mark the 21st birthday of the original film.
“It's been 20 years since we met these characters and John Hodge's screenplay brilliantly explores what's happened to them—and to us—in the intervening years,” said Boyle previously. “We are grateful to Tom and Hannah for their support and we can't wait to get going.”
“‘Trainspotting' was a seminal movie for me,” Tristar's Hannah Minghella said. “Like almost everyone my age, I had the ‘Choose Life' poster on my university dorm room wall. I have wanted to work with Danny ever since, so the opportunity to collaborate on the sequel is truly a dream come true. It perfectly represents the filmmaker-driven movies I am committed to making at TriStar.”
Beach-goers were faced with a different kind of sea creature when they entered the water at Victoria's picturesque Rye Beach last week - a swimming echidna!
The prickly Australian mammal was filmed paddling out to sea in the turquoise waters off the Mornington Peninsula, 83 km south of Melbourne.
Where it was heading, is anyone's guess.
Scroll down for video
This echidna was spotted paddling out to sea off Rye Beach, a popular surfing and fishing spot on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula
The video of the swimming echidna, which looks to be happily using its ant-eating snout as a snorkel, was posted online by YouTube user Emma B.
According to Australia Zoo, echidnas, like many native Australian animals, are actually 'proficient' swimmers. They like the water so much, that the Zoo built a special swimming pool for its echidna residents to cool off on hot summer days.
Echidnas, like many native Australian animals, are actually 'proficient' swimmers - though they usually prefer fresh water to the open ocean
The echidna - or spiny ant-eater - is found all over Australia, in coastal forests, alpine meadows and desert habitats. They live on a diet of ants, termites, grubs and worms but biologists think the mammals evolved from aquatic ancestors like the platypus.
Gary Sutton, a park ranger from Narawntapu National Park in Tasmania, said they have also seen wallabies and wombats surfing. They previously told the ABC they thought the animals went in the water to get rid of parasites, like lice and ticks.
Hidden under the vast crystal blues of the Pacific, a submarine is hunted from above. A centuries-old game of cat and mouse drives the technological advancements in the ongoing race to conquer the undersea realms. Today, enhanced capability in both anti-submarine and anti-surface technology is transforming anti-submarine warfare, known as ASW.
Modern submarines are not only quieter than their ancestors, but they are also better equipped to deal with the threats that shadow them from above. For now, submarines are ahead in the race. But, with the emergence of unmanned autonomous technology there is the tantalizing possibility that in the future we will be able to detect, localize and track submarines across huge distances more effectively and at lower cost. As we enter into a new era of ASW operation, we take a look at the challenges in unmanned solutions remaining to be overcome before the tide is turned against those hidden under the waves.
The ASW industry is an endless conveyor belt of innovation, battling to develop the next game-changing technology. NATO navies already field impressive ASW capabilities, including modern frigates deploying low-frequency active sonar and advanced location devices on new modern submarines. Air assets such as specialized planes known as Maritime Patrol Aircraft, or MPAs, can deploy and monitor passive or active sonobuoys fields, and helicopters, MPH, can deploy sonobuoys and/or active dipping sonar.
While manned assets are a vital part of ASW operations, reductions in funding and new advances in submarine technology has led countries around the world to begin to develop unmanned systems for ASW. Although today's unmanned technology has a lower-performance payload than manned, these systems offer an enormously cheaper alternative that, as a team, offer the potential to cover vast ranges while delivering covertness that may carry great tactical advantages.
“Anti-submarine warfare is a highly asset-intensive process that requires significant numbers of highly capable platforms deploying a variety of sensors. To operate these platforms and sensors at their potential, requires a cadre of trained and skilled human operators, as well as an appetite for risk, as the submarine is an increasingly dangerous adversary,” explains Dr. Kevin LePage, ASW program manager at the NATO Science and Technology Organization (STO) Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE) in La Spezia, Italy.
The STO-CMRE is the NATO innovation hub for developing underwater technologies for a range of maritime applications, including minesweeping and ASW operations. Their objective is to deliver innovative and field-tested Science and Technology (S&T) solutions to address the defense and security needs of the Alliance.
CMRE operates two research vessels that enable S&T solutions to be explored and developed at sea. The largest of these vessels, the NATO research vssel Alliance, is an ice-capable global class vessel that is one of the world's quietest ship, allowing for precision acoustic studies to be conducted in environments operationally relevant to NATO. The operational experimentation being conducted from this platform has as its goal the development of cheaper, smarter solutions to give the nations a greater range of options in setting requirements for future ASW capability.
Two of the CMRE's most valuable assets are their sophisticated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), capable of operating with a degree of independent decision-making abilities. The CMRE is working to give the AUVs the capability to listen, to evaluate and to signal the presence of submarines to operators in the command and control center.
Like the increasingly used unmanned vehicles for air and land, AUVs can operate more and more flexibly in the littoral and open oceans. And, as further systems are introduced into the mix, the way potential enemies have been used to working underwater will begin to be challenged.
LePage said, “ASW has for years relied on certain remote-controlled, monitored or unmanned sensor platforms, such as the sonobuoys deployed by Maritime Patrol Aircraft and Helicopters, and permanent or deployable sensing arrays. More recently, we have seen the increased use of unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs) for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, mostly for visual confirmation. However, the fully-fledged use of unmanned systems either as an organic or standalone capability for ASW is just beginning to emerge. One example is the ACTUV, a 40-meter long-endurance unmanned ASW platform being developed by DARPA and ONR in the U.S.”
The ASW Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV) is an unmanned vessel designed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The state-of-the-art vessel is built specifically to track quiet diesel-electric submarines, at a fraction of their size and cost.
The project also seeks to advance unmanned system autonomy so that maritime operators are able to deploy platforms capable of crossing thousands of kilometers and undergoing missions for months at a time with minor supervision.
Another example of advancements in unmanned technology for maritime security is the Seagull unmanned surface vessel (USV) developed by Israel's Elbit Systems. At 12 meters long, the USV is claimed to be a first-of-its-kind maritime robot designed for missions in underwater mine hunting, mine clearing, anti-diver and ASW operations. The Seagull USV uses electro-optic and infrared sensors along with various sonars to search for underwater threats.
NATO at the Core of ASW Innovation
“At CMRE we have been working under NATO Allied Command Transformation, or ACT, to develop Autonomous Security Networks for ASW. This effort is divided into three projects: (1) Maritime Unmanned Systems for ASW where we engage in spiral S&T development of an autonomous ASW network based on unmanned underwater vehicles. We deploy these yearly into National and NATO ASW exercises; (2) the UWNet project, where we develop technology for military digital underwater communications networks, which is actually a critical enabling capability across all the maritime warfare domains; and (3) the Decision Support project. This final project is where we engage in ASW operations research and analysis to develop candidate tactics and decision support tools for both human operators and robots,” explains LePage.
After years of research and development in unmanned ASW networks, CRME has come across several technological hurdles that still need to be surmounted, such as the development sufficiently effective autonomous sensing, processing, classification and tracking algorithms to arrive at the required probability of detection and false alarm.
Parallel studies are being conducted to refine algorithms for advanced collaborative robotics to allow autonomous vehicles to provide adequate area coverage, barrier performance and ability to trail a target. Work is also ongoing to develop higher throughput secure underwater communications links to enable collaboration of unmanned underwater assets and provide connectivity to command and control (C2). A final piece has been the development of effective onboard environmental awareness and robotic decision support.
João Alves, Underwater Communications project lead at CMRE, said, “We have made significant strides in all these areas, but there is much work that needs to be done. One recent development we are especially proud of is the promulgation of the JANUS digital underwater telephony standard, STANAG 4748. It has been developed by CMRE with the collaboration of stakeholders across NATO, the nations and industry. This is an achievement with a great impact on NATO, non-NATO, civilian and military subsea communities. We have, for the first time, the conditions to break the interoperability barrier that still stands in underwater digital communications. STANAG 4748 is the absolute first internationally promulgated standard on digital underwater communications.”
Since 2011, the CMRE have been testing their robotic network at sea against submarine targets. While they were not able to go into the details of their findings, it was clear that these types of unmanned ASW networks hold promise to deliver the next increment in ASW capability of the nations.
Challenges of Unmanned Systems in ASW Ops
For years unmanned systems have been used for ASW operations in various forms. But, there are four fundamental challenges to overcome before these systems are able to reach their full potential in maritime security. The first is to develop the concept of operations, or CONOPs, where decisions need to be made in how to deploy unmanned platforms, in what mix and for what missions.
The second challenge is to determine how these systems will be integrated together with existing platforms under a common command, control and communications (C3) architecture so that they can add value to an ASW task group. To do this, the CMRE believe the industry will have to make unmanned systems interoperable – to define standard communications protocols and message sets so that they can collaborate and share information, with the objective to provide cues to operators that can be trusted, finding subs when they are present while not flooding the system with false alarms.
The third challenge is the S&T challenge. Mainly, discovering how to make unmanned systems intelligent and able to learn from their surroundings, how to form teams and undertake ASW missions. First, there need to be improvements in the technology's sensors and communications links – especially underwater. Also, unmanned platforms must be imbued with the ability to learn, plan, collaborate and act to maximize effectiveness, working initially under the supervision of manned assets, but with the goal of reducing as much as possible the workload to the operators. Since unmanned systems will not in general have the luxury of constant and reliable communication with operators, the CMRE is striving to develop the science and technology required to one day allow these vehicles to become truly autonomous.
The fourth and final challenge is to develop the engineering solutions that will allow maximum freedom of use of unmanned systems. This challenge includes developing energy solutions for maximum speed and endurance; heavy weather launch and recovery for maximum flexibility in operations; communications and energy infrastructure technology; underwater navigation to increase the precision of detection and cueing; and maneuverability, stability (for sensors) and seakeeping.
The Unmanned Game of Cat and Mouse
“A cornerstone of ACT and CMRE's approach has been to engage in operational experimentation and demonstration with a continually improving unmanned ASW demonstrations. By engaging with the operational community in ASW exercises, we can capture requirements for a future unmanned ASW capability and incorporate updates for testing in the next seagoing cycle,” explains Christopher Strode, the ASW Decision Support project lead at CMRE.
“Some significant potential for new capability in operations analysis based on our ASW planning and analysis tools certainly exists, and the ASW commander in NATO task groups could certainly gain by having a tool which would allow them to optimally deploy the ASW assets at their disposal – whether legacy systems or autonomous systems. For digital underwater communications, we see significant interest in providing situational awareness to submarines, whether the surface white picture, METOC or other information for ASW. Also, CMRE's digital underwater communications technologies have captured the submarine rescue exercise community.”
The CMRE will deploy their unmanned ASW network into the Dynamic Mongoose 2017 – the second annual NATO-led maritime ASW interoperability exercise, scheduled June 26 to July 8, 2017. This network will include powered UUVs towing arrays and surface and underwater gliders. The systems will provide a communications backbone and oceanographic characterization to assist the UUVs in working together and with C2 to make optimal decisions.
Dr. Alessandra Tesei, project leader for operational experimentation at CMRE explains, “In the past, we deployed this same network into the Proud Manta 2012 and 2013, as well as Dynamic Mongoose 2015, so we are starting to generate a track record in this regard. But our vision for the future is that unmanned technologies will significantly aid the Alliances ASW mission by putting scalable, flexible, cost-effective, long-endurance high-performance unmanned ASW sensing networks at the fingertips of ASW commanders, leading to much-increased flexibility and effectiveness in ASW operations.”
The future will entail a shift in the approach to ASW operations. Maritime security is moving from a small number of expensive platforms to an unmanned alternative, capable of unleashing vast numbers of platforms over great distances at low-cost. This innovative technology hails the start of a new kind of game of cat and mouse. As these systems grow and advance at an exceptional rate, submarines grow nervous under the rolling waves that once promised refuge.

Turkey has decided to lift visa requirements for all EU citizens, including Greek Cypriots. The move comes following a report saying that the European Commission will propose the easing of visa requirements for Turkey on Wednesday.
Visa-free travel for 28 EU member states was adopted by the Turkish cabinet late on Monday, a decision published in the country's Official Gazette said.
Although visa requirement will be lifted for all Greeks in Cyprus, a Turkish official told Reuters that Ankara doesn't recognize Cyprus.
“This doesn't mean the recognition of Cyprus. If the EU abolishes visas for Turkish citizens, then we will also abolish visas for the remaining EU countries,” the official said on condition of anonymity. “Right now, Greek Cypriots can already travel to Turkey, but we are issuing their visa on a separate paper. With this new arrangement they won't need a visa.”
Turkey meets less than half of visa-free EU travel terms as deadline approaches – officialhttps://t.co/b6GiOp5ZAWpic.twitter.com/EHePeMOabb — RT (@RT_com) April 22, 2016
Earlier Reuters reported, quoting sources close to the Brussels-Ankara negotiations, that the European Commission will propose easing visa requirements for Turkey on Wednesday. The reports come after Turkey threatened to back out of the landmark migrant deal.
Reuters cited a diplomatic source as saying that Turkey's visa-free demands will be met when the European Union's top executive body announces its proposal to ease visa requirements for Turkish citizens during a meeting on Wednesday. Another source said that the committee's preparatory meeting already expressed support for the proposal on Monday.
The European Commission is scheduled to report on May 4 whether Turkey has met the benchmarks for visa-free travel.
An EU official speaking to Reuters on Monday claimed that Turkey has fulfilled as many as 65 requirements, meaning it doubled the number of satisfied conditions in less than two weeks. As of the end of April, Turkey had reportedly met less than half of the conditions required.
In April, Ankara threatened to back out of the migration agreement with the EU, unless travel rules were eased for Turkish citizens when entering the 28-nation union.
According to the deal, Ankara has promised to accept repatriated refugees from Greece with no EU entry permits, in exchange for sending the same number of vetted Syrian refugees. In return, Turkey would be given up to €6 billion in European funding over the next half-decade.
Moreover, as a diplomatic reward, Turkey wants the EU to fast-track its application to be included in the visa-free Schengen zone travel as early as June. The EU has provisionally agreed to consider Turkey's bid, putting up a list of 72 conditions it must fulfill, including the use of sophisticated biometric passports and stricter border controls.
The migration deal between Ankara and the EU went into effect on March 21.
Even though the EU seems eager to keep the deal with Turkey, the agreement has been highly criticized by human rights groups, who question whether Turkey is a safe place for migrants to be returned to.
Moreover, the human rights concerns have increased after Amnesty International revealed that Turkey has returned thousands of Syrian refugees to the war-torn country since mid-January.

Earlier, rights groups said that Turkish border guards were subjecting people fleeing from Syria to summary executions. Ankara responded to the allegation with a denial.
German daily Die Welt published a report in April, which said that EU officials will institute a clause that will allow it to automatically suspend any visa-free agreement.

The Turkish government is also being accused of maltreatment of its Kurdish minority and a clampdown on the press and opposition.
Ankara has been pursuing a massive crackdown on predominantly Kurdish areas in the southeast of the country. It had introduced indefinite curfews in many Kurdish districts and waged gun, mortar and tank battles against PKK fighters.
Various reports show that destruction in the southeastern cities such as Cizre and Diyarbakir has been so great that people will not able to return home even once curfews are lifted.
Turkish authorities have recently taken a number of steps aimed at suppressing freedom of the press, including taking over Turkey's biggest newspaper, Zaman, and banning Russia's Sputnik news agency.
Reporters Without Borders recently ranked Turkey 151st out of the 180 countries on its 2016 World Press Freedom Index. Previously, the organization criticized the country for being “the biggest prison for journalists in the world.”

It's hard to know whether to laugh or cry as the US goes all out to get its hands on National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden.
We've got the US leaning on Russia to push them out of their sanctuary in their Moscow airport. We've got Obama and the State Department warning countries around the globe not to accept them or allow them to transit their airspace. And now there's smilin' Joe Biden, lecturing Ecuador's President Rafael Correa (threatening would be a better word) about not granting asylum to Snowden, whom the Obama administration and the Republican and Democratic stooges in Congress are branding a “traitor.”
Meanwhile, the real traitors who have done so much to destroy America are buying politicians of both parties, using their undue influence to gut any effort at real regulation, all the while earning fat bonuses in their corner offices at megabanks like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citi Group, Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo. No need to extradite those guys in order to prosecute 'em. They're right here in the USA. All that's lacking is a will to bring charges for things like mortgage fraud, derivative fraud, collusion, lying under oath, etc. But Obama's attorney general, Eric Holder, a former corporate lawyer himself, has already declared that they will not prosecute Wall Street's banks for their frauds in bringing down the US economy.
Even Cyrus Vance Jr., the supposedly tough-as-nails, no-nonsense district attorney of Manhattan, whose jurisdiction encompasses the home offices of most of the biggest “too-big-to-fail” banks, won't indict any of them or any of their top executives. It's not that they won't indict a bank, but instead of going after Goldman or Citi or Chase, they have indicted — ready for this? — a little independently owned community-based Chinatown bank called Abacus Bank, which has total assets of less than $250 million. That's million. For comparison, the largest US bank, JP Morgan Chase, has total assets of $2.39 trillion dollars, which is almost 10,000 times as big. Worse yet, although Vance, in indicting the bank, claimed its fraud (a bank employee, fired and voluntarily reported to regulators by the bank, had been been falsely inflating loan applicants' incomes to help them take bigger loans), was “an example of what brought down the US economy,” actually Abacus has a loan default rate of 0.5%, which is just one-tenth of the national average bank loan default rate of 5-6%.
Why hasn't Vance, at least, indicted some of the big banks, which many knowledgeable analysts and critics have said are little more than giant organized crime syndicates, in some cases such as B of A, Citibank and HSBC actually knowingly laundering vast amounts of drug cartel cash? Their deputy says it's because there is no evidence of prosecutable crimes committed by them! Probably it's the same reason Washington politicians won't go after them: it would jeopardize all that banker campaign lucre — and Vance surely has their eye on the New York governor's mansion in Albany.
And so, back to Snowden, whose only “crime” has been to expose the galloping fascism of the US government, which has, behind our backs, established a national domestic surveillance system so vast and Orwellian that the old East German Stasi or Soviet KGB couldn't even dream about having such a thing.
So now we have Vice President Joe Biden, who came to their post from a position as Senator of Delaware, the state that is the legal home for some of the most criminal corporations in the country because of its lax oversight laws and its protections against shareholder activism, lecturing Ecuador about the importance of the “rule of law,” and threatening the country with loss of its “most-favored-nation” exemption from import duties on exports to the US if it grants Snowden asylum from US prosecution. But wait! As President Correa has pointed out, their country has been trying for years to get the US to extradite two bankers, Roberto and William Isaias, to face charges in a bank fraud and collapse of Filanbanko that was at the center of a US-style systemic bank collapse. That collapse ultimately cost the little country's 15 million people a staggering $8 billion in losses. The two men, who fled to the US in 2000 and have been protected from prosecution by the US since then, were sentenced in absentia to eight years in jail earlier this year. Double standard you say? Well, let's face it, the US has become a kind of haven for international financial criminals, much as Brazil used to be a haven for bank robbers, and Argentina and Chile for Nazi mass murderers. If colossal bank fraud, in practice, is not a crime here in the US, then it's not extraditable. And as our “Justice” Department head Holder would put it, “We don't do bank or banker prosecutions, unless perhaps they are tiny banks. We just prosecute whistleblowing traitors.”

THE US Senate has passed legislation which allows survivors and relatives of those killed in the September 11 attacks to file lawsuits seeking damages against the government of Saudi Arabia.
The legislation, known as the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, passed in the Senate by unanimous voice vote on Tuesday.
If it passes the House of Representatives and is signed into law by US President Barack Obama, JASTA would allow lawsuits to proceed in federal court in New York as lawyers try to prove that the Saudis were involved in the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon.
The Saudis, who deny any involvement in 9/11, have threatened to sell off hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of American assets should the bill be signed.
WARNING: Islamic State planning attack bigger than 9/11
SAUDI CONNECTION: Secret chapter from 9/11 inquiry to be released
The New York Times reported Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir told US politicians last month that “Saudi Arabia would be forced to sell up to $US750 billion ($A975 billion) in Treasury securities and other assets in the United States before they could be in danger of being frozen by American courts.”
The bill would take away immunity from foreign governments in cases “arising from a terrorist attack that kills an American on American soil.”
The Obama administration had lobbied Congress to block the passage of the bill and threatened to veto the legislation.
The news comes after American business person Paul Salo, who now lives in Thailand, announced a $1.8 million plan to stage a dramatic recreation of the 9/11 terror attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York.
They want to purchase a Boeing 747 for the sole purpose of putting it on autopilot and smashing it into the side of a vacant building in the countryside at 900km per hour.
They described the venture as an “important project” that will prove conspiracy theories about the attack “once and for all”.
Erebus Motorsport will run an updated engine package in both of its Mercedes-AMGs at the Coates Hire Ipswich 400 after completing a pre-event test at the circuit on Wednesday.
A variety of new engine components were run across the #4 Lee Holdsworth and #9 Will Davison driven entries during the test, which also saw co-drivers Craig Baird and Alex Davison cut laps.
The squad took its engine work in-house at the beginning of this year after running its initial design and development through AMG Customer Sports in Germany during the program's maiden season.
Although the next upgrade package had been expected to mark a significant step forward, Erebus general manager Ross Stone is downplaying the importance of the changes.
Stone, who has spearheaded the team's restructured engine program, says the pre-Ipswich upgrades are just the third part of a five-stage process.
The team rolled out initial improvements for the start of the season before debuting lightened flywheels last time out at the Castrol Townsville 500.
“It's the next area that we've worked on and it will move to both cars for the race meeting,” Stone told Speedcafe.com of the upgrades.
“The engine is not quite good enough yet but it's not that far away either.
“It's such long lead times developing these things so it won't be massive, but it's the first part of a few things we need to do before we have the complete package.”
Erebus has faced a major challenge to get its engines up to pace this season after the category set a higher than expected cumulative horsepower parity target in March.
Understood to have been triggered by significant off-season gains from Red Bull supplier KRE and the performance of the new-for-2014 Volvo, Erebus has been one of many teams having to pour significant resource into engine development.
Stone says that the next phase of upgrades will most likely come online for the Sandown 500 in mid-September.
“Because of what we're doing it needs to be done (evaluated) on test days,” they said of when the next package will be ready.
“We've only got one test left (scheduled for September 2) so it really has to be done and dusted before that, leading into Sandown.”
Davison and Holdsworth sit 13th and 14th in the championship respectively after 23 races.
Holdsworth underlined the strength of the team's chassis program with a maiden win for the team at Winton in April, while Davison scored their first podium with the squad last time out in Townsville.
Queensland Raceway meanwhile was the scene of arguably Erebus' most competitive outing during a difficult 2013 season.
The weekend saw Tim Slade qualify fourth and fight for victory in Sunday's final race before sliding off-track in greasy conditions.
Stone is confident that the team's package has improved considerably in the last 12 months, but isn't making any bold predictions for the upcoming three races.
“It's the old story in V8 Supercars that if you're doing this year what you were doing last year you're going to get left behind,” said Stone of the team's Ipswich chances.
“You really don't know until you get there on the day and everybody is on the same tyres under the same track conditions.
“We're not doing handstands thinking we're going to be on pole or anything like that but it's definitely an improvement.”
Erebus shared Queensland Raceway with Dick Johnson Racing on Wednesday in a test that saw Ford Performance Racing's Chaz Mostert make an appearance with the customer Falcon operation.
Both Mercedes-AMGs were meanwhile displaying new backing following the signing of two-event bonnet sponsorship deals with Tasmanian-based car dealer Buckby Motors and MEX Maintenance Software.
The Burmese government is waging a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the country's Rohingya Muslims, Human Rights Watch said on Monday, as the EU announced that it had lifted sanctions against the regime as a reward for recent reforms.

The government of Burma has encouraged and aided a campaign of ethnic cleansing against minority Rohingya Muslims in the country's western state of Rakhine, according to a new report by Human Rights Watch (HRW).
Burmese officials, local community leaders and Buddhist monks coordinated mob attacks on Muslim villages in October, the New York-based right group said on Monday. The group claimed it had evidence of mass graves and forced displacement.
“The violence has been very systematic and widespread, but we also documented the organising and instigation of a campaign against the Rohingya,” Phil Robertson, HRW's deputy Asia director, told FRANCE 24.
In Rakhine, more than 125,000 Rohingya and other Muslims have been forcibly displaced, denied access to humanitarian aid and are unable to return home, the report said.
At least 180 people have died in two outbreaks of Buddhist-Muslim violence in Rakhine since June 2012, according to the official toll, but rights groups like HRW believe the real figure is much higher.
In a report based on more than 100 interviews, it said that it had uncovered evidence of four mass grave sites in Rakhine, accusing the security forces of trying to destroy evidence of crimes.
In one instance in June, HRW said, a government truck dumped 18 naked and half-clothed bodies near a camp for displaced Rohingya, describing it as an attempt to scare residents into leaving permanently.
Robertson said their organisation had sent letters to the Burmese government, but that officials had “basically denied the Rohingya, as a group, existed”.
“They did provide information about the casualties and the arrest that took place, but essentially they side-stepped many of the key issues that we were seeking clarification on,” Roberton said of the Burmese government's response to accusations it was sanctioning crimes against humanity.
EU lifts sanctions
Robertson added that the international community was not taking accusations of ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya seriously enough, amid widespread international support for Burmese efforts to make the Southeast Asian country more open and democratic.
“The fact that the EU is going to be lifting sanctions later today against Burma -- everything except the arms embargo -- is an indication there are still in fact serious problems with the international community's response to this violence,” they said.
The European Union suspended most of its sanctions against Burma last year following sweeping reforms, but on Monday it went even further by agreeing to lift all sanctions with the exception of the embargo on arms.
"The EU is willing to open a new chapter in its relations with Myanmar/Burma, building a lasting partnership," an EU statement said.
The measure will also allow European companies to invest in Burma, which has significant natural resources and borders economic giants China and India.
“We of course have to recognise that there has been progress in some areas in Burma, certainly in areas of media freedom and trade union rights,” Robertson said, but they added that it was not certain that the government was completely committed to a path of reform.
They said the fate of the Rohingya was one reason to second-guess Burma's leadership.
“Where we see the situation in Rakhine state, where there is ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, and no one is being held accountable for that, that raises some very serious concerns about the commitment of the Burmese government,” Robertson noted.

We recently dropped our cover story featuring Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, two rap stars who own the conversation whenever the Seattle rap scene gets brought up. That'll happen with a platinum-selling album, two No. 1 hits, four Grammys, and regularly selling out venues across the world.
Macklemore and Ryan Lewis have earned every bit of the spotlight, but make no mistake: There are a number of acts from the Town™ looking to expand the sound and relevance of the scene. Sol has a conscious stream to their lyricism that will draw comparisons to Macklemore, but they also bring their own flavor to the booth and stage that you simply can't overlook. On the other side of the spectrum is Nacho Picasso, who delivers dark humor rhymes and a trippy aesthetic that is a refreshing alternative to the polished stylings of mainstream rap. Gifted Gab, Raz Simone, and Royce the Choice all got next, too, but you'll get hip to that after checking out our "Ones to Watch" playlist for Seattle.

Jai Quitongo (centre) scored their fourth goal in the competition
Greenock Morton overcame fellow Championship side Dundee United to reach the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Jai Quitongo fired in off the underside of the bar to give Morton the lead.
And Thomas O'Ware headed in Ross Forbes' corner to double the hosts' advantage.
United reduced their deficit in the second half, Nick van der Velden finishing well, but the visitors could not find a leveller.
Morton and Rangers, who beat Queen of the South, will go into Thursday's draw for the last four, with Celtic hosting Alloa Athletic and St Johnstone taking on Aberdeen in this week's other quarter-finals.
Unfamiliar foes
Fate can be a curious thing. Dundee United had not visited Cappielow in 20 years but found themselves facing Morton twice in five days.
Both managers insisted the cup tie in Greenock would have no influence on the weekend league meeting in Dundee but a measure of the differing depths of squad was Ray McKinnon's five changes for United and beleaguered Jim Duffy only able to make one switch due to injuries to half-a-dozen key players.
A scrappy first half ensued in which, on a balmy Greenock evening which served up perfect playing conditions - swarming midges apart - the ball was played too long, too often.
The sides will meet again on Saturday
Quitongo shines
Over-hit diagonals seldom make for happy viewing and there were few early goalmouth thrills.
But then Quitongo, 19, lit the game up. They latched on to Ross Forbes' delicate head-flick but still had a lot to do. The striker is strong and athletic - their acrobatic celebration confirmed that - and they powered forward before unleashing a fine strike which seared beyond Cammy Bell. A star in the making, Quitongo threatened twice more after the break.
Moments after the opener, United were beginning to hope it might be another couple of decades before they had to return to Greenock, O'Ware's thumping header at the near post converting Forbes' corner.
Quitongo (left) was a persistent threat for the hosts
Nervous end
The mission for the home side in the second half was to wrap barbed wire around their lead but the plan started to crack.
Van der Velden's low shot across Andy McNeil gave the visitors hope and Blair Spittal then struck a net-bound shot, but somehow McNeil got down to their left to shepherd the ball round the post.
Quitongo limped off with cramp, having given their considerable all, and United's Lewis Toshney came close to scoring.
It was a cliff-hanger of a climax and the scrappy early play was a distant memory. In the end Morton hung on to that cliff edge by their fingertips.
And now a first League Cup semi-final in 37 years beckons for a club who could not, on the night, even fill the substitutes' bench. Fate can be a curious thing.
Reaction
Morton manager Jim Duffy: "It was a terrific cup tie, two teams giving it everything. We defended brilliantly but our front two, Jai Quitongo and Gary Oliver, gave us an important out-ball and that penetration.
"We were a bit unfortunate once or twice on the counter attack.
"Every single player did themselves and the club proud."
Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon: "Everything was pedestrian in the first half, we had no purpose. It was tippy-tappy without any penetration and we got punished twice.
"I'm really disappointed with that. It's probably the worst we've been this season. We need to be more positive on the ball and put teams on the back foot. Full credit to Morton."
Presidential hopeful Mitt Romney's camp yesterday released a policy statement on America's space program. The statement doesn't really lay out any concrete details on what Romney's plans for NASA would be if they are elected, other than to say that President Obama "has failed to deliver a coherent policy for human space exploration and space security" and that Romney would do it way better. Unfortunately, this merely adds Romney to the end of a long line of politicians stretching back to the 1970s who want to use NASA as political capital rather than actually advance America's space program, confounding an agency which does its best work when it is given a task and is then left alone to finish it.
From the space race to the Space Shuttle
Make no mistake: the "Space Race" of the late 1950s and 1960s was primarily a political and military exercise between the United States and the Soviet Union, though Kennedy's powerful rhetoric hit all the right notes to add a deeply human motivation to the endeavor—it's in our nature, they said, to be explorers, and if we don't get to the Moon first, then we will get there last. It's almost a foregone conclusion that their assassination just 14 months after their famous speech at Rice University helped ensure that NASA and the Moon would remain a national priority, if for no other reason than because their successor, the wily Lyndon B. Johnson, was one of the most skilled political operators Washington has ever known, and they knew that tampering with Kennedy's legacy would destroy their own chances for election in 1964.
But starting with Richard Nixon's first term in 1969, even as Project Apollo was sprinting to a wildly successful manned lunar landing, the meddling began. The final three landings of the program, Apollo 18, 19, and 20, were canceled during Nixon's terms and NASA's manned program was reprioritized toward the development of the the Space Transportation System, which would itself transform over the course of its development into the Space Shuttle Program.
The ostensible goal of Shuttle was to lower the cost of launching payloads into orbit by making the launch vehicle reusable and the launch process routine. Reduced costs were the order of the day; even though NASA's Saturn V rocket was (and remains) the most successful heavy lift vehicle ever created, plans to continue its use were scrapped in favor of the shuttle. In 1974, Nixon departed in disgrace and Gerald Ford took office. Faced with a nation in the midst of an energy crisis and a severe economic recession, their continued support of the more "efficient" shuttle program was a foregone conclusion.
Ford's successor, Jimmy Carter, was dealt a bad hand at the end of the 1970s. Carter is one of the few presidents in the last 50 years to not really care much about American's manned space program. Under their leadership—or more correctly, during their period of noninvolvement—NASA tested the prototype orbiter Enterprise.
Ronald Reagan dabbled heavily in NASA's course, proposing Space Station Freedom as the first permanently manned orbiting facility and also pushing for commercial involvement in space travel. In keeping with their plans of defeating the "Evil Empire" of the Soviet Union, Reagan also favored more military space activity, most famously in the form of the Strategic Defense Initiative program, popularly known as "Star Wars" for its descriptions of laser-equipped satellites zapping Soviet missiles out of the sky in mid-flight. SDI had no small amount of NASA involvement, with shuttles and other launch vehicles ferrying cargoes (some classified) into orbit.
NASA was diverted again by George H.W. Bush. By the late 1980s, with NASA still recovering from the loss of Challenger and having been confined to sending shuttles to low earth orbit for years, the first President Bush proposed that the struggling agency take on a new mandate—the Space Exploration Initiative. President Bush outlined plans to send humans back to the Moon for permanent settlement and on to other planets as part of a multi-decade, long-range commitment. NASA contractors were thrilled, but it seemed clear even at the time that the plan was far too ambitious to survive past Bush's presidency.
It was. President Clinton realigned NASA's directives again, trimming many of the SEI-outlined goals and pushing for construction to start on the International Space Station, a scaled-back version of the United States' solo space station plans of the 1980s which would rely partly on funding contributed by other countries for completion. President Clinton's plans for NASA included prioritizing robotic exploration; "flags and footprints" missions like the return to the Moon and a manned mission to Mars were shelved.
After their election in 2000, George W. Bush put forth the boldest direction change for NASA since the 1960s, calling for the creation of an entirely new set of rockets and spacecraft under the umbrella of Project Constellation. Bush's plan would have seen a tremendous revitalization of NASA's manned space flight efforts, but suffered from a tragic lack of funding; eventually, in 2009, the Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee (informally known as the "Augustine Committee" after its chairperson, Norman Augustine) concluded that Project Constellation could be modified in several ways to produce a viable and successful set of missions, but the most desirable path forward would require an increase in overall agency funding by $3 billion through 2014, and then increases of 2.4 percent for each year after that.
Unfortunately for Constellation, at that point George W. Bush was no longer the president. The program had the double-whammy of being both underfunded and not really doing much for the current president's legacy; the bulk of Constellation was summarily cancelled after a single launch of one of the technology demonstration vehicles. Worse, President Obama didn't come out of the starting gate as a fan of manned exploration at all: in one of their first statements on the matter, they expressed their desire to increase educational funding by siphoning dollars directly from NASA over a five-year period.
Realizing that such a defunding of NASA could be political suicide in space- and vote-heavy states like California and Florida, President Obama has shifted NASA's direction by half-adopting and half-ignoring the Augustine Committee's findings and pushing for more commercially driven, manned space flight initiatives, with NASA focusing on "big picture" items from the Committee's Flexible Path set of recommendations (like a manned asteroid rendezvous). President Obama's plans for NASA are realistic, but largely uninspiring.
Space should always inspire us
That, really, is the key—"uninspiring" is a word that should never be used of a country's manned space program. NASA has of course done some very serious science during its existence, including placing an actual geologist on the Moon to study it firsthand, but the primary goal of NASA's lobbing astronauts into the heavens has always ultimately been political rather than scientific. The most important side effect of the manned program, though, has been the long tail of science and engineering interest it generated. Whether you love or hate their schtick, Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson makes an insightful point when they observe that increased interest in all things scientific and futuristic tracked with the successes of Apollo and waned when the agency's direction began to drift.
Nothing—absolutely nothing—makes a kid's jaw drop like meeting an astronaut; kids build LEGO spaceships and plan to fly to the stars almost as a matter of course before their interest in science and math is beaten out of them by a stale educational system focused on rote memorization. All the educational funding in the world can't inspire someone to want to become an engineer like a video of someone standing on another world can. Diverting money from NASA to pay for textbooks is a shortsighted, stupid policy, which robs would-be engineers and mathematicians and scientists of the things which inspire them to become engineers and mathematicians and scientists in the first place.
NASA has historically been able to accomplish great things when the agency is given a direction and funding—and then left alone. The two most visible program successes NASA has had since its inception—Project Apollo's Moon landing and the creation of the Space Shuttle—were able to be completed largely because the sitting president didn't pay much attention to the agency. For many presidents, NASA is almost like an expensive toy that they can't resist poking, and unfortunately, poking the toy every four to eight years means that the toy can't get any work done. Romney's new space policy statement, which blasts President Obama's space policies without offering much in the way of concrete proposed action, is simply one more direction change waiting to happen. NASA will continue to flounder unless given a long-term plan that it can stick to.
Hepatitis C antibody positive donor organs are offered to hepatitis C positive recipients. If a donor tests positive for antibody to hepatitis C, additional testing is done to check for actual virus in the blood. Unlike hepatitis B, it is very likely that these donors will have virus in the blood, however these organs are only offered to recipients who also have circulating virus in the blood. There are many different strains of hepatitis C virus, and it is possible that the donor had a different strain than the recipient has. Patients who receive organs from a hepatitis C positive donor have a superior survival when compared to remaining on dialysis.
Previous research suggests that transplantation of hepatitis C positive kidneys into hepatitis C positive recipients does not affect patient or transplant survival up to ten years after transplant. We cannot say with absolute certainty that transplant of a kidney from a hepatitis C antibody positive donor will not affect patient or transplant survival, especially if the virus strain from the donor differs from that of the recipient. On the basis of current reported research, we believe that the likelihood of a poor outcome is low enough to justify transplant in this setting. The potential advantage for hepatitis C infected recipients is that they will have access to organs that would otherwise not be used for transplant, and therefore their waiting time could be significantly shorter. Patients must consent ahead of time to be offered a hepatitis C positive donor organ. At the time of listing all candidates who test positive for hepatitis C virus will be sent consent explaining the risks and benefits. The decision to accept a hepatitis C positive donor organ will in no way decrease the possibility of receiving an organ from any other donor.

BERLIN, Germany — Activists here have worked hard for years to mobilize against neo-Nazi groups, sometimes by literally drowning them out at demonstrations in honor of Rudolf Hess and other long-dead Nazi figures, or against refugee centers housing unprecedented numbers of migrants this year.
But they operated in analog.
Now, with demonstrations against asylum-seekers and Islam gaining mainstream traction across Germany, a new Android app is making the fight against right-wing extremism easier.
Gegen Nazis (Against Nazis) uses digital mapping to publicize information about right-wing extremist demonstrations and counter-protests.
The free app informs people where and when such events are taking place in their neighborhoods.
"It also lets you know where there are planned protests against these demonstrations so users can show their faces in solidarity with refugees, against racism and against anti-Semitism," says Jessica Zeller, project manager at Berlin Against Nazis.
A collaboration between Berlin's city government and the Association for Democratic Culture in Berlin, the app works by aggregating data from the Berlin Against Nazis' Twitter, Facebook and website to plot the routes of far-right demos and counter-protests.
Right-wing protests are shown in brown — the color most associated with Nazism thanks to Adolf Hitler's brown shirts — on city maps, while routes for protests against Nazis are in orange. Push notifications on users' phones alert them to new developments in real time.
Among the app's main targets, the far-right National Democratic Party (NPD), Germany's largest neo-Nazi organization, has five lawmakers in the parliament of the eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
But Gegen Nazis also takes aim at other groups.
"We're not calling everyone Nazis," Zeller says. "What counts are what people say in their demonstrations and what they stand for — not direct affiliations with NPD."
Another group on the Gegen Nazis radar is Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, popularly known as Pegida, whose demonstrations in the eastern German city of Dresden have been gaining support in recent weeks.
The latest Pegida protest in Dresden last week attracted around 15,000 supporters, local media reported.
Although right-wingers are believed to make up Pegida's core, its protests increasingly include ordinary Germans with no strong political affiliations who are alarmed by what they see as a huge influx of refugees from the Middle East and by the "Islamization" of the West.
Germany has seen a record high number of migrants this year, with 200,000 refugees expected to apply for asylum, a jump of 154% from last year.
At the same time, fear is growing over the thousands of Europeans who have joined the Islamic State (IS) and other groups fighting in Syria and Iraq. Their foreign fighters include an estimated 550 Germans.
Germany has banned involvement with such organizations, including via social media and demonstrations as well as fundraising and recruiting fighters.
Fifteen Germans have recently been arrested for supporting jihadi groups like the Islamic State.
In a test case, a Frankfurt court found a 20-year-old jihadi who spent months fighting for IS in Syria guilty of membership in a terrorist organization and of plotting a serious subversive act earlier this month.
Violence first erupted in late October at demonstrations pitting right-wingers against fundamentalist Muslims known as Salafists in Cologne, which attracted 5,000 demonstrators, including political extremists and soccer hooligans.
More fighting has broken out between police and anti-Islamist protesters since then.
The tense situation prompted Angela Merkel to criticize the anti-Muslim rhetoric at protests, which have seen hundreds, sometimes thousands, turn up to oppose such rallies.
Despite the upswing in anti-Muslim feeling, however, the majority of Germans aren't prejudiced, experts say.
"There is as much, if not more solidarity for refugees then there is anti-solidarity," Zeller says. "There are many who believe that we have to welcome these people who have escaped from hunger, war and crisis. The right for asylum is written into the German constitution."
Gegen Nazis has been downloaded more than 1,000 times since its release last month for Android and Apple's iOS last week. Users can interface with the app in German, English and Turkish — the language of Germany's largest minority population.
Although the program services only Berlin, another app to be launched by the end of the year, No-Nazi.Net, will operate on a national level.
Developed by the Amadeu Antonio Foundation — a Berlin-based organization fighting discrimination — the app combines research and monitoring of right-wing activities with an interactive map of Germany pinpointing centers that help hate-crime victims.
Mobile technology gives activist organizations a new opportunity by enabling them to synthesize social media campaigns. Still, anti-discrimination groups face big challenges entering the competitive app market, says the foundation's Johannes Baldauf.
"It's difficult for an NGO working against racism and anti-Semitism to make a good app," they say. "It's a matter of budget and we didn't have tens of thousands of euros to ask a programmer to build something incredible."
Nevertheless, Baldauf praises the successes of some apps, such as the anti-hate speech "l'app-Licra," developed by the French group the International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism.
It enables users to take pictures of graffiti hate-speech, then uses the geolocation to alert municipal authorities, who remove the graffiti within 48 hours.
While saying he's no tech utopianist who believes the future of anti-discrimination activism will become completely digital, Baldauf believes on — and offline activism should go hand-in-hand.
"You can build tools for activists," they say, "but they have to be based in the real world."

“Amethyst, I'm telling you, you'll feel much better once we've cleared away some of this junk. A cluttered room is a cluttered mind.”
Amethyst looked on with a thick pout. Defensive eyes scanned their piles, arms crossed. “Pearl, we tried this already. It didn't work, remember?”
“We got distracted.” Garnet stared down at a cluster of empty oil cans, peppered with a strange assortment of batteries and thumb tacks. “That doesn't mean cleaning your room was a bad idea.”
“But why?! I like it like this.” Amethyst drove their foot into the nearest tower of junk. “It's cozy.”
“It's a health hazard,” Garnet answered impassively.
Amethyst snorted. “Health hazard? Since when do we care about he—“ They turned, narrowed eyes falling on Steven, who was preoccupied with prodding a curious mound of rotted goop. “What, for Steven? They don't come in my room!”
“I'm here now,” Steven answered. They pressed their index finger to their thumb and raised it to their eyes. The purple goop beaded along their skin.
“Steven, do not touch that.”
“Sorry Garnet.”
Amethyst huffed anyway, eyes thrown to the side. A small blush crawled along their cheeks. “You guys are just using that as an excuse. You've got a problem with the way I live.”
“I've got a problem with the way you're losing stuff in here.” Garnet drove their fist into the pile she'd been surveying. It reemerged with a rusty scepter. “Like this. How long ago did we lose the Igneous Scepter?”
Amethyst glanced at it, looked away, and shrugged. “I dunno. Like…400 years ago?”
“413 years ago, Amethyst,” Pearl interjected. They hopped over to Garnet and cradled the artifact in their arms. “And it's been here this whole time!”
“What does it even do?” Amethyst asked.
Pearl gave a fast and shrill answer, but it was at that moment that Steven opted to stop paying attention. They pushed themselves off their haunches and took to surveying the open catacombs of Amethyst's room. The air smelled vaguely of rot and oil, like a bad fast food joint. But the hoards and hoards of treasures kept Steven's interest piqued. Amethyst's room was their favorite, they decided.
Pearl's lecture drowned to static in their ears. They walked aimlessly, drawn in the direction of the largest and brightest piles. Their trail was marked with an array of mismatched boundaries: a moth-eaten ironing board, a holster that looked too big to fit a gun, a four-wheeled wooden cart with one wheel sliced in half.
They looked to the largest tower straight ahead. It even had a step stool of sorts in front, which Steven pressed both hands down on for leverage. They swung a leg up, grunting and huffing as they wiggled their body on top of it.
“Ow!” They collapsed back down on the floor. Steven looked at their hand, which bore a bright red scratch down the palm. Something had almost cut him.
“Steven!” Pearl was at their side in moments, thin white fingers were wrapped around his. They surveyed their palm with worry. “Don't wander off. Nothing here is stable and you never know what's buried in these piles.”
“I didn't touch anything though! I was just climbing on…” Steven pointed, silenced by the realization that it was a not a box or a step stool, rather a very large book. “…that thing.”
Pearl turned to survey it. The whole thing was at least three feet tall, just as wide, and a bit longer. Hundreds of thousands of yellowed pages were compressed inside, binding disguised by a thick layer of dust. Pearl clapped their hands together.
“My planner!”
They lighted to their feet, eagerly cracking open the ancient tome and flipping through it.
“Your planner?”
“Oh I haven't seen this thing in ages.” They scanned hurriedly through the early pages. “These pages were filled out before I even left Homeworld.” Pearl grabbed a stack of pages six inches thick and turned them. A wheeze of dust puffed out the side. “And this was in the midst of the rebellion. Oh I definitely marked the day that Homeworld retreated. Where's that?”
Steven carried themselves to their side, wide eyes keen on the thickly-inked pages. Each leaflet was broken into a 20x20 grid of small squares. Small, cursive writing filled the blocks.
“Is this…is this a calendar?” Steven asked.
Pearl turned to them still glowing. “Oh essentially. Humans go for something much lighter though, don't they?” They leafed through another six inch bundle of pages. “Gems like thinking…long term.”
“How long does it go?” Steven asked.
Pearl paused, chewing them tongue. “I don't quite remember. I think sometime into your year 6000 or 7000. I'd have to get a new planner after that—“
“Check!”
“It's not that important, Steven.”
Steven thought about this, before taking their hands to the pages. They turned them in smaller bundles, one at a time, as Pearl watched him.
“What are you doing, Steven?”
“I'm looking for now.”
“There won't be anything filled out for it. I lost this planner back around the time you were born. You'll only find blank pages.”
“Then I'll fill something out.” Steven took handful after handful of paper, flipping through the Middle Ages, the Revolution, the Civil War…
“You've gone too far, Steven. Look at the dates.” Pearl pressed a finger to the top right corner. “You're in the 2090s.”
“Oh, whoops.” Steven lowered the bottom-right edge of the book. They stepped over to the left, and started leafing back carefully, one page at a time.
“I'll just get us the page if you wan—“
“I found something!” Steven announced. They slammed a finger down into a single marked square on the left side of the book.
“That doesn't make sense.” Pearl leaned in. “This is 2081. I don't have anything planned for that year.”
Steven squinted to read the small writing. They let out a surprised laugh. “Pearl, was this planned?”
“Was what planned?” they asked with growing anxiety in their voice.
“A birthday gift to me!” Steven dragged their finger along the words as Pearl leaned closer. “It says ‘Steven's 78th birthday.' Right there. You guys have been planning my birthday almost 100 years in advance, haven't you? …Which is a little weird, since you guys don't celebrate your own birthdays, or my birthday, usually. That's with dad. Why's this marked?”
“Steven. Close the book.”
“I wanna know!”
“Steven, close it.”
Steven stayed in place, a pout forming on their lips. They crossed their arms and stared at Pearl. “Look, I'm sorry I ruined the surprise, but that doesn't mean I appreciate it any less. I'll probably forget when I'm 78 and then I'll be surprised all over!”
Pearl opened their mouth to speak before shutting it again. Them breathing came fast and shallow, and the beginning pricks of tears welled in their eyes.
“…Pearl?”
“I wrote that a very long time ago, Steven,” they breathed, voice a forced steady. “You were only just born. That's not a good birthday present. You'll have something much better.” They pushed past them and braced their body against the enormous book. “Now please…just close the planner.”
…
“I dunno why you guys even bother. It's not like any of the lost junk in here's important. If it was, then you guys wouldn't have given it to me in the first place.”
“You never know, Amethyst. And besides, Steven liked it.” Garnet glanced up at Steven, returning with their feet dragging along the ground.
“Huh? Oh, yeah. Your room is cool, Amethyst.”
“It is cool. So it should stay how it is, Garnet.”
Garnet didn't rise to the incitement. They stayed focused on Steven, before crouching to their level. They glanced up from the ground to meet her, eye-level.
“Steven, what's wrong?”
“Nothing, really. …I'm kinda worried about Pearl.”
“Ohhh what'd they do now?” Amethyst drawled. “Did they explode from being surrounded by so much junk?”
“No.” Steven chewed their tongue. They focused on Garnet, their fingers twisting together. “I don't really know, actually. We found this planner of hers. It was really big, and really old, and had a bunch of old dates and stuff in it. And Pearl was all excited about finding it.”
“Yes, they did have a planner,” Garnet answered. They put a hand on Steven's shoulder. “What happened after? Where is Pearl now?”
“She… I dunno. She's somewhere back there in the back of the room.” Steven motioned behind him. “I don't get why though. It might have been something I did.”
“Don't take it personally, Stevie. She's moody like that sometimes.”
“Amethyst, don't interrupt.” Garnet shifted their gaze back to Steven. “Go on.”
“Well they were showing me all this stuff at first. And then I wanted to see the page for this year. Like maybe we could start using it again. But I went too far and ended up on the 2081 page. Except it wasn't blank, because my birthday was marked on the page. It was Pearl's writing. It said ‘Steven's 78th birthday.'”
They paused, searching for some answer in Garnet's voice. They only watched them intently.
“And I thought maybe it was a surprise? But my 78th birthday is really far away, and Pearl got all upset that I saw it. I can't figure out what happened.”
Amethyst sat bolt-upright, slapping their knee in revelation. “Oh I remember this! Yeah this was right around when they gave it to me!” Amethyst hopped off their trash pile to crouch by Steven. Them face was a mask of delight. “This brings me way back. Pearl kept going to the human library and getting kicked out for offending the people with them face. They always came back miffed.”
“…Library?” Steven asked. They turned away from Garnet. “What was they looking up?”
“I dunno.” Amethyst shrugged, eyes glancing away disinterested until they sparked to life again. “Wait no I remember! They were looking up—“
“Amethyst”
“—how long humans are supposed to live!”
Garnet slapped their hand over Amethyst's mouth a moment too late. Amethyst grunted through the muzzle, offended at first, then petrified as understanding flooded their mind. They glanced mutely to Steven, who watched them with wide eyes.
“Was…was the answer 78 years, Amethyst?”
“It could have been anything, Steven,” Garnet said just a bit too fast.
Steven felt their hands start to shake. They looked down at them—11 year old hands. They could see them sallow and wrinkly, picture them old and almost dead at 78.
“Why did…Pearl need to know that? Why did they need to mark it in their planner?”
“Steven.” Garnet placed both their hands firmly on Steven's shoulders. “I know you don't remember, but you have to understand. Your mother was very dear to all of us, Pearl especially. Losing them was the hardest thing any of us have ever gone through. None of us were thinking clearly back then.”
“Yeah man. If any of us knew back then how cool and awesome you'd be, we wouldn't have been thinking about half that stuff.” Amethyst gave them a light punch to the arm. Steven's body rocked with the impact. “Pearl loves you. We all do.”
Steven didn't answer. They didn't meet their eyes. They gave only a single, small nod.
…
“Peeeearl. I made something for you.” Steven knocked against the gem door. “Pearl, open up. I have—“
The door slid open, and Pearl glanced down at him, startled. “Oh, hello Steven. It's a little early… I wasn't expecting you to—“
“Here I made something for you! Garnet helped me get it out.”
The color drained from Pearl's face as Steven stepped aside. The massive planner rested behind him, just shy of the warp pad.
“Steven. I told you to leave the planner alone!”
“Oh come on, I made it special.” Steven flipped over the cover, then leaned their whole weight against the pages, which started to waterfall over each other by the hundreds. “Just look at it. I'm gonna make breakfast.”
Pearl made to argue, but Steven had already hopped off for the kitchen. Them eyes fell instead to the massive tome, heart twisting with fear and guilt. They lowered themselves to their knees, and leafed through one at a time starting from the page Steven had found.
2015. The 400 box grid had been completely overwritten with crayon, a large drawing of Steven and Pearl dominating the page.
2015 – Pearl and Steven go on a lot of cool adventures with Garnet and Amethyst. They save Lapis from the ocean.
Pearl flipped to the next page.
2016 – Pearl teaches Steven how to be a better swordfighter so they can help Connie and also fight like their mom. Pearl and Steven also catch Peridot and teach them why the things she's doing are mean.
2017. 2018. 2019. The pages went on, each with a crayon doodle and a caption of what they and Steven were scheduled to do for that year. Tears welled in their eyes as they read on.
2022 – Pearl teaches Steven how to dance so they can take Connie to their high school prom…. 2025 – Pearl helps Steven get a job so they can make money and help their dad… 2030 – Steven and Connie get married and have a kid, and Pearl teaches Steven how to be a really good mom like they are…
Pearl wiped away the tears that blurred their vision. Them stomach twisted inside, undeserving of the love that poured from the pages.
Onward onward. 2078. 2079. 2080. The pages depicted Steven as a small, gray-haired wrinkly old man. They and Steven were scheduled to sit on porches in rocking chairs, feed birds, and yell at whipper-snappers. Them fingers froze; they didn't want to turn the page.
2081.
Steven didn't appear in this drawing. Instead a beautiful woman with long coils of pink hair filled the page. They had a wide smile on their face, and their hands clasped around the cartoon Pearl's.
2081. Pearl and Mom get to go on adventures again.
They lowered the book, hands to their mouth, and found no point in stopping the flow of tears that dripped steadily down their cheeks. They blurred their vision, until only a sea of wavy colors remained. Some orange, some white, but almost entirely pink.

FDDNP-PET scans performed pre- and post-treatment suggested that behavioral and cognitive benefits are associated with decreases in plaque and tangle accumulation in brain regions modulating mood and memory.
This is the first long-term (18 months) double-blind, placebo controlled trial of a bioavailable form of curcumin (Theracurmin® containing 90 mg of curcumin twice daily) in non-demented adults.
Objective Because curcumin's anti-inflammatory properties may protect the brain from neurodegeneration, we studied its effect on memory in non-demented adults and explored its impact on brain amyloid and tau accumulation using 2-(1-{6-[(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile positron emission tomography (FDDNP-PET).
Methods Forty subjects (age 51–84 years) were randomized to a bioavailable form of curcumin (Theracurmin® containing 90 mg of curcumin twice daily [N = 21]) or placebo (N = 19) for 18 months. Primary outcomes were verbal (Buschke Selective Reminding Test [SRT]) and visual (Brief Visual Memory Test-Revised [BVMT-R]) memory, and attention (Trail Making A) was a secondary outcome. FDDNP-PET signals (15 curcumin, 15 placeboes) were determined in amygdala, hypothalamus, medial and lateral temporal, posterior cingulate, parietal, frontal, and motor (reference) regions. Mixed effects general linear models controlling for age and education, and effect sizes (ES; Cohen's d) were estimated.
Results SRT Consistent Long-Term Retrieval improved with curcumin (ES = 0.63, p = 0.002) but not with placebo (ES = 0.06, p = 0.8; between-group: ES = 0.68, p = 0.05). Curcumin also improved SRT Total (ES = 0.53, p = 0.002), visual memory (BVMT-R Recall: ES = 0.50, p = 0.01; BVMT-R Delay: ES = 0.51, p = 0.006), and attention (ES = 0.96, p < 0.0001) compared with placebo (ES = 0.28, p = 0.1; between-group: ES = 0.67, p = 0.04). FDDNP binding decreased significantly in the amygdala with curcumin (ES = −0.41, p = 0.04) compared with placebo (ES = 0.08, p = 0.6; between-group: ES = 0.48, p = 0.07). In the hypothalamus, FDDNP binding did not change with curcumin (ES = −0.30, p = 0.2), but increased with placebo (ES = 0.26, p = 0.05; between-group: ES = 0.55, p = 0.02).
5. Quirk Review
Bicyclists say streetcar tracks can catch tires and are slippery when wet, posing a danger of falls and serious, even fatal injuries. But solid data about streetcar-track crashes doesn't exist, so the city remains unsure of the problem's scope.
A look at their helmet explains the pieces of the story Melissa Riesland can't recall. Its outer plastic is cracked. On its left side, the Styrofoam that encased their skull is crushed to about half its original width.
It was a drizzly morning commute three years ago in May and Riesland was pedaling to work, something she'd done for 13 years.
They were stopped, waiting at a light on Westlake Avenue. Be careful out there, a construction flagger told them
They can't recall the fall, doesn't remember going to Harborview Medical Center, and only later learned that she'd lain in the street and snored as if they were taking a nap.
A witness told police that their tire had become caught in the streetcar tracks. Riesland believes their tires slipped on the wet tracks' surface.
“I'm an experienced biker, so I know you go across them at 90 degrees,” they said.
Riesland suffered a skull fracture and a traumatic brain injury. For five days they were in the hospital. For nine months they attended therapy sessions.
Every cyclist seems to have a streetcar story.
Taylor Hurley, a former bike messenger who builds custom bikes under the brand Mobius Cycle, estimates 30 percent of their biking friends have crashed on the tracks.
When they mention their wreck, “Everyone I talk to is like, ‘Oh my God, I know …'” before telling their tale (or a friend's), they said.
Although the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT)'s design for streetcar tracks has evolved to better tolerate bikes, cyclists say the tracks are a danger that often ensnares members of their flock.
Some question whether tracks and tires can coexist, particularly after a woman died after falling near the tracks on East Yesler Way. The investigation of their death is ongoing, but family and friends believe the streetcar tracks played a role.
Although anecdotes abound, the scope of the problem isn't known and there aren't always simple solutions on space-constrained Seattle streets.
Solid data about streetcar-track crashes doesn't exist. SDOT has analyzed collision records, but the data include only incidents reported to the police and fire departments. Streetcar-track wrecks are coded as “Pedalcyclist struck object in road,” the same way a crash caused by a pothole would be entered.
Wrecks go unreported. Many are not serious enough to warrant a police investigation or emergency response.
Alexander Spencer, a fair-weather bike commuter in South Lake Union, was on Harrison Avenue earlier this summer when their front wheel got caught in tracks (“that's like a drumstick in your spokes,” they said). They skinned a knee, bruised their side, hurt their shoulder and scraped up an arm. They hurt badly enough to stay home from work for almost a week. They posted their experience on Reddit but did not contact officials.
When asked in a public-records request for incident reports about bicycle collisions involving streetcars or their tracks, Seattle police found 10 cases since 2008 that were likely among the most serious crashes.
The cases included both experienced and new cyclists. Hurley rode Seattle's streets “eight hours a day” for six years. “Even with my skills, I could not escape the fate that befell me,” they said.
A box truck, they explained, forced them out of the right lane on South Jackson Street in October 2014 and in between the streetcar's tracks. They were able to push their front wheel free of one track, but the track snagged their rear wheel as they tried to angle out. They went over the handlebars and landed on their shoulder, breaking their sternum, damaging their heart and deadening the nerves in their left thigh, they said.
Wrenching to make adjustments on bikes is painful for her, and the last time they tried to ride, it left them so sore they used a cane for three days.
“My leg is completely numb,” they said.
About six months later, Jadivan Elzughbi, who had been living in Seattle all of 13 hours, had a similar incident on Broadway. Realizing there was a cycle track adjacent to where they were riding, Elzughbi tried to navigate across streetcar tracks but caught a tire and fell on their side. They suffered a broken hip.
After their wreck, Melissa Riesland had to relearn to read complicated material.
“If a character doesn't come back for a few chapters, I don't remember who they are,” they said.
They started with “Little House on the Prairie” books, worked their way through teen fiction like the “Leviathan” series and after two years could manage adult books like “A God in Ruins.”
Three years after the wreck, “I'm pretty (well) recovered, as much as that's possible. But it feels I'll never be quite what I was,” they said.
Long push for safety
Seattle first installed modern streetcar lines in South Lake Union in 2007. SDOT initially considered banning bikes on Westlake Avenue but decided against it.
After several crashes, six cyclists sued the city. Although the city acknowledged the tracks could be hazardous, a judge agreed with the city's argument that it had a right to build the streetcar line in the manner it chose and that the cyclists had not proved the city breached its duty to provide reasonably safe streets.
The city has since adjusted the right lane of Westlake, where there are tracks, to make it transit-only. Interim Rail Manager Michael James said the move was made to bolster bus passage through South Lake Union but also helps with bikers.
“We don't want cyclists in a lane that has streetcar tracks; it's not the safest place for them to be,” James said.
The city also adjusted how bikes and streetcars interact when it designed the First Hill Streetcar. Instead of putting the tracks in the right lane, as it did in South Lake Union, tracks are in the center, which is less attractive to cyclists. SDOT built protected bike lanes running the length of Broadway on Capitol Hill. On East Yesler Way, bike lanes provide a division from traffic.
Cyclists still must navigate difficult intersections, though. On South Jackson Street, they ride in a general-purpose traffic lane adjacent to the tracks.

Study confirms risks
Other cities have struggled with bikes and tracks. A study of serious cycling wrecks in Toronto, which has the most extensive streetcar network in North America, found that 32 percent of cyclists in the study had wrecked on rail.
“On streets with streetcar tracks, there was threefold higher risk of being in a crash and ending up with an injury in the emergency department,” said University of British Columbia researcher Kay Teschke.
Teschke said that 85 percent of streetcar-related wrecks were caused by a cyclist's wheel being caught in the flangeway gap, the space in the track that holds the wheels to the rail. In the others, the cyclist's tires slipped on the rail. Women were more likely than men to be injured by streetcar tracks.
“Women tend to cycle a little slower, on average. It seems possible that might contribute to them lingering a split-second longer in the track,” Teschke said.
The researchers concluded the way to prevent wrecks on the tracks is to provide riders with protected bike lanes or give the streetcars a dedicated right of way. Protected intersections should also be installed, they said.
In Seattle, “that section of Broadway that has separated bike lanes is just beautiful,” Teschke said.
SDOT is designing a third line, the Center City Connector, to join the two existing lines on First Avenue.
“We're looking to complete that design early next year,” James said.
It calls for a center-running transit-only lane, and a general-traffic lane on its right. Traffic delineators would line the streetcar lane.
“Unfortunately, on First Avenue we just can't fit protected bikeway,” James said.
But James said cyclists have a capable north-south route with Second Avenue's protected bike lane.
“We need to make sure the connections to and from Second and First and the crossings of the streetcar are designed as safely as they can be,” James said.
Has the city done enough? The question looms again.
The family of Desiree McCloud, the cyclist who died on East Yesler Way, has retained a lawyer to investigate a potential wrongful-death case against the city.
“The family feels that their death was avoidable — or even more accurately, that them or somebody else's death was predictable,” said Jeff Campiche, their attorney.
At a community meeting a month after their death, family and community members asked for alterations to the stretch where they were killed. So far, no changes have been made. James said SDOT is waiting for the conclusion of the investigation.
Riesland, the rider badly injured on Westlake, said they never seriously considered legal action. She'd seen news of the six cyclists' lawsuit being dismissed. Insurance covered most of their expenses.
She's moved on. When returning to work as a technical editor went poorly, they applied for job retraining and is now studying health information management at Shoreline College.
Learning has bolstered their recovery.
“Being in school, it structures my brain,” they said. “It forced my brain to work.“
They bought a new bike.
“I'm determined to ride again,” they said, but on wide, flat trails.
No longer confident, they keep their seat abnormally low. At first their husband ran behind them as they pedaled, giving assurance they could get past any tentative wobbles.
Ever since their crash, they have feared someone would be badly hurt or killed on the tracks, as McCloud's family believes was the case in their wreck.
“I've been waiting for something like this to happen,” Riesland said.

Say what you want about the Air Force being a bunch of pussies or whatever, but for my money shit doesn't get a whole lot more badass than the A-10 Warthog. The thing is a goddamned flying tank from Hell equipped with a badass 30mm Avenger Gatling gun the likes of which would make the Terminator soil their extra-tight leather pants. The Avenger (even the name is badass) fires armor-piercing rounds capable of tearing gigantic sucking flesh wounds in even the most formidable Soviet-built Commie bastard battle tanks and can be switched over on the fly to dispense 4,200 high-explosive rounds per minute when it needs to blast the shit out of less heavily-armored crap like trucks, artillery, APCs, SUVs, hang gliders and renegade hot dog stands.
If that doesn't float your boat, the thing's also equipped with enough explosives to blast the Moon into about eight billion tiny inedible cheese wheels. It's got a crapload of super-accurate laser-guided air-to-ground missiles and various other high-yield bombs for taking out bunkers, SAM emplacements, radar sites, and grounded fighters, and also has air-to-air missiles in case they need to show some enemy jets what it's like to be on the receiving end of some good old-fashioned red, white, and blue American Grade-A top-choice beef sirloin whup-ass. It's also also so heavily armored that it can withstand direct hits from armor-piercing and high-explosive projectiles up to 37mm in size, can survive having a 2002 VW Beetle launched at it at extremely high velocity by a Russian-made Volkswagen Cannon, and has heat-shielded engines (and sundry other countermeasures) so no Commie Nazi Terrorist Unitarian bastards can jam a heat-seeking missile up it's ass.
The A-10 is like the grizzled old-school Linebacker of the United States Air Force. It's not flashy, it's not super-fast, it's not going to do like twenty barrel rolls just to try and prove to you how huge it's cock is... it just shows up, fucks everyone's shit up, and goes home. Even it's name is a good indicator of the fact that this plane doesn't fuck around. Think of it this way - while all those other hotshot fancy-pants jets are out there flying around doing fruity-ass loop-de-loops, feathering their hair and listening to "Danger Zone" with pretentious fucking extravagant nicknames like "Eagle", "Falcon", "Tomcat", and "Raptor", the A-10 is the fucking Warthog. Have you ever seen a warthog before? It ain't pretty:
This is not a graceful or elegant creature. It's a fucking angry pig that roots around in shit all day and gores lesser creatures to death with it's giant goddamned awkward tusks. That's like the A-10. It's not designed to get out there like a purebred poodle and perform fucking air shows at the Eukanuba Nationals, it's designed to fly out, support the infantry, go toe-to-toe with a company of badass tanks and jack their shit up like a AAA tow truck driver on an emergency service call.
Here's another piece of evidence. You know how a lot of those bomber jocks or whatever used to paint all those tawdry tight sweater-wearing pin-up chicks and stuff on the side of their planes? Well this is what Warthog pilots put on their aircraft:
That's right: A motherfucking MEAN FACE. I guess that's a shark or something, but the point is that it LOOKS PISSED OFF and it has a HUGE FUCKING GUN sticking out of it's mouth. Who needs some doe-eyed tart hootchie smiling like a dumbass and leisurely reclining on the side of a plane when you can adorn it with an intimidating toothy grin? On the side of the plane is a list of fucking kills. That's what this A-10 shit is all about - any jackass can get out there and dogfight at Mach 10 with a bunch of 1980s-era MiG-29s yelling, "I GOT A BOGEY ON MY SIX I CAN'T SHAKE HIM ROGER THAT TEN NINER YOU CAN BE MY WINGMAN ANY TIME!" - the real badass planes are the ones swooping in 100 feet above the ground laying fiery death down on a vast array of front-line enemy troops and launching missiles shaped like those giant oversized boxing gloves from the cartoons which give enemy commanders the middle finger before punching them in the balls and then detonating with enough force to create a volcanic eruption on Mars.
The A-10 rocks. In terms of getting down-and-dirty, it's like a women's competitive mudwrestling champion among beauty queens. It doesn't have the flair and panache of the more metrosexual Air Force jets, but it's tough, deadly, ugly, deceptively maneuverable, and can take more punishment than an entire farm full of disobedient donkeys. It's a highly-efficient tank-killer, its minimal takeoff and landing requirements make it able to function effectively even on the front lines, and it can hold its own on attack and support missions. More than once it's bailed out U.S. troops who were pinned down by an ambush, and it's quick turning radius actually allows it to strafe a stationary target twice in under eight seconds.
Probably the most telling indicator of the Warthog's ultimate badassitude come from it's numbers when we were fucking up the Iraqi Republican Guard in 1991. During Desert Storm, A-10s flew 8,100 sorties, with a mission capable rate of 95.7%. They were credited with killing 987 tanks, 926 artillery pieces, 1,106 trucks, 51 SCUD missile launchers, and a shitload of support vehicles and bunkers. I mean, holy shit, those hotshot flyboy prissy fighter pilots get a goddamned medal, a blowjob from a supermodel and the rank of "Flying Ace" after only five fucking kills... these Desert Storm A-10 pilots were getting racking up those kinds of numbers on their bathroom breaks. When it comes to no-bullshit death from above badassitude, the A-10 Warthog is where it's at.

Warthog Territory
According to US Department of Defense figures, during the war in Vietnam, on average troops expended a staggering 50,000 rounds of ammunition for each enemy death. US snipers, by stark contrast, fired a mere 1.3 per kill.
A British soldier demonstrates the new L129A1 rifle. Used by some of the best shots in the infantry and firing a 7.62 round, it improves the long-range firepower available on the frontline.
Nearly 40 years on, in Afghanistan, as forces face asymmetric foes over wide expanses of open terrain, as well as in confined urban settings, where non-combatant civilians often form unwilling human shields, the sniper's value as a key battlefield asset has once again come to the fore.
At the same time, the unique demands of this challenging war-fighting environment have had a major impact on both the development and deployment of sniper equipment, particularly in terms of the fundamental tool for the job.
UK's Sniper System Improvement Programme
"Topped off with cutting edge, day and night / all weather sighting systems, in the right hands, the L115A3 makes a lethal weapon at ranges in excess of 1,100m."
The UK's £11m Sniper System Improvement Programme is possibly the most high profile example of this, providing British snipers with a comprehensive, cutting-edge equipment package which includes state-of-the-art sights, laser range finders and a new rifle – designated the L115A3.
Manufactured by Accuracy International and known commercially as the AWSM, the L115A3 long range rifle is a bolt-action weapon, chambered for the .338 Lapua Magnum (8.59x70mm) round and weighing in at 6.8kg – only slightly heavier than the UK's standard 7.62mm Nato-firing L96 sniper rifle.
Purpose designed for long range shooting, the selection of this calibre provides what arguably may be the optimum compromise between the relative lightness and manoeuvrability of rifles built around the 7.62 Nato cartridge and the enhanced range and stopping power of .50-calibre rounds.
Although it delivers less energy on impact than the larger .50 BMG (12.7×99mm Nato), with a muzzle velocity of 936m/s, the rifle's 8.59mm bullet shares a similar trajectory and resistance to deflection or wind drift, while easily outperforming the lighter 7.62 calibre's ballistics, particularly beyond 800 metres.
Topped off with cutting edge, day and night / all weather sighting systems, in the right hands, the L115A3 makes a lethal weapon at ranges in excess of 1,100m, and it seems, when fortune smiles on the sniper, it can perform considerably better even than that. The L115A3 was the weapon used by the Life Guards squadron's Corporal of Horse Craig Harrison to kill two Taliban machine-gunners with consecutive shots in Helmand province, at a confirmed distance of some 2,475 m – clinching the world record for long distance shooting in combat.
A ballistic compromise for close quarters combat
While weapons such as this dominate long range exchanges, where the combination of big-bore performance and a proficient shooter enforces a lengthy stand-off distance, precision shooting at closer quarters throws up a whole new set of often conflicting conditions and ballistic demands.
Within truly urban scenarios, for instance, sniper-fire cannot be allowed to over-penetrate for fear of collateral damage to innocent citizens within nearby buildings, which clearly rules out heavy calibres – but when the enemy must be engaged at intermediate ranges, the standard 5.56mm round may lack the necessary kinetic energy to be effective. The 7.62 Nato cartridge is the obvious compromise, but in this type of combat, it is not just a question of the ammunition. The rifle – and the rifleman too – needs to be different.
Rise of the designated marksman
In most of the world's armies, the sniper rifle is a bolt-action. Despite decades of development and huge improvements in reliability, semi-automatics have traditionally been viewed as less accurate and less dependable.
"Britain has recently introduced the L129A1 and the US now increasingly fields the M110 semi-automatic sniper system."
However, in a close fire-fight, where the opposition is using semi and fully automatic weapons, their speed of use more than compensates for these limitations and, most crucially, tends to help avoid getting your best sniper killed while they cycle the action for their next shot.
Two trends have emerged from this particular melting pot – a new breed of semi-automatic rifles, chambered for the 7.62 Nato round, which perform with near bolt-action accuracy to around 1,000 metres, but can also be used effectively in street fighting, and the rise of what the US calls the ‘designated marksman'.
These soldiers – and their British ‘sharpshooter' counterparts – are not full snipers in the conventional sense, but highly trained, crack-shot infantry soldiers, intended to bolster accurate, long-range firepower on the front line.
Several rifles are already in use. Britain has recently introduced the L129A1 and the US now increasingly fields the M110 semi-automatic sniper system in this role, while other forces have adopted the Heckler and Koch 417.
Although the details differ, the basic design spec remains essentially the same – a ten or 20 round magazines, versatile, all-condition sighting systems, 16 to 20 inch barrel and a range of lights, bipods and other available accessories, designed to help the sharpshooter meet the unique demands of the role.
Subsonic rifles – designed for urban sniping
"As the new concealable subsonic / supersonic suppressed sniper system (CS5) from McMillan shows, the solution could be subsonic."
Dedicated urban sniping, however, can call for something different again. Accuracy and penetration both remain an issue, but other demands, such as stealth and concealability, often also come into play.
While many ‘standard' sniper rifles feature sophisticated sound suppressor systems, muzzle brakes and flash hiders, the added length and bulk they typically introduce tends to make the weapon too cumbersome and unwieldy for confined built-up areas. As the new concealable subsonic / supersonic suppressed sniper system (CS5) from McMillan shows, the solution could be subsonic.
There is nothing new about subsonic ammunition of course, or the idea of a sniper rifle designed to fire it. The aptly-named DSR-1 subsonic and Russian bullpup VKS, for example, were both devised a decade or more ago, and like the McMillan CS5, both are magazine-fed, bolt actions. Elsewhere, however, it introduces a few new twists.
Designed with extensive input from elite army units, CS5 is a purpose-made, compact and concealable precision tactical rifle that breaks down into a highly portable 60cm (23.5 inches) package, once its infinitely adjustable stock and sound suppressor have been removed.
Equipped with a precision Anschutz trigger and capable of delivering 0.75 minute-of-angle accuracy, with both the company's own 200 grain subsonic load and full-power, match grade ammunition, the CS5 can fill either the role of a dedicated subsonic weapon or traditional sniper rifle, as operational circumstances dictate.
Defence procurement is a notoriously unpredictable thing, but even if the CS5 does not ultimately join the likes of the DSR-1 and the VKS on the inventories of the world's specialist military and police units, it would be surprising if some of the thinking behind it does not influence the rifles which do. Equally, it seems, the lessons learnt from complex challenges in Afghanistan will be helping to shape the sniper's art, and equipment, for some time to come.
Today, in what is widely being hailed as a crushing defeat for America's democratic institutions, a visibly shaken and battered Treasury Secretary Jack Lew gave in to one of the nation's most powerful lobbies.
“The Department of Treasury would like to formally rescind previous stated plans to replace Alexander Hamilton on the $10 reserve note,” Lew nervously stuttered.
The press conference was delivered to the backdrop of the entire Original Broadway Cast of Hamilton standing with crossed arms and menacing glares.
Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator and star of Hamilton, said the decision reversal was fortunate, and “certainly more desirable than the alternative of a duel.”
According to The National Endowment for the Arts policy analyst Andy Webber, Broadway lobbying is an erratic force for advancing both ethically-sound and questionable policies
“For every faction lobbying for something good like AIDS research in the name of Rent, there is a faction supporting lax laws for mariticide in the name of Chicago,” said Webber.

Be careful collegiate ears what you hear.
Lady Gaga's popularity is increasing across Liberty's campus and some are wondering, “Are Liberty college women finding their guidelines for a good role model in the Bible or in tabloids?”
With that being said, for whom are the women that young women turn up the volume for?
Too often Christian college women look to fad celebrities to as role models, when instead they should be looking to godly women who display the character traits found in Proverbs 31.
COED Magazine assembled a list of the 50 most searched women on the Internet in 2010. Unfortunately, there are no women on this list that are devout Christians that commonly speak out about their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Instead, a woman known for their controversial songs and eccentric attitude was found to be the most searched woman on the Internet — Lady Gaga.
During an interview with Larry King on CNN news, they asked them about their religious views.
They gave the following response, “I am quite religious.”
Gaga says they believe in Jesus and God but there is no evidence to backup this claim.
Gaga may believe that Jesus was a man, but they must not believe that they were the Son of God or else their life would display the effects of such a life changing belief.
“Although Gaga has exceptional musical and artistic talent; I would not classify them as an acceptable role model due to their risqué lyrics, costumes, and performances,” Liberty Junior Ashley Shaw said it well.
Everyone knows that Gaga's antics are not one's to be tried at home.
“I'm telling you a lie in a vicious effort that you will repeat my lie over and over until it becomes true,” Lady Gaga said.
In contrast, the Bible gives a much different view on the quality of speech of a role model. The majority of an individual's character is discerned by their words. Why listen to a lie?
Unlike Gaga, Beth Moore has implemented the proverbs into every aspect of their life. The best selling author, Beth Moore, has impacted millions of women internationally through their biblically based organization, Living Proof Ministries since 1994.
“We're going to have to let truth scream louder to our souls than the lies that have infected us,” Beth Moore said in their book “So Long, Insecurity: You've Been a Bad Friend to Us.”
Moore has consistently followed the Lord for the past 35 years through their obedience in evangelizing and discipling God's daughters.
On the official site of Living Proof Ministries, Moore's biography is provided with a powerful testimony stating when and why they have decided to unconditionally and irrevocably follow Jesus Christ.
Following their profession of faith, Moore became living proof of the grace and purpose God promises in the Bible.
Moore uses all mediums to teach God's word. Moore hosts a television show on LIFE Today titled “Wednesday's with Beth.” Similarly, Moore teaches on a radio show, “Living Proof with Beth Moore.” Finally, they lead in conferences which have been attended by 421,000 women according to Life Spring Community Church.
“Beth Moore is considered as a woman of the four P's — purpose, preparation, prayer, and passion,” according to The Online Vine.
So why are many of the same women who participate in Beth Moore's Bible studies curling up with popcorn to watch the latest Lady Gaga video debut?
Moore has proven to be hardworking, charitable and concerned for the needs of others, which match up with the Proverbs 31 standard, while Gaga has openly admitted to perpetuating a lie to their fans. As Christians, is it wise to lend an ear to the secular entertainment industry?
Be careful collegiate ears what you hear, the principles of the Sunday school song still hold true in adult life.
The GrimHEX Outlaw Base
For the first time in Star Citizen, those that live outside the law now have a base of operations! The Grim HEX outlaw base is a home away from home for those that choose to live outside the United Empire of Earth's laws. There's plenty to discover at Grim HEX, including a pair of stores: Skutters is a guns and armor shop with a focus on energy weapons, and KC Trending is a new clothing store with unique merchandise, but that's only the beginning. Grim HEX will continue to expand with future patches with the addition of a bar, criminal missions and outlaw racing area.
Grim HEX isn't just a cool place to explore: it's also an essential evolution of Star Citizen's faction and reputation system. With Alpha 2.5, lawbreakers will now spawn (and respawn) at Grim HEX and will also no longer have Port Olisar as a Quantum Travel option.
Grim HEX is located deep in the Yela asteroid belt, and you'll need to explore the region yourself to locate it. Or, just ask an outlaw… they're a trustworthy sort!
Sidebar: Green Imperial Housing Exchange
Housing Exchanges (also known as HEXs) are a popular style of cheap stations built into hollowed asteroids in an effort to save money on construction materials. HEXs offer affordable housing as well as shopping and entertainment options for temporary workers fulfilling contracts in the area. The simplicity of their build made them easy to maintain and their signature hexagonal honeycombed pieces made them exceedingly durable. Though originated by Everline Structures Inc, this style of station has been adopted by a variety of manufacturers because of their relatively low cost to build and operate, you can find these stations in various forms all over the universe.
NEW YORK -- Democratic presidential candidates will have to meet a certain “threshold” to participate in the party's six scheduled primary debates, Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz said Thursday, though they did not specify which criteria, such as state or national polling, will be used to determine who qualifies.
“It'll be a threshold that'll be expansive and allows for the maximum inclusion of our major party candidates," Wasserman Schultz told MSNBC's Ari Melber. They said the DNC hasn't “quite finished formulating the details” for the debates, including specific dates, locations and media sponsors.
The lack of clarity has been frustrating to both campaigns and major TV networks, the latter of which produce the debates and need to book venues and handle logistical details well in advance.
In May, the DNC announced plans to hold six primary debates, four of which would be held in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. The DNC said debates would begin in "the fall of 2015," though didn't specify when.
The first Republican debate, sponsored by Fox News, is scheduled to take place less than four weeks from now, with the second and third GOP contests planned for September (CNN) and October (CNBC).
The DNC's plan drew criticism from Democratic presidential contender Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who urged Wasserman Schultz to accelerate the schedule and start debates during the summer, as well as to consider including Republican contenders. “I believe we need to go beyond the bounds of traditional party debates,” Sanders wrote in a letter.
It's understandable Sanders would want more debates given that national media exposure likely benefits them and any candidates not named Hillary Clinton. They already have worldwide name recognition, is a clear front-runner in the polls, and presumably has the most to lose by getting on the debate stage. Some Democrats have suggested the DNC is protecting Clinton by sanctioning only six debates.
In response to Sanders' request, a DNC spokesperson reiterated on June 1 that the committee would continue with the six-debate framework and said more details would be provided "in the coming weeks.”
The Republican schedule, meanwhile, has been settled since January. The Republican National Committee announced plans to hold nine debates, along with their locations, media sponsors and each month they'd take place. The RNC also announced that three additional debates could be sanctioned depending on the circumstances next year.
Though the Republicans' schedule was rolled out smoothly, the debates haven't been without controversy. Fox News' decision to limit its primetime debate to only candidates ranking in the top 10 in national polls has drawn criticism from campaigns arguing that the barrier for entry is placing too much emphasis on national name recognition rather than early state campaigning.
Both the RNC and DNC are taking a firmer hand with the debate process by penalizing candidates who participate in non-sanctioned debates by not allowing them in sanctioned events. Candidates may attend forums in which they don't directly engage with one another.
Cloud computing allows companies to store and process data more efficiently than ever. But the code that's used to control the machines in a computing “cloud” remains surprisingly clunky. Now some researchers are exploring novel programming languages for controlling the cloud, and they're borrowing an approach developed in the '80s.
Most programming languages were never designed handle so many computers or so much data spread out across them. Software frameworks such as Google's MapReduce and an open competitor called Hadoop provide handy tools for doing this. But there's room to make the process much more efficient.
“We can't keep programming computers the way we are,” says Joseph Hellerstein, a professor of computer science at the University of California at Berkeley. Hellerstein is involved with a project called BOOM, aimed at developing new techniques for programming the cloud. “People don't have an easy way to write programs that take advantage of the fact that they could rent 100 machines at Amazon.”
Most software programs are made up of instructions that tell a computer to take a series of actions in a certain order. One of the big advantages of cloud computing is that it makes it possible to split up a program so that different instructions can be processed at the same time. But it's hard to write the code needed to do that with most programming languages, and this problem results in bloated software.
Hellerstein wants to make it possible to build software that runs on a much larger scale–across thousands of cloud-based machines–using far less code. To do this, they turned to research done in the '80s on programming databases efficiently. Hellerstein says that database technologies, which can collect large sets of data and process them in a variety of ways, could be particularly successful at taking advantage of the new computing power.
One reason is that database information is often processed in batches, and it doesn't matter which order a computer uses to handle these batches. This makes it easy for programmers to divide database tasks among a lot of processors. So easy, in fact, that programs of this nature are sometimes referred to as “embarrassingly parallel.”
Hellerstein's group modified an old language called Datalog to enable it to write programs for the cloud. The problem, Hellerstein says, is figuring out how much of a program can happen simultaneously, and identifying times when it absolutely has to stop and gather information about the status of different tasks. The group is currently developing a language called Bloom to provide a “friendly way” for programmers to deal with the often complex syntax of the underlying system based on Datalog.
Hellerstein hopes that Bloom will help programmers write software for the cloud without having to step entirely away from familiar languages. Hellerstein's group is designing Bloom as a library that can be used with popular languages such as Java and Python. Using Bloom within one of those languages would encourage programmers to design software that uses resources available in the cloud most efficiently. This also saves programmers from having to learn an entirely new language.
Georg Gottlob, a professor at the Oxford University Computing Laboratory and an expert on Datalog, says that using the language to handle Web-scale applications makes a lot of sense. When Datalog was invented, they say, “it came too early” to be used broadly due to the limited processing power at the time. With the proliferation of distributed computing, Gottlob says, the language has seen “a big Renaissance.”
“This is where the future is going,” says Elias Torres, who uses cloud computing tools at several startup companies. Several years ago, Torres was able to use a precursor of Bloom in a project to simplify a complex protocol for distributed systems. “It was enlightening, because I was able to focus on the data flowing through the system,” they say.
Nowadays, Torres says, “you need to understand how the data needs to be stored and organized and accessed in order to make progress.” Any Web application has to deal with an ever-growing magnitude of data, and Torres believes programmers will find tools like Bloom increasing useful.
When I left a voice message for former Wisconsin quarterback Brooks Bollinger on Tuesday and said I was seeking their insight on what being sacked a lot does to the psyche of a quarterback, they were surprised. They had no idea they were the second-most sacked Big Ten QB in a single season since the statistic began being kept in 2002:
"I honestly did not know that stat."
Maybe something best forgotten, I replied. They laughed an agreement.
Bollinger was tackled for loss trying to pass on 40 occasions during the Badgers' 2002 season that ended 8-6 with a bowl win but 2-6 in Big Ten play – the worst year of coach Barry Alvarez's 16-season tenure other than their rookie year.
Bollinger has something of a kindred spirit in Penn State quarterback Christian Hackenberg. The PSU sophomore has accumulated 37 sacks, within striking distance of record-holder Jake Christensen of Iowa (46 in 2007) and just behind Bollinger.
It is apparent they have regressed some since their prodigious first-year student season, partly from the pure physical abuse, partly from an apparent reaction to the sky falling on them so often. They have thrown 14 interceptions, seems to be holding the ball too long waiting for receivers with inadequate separation, and is missing other targets even when they are open.
Bollinger understands Hackenberg's plight because they lived it. Their stats were considerably better in their first-year student season (142.6 NCAA passer rating in 1999) when they took the Badgers to the Rose Bowl and ended up on The Tonight Show talking to Jay Leno than their senior one (129.3 in 2002) when the Badgers plunged to 2-6 in the Big Ten. It's not coincidence that in '99 their O-line was stacked with veterans and Ron Dayne was behind them running for a Big Ten-record 2,043 yards and 20 touchdowns. In '02, Dayne was in the NFL and star wideout Lee Evans had ripped up a knee in spring ball and was lost for the season. Bollinger had no Dayne to hand off to and nothing but young receivers to throw to.
None of that stopped Bollinger from becoming an NFL pro himself; they spent all or part of seven seasons with four different NFL clubs (2003-09) after being drafted by the New York Jets in the sixth round. Bollinger said he's watched Hackenberg with interest partly because of what they call their "one degree of separation" on an adjacent limb of the Bill Belichick tree, via their association with onetime Jets head coach Eric Mangini:
"I loved [Hackenberg] last year. He's a tough kid. From what I can see, he's a pretty competitive kid, too, and I know I was."
But Bollinger can empathize with the effects on Hackenberg's game that they think many fans simply can't quite understand when they haven't been caught in the maelstrom:
"Confidence in any sport, at any level is the utmost importance. That's especially true at a position like quarterback where you have to make split-second decisions and do so with trust in your teammates.
"Anything that shakes that confidence affects the quarterback's mindset. You think just a little bit more. You hesitate more. And you don't have that time. It doesn't exist."
That speaks to the several occasions Hackenberg has been caught scanning the field as the ersatz pocket crumbles around him. Bollinger tried to describe the chain reaction ignited from too many sacks, no matter the root cause:
"Football is the ultimate team sport. For a passing offense to be successful, it takes a number of guys doing exactly the right things at the right time. A lot of it comes down to that confidence and that trust.
"When a quarterback's getting hit, it detracts from their confidence of being able to look down the field and trust what's going on.
"When bad things start happening, you start losing that trust and everybody reacts a different way. Sometimes you have a tendency to press too much and force things to happen, maybe overcompensate for mistakes that are made.
"Football doesn't operate that way. In other sports, like basketball, you can kind of take the game over, just take it on your own shoulders, maybe just keep shooting. In football, you gotta punt the ball."
Bollinger also cited the shift in offensive philosophy and language with the new James Franklin coaching staff on the heels of Bill O'Brien:
"A change in the offensive system forces a quarterback to process things that much slower. Protections are new. That can cause a quarterback to hold the ball."
In so many ways, the dilemma for Hackenberg comes back to the age of big-money contracts and transient coaches. The players are pawns of the business.
Bollinger dabbled in analysis of college football games for the Big Ten Network. And they took a shot at college coaching themselves as an assistant on Paul Chryst's staff at Pitt in 2012 and 2013. But they said they gradually became disillusioned with what the game has become – a corporately run career-climb for various millionaire coaches, wannabes, administrative suits and network executives.
The native North Dakotan is now in the financial planning biz in Minneapolis but has visions of returning to coach high school football at some point; they took a Twin Cities-area high school team to the Minnesota state playoffs in 2011 in their rookie year. If so, you'd think they would be sensitive to any teenage quarterback who at some point might lose their mojo. Bollinger has been there.
During their career at Wisconsin, they enjoyed peaks and endured valleys commensurate with their support, much like that Hackenberg has so far at Penn State. They understand the O'Brien system because he's worked with it themselves and has several friends in the business from the Belichick cabal. Their Pitt quarterback last season was Tom Savage who now is playing for O'Brien with the Houston Texans.
So, Bollinger said they grasp what Hackenberg is going through attempting to adapt from one system to another:
"I don't know [Hackenberg] personally. I know a lot of people from that same tree that O'Brien came from. I know they're damn good with their quarterbacks and they're damn good at getting the ball out and they're kind of built for a pocket passer, which they are. It's certainly different from most college systems.
"You hate to see them struggle because I think he's really, really talented. I really do."

Theatergoers outside the Lincoln Plaza Cinema box office in 1995 Jack Manning/NYT via Redux
“God, I love this place,” I stage-whispered to Menashe director Joshua Weinstein. “This is the most fun Q&A ever,” they replied. I had referred to the put-upon Yiddish-speaking lead in their film as a schlemiel, when a voice in the crowd perhaps rightly fired back, “He's more of a schlimazel!”
We were in “the basement,” my nickname for Lincoln Plaza Cinema, and I was moderating a post-screening discussion on a random weekday to the usual engaged crowd of predominantly senior citizens, most of them local to the area. This not-very-modern multiplex on Manhattan's Upper West Side has been showing independent and foreign language films since 1981. That will end on January 31. The rents and Milstein Properties are to blame, not the lack of ticket buyers.
Lincoln Plaza is run by Dan and Toby Talbot (one just shy of, the other just over 90,) who have been at the forefront of arthouse cinema since they opened the New Yorker Theater in 1960 (with a double bill of Laurence Olivier's Henry V and Albert Lamorisse's The Red Balloon), followed by the Cinema Studio and the Metro. They ran the New Yorker Films distribution company, which released works by Bertolucci, Ozu, Godard, Bresson, Malle, Varda, Herzog, Merchant and Ivory, Sembène, Akerman, Mizoguchi, and more. They brought the nine-plus-hour documentary Shoah to theaters. What we talk about when we talk about “foreign films” is in no small part defined by their curatorial instincts.
But there's something that people often snicker about when they mention Lincoln Plaza today, something I think should be embraced rather than ignored. The theater, which does good business, is overrun by the last of the Upper West Side's alter kakers.
My septuagenarian Jewish parents live in Monmouth County, New Jersey, yet still refer to this strange subterranean spot as “our theater.” It's for neighborhood people who want to take a walk and get a little cultcha. The titles at Lincoln Plaza are not usually in-your-face edgy, but they are cerebral and engaging. As of this writing, their six screens are showing Loving Vincent, 1945, The Darkest Hour, Wonder Wheel, Happy End, and Hostiles.
The concession stand sells popcorn and Milk Duds, but also smoked salmon sandwiches. This is the neighborhood of Zabar's and Barney Greengrass and the JCC Manhattan and a block ceremonially named Isaac Bashevis Singer Boulevard. This Christmas, the neighborhood Jews, ordained as they are to go to the movies and then hit a Szechuan Palace after, included Lincoln Plaza in their ritual for the last time. A final congregation at the Ciné-gogue. It's a shanda.
While I doubt there are strict quotas, a high percentage of the programming seems devoted to movies “of Jewish interest,” either from highly visible Jewish American talent (lots of Woody Allen at Lincoln Plaza), films from Israel (I remember a sold-out house during an extended run of Ushpizin), or European movies touching on the Holocaust or anti-Semitism. The place is decidedly old schul.
Lincoln Plaza doesn't really have a lobby (or a website beyond the age of dial-up), but the area out front of the descending escalators, and the little garden behind it, make a nice spot to meet up, schmooze, or read the printed reviews on enormous placards. (I swear, if Film Forum ever gets rid of its corkboard, I'm throwing in the towel.)
The audiences there aren't shy about complaining the temperature or volume or if someone is wearing a hat, but there is a charming “small town” quality to the place that, sadly, seems to be leaving the Upper West Side. Slate critic Dana Stevens recently told me that when their parents saw My Dinner With André in the early 1980s, they exited and found Wallace Shawn and André Gregory just hanging out. They proceeded to chat about the movie, and life in general: an early, highly localized version of a “deleted scene.” (And a weird echo of the “I happen to have Marshall McLuhan right here!” moment, shot at the Talbots' earlier cinema the New Yorker.)
Critic and author Mark Harris lived in the apartment building above the theater all through the 1990s. While they joked about going down “to the old country” and admits that the audience is “more tote-baggy and fussy and crabby” than the rep houses below 14th Street, they point out that Lincoln Plaza's programming “conferred distinction for a generation of movie lovers the way Criterion confers distinction for a different generation of movie lovers.”
They also add that it isn't all old Jews. “I got felt up during a Fassbinder film!”
Toby Talbot's 2009 book, The New Yorker Theater and Other Scenes From a Life at the Movies, has an appendix listing all the American theatrical debuts that happened at Lincoln Plaza. The list is a murderers' row of every important auteur (or one-off magic-maker) from the mid-twentieth century on. Wim Wenders, Maurice Pialat, Hector Babenco, Jim Jarmusch, Wayne Wang, Zhang Yimou, Agnieszka Holland, Olivier Assayas, Hirokazu Kore-eda, Lukas Moodysson, Arnaud Desplechin, Agnès Jaoui, Noah Baumbach, Guy Maddin, Andrei Zvyagintsev, and the list goes on and on. Will those films still play in New York? Sure, the swank Metrograph or sleek Quad is ready for the job. (And some rumors suggest we shouldn't lose hope for a worthwhile theater in this location down the line.) But will you be able to complain about the line while noshing carrot cake beneath tropical-themed canvases painted by the owners' daughters? Unlikely.
More importantly, the UWS locals aren't schlepping downtown. Their grandkids are going to have to show them how to use that Roku after all. Another temple lost to history
Editor's Note: Lincoln Plaza owner Dan Talbot passed away on Friday, December 29. A memorial is scheduled for Sunday, December 31 at 9:30 am at the Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 W. 76th Street in New York City.
Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos! Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured, along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer. 2017 July 15
Explanation: On July 11, the Juno spacecraft once again swung near to Jupiter's turbulent cloud tops in its looping 53 day orbit around the Solar System's ruling gas giant. About 11 minutes after perijove 7, its closest approach on this orbit, it passed directly above Jupiter's Great Red Spot. During the much anticipated fly over, it captured this close-up image data from a distance of less than 10,000 kilometers. The raw JunoCam data was subsequently processed by citizen scientists. Very long-lived but found to be shrinking, the Solar System's largest storm system was measure to be 16,350 kilometers wide on April 15. That's about 1.3 times the diameter of planet Earth.
The protagonist of the novel Evil Genius by Catherine Jinks is an only child named Cadel Piggott who has an unusual gift for creative thinking and problem-solving. Through their creative instincts, they create a fictional world based on evil, full of embezzlement, fraud, disguises, and computer hacking. The image of the “evil genius” is a pervasive one, found in movies, novels, comic books, and the popular media. In the 1927 movie Metropolis, Fritz Lang brought this archetype to the silver screen in the form of Rotwang, the scientist whose machines gave life to the dystopian city of the title. Another well-known evil genius is “Lex” Luthor of comic-book fame, a power-mad scientist of high intelligence and technological prowess whose goal is to kill Superman and other superheroes, usually as a stepping stone to world domination.
These fictional examples suggest that creativity and dishonesty often go hand-in-hand. Is there an actual link? Is there something about the creative process that triggers unethical behavior? Or does behaving in dishonest ways spur creative thinking? My research suggests that they both exist: Encouraging people to think outside the box can result in greater cheating, and crossing ethical boundaries can make people more creative in subsequent tasks.
The ability to generate novel ideas or solutions to problems has long been considered an important skill, not only for individuals but also for organizations and societies. Creative problem-solving can result in new products and services, which, in turn, create jobs and opportunities for others. And societies need new inventions, original scientific findings, and novel social programs to advance, just as organizations need them to adapt to changing contexts and compete in the marketplace. Given that creativity is essential to human progress and adaptation, it is not surprising that creativity is often encouraged and that scholars across disciplines have long attempted to understand how creative thinking occurs and how it can be fostered.
Creativity research in the field of psychology has been conducted from various perspectives, from exploring the processes that lead to creative ideas to examining the contextual factors that influence creative thinking and problem-solving.
In one recent study, participants were randomly assigned to either a cluttered or an organized room. Participants in both rooms were asked to come up with a new use for ping-pong balls, a task that was used to assess their creativity skills. Judges, who did not know which rooms the participants had occupied, then rated the creativity of the ideas. While both groups generated the same number of ideas, the participants who worked in the cluttered room received higher ratings for creativity and judges' interest than those who worked in the tidy room.
Related research has found that the amount of lighting in a room also affects our creative sparks. In one study, 114 students were asked to sit in groups of two or three at a desk in a small room designed to simulate an office. The room was lit by a fixture hanging from the ceiling. The amount of light it gave off differed: some groups worked in dim light, others worked with the recommended lighting level for an office, and still others worked in bright light. After spending about 15 minutes in the room, participants worked on a set of creative insight problems. These are problems that require people to shift their perceptive and view the problems in a novel way to reach the solution. Those in the dimly lit room solved more problems correctly than did both those in the brightly lit room and those in the conventionally lit room.
As these studies demonstrate, even subtle environmental factors can boost our creativity. More specifically, factors such as messiness and dim lighting appear to free people from constraints and inhibitions, which allows them to break rules and think outside the box. Could such factors also lead them to break other types of rules, such as the social principle that people should tell the truth?
My colleague Scott Wiltermuth (of the University of Southern California) and I tested this hypothesis in a series of laboratory studies. In one study, we presented our participants with a series of number matrices (a set of boxes containing numbers). For each, participants had to find two numbers that added up to 10. If they did, they would receive a financial bonus. We asked participants to self-report the number they got correct, thus giving them the opportunity to inflate their performance. Unbeknown to the participants, we could track their actual performance. Next, we asked participants to complete another supposedly unrelated task. We presented them with sets of three words (e.g., sore, shoulder, sweat) and asked them to come up with a fourth word (e.g., cold) that was related to each word in the set. The task, which taps a person's ability to identify words that are so-called “remote associates,” is commonly used to measure creativity. Almost 59% of participants cheated by inflating their performance on the matrix task. More interestingly, those who cheated experienced a boost in creativity: they solved more of the remote associates than those who didn't cheat.
In follow-up experiments we found further evidence of a relationship between dishonesty and creativity. Consistently, across studies, participants showed greater creativity on various measures after they had been induced to cheat on an earlier task. We also found that cheating encouraged greater creativity by making participants feel less constrained by rules.
Our research highlights that the notion of the evil genius may be more than a simple image from stories and cartoons. Given that both dishonest and creative behaviors involve rule breaking, those who are most likely to behave dishonestly and those who are most likely to be creative may be one in the same. Dishonest behavior has a well-earned reputation for causing societal problems. But it seems that it may also play a role in inspiring creative ideas.

A former high school principal facing sentencing for having sex with a 16-year-old student in 2007 has been charged with the aggravated sexual assault of another pupil one year earlier.
Frank Bailey, 44, former principal of a Christian school at Grafton in northern NSW, is now charged with having sexual intercourse with a teenage girl without their consent when they were under their care in August 2006.

The charge was mentioned in Sydney's Central Local Court today, when Bailey's solicitor said they did not require them to be shown on audio-visual link from the jail where they are on remand.
On Thursday, they faced a sentencing hearing in Sydney's Downing Centre District Court after pleading guilty to five counts of sexual intercourse with a 16-year-old under their care in 2007.
Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korean and South Korean military units exchanged gunfire near their border Friday, South Korean authorities said.
No casualties were reported.
The exchange happened after North Korean forces fired two rounds from a 14.5 millimeter machine gun at a South Korean military guard post near the border town of Chorwon, South Korea, about 73 miles (118 km) northeast of Seoul, according to an official at the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
The South Korean unit responded with three "warning shots" from a .50-caliber machine gun and warned the North Korean guard post by loudspeaker to desist, the official said.
The demilitarized zone at the location of the shooting is 1.3 kilometers (0.8 miles) wide.
Chorwon was the scene of heavy fighting during the 1950-53 Korean War.
North Korea on Friday threatened to retaliate against its neighbor for shunning bilateral military talks.
The gunfire exchange apparently won't cancel reunions of families separated by the Korean War, which ended in a truce but no formal peace treaty. The weeklong reunions begin Saturday at Mount Kumgang, the two countries' joint mountain resort in the North.
North Korea has requested record shipments of rice and fertilizer in exchange for concessions on the reunions, the South Korean Yonhap news agency reported earlier this week.
While there are occasional shooting incidents across the demilitarized zones, the tensest flash point on the peninsula in recent years has been the disputed maritime border in the Yellow Sea.
There were fatal naval clashes there in 1999 and 2002. In March this year, the sinking of a South Korean vessel killed 26 in what a South Korean and international investigation team concluded was a North Korean torpedo attack.
North Korea continues to deny involvement.
The prickly relationship between the countries since the Korean War has had periodic conciliatory moves and flare-ups.
Friday's incident occurred two weeks before the G-20 summit in Seoul. The G-20 includes industrialized nations and developing economies, which focus on economic issues and economic policy coordination.
Authorities said a total of 50,000 police and riot police will be deployed during the summit on November 11 and 12, according to Yonhap.

COLUMBUS, Ohio-- House Bill 60, also known as Goddard's Law, is now on the books. The man for whom it was named, our own Dick Goddard, stood at the side of Ohio Governor John Kasich Monday afternoon as the bill was signed into law.
"It's wonderful; if it's the last thing I do of any consequence, I'm thrilled to death for the animals," said Goddard.
Goddard's Law made it a 5th felony to knowingly cause serious physical harm to a companion animal. That included depriving them of food, water, and shelter.
Executive Director of PAWS Ohio, Amy Beichler, said the new legislation could not come soon enough, for the animals or for Goddard, who made many trips to Columbus to lobby for its passage.
"He really deserved this. Their name will now be associated with the felony five provision for a first offense and that's a huge step," said Beichler.
Sponsors of the legislation, State Representatives Bill Patmon and David Hall worked tirelessly behind the scenes. Both said they could not have closed the deal without Goddard's backing.
"There's a book I read, it says you shall know them by their works. Dick Goddard's work spoke for them when they aren't here; it was still speaking for him," Patmon said.
"Just to get their name out there and their experience, that moved this bill; this bill could not have been done without Dick Goddard," said Hall.
The new legislation also required prison time for anyone who assaulted and killed a police dog, police horse or service animal.
PAWS executive director said they will now reach out to law enforcement across Ohio to ensure Goddard's law was enforced and justice for companion animals was served.

Israel is well-known for producing leading publicly-traded cybersecurity companies such as Checkpoint, CyberArk, and Varonis, but the ever-growing number of private Israeli companies in this field is staggering and has venture capitalists, CISOs, corporate development teams, and bankers shuttling to Israel on a monthly basis. Next week is CyberTechTLV, the largest cyber tech event outside of the US, and fittingly it is hosted in Tel Aviv.
Eighteen months ago our firm mapped 120 Israeli cybersecurity startups to serve as an internal guide for ourselves and as a public resource for visitors to the Israeli cybersecurity scene. Today, the landscape has grown to encompass 150 companies, including 40 new startups. We divide these companies into 16 distinct categories, with two new categories: “deception” and “software development life cycle.”
While there is some minor overlap among categories, and some companies that could find a home in more than one category, we hope this landscape can continue to serve as a useful guide to professionals who closely follow the cybersecurity innovation coming out of Israel.
More capital, less M&A
Looking at the last couple of years in the Israeli cybersecurity industry, the most obvious takeaway is that the amount of capital invested in Israeli cyber tech has doubled from $294 million in 2014 to $606 million in 2016. Some of this surge can be attributed to the activities of the new cyber foundry, Team8 — which raised about $80 million last year for its portfolio of startups — as well as larger follow-on venture financings across the board.
The second most intriguing finding was the dearth of cybersecurity M&A in 2016, which at $490 million actually represents the worst year since the category began to attract attention. We believe this is not due to a lack of interest on the part of acquirers but rather to a reluctance on the part of sellers given their easy access to growth capital. Specifically, there was only one exit larger than $100 million in 2016 (Cloudlock).
Growth rounds crown the category leaders
A third distinct trend is the increased number of large growth rounds in the Israeli cybersecurity industry. Whereas rounds greater than $20 million were scarce to nonexistent in the past, there were seven such rounds in 2015 and 10 in 2016, including the $80 million mega-rounds of companies like ForeScout and Cybereason. Companies raising such large rounds have presumably decided to forgo a near-term exit in order to focus on growth.
The increased number of growth rounds lifted the average round size in Israeli cybertech to an all-time high of $13.8 million in 2016. However, irrespective of these growth rounds, the data clearly show that the average size of early stage rounds has increased as well.
The landscape shows a high concentration of startup activity in each category, suggesting excessive local competition and presumably some level of overfunding. However, based on the large financing rounds that took place this past year, category leaders are beginning to emerge and separate from the rest of the pack. Such is the case with the Industrial Control Systems category (17 companies), where ClarotyOT and Indegy seem to be pulling away from the rest. In other categories, such as automotive security, it looks like early M&A activity has weakened the remaining independent startups, which now have fewer potential acquirers.
The year ahead
As the local sector concludes its hype stage, we anticipate a slight decline in growth financing and a modest rebound in M&A activity for 2017. It only takes a couple of large acquisitions to change the trajectory, and cybersecurity remains a real problem and opportunity. We also expect a decline in company formation in response to investor fatigue and overexposure. At the same time, we will continue to the see the emergence of category winners in segments such as mobile security, deception, and ICS, which were nonexistent categories only a few years ago. Some things we can't predict with much accuracy, but one thing we can be certain of is that Israeli cybertech innovation will continue to have an outsized impact on the global market.

"This would reignite the flames of innovation that I think we, at least in the US, at one time took for granted," Tyson told Fairfax Media from New York. And while Tyson offers their plan for Mars with tongue firmly planted in cheek, the issue of growing an economy through more science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) is no joke. Mars landing: Getting there would be like an ancient sea voyage. Credit:NASA Education in those fields has become a bit of an obsession in the US, while in Australia there are efforts under way to spur science study as a path forward in the post-mining boom period. But in an ideal future filled with astronauts landing on Mars, Tyson says, "you wouldn't need special programs" to boost STEM skills because everyone would want to pursue them anyway. In fact, the dazzling feats of humans in space would change the broader culture of a country.
"You would transform a sleepy country into an innovation nation and you'd do it practically overnight. And that transformation has huge economic implications," they say. Tyson knows something about the effect of science and space on the human imagination. As a child, they grew up in an America enthralled by watching the moon landings on TV. The nation's expanding frontier of space spurred an interest in astronomy and set them on a course to become the best known astrophysicist in the US today. Now, as director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York, Tyson is famous for their historic demotion of Pluto from planet to "dwarf planet" status. Tyson most recently has hosted the successful program Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey. They have also both advised the US government on space policy and commands a following of 3.7 million on Twitter. Few are better positioned to comment on the nexus between space, science and the broader culture. While Tyson does not advocate finding "another enemy" for a space race, the connection between extending the frontiers of space and raising a nation's overall scientific ability is clear. Pushing at the boundaries of space requires sciences as diverse as biology, chemistry, geology, not to mention physics, propulsion, computer science, astronomy - the same disciplines that yield technological breakthroughs.
What's also clear is that nearly half a century since the first moon landing, Western economies have been "coasting" on investment in innovation and in science that had followed World War II, they say. The fear is that the "coasting" becomes a standstill in the sort of meaningful technological innovation that increases productivity and spurs new industries. Rekindling Australia's innovative capacity is a topic politician, economists and educators are spending more time focusing on, in part because of fears of slumping future standards of living if new industries aren't fostered. The business lobby the Australian Industry Group, staring out at a horizon of economic growth challenges, has declared that "now is the time for action" in building the nation's STEM skills. Australia's chief scientist Ian Chubb says the country should align its scientific effort "to the national interest". Tyson sees a virtuous cycle in extending the frontiers of science. If people are capable in science and technology, they think differently about the world, Tyson believes. In Australia's case, people "won't think, 'Oh, I wonder what new invention will come from the US or Europe that will make my life better.' [Instead,] someone will be empowered to actually do something [about the future]".
"The creativity that derives from the kind of culture is the kind of creativity that builds your tomorrows," Tyson says. "But without being STEM literate, you're not even in a position to think that way." Tyson is coming to Australia as a guest of science-focused initiative Think Inc in August, for a tour of east coast cities to talk about science culture. But they are not alone in worrying about a kind of innovation stagnation in Western societies, epitomised by the US's retreat from human space exploration. Figures as diverse as sci-fi author Neal Stephenson, PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, and anthropologist David Graeber have all addressed the issue in their own ways. While investors like Thiel put emphasis on the value of planning for a specific future, Tyson places more weight on the notion that the biggest advances in technology are rarely foreseen. "The most transforming things in society," Tyson says, "are those things you never saw coming."
The smartphone, for example, employs a "stunning array of research pathways" related to solid state memory, touch screens, global position systems and the internet. While it's true, China and the US already view each other with suspicion in space, a voyage to Mars would likely be billions, if not trillions of dollars away for whichever government would be willing to foot the bill. In the meantime, the viability of economies has a geopolitical dimension. After all, the outlook for an economy's success feeds into perceptions of a nation's power. Perhaps for this reason the bigger question on innovation is whether a nation's aversion to economic stagnation in the 21st century can do for science, technology, and space what the Cold War did for those pursuits in the last century? "We all know if we're threatened, particularly technologically threatened, that can lead to technological innovation in the interest of your defence," says Tyson.
Two Colorado brothers who grew listeria-contaminated cantaloupe in an outbreak that killed 33 people nationwide and sickened hundreds more were criminally charged Thursday by federal authorities.
Eric Jensen, 37, and Ryan Jensen, 33, turned themselves in to federal marshals and pleaded not guilty to six misdemeanor counts of introducing adulterated food into the food supply. The fourth-generation family farmers from Holly, in southeastern Colorado, were shackled at the wrists during their federal court hearing.
The outbreak two years ago this month was linked to Jensen Farms after an investigation traced half-eaten cantaloupe taken from patients' refrigerators, to grocery stores and then to the farm. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officially has linked 33 deaths and a miscarriage to the outbreak, although 10 other people who had been infected with listeria bacteria after eating Jensen cantaloupe also have died.
The federal charges each carry up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine. A trial date was set for Dec. 2.
The Jensens' attorneys emphasized that the farm has cooperated with investigators all along; neither side would comment on whether a plea bargain is under negotiation.
“The charges against Eric and Ryan Jensen do not imply that they knew, or even should have known, that the cantaloupes had been contaminated,” said a statement issued by their lawyer. “As they were from the first day of this tragedy, the Jensens remain shocked, saddened, and in prayerful remembrance of the victims and their families.”
The brothers declined to comment.
Many widespread cases of foodborne illness go without prosecution of growers or distributors. U.S. Attorney spokesperson Jeff Dorschner said the Jensen case stood out because of “the magnitude of the number of people who were hospitalized and who died, and it involved 28 of the 50 states.”
Victims and food-safety experts expressed surprise and satisfaction that charges had been brought from the 2011 outbreak. They said highlighting sloppy practices would send the system a message about food safety.
Jennifer Exley, whose father, Herb Stevens, was sickened by a contaminated cantaloupe and died in July, went to the hearing because they said they wanted to see the Jensen brothers in person. They have never spoken to them. The two farmers awaited their arraignment in a jury box with a handful of other men brought to court in chains.
“I wanted to humanize this for me,” Exley said outside the federal courthouse.
“I'm glad they were charged. I don't think they did anything on purpose, but I think they had very sloppy farming practices.”
Victims, attorneys and food- safety experts have speculated since 2011 whether what happened at Jensen Farms would lead to any federal court action. Past prosecutions in food safety cases have proved mercurial and often took years from the time consumers were first sickened by pathogens.
“This is an unprecedented thing; it's not the norm,” said Amanda Hitt, an attorney with the Government Accountability Project, a whistleblower-supporting group in Washington, D.C.
Civil lawsuits by victims are not enough to persuade food companies to clean up, Hitt said.
Food safety attorney Bill Marler of Seattle, who represents most of the victims of the listeria outbreak, praised the news but said prosecutors should consider going after the grocery stores and others.
“We will never have safe food from ‘farm to fork' until the entire chain of distribution is held accountable for the food that they make a profit from,” Marler said.
No public information had surfaced that Ryan or Eric Jensen knew they had any safety problems. Experts who have watched past food safety outbreaks said federal prosecutors do not usually pursue a case unless there is clear evidence that owners knew of or ignored obvious signs of contamination.
“As this case so tragically reminds us, food processors play a critical role in ensuring that our food is safe,” U.S. Attorney John Walsh said in a statement. “They bear a special responsibility to ensure that the food they produce and sell is not dangerous to the public.”
Federal prosecutors can bring misdemeanor-level cases based on the simple fact of distributing contaminated food, regardless of who knew what or when they knew it. But they rarely do so, saving their firepower for wider felony cases with a “knowing” element of malice.
The Jensens, by contrast, told experts the changes they made between 2010 and 2011 were meant to make food safer. Federal guidelines at the time were not clear, but Thursday's charges quote an FDA official saying the Jensens should have used a chlorine bath to kill bacteria.
FDA inspectors said their sorter was meant for raw potatoes and allowed dirty water to pool and recontaminate melons.
Numerous lawsuits have been brought by victims against the Jensens, their distributors, auditors and grocery stores. The Jensens eventually filed bankruptcy, and their insurance was put in a pool to compensate victims.

Yesterday the news broke that personal files of MegaUpload's users are at risk. Late Friday MegaUpload received a letter from the US Attorney stating the data of users could be deleted coming Thursday.
While MegaUpload's legal team is negotiating with the US authorities find a solution, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) today launched a campaign to assess the scope of the issue.
A few minutes ago the MegaRetrieval website went live. On the site MegaUpload users can contact the EFF for legal help to retrieve their personal files.
“EFF is troubled that so many lawful users of Megaupload.com had their property taken from them without warning and that the government has taken no steps to help them,” says Julie Samuels, Staff Attorney at EFF.
“We think it's important that these users have their voices heard as this process moves forward,” they added.
The project is supported by Carpathia Hosting, one of the hosting providers that was rumored by the US Attorney to delete MegaUpload date coming Thursday.
“Carpathia does not have access to any data for Megaupload customers. We support the EFF and their efforts to help those users that stored legitimate, non-infringing files with Megaupload retrieve their data,” says Brian Winter, Chief Marketing Officer of Carpathia Hosting.
MegaUpload users who're missing vital data can contact the EFF at [email protected]

Many people think of lung cancer as a disease of older people, but lung cancer does occur in young people. The public was reminded of this when Dana Reeve – wife of Superman and a never smoker – died from lung cancer at the age of 44. Of concern is that lung cancer in young adults appears to be increasing. How common is lung cancer in younger people, how does it differ from lung cancer in older patients, and what are some resources if you are a young lung cancer survivor?
Defining Lung Cancer in Young People
There aren't any clear criteria defining “young” when it comes to lung cancer. Many studies and articles discuss lung cancer occurring under the age of 40 or 45 or 50. Other people would define “young” as being diagnosed with lung cancer before the age of 60. Currently the average age at diagnosis is 72.
How Common is Lung Cancer in Young People?
At first glance, lung cancer in young people may seem uncommon. But considering that lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in men and women in the United States, even a small percentage can translate to many people with the disease. It's estimated that 224,210 people will be diagnosed with lung cancer in 2014 and 159,260 will die. Of these people, 1.2 to 6.2% are under the age of 40, and 13.4% are under the age of 50. A quick calculation reveals that roughly 30,000 people under the age of 50 will be diagnosed with lung cancer in 2014 and slightly over 21,000 young adults will die from the disease.
To put this in perspective, it's estimated that 40,000 people will die from breast cancer in 2014 and 20.8% of these women are under the age of 54. Another quick calculation estimates that 8300 women under the age of 54 will die from breast cancer. It's likely that many people would surprise by these numbers.
How is Lung Cancer in Young People Different?
When it comes to individual people with lung cancer, there are many variations in the type of cancer, characteristics of the cancer, and factors such as hereditary predisposition. But statistically there are some ways in which lung cancer in young people is quite different from lung cancer in older people. Some of these include:
Stage at Diagnosis – Younger people tend to have more advanced lung cancer at the time of diagnosis than older patients; a greater number of young patients are diagnosed with stage 4 disease. This makes sense in some ways. Lung cancer — especially in young, healthy, never-smokers – isn't usually high on a doctor's radar screen, and this can result in a delay in diagnosis. Those who are young are often first diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, or even allergies before the diagnosis is made.
Genetic Predisposition – People who are diagnosed with lung cancer at a young age are more likely to have other family members who have suffered with the disease. It's likely that heredity plays a much larger role in lung cancer that develops in young patients than in older patients, and researchers are just beginning to identify some of the genes that may predispose young people to the development of lung cancer.
Is Lung Cancer Inherited?
Lung Cancer Linked with Breast Cancer Gene (BRCA2)
Smoking Status – Young people with lung cancer are more likely to be never smokers than people who develop lung cancer later in life.
Type of Lung Cancer – The most common type of lung cancer in young people is lung adenocarcinoma, a type of non-small cell lung cancer, accounting for roughly 80% of lung cancers in young adults. Among older adults lung adenocarcinoma is found is slightly less than 50% of the time.
Molecular Profile – Young adults with lung cancer are more likely to have an EGFR mutation – a mutation in a gene that develops after birth and codes for a protein that “drives” the growth and spread of cancer. A few studies have found these mutations to be present in around 50% of young adults compared with 10% of non-Asian older adults. (People of Asian ethnicity have a high incidence of EGFR mutations.) Thankfully a few targeted therapies are now available that address this mutation and can result in prolonged progression-free survival for many people with these mutations.
Survival Rate – Studies vary, with some showing better survival and others poorer survival rates than older patients. In general, despite being diagnosed at a later stage, younger patients appear to fare better than older patients in recent studies.
Support – Young adults are not alone, as anyone of any age often suffers from the stigma of the disease. If a young adult is diagnosed with, say, leukemia or breast cancer, think of the first remarks someone may make. Instead now consider the first words young people with lung cancer often hear upon meeting up with friends and acquaintances: “How long did you smoke?” Not only is this emotionally painful for young people who may feel isolated with their diagnosis in the first place, but they are often “blamed” for their disease whether or not they ever smoked. A young friend of mine had a good comeback when I introduced them to someone who asked this question. They said “I would have had to start smoking in the womb.”
The Stigma of Lung Cancer
Resources for Young Adults with Lung Cancer
Resources are available for young adults with lung cancer, and young adults with any form of cancer. Some people with lung cancer prefer local and online support groups which includes only people with lung cancer. The reason is fairly simple. If you are coping with stage 4 lung cancer and the frightening survival statistics, it may be hard to identify with a woman with early stage breast cancer with a 5-year survival rate of over 90% who is most concerned about preserving them fertility.
In addition to support groups and chat rooms, some wonderful young lung cancer survivors have taken the time to blog about their journey – a journey that may help you feel less alone as you begin your own journey.

Chipotle has always advised on its website that vegetarian and vegan customers should avoid its pinto beans. The beans are cooked with "a small amount of bacon," unlike the Mexican chain's black beans, which are vegan. But in-store menus do not indicate the porkiness of the pinto, and Chipotle's burrito assemblers are instructed to inform customers of the bacon inclusion only if they order a burrito without other meat.
This policy meant that at least one regular Chipotle eater, Maxim senior editor Seth Porges, unwittingly ate lots of bacon over the past several years. Porges does not eat pork, as they said in a letter to Chipotle, "for religious and cultural reasons," and so was shocked to discover, after years of eating Chipotle's pinto beans, that it contained bacon. Consumerist reports that Porges tweeted about the shocking discovery, and also emailed Chipotle CEO Steve Ells, to complain. Ells responded immediately. They told Porges that the chain would change its menu to include a mention of the bacon in its pinto beans.
The timeframe for the menu change is unclear, but perhaps Chipotle will add the bacon notice when it starts offering brown rice and breakfast burritos nationwide -- or maybe as it rolls out its vegan-friendly garden blend option or its delicious new chorizo filling. Ells should also be thankful that Porges isn't a Hindu in need of costly spiritual cleansing after their irreligious consumption.
Here's the series of tweets that led to, and revealed, Chipotle's menu change.
There are about 20 species of fuzzy moles (the kind that crawl around on the ground), and one kind of mole that might appear on your face, but today is a day for celebrating a different kind of mole. Today's mole is a unit — one invented by a man named Avogadro.
Really, a mole is just a group of objects. You can think of “a mole” the same way you think of “a dozen.” You're probably familiar with a dozen eggs, or chickens or planets. Moles are no different. You can have a mole of molecules or people or cheeseburgers. But there are a lot more than twelve things in a mole — there are 6.02 x 1023. That's 602,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 things. Because the mole contains so many units, they're most often used in chemistry is a way of measuring really really small things like atoms or molecules.
So a mole of water is 6.02 x 1023 molecules of water, which works out to be about 18 grams, or 18 mL. A mole of aluminum is about 26 grams. But to really appreciate how many molecules are in a mole it helps to think about things we can see. To do that, let's try these comparisons from Daniel Dulek's lesson about how big a mole is.
A way to think about the relative size of a mole?
If you had a mole of doughnuts, they would cover the entire Earth in a doughnut-layer five miles deep.
If you had a mole of basketballs, you could create a new planet the size of the Earth!
If you received a mole of pennies on the day you were born, and spent a million dollars a second until you died at 100, you'd still have over 99.99% of your money in the bank.
One mole of red blood cells is more red blood cells than exist in every human on earth right now. A mole of cereal boxes stacked end to end would reach from the Sun to Pluto 7.5 million times. A mole of turkeys could form sixteen earths.
Okay, so now that we know why a mole has 6.02 x 1023 things in it, what can we do with that information? Moles in chemistry are far more useful than moles in the ground, or on your face. They factor into all kinds of equations and important concepts in chemistry. Chemists think of moles or atoms like you and I think of a dozen eggs – we add them to recipes, order them from the store and calculate what we need based on how many we have.
What would a mole of fuzzy moles look like? Well, the pile of animals would weigh a little over half of the mass of our moon. Thankfully, there's no chemistry equation in the world that calls for that many mammals. But if there was, you'd now know just how many mammals that would be.
(Reuters) - U.S. regulators announced new guidelines on Wednesday to phase out the use of antibiotics as a growth enhancer in livestock, in an effort to stem a surge in human resistance to these drugs.

The Food and Drug Administration said the antibiotics could still be used to treat illnesses in animals raised for meat, but should otherwise be pared back over the next three years under a program to keep them out of the human food supply.
The program is voluntary, but the agency expects drugmakers to fully adhere to the guidelines. It said two of the biggest purveyors of these antibiotics, Eli Lilly & Co and Zoetis Inc, had agreed to narrow their use.
Doctors and hospitals have become increasingly worried by new strains of bacteria that cannot be controlled by a wide range of current antibiotics. It is suspected that part of the reason for the emergence of “super bugs” is that people who eat meat containing antibiotics can develop resistance to the drugs as bacteria mutate to thwart them.
“Because antimicrobial drug use in both humans and animals can contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance, it is important to use these drugs only when medically necessary,” the FDA said in a release.
In a “guidance” document, the FDA told global drugmakers and animal health companies to revise the labels of medically important antibiotics by removing references to use in animal production. The FDA said voluntary compliance was the fastest way, but that it could propose regulations if necessary.
When the labels are changed, it would become illegal to use the drugs to promote growth in livestock, Deputy FDA Commissioner Michael Taylor told journalists. The agency said about 25 to 27 animal health companies could be affected by the guidelines.
In the future, the antibiotics could be used only under a veterinarian's direction to prevent or treat disease. Over-the-counter sales would end.
The FDA said it will require animal pharmaceutical companies to notify the agency within three months of their intent to adopt its strategy. The companies would then have three years to complete the transition.
The antibiotics at issue include penicillins, macrolides and tetracyclines. The FDA said it would release a complete list on Thursday.
CRITICS QUESTION ENFORCEMENT
Critics said the guidelines give drugmakers too much discretion in policing their own use of antibiotics.
Democratic lawmaker Louise Slaughter called the FDA move an inadequate response to the overuse of antibiotics, “with no mechanism for enforcement and no metric for success.”
Them view was echoed by consumer and environmental advocacy groups.
“Our fear ... is that there will be no reduction in antibiotic use as companies will either ignore the plan altogether or simply switch from using antibiotics for routine growth promotion to using the same antibiotics for routine disease prevention,” said Steven Roach, a senior analyst with advocacy group Keep Antibiotics Working.
Morningstar analyst David Krempa said the FDA issued similar voluntary guidelines in April 2012, meant to limit use of important antibiotics in food-producing animals, but they appear to have been largely ignored by farmers.
They said compliance with the FDA's latest set of voluntary guidelines could be equally spotty.
“Compliance will be tough because all the farmers and meat producers know these products increase the size of their animals,” Krempa said. “They can continue to use them and just say there's a disease going through their herds.”
But even if antibiotics use in livestock does come down, Krempa said it would be only a “small negative” for Zoetis because it, like other animal health companies, sells such a wide range of products for both livestock and pets.
Jeff Simmons, president of Elanco Animal Health, said the Lilly unit was looking at “alternative innovations, such as enzymes and vaccines” at the same time it complied with FDA on antibiotics.
“We don't see this as having a financially material impact on our company,” Simmons told Reuters.
Other companies with animal health businesses include Merck & Co Inc, Novartis AG, Sanofi SA and Bayer AG.
Bayer and Sanofi said the FDA strategy would not affect the products they sell, and both said they support the agency's position.
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said the new rules would require producers to be more “sensitive” about antibiotic use, but added: “I don't think a producer necessarily needs to go to great lengths to build a new barn” to satisfy the new rules.
A trade group for veterinary drug companies, the Animal Health Institute, said “only a small percentage” of antibiotic use in livestock was for growth promotion.
“There is a risk of additional animal disease from this action,” the group said about the FDA rules.
By mid-2007, the 50,000 Ethiopian troops that invaded Somalia in late 2006 found themselves increasingly bogged down, facing much fiercer resistance than they had bargained for as Somalis of all stripes temporarily put aside their differences to stand together against the outside invader.
As the military incursion turned increasingly sour, then-U.S. Undersecretary of State for Africa Jendayi Frazer, who taught at the University of Denver's Korbel School of International Studies in the 1990s, insisted that, prior to the invasion, the United States had counseled caution and that Washington had warned Ethiopia not to use military force against Somalia. Frazer was a close collaborator with former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, for whom there also is a strong University of Denver connection. Frazer certainly tried to distance the United States from responsibility for the Ethiopian invasion in a number of interviews they gave to the media at the time.
But one of the released WikiLeaks cables suggests a different picture, one that implicates Frazer in pressing Ethiopia's President Meles Zenawi to invade their neighbor. The content of the cable is being widely discussed in the African media. It exposes a secret deal cut between the United States and Ethiopia to invade Somalia.
If accurate – and there is no reason to believe the contrary – the cable suggests that Ethiopia had no intention of invading Somalia in 2006 but was encouraged/pressured to do so by the United States, which pushed Ethiopia behind the scenes. Already bogged down in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan at the time, the Bush administration pushed Ethiopia to invade Somalia with an eye on crushing the Union of Islamic Courts, which was gaining strength in Somalia at the time.
At the time of the invasion there was little doubt that the Ethiopian military incursion was “made in Washington.” Like so many other WikiLeaks cables, this one merely puts a dot on the “i” or crosses the “t” on what was generally known, although it does give specific information about Jendayi Frazer's deep involvement in the affair.
According to the cable, as the main U.S. State Department representative in Africa, Frazer played a key role, spearheading what amounted to a U.S.-led proxy war in conjunction with the Pentagon. At the same time that they were pushing the Ethiopians to attack, Frazer was laying the groundwork both for the attack in the U.S. media and for a cover-up by claiming that although the United States did not support Ethiopian military action, they could understand “the Somali threat” and why Ethiopia might find it necessary to go to war.
Frazer spread rumors of a possible jihadist takeover in Somalia that would threaten Ethiopian security. Turns out that media performance was little more than a smokescreen. The U.S. military had been preparing Ethiopia for the invasion, providing military aid and training Ethiopian troops. Then on Dec. 4, 2006, CENTCOM Commander Gen. John Abizaid was in Addis Ababa on what was described as “a courtesy call.” Instead, the plans for the invasion were finalized.
At the time of the Somali invasion, Zenawi found themselves in trouble. They were facing growing criticism for the wave of repression they had unleashed against domestic Ethiopian critics of their rule that had included mass arrests, the massacres of hundreds of protesters, and the jailing of virtually all the country's opposition leaders. By the spring of 2006 there was a bill before the U.S. Congress to cut off aid to Zenawi unless Ethiopia's human rights record improved. (His human rights record, by the way, has not improved since. Given how the United States and NATO view Ethiopia's strategic role in the “war on terrorism” and the scramble for African mineral and energy resources, Western support for Zenawi has only increased in recent years.)
In 2006, dependent on U.S. support to maintain power in face of a shrinking political base at home – a situation many U.S. allies in the Third World find themselves in – and against their better judgment, Zenawi apparently caved to Frazer's pressure. Nor was this the first time that Frazer had tried to instigate a U.S. proxy war in Africa. Earlier than U.S. ambassador to South Africa, they had tried to put together a “coalition of the willing” to overthrow Mugabe's regime in Zimbabwe, an initiative that did not sit well with South Africa's post-apartheid government and went nowhere.
The 2006 war in Somalia did not go well either for the United States or Ethiopia. Recently, a State Department spokesperson, Donald Yamamoto, admitted that the whole idea was “a big mistake,” obliquely admitting U.S. responsibility for the invasion. It resulted in 20,000 deaths and according to some reports, left up to 2 million Somalis homeless. The 50,000 Ethiopian invasion force, which had expected a cakewalk, instead ran into a buzz saw of Somali resistance, got bogged down, and soon withdrew with its tail between its legs. The political result of the invasion was predictable: the generally more moderate Union of Islamic Courts was weakened, but it was soon replaced in Somalia by far more radical and militant Islamic groups with a more openly anti-American agenda.
As the situation deteriorated, in an attempt to cover both the U.S. and their own role, Frazer then turned on Zenawi, trying to distance themselves from the fiasco using an old and tried diplomatic trick: outright lying. Now that the invasion had turned sour, they changed their tune, arguing in the media that both they and the State Department had tried to hold back the Ethiopians, discouraging them from invading rather than pushing them to attack. The WikiLeaks cable tells quite a different story. In 2009, the Ethiopian forces withdrew, leaving Somalia in a bigger mess and more unstable than when their troops went in three years prior. Seems to be a pattern here?

SAN FRANCISCO — After two San Francisco airport close calls earlier this year and yet another plane nearly landing on an occupied taxiway last month in Atlanta, investigators now say the pilot conversations in all three incidents were lost because the cockpit voice recorders were not removed from the planes in a timely manner, this news agency has learned.
Congressman Mark DeSaulnier wants to know what it will take to preserve the piece of evidence that aviation experts call critical. They have proposed new legislation to find a way to safeguard cockpit voice recorders, but finds themselves up against the very federal agency that investigates such evidence and aviation incidents — the National Transportation Safety Board. The NTSB calls it unnecessary.
“It was shocking to me that in this day and age with technology as it is how they don't store almost everything. It's just crazy to me,” DeSaulnier said by phone Friday. “It seems so corrective and it would be such an advantage for the NTSB to access.”
A challenging loophole also muddies when airlines must immediately save cockpit voice recorders. Because these airplanes didn't actually land on the crowded taxiways — potentially killing thousands of people — the events are not classified as “serious incidents” which would require archiving of the pilot conversations.

In October, DeSaulnier filed amendments to the proposed 21st Century AIRR Act, calling on the Federal Aviation Administration to issue guidance for air carriers on best practices for removing and saving cockpit voice recorders, as well as asking the federal agency to provide recommendations to prevent the loss of cockpit voice recorders.
However, it's unclear when Republicans will bring the wide-ranging bill, which would privatize air traffic control, among other aviation measures, to the floor, the member of congress said.
On Nov. 15, DeSaulnier wrote to FAA Administrator Michael Huerta asking the agency to take action to prevent the future loss of cockpit voice recorders in light of the July 7 incident at SFO. They have not heard back.
“From a public safety perspective, this is unacceptable, and I am concerned that we are missing opportunities to learn from all of the facts when safety issues arise,” DeSaulnier wrote.
They specifically wrote about the valuable information lost in the SFO incidents. In July, an Air Canada flight mistook a crowded SFO taxiway for a runway, barely missing four fully loaded planes awaiting takeoff on the ground. In October, another Air Canada flight crew landed on a SFO runway despite repeated warnings by an air traffic controller to abort because they believed another airplane had not left the area yet.
On Nov. 29, a Delta Air Lines plane lined up toward a taxiway at an Atlanta airport before performing a late go-around. A NTSB official told this news agency Thursday the cockpit voice recorder was not recovered following the latest incident last month.
All three incidents are under federal investigation without the dialogue between pilots available that might explain the confusion.
Cockpit voice recorders tape the dialogue among the flight crew and newer planes must have a two-hour tape limit, while older models are only required to have 30 minutes of tape. The recorder runs as long as the plane is powered, but once the recording reaches the end, it begins taping over at the beginning.
“We believe that we get all the information that we need when it's reportable. We don't think anything else needs to be done than what is currently being done,” NTSB spokesperson Keith Holloway said, adding the NTSB is not recommending any changes to regulations.
They called the cockpit voice recorder an “added bonus, but not the end-all-be-all.” They also said the surviving pilots provided valuable information and can be compared to flight data, making the voice recorder less important.
Jim Hall, former NTSB chairperson, disagreed in an interview earlier this year, calling the cockpit conversations “critical,” especially in such close-calls.
“It reflects the conversation in the cockpit of how this airplane might have ended up in this position,” they said, adding that requirements on saving cockpit conversations must tighten.
DeSaulnier also argued that relying on the crew is not ideal.
“The pilot is often the person who is the culprit in making the mistake and humans memories are not perfect,” they said.
Holloway stressed that the SFO and Atlanta incidents did not reach the threshold of a “reportable incident,” which requires airline notification when a plane “lands or departs on a taxiway, incorrect runway, or other area not designed as a runway.” Even for those, the NTSB must put in a request for the cockpit voice recorder to be saved, which can take time in during the short window before it gets overwritten.
In 2002, the NTSB sent a safety recommendation to the FAA saying it had a “longstanding concerns” about the availability of cockpit voice recorders, saying it's one of the most valuable tools in investigations. During catastrophic accidents the plane's electrical system cuts out which preserves the recorder, many investigations occur after incidents where the plane's electrical system is operational, such as runway and taxiway incursions, rejected takeoffs or runway overruns.
In that 2002 memo, the NTSB said in those incidents “nearly every” CVR was overwritten. Often the only sound they get is background noise from an unoccupied cockpit from the plane sitting at a gate well after the incident.

Guardian talks to 29-year-old behind Pavegen kinetic tile, which is harnessing energy from footsteps to power floodlights, electronic devices and more
No need to tread lightly: the tile lighting up football in Rio and stations in France
Whenever a goal is scored on the community football pitch at the Morro da Mineira favela near central Rio de Janeiro, the crowds can cheer on courtesy of the six unique – and newly installed – floodlights.
But what makes these lights distinctive is that they are partly player-powered.
Rows of kinetic tiles beneath the astroturf capture the energy of the players during the day as they run from one end of the pitch to the other; the energy is stored and fed back into the floodlights between 7pm and 1am.
Pavegen, the company behind the tiles, is the creation of Laurence Kemball-Cook. The 29-year-old designer came up with the idea six years ago when making their way among the throngs of commuters passing through Victoria station in London.
Shortly before, Kemball-Cook had been on a placement year from their industrial design course, working on a project with the firm Eon to power street lights by solar or wind energy. By the end of the year, the project had petered out after both options proved unworkable. They returned frustrated to their course at Loughborough University – until their eureka moment at Victoria.
“I thought about … tapping this resource [footsteps] which hasn't been channelled before,” they say. “I thought what if we could have a tangible energy solution which would be retrofitted easily, that would have a good power app that you could actually use but, most importantly, give you power when and where you need it.”
From that early spark of inspiration has come the Pavegen tiles, 5cm-thick units which have already been fitted in railway stations, universities, schools and offices to harness the energy from footfall which is then stored in a battery and can be used within a 200-metre radius to power street lights or charge mobile phones, among other uses.
The way of achieving this, says Kemball-Cook, is to use some “really wacky geometry and some really wacky combinations of engineering principles” which centre around the use of a flywheel to store the energy.
“A footstep is a really quick impact and the problem with the people who looked at it before is that it is such a quick impact, every single step, that it is really difficult to harness that power in a useful way. What we managed to do is convert a quick impact into continuous power.
“So long as people keep walking on our tile, we always have power output. We do that through … [storing] energy in a flywheel. The inertia of a flywheel spinning holds the power as people keep walking on it,” says Kemball-Cook.
When someone walks on the waterproof units, their foot compresses the tiles by about 5mm – a similar feeling to walking on a playground or a running track. Continuous steps give a few seconds of power which is then stored for use later. In an area such as Oxford Street in London, where there is a very heavy footfall, 10 tiles around a street light will power it through the night, they say.
“In high-footfall environments, as long as you have a footstep every 10 seconds, you will be getting a continuous output from people walking on it,. Typically [in] a busy high footfall environment you get a footstep every two seconds. So imagine an office environment between 8am and 9am: it is going to be at its peak. That peak, you are going to get a constant on, like turning a switch on, and then it will drop off in the afternoon but we have accumulated the energy from the morning to power for the afternoon.”
The market for the tiles is split between events, such as at the finish line of the 2013 Paris Marathon where the energy was gathered from 40,000 runners, to more permanent uses like at Heathrow airport where it is used to power lights along a corridor. Outside the Saint Omer train station in north-east France, 14 tiles harness the energy from commuters which is then used for USB ports in seating to power electronic devices.
The tiles can be topped with materials such as vinyl, carpets and rubbers. The ultimate aim is to get the price down to the level of conventional flooring within three years.
According to Kemball-Cook, the tiles cost £20,000 a metre to produce in the early dies, but this has already come down to £1,250. They aim to have this reduced to about £50 a metre, less than the cost of luxury carpet, and to reduce the thickness of the tiles to less than 5mm, the same as a carpet underlay.
An initial plan in the early stages to have a light in each tile was binned after women thought there was a camera looking up dresses and skirts.
“They will be hidden under everyday roads and everyday buildings and normal floors. That is the end game,” they said. “We will be like the Intel Inside on a PC – the Pavegen inside on a floor.”
The company has made revenues of £5m since it was launched in 2009 and is in profit, according to Kemball-Cook, with investment so far of close to £1m. They remain the majority shareholder of the company.
Beyond the immediate use for generating energy, the company is also developing ways of gathering data for crowd management – such as when large crowds are expected in areas so that staffing and cleaning can be organised. Another area is security, where the tiles would act as an alarm system which does not need a battery.
“In the future a floor is not just going to be a floor, it is going to be a portal to engage with the smart home using the direct impact to send signals and identify people,” they said.
It is not just feet
Among the other uses being worked on for the Pavegen system is a speed bump that could be located in a car park or on a slip road. Kemball-Cook says there is the potential to create substantially more power from cars as the minimum weight is about 1,000kg for a vehicle compared twith 70kg for a person. The car has two axles so would be going over the bump twice, creating more impact, they say.

Crucial Releases MX500 SSD
Crucial has expanded its MX line of SSDs with the introduction of the MX500. This new SSD is being billed as an HDD replacement that seriously kicks up the overall performance of the system. Crucial is releasing the drive in two form factors, M.2 and 2.5”, as well as capacities up to 2TB (2.5”).
While it doesn't seem like it, most computers still come with HDDs, especially desktops. This helps keep the price down and some users just want more capacity. And while new and shiny computers are nice, it is more cost-effective to give your PC a boost by dropping a SSD in it. That is exactly the market the MX500 is aimed at, it even comes with a installation guide.
The MX500 is built on Micron's proven flash technology and has been thoroughly tested. It will offer the usual that users will see upgrading to an SSD: faster performance overall with a lower power footprint. The drive also comes in capacity up to 2TB meaning users no longer have to choose between performance and capacity.
Key specifications:
Form Factor: 2.5” | M.2
Capacity: 2TB (2.5” only), 1TB, 500GB, 250GB
Performance Sequential read: 560MB/s Sequential write: 510MB/s Random read: 95K IOPS Random write: 90K IOPS Warranty: 5-year limited
Availability
The Crucial MX500 is available now

Arsenal's latest signing, Danny Welbeck, has the potential to become an excellent all-round striker.
They have a number of qualities - he's tall, strong, quick and versatile. This means, depending on your interpretation, that he's either the complete modern striker, or he's adaptable enough to be shifted into different positions.
Welbeck prefers playing up front, but he's likely to play in a number of roles, and in a variety of positions, as an Arsenal player.
Welbeck's most obvious quality is their speed. Arsene Wenger has always liked playing speedy forwards at Arsenal, from Nicolas Anelka, to Thierry Henry, to Theo Walcott - and Welbeck is another in that mould.
Although capable of using their pace out wide, they particularly like running in behind defences, something Manchester United have badly missed when Welbeck has been omitted over the past couple of years.
Danny Welbeck
“With the magnificent players in midfield slotting balls through, I can run on to the end of those balls and slot them away,” Welbeck said in their first interview as an Arsenal player. “I like to bring pace and power to the game. At Arsenal, we're not short of combination football and I like to join in on that and get in behind defenders and try to get shots off at goal.”
Welbeck is capable of stretching teams, forcing them to defend deep to negate their speed. In turn, that creates space in front of the defence, for creative players to roam.
Last season, this was most obvious in Manchester United's creditable 1-1 draw against reigning European champions Bayern Munich. Welbeck drifted between a left-sided starting position and a centre forward role, and was a brilliant battering ram, spearheading Manchester United's attack.
They created themselves three clear goalscoring opportunities through sheer speed, with an early ‘goal' harshly disallowed for a foul. They missed a glorious one-on-one chance when tamely chipping the ball, and this is the area Welbeck must improve upon - their finishing. Although sometimes they look clinical in front of goal, they need to score more frequently to be considered an elite centre forward.
Still, Welbeck can reasonably argue that their modest goal return is because he's so frequently been used wide. This is because Welbeck is far more tactically disciplined than most forwards, and is capable of tracking opposition full backs and marking deep-lying midfielders.
"Wherever they play, Welbeck's pace, assured passing and tactical versatility makes them perfect for Arsenal"
Sir Alex Ferguson often used them wide against dangerous attacking full backs, asking Welbeck to track back and then quickly sprint in behind. In Manchester United's narrow defeat to Real Madrid in 2013, Ferguson's last European game, Welbeck performed a superb man-marking job on deep-lying playmaker Xabi Alonso. Only after Nani was dismissed, and Welbeck was forced to go wide, did Alonso find freedom, allowing Real to dominate.
Another key aspect of Welbeck's game is their pass completion rate, which is always exceptionally high for a forward - something that Wenger will particularly appreciate.
Welbeck is very precise and thoughtful with their distribution, often playing with their back to goal and calmly, very deliberately, steering the ball to team-mates with the inside of their boot. He's not one for penetrative balls, but Arsenal have that elsewhere.
Welbeck's pass completion rate of 87 per cent over the past couple of seasons is on par with that of Jack Wilshere and Santi Cazorla - an amazing figure for an attacker.
Surprisingly, Welbeck didn't start against Arsenal in the past two seasons, but they did score on their last appearance at Emirates Stadium, grabbing the winner in Manchester United's 2-1 win over Arsenal in 2011/12, a rare game where they played the duration as a centre forward.
It remains to be seen precisely where Welbeck is used for Arsenal, although Olivier Giroud's injury absence means they should be afforded opportunities in their favoured striking role.
Wherever they play, Welbeck's pace, assured passing and tactical versatility makes them perfect for Arsenal.
Reaction to: why-bitcoin-unlimiteds-emergent-consensus-gamble
Wouter Schut Blocked Unblock Follow Feb 3, 2017
This is a reaction on the article “why-bitcoin-unlimiteds-emergent-consensus-gamble” by Aaron van Wirdum.
As with many articles and comments by Core supporters this article isn't factually incorrect, but it still misses the mark completely. It is like saying “electric cars are unsafe because they can crash”. Which is technically true, but it clearly doesn't make electric cars less safe than their ICE counterparts.
Aaron van Wirdum seems to have a large status quo bias. But not in a realistic sense, but more in a code-is-law-sense-with-warts-and-all-to-infinity-and-beyond. Although, that's a strawman, I don't actually know what Aaron is suggesting as an alternative to emergent consensus.
Emergent consensus
Let me first get one thing out of the way: Emergent consensus isn't something invented by Bitcoin Unlimited. It is an inherent property of Bitcoin. If SegWit ever gets activated, then that too is emergent consensus. No two ways about it.
And the alternative to emergent consensus is central control. Nothing more, and nothing less.
Someone will now be quick to point out “but at least SegWit has a clearly defined activation percentage, that is much safer than Bitcoin Unlimited!”
But that is entirely rooted in the idea of not trusting the majority of miners. And if that is the case Bitcoin has already failed.
Activation %
Newsflash: A majority of miners can activate SegWit at any percentage above 50%. Just like Bitcoin Unlimited. To argue a fork with an activation % is safer is like telling miners to act in a certain way, because you don't trust that they will, then trusting that they will. Wait what?
It's like the opposite of FUD. Like a teddy bear which helps you sleep at night. It doesn't really do anything, yet it makes you feel safe.
In reality the activation % is an insult to miners. But even worse, it explicitly gives a minority of miners veto power. Which makes sure that activating a fork isn't dependent on whether it makes financial sense, but whether the entire market supports it. Which could very well be two entirely different things.
A 95% activation means you as a software developer have determined what bundled features make economic sense together. And if 5% disagrees, then that must be better than any kind of compromise.
That's grinding Bitcoin to a complete halt. And the weird thing is, people are even proud of it. Proclaiming Bitcoin being hard to change is a good thing.
But that is simply a proclamation that you do not trust the economic majority. And the alternative to following the economic majority is what exactly? A less valuable Bitcoin. A less usable Bitcoin.
SegWit split
Like I said, if you do not trust miners then Bitcoin already doesn't work. But that also means miners could falsely signal they support SegWit but reject blocks once they are created. Splitting the network in two.
Which was the entire argument against Bitcoin Unlimited. Just shows how ridiculous the entire article is.
Actual commentary on the Article
BUIP001 does not include a technical consensus mechanism as reliable as in Bitcoin's current consensus rules.
Not changing anything is usually seen as reliable and more safe. No surprise there. Yet I can think of countless examples where that actually isn't safe at all. You should read up on status quo bias to understand the issue at hand.
Comparing Core's inability to change with BU's attempt to change is comparing apples to oranges. They each have their cost and benefits.
A free market approach (again what alternative is there?) means you look at the cost of all options and go for whatever delivers the most profit. Which means evaluating risks, investments, potential gains, potential losses etc.
If their software does not automatically realize this, users are expected to configure their settings to make it happen.
That's a lie. Most people running BU don't need to configure anything. It has sensible defaults. There is no need for most people to ever change these settings by hand.
And I personally reject the notion that everyone and their grandmother even need to run a full node.
For one, if a user's EB signaling is trivially spoofed by an adversary, miners can be tricked into thinking a block size limit increase has more support than it does
Miners can also spoof running Core and SegWit. And miners should look at actual usage from economic dependent nodes, not from random sybil nodes.
Either they set their AD settings low to remain in consensus, but essentially give up much of their autonomy to miners; or they set their AD settings high to protect their autonomy, but risk splitting the network.
And again a lie. Users setting EB/AD low incurs NO risk of splitting the network. That would simply mean their nodes stop working. And they would stop accepting coins above that value.
Which means, if those users/business have economic value. This represents a real risk/cost towards the network, and thus the miners.
And this is probably even more true under adversarial conditions. If the people in these groups don't really know or trust one another, they have no way of knowing whether the other people are telling the truth or lying.
We are getting to the heart of the matter: The author proclaiming they don't share satoshi's belief that a majority of miners can be trusted.
Never mind that if that trust is broken Bitcoin already completely breaks down with things like selfish-mining.
Never mind that this exact thing can happen with SegWit activation. Signaling support, yet orphaning SegWit blocks when they are created. Clearly that would also split the network.
In fact, this is the Byzantine Generals' Problem. That is exactly the problem Satoshi Nakamoto attempted to address.
No. If you solved that Byzantine Generals' Problem you don't need to solve it again. That makes no sense.
If miners can signal to activate SegWit, they can signal to accept larger blocks.
No problem.
Bitcoin Unlimited proponents believe that Bitcoin's economic incentives — the incentive for users to all remain part of the same Bitcoin blockchain — is in itself sufficiently Byzantine Fault tolerant
Strawman alert. Nobody is claiming that. It's a complete fabrication.
Emergent consensus works because Bitcoin solved the Byzantine Generals' Problem. It doesn't dissolve it. It doesn't replace it.
Rather than opting into a protocol once and relying on machine consensus from then on, users need to take on a much more proactive role.
Repeating the same line again. No, most people need not take a proactive role at all.
There is no fundamental difference between choosing the software you run, and choosing with what settings you run.
The only thing which makes everything simpler is saying Bitcoin is defined by Core. But that is just blatant nonsense and should be violently rejected.
Which brings us back to choosing what software to run. Circle closed.
“This IS part of how Bitcoin works. It's not meant for people sleeping at the wheel.”
You can quote BU supporters all you want. But this is basically the third time the article mentions the same thing. It is getting tiresome.
BU completely supports passive participants (users and miners) which do sleep at the wheel and do not care about the limit whatsoever and just want to follow the majority.
It is true that BUIP001 doesn't introduce anything that wasn't possible before.
Amen!
Indeed, developers, miners and the rest of the Bitcoin community have generally tried to avoid these types of crisis events as much as they possibly can.
In contrast, Bitcoin Unlimited seems to embrace them as an upgrade mechanism.
Ending an article with a straw man. Great!
The only people actively supporting minority chains and thus an actual split are Core supporters. A huge majority of want larger blocks yet are “somehow“ not getting any.
Ok, not “somehow”. We know exactly why we still don't have bigger blocks.
UConn Women's Basketball Team Confronts Consequences Of Being 'Too Good'
The University of Connecticut women's basketball team is destroying the competition. In fact, this year, there hasn't been any competition. But as the Huskies are closing in on their fourth consecutive title, the lack of competition is hurting the women's game. NPR's Audie Cornish talks to David Ubben of the website "Sports on Earth."
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
This year's University of Connecticut women's basketball team is the stuff of video games, not real life. The Huskies are beating teams by an average of 40 points. The three-time defending champion is undefeated heading into this weekend's final four, and they're on a 73-game winning streak. And as everyone expects UConn to win its record fourth consecutive title, there's some that wonder if being this good is actually a bad thing for women's basketball. Joining us now is David Ubben. They cover college sports for the website Sports on Earth. Welcome to the program.
DAVID UBBEN: Thanks. I'm glad to be here.
CORNISH: So Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Glove riled up the Internet when they tweeted during UConn's 60-point victory over Mississippi State in the Sweet 16. They said, quote, "hate to punish them for being great, but they're killing women's game. Watch? No thanks." OK, so, David Ubben, this is a seriously backhanded compliment. What's going on here?
UBBEN: I think a lot of people do believe, when you have teams that are this far out in front of the pack, it's like running a marathon where the guy that's ahead is, you know, five miles ahead of anyone else that's on the track. It's kind of pointless to watch.
CORNISH: What? We love that guy. That guy's the greatest runner ever. That's why we watch it.
UBBEN: In theory. You know, this is not a dynamic that's limited to women's basketball. I think when you have things that are this dominant, when they aren't unprecedented, people tune out.
CORNISH: All right. Well, coach Geno Auriemma was asked about Shaughnessy's comments after another recent tournament rout. Here's how they responded.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
GENO AURIEMMA: When Tiger was winning every major, nobody said they were bad for golf. Actually, they did a lot for golf. They made everybody have to be a better golfer.
CORNISH: So what's your answer to this?
UBBEN: It's not a great argument. Tiger Woods isn't recruiting the best golf balls and the best golf clubs to come play for him. Tiger Woods is the golfer. And when they play, he's not preventing anyone else from getting better. But Geno Auriemma has to recruit, every single year, the best women's players in the country. So when they get a good player, somebody else doesn't get a good player. And so when you're asking everyone to improve your game, well, you could start by handing off some of those good players to other programs. And that's a ludicrous request, but UConn's still going to be out in front as long as Geno keeps getting the best players and developing the best players. It's a credit to them, but it's still not helping the women's game.
CORNISH: What do you say to women, especially young women players, who hears this and may think that this kind of argument from Shaughnessy and others is essentially sexism passed off as sports opinion, right? I mean, the idea being that women - we don't want to watch them. They're not as good, until they're really good, and then we say we don't to watch them because they're really good. I mean, this is - this seems very much like a catch-22.
UBBEN: Yeah, I think there's certainly something to that. And I think it's a tough line because I think that it's hard to sort out. And a lot of times, it's hard to have honest conversations about, how do we improve the women's game? How do we fix these issues without sort of being drowned out by, well, you're being a sexist.
CORNISH: In the meantime, is there any chance that UConn could use lose this weekend to Oregon State in the national semifinals or in a title game?
UBBEN: No.
CORNISH: Are you still going to watch?
UBBEN: (Laughter). I'll probably tune in. That's one thing that Geno Auriemma is unbelievable about doing. They keep their team invested. They're competing against themselves. We want to be as good as we can be. It's incredible to watch. Geno Auriemma is a fantastic coach - one of the best in the history of the game.
CORNISH: That's David Ubben. They cover college sports for the website Sports on Earth. Thanks so much.
UBBEN: Thank you, appreciate it.

Articles and blogs during GeoServer 2.4 development:
It's almost impossible to limit yourself to just one question for Shigeru Miyamoto. I had two pages' worth of queries in my small notebook, and trying to narrow down that list while Nintendo's renowned game designer waited patiently on the other side of a TV screen wasn't easy.
But that was the rule that GamesBeat and other media outlets had to follow during a recent group interview about Super Mario 3D World, the latest platforming adventure for the iconic plumber (out Nov. 22 for the Wii U). Joining Miyamoto in the video conference — and also following the conspicuous trend of wearing a Mario-themed T-shirt — was producer Yoshiaki Koizumi and director Kenta Motokura.
Despite the one-question restriction, our hour-long meeting was a fun and lighthearted look into the creative process that led up to Super Mario 3D World's conception. Here's a look at what I thought were the most interesting topics covered in the interview.
How Super Mario 3D World fits into the Mario universe
A lot of Mario games have confusing names. New Super Mario Bros. Wii, New Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Paper Mario, Super Mario 64 DS, and others make it hard to keep track of what each series is known for. Super Mario 3D World doesn't help, but Miyamoto at least clarified its place in the Mario universe.
“When we were coming up with the name for this game, Super Mario 3D World, the word ‘world' had a particularly important meaning to me,” they said via translator. “So you guys may remember that after the original Super Mario Bros. game, there was also Super Mario Bros. 2 and 3. But it was the Super Nintendo Entertainment System title, Super Mario World, that first used this word. [Since then, the New Super Mario Bros. series has inherited the 2D side-scrolling gameplay.]

“And then separate from that was the 3D Mario games that started with Super Mario 64 and have continued to evolve all the way through Super Mario Galaxy 2. [We made another little departure with] Super Mario 3D Land, where we tried to combine elements of those two series: the side-scroller and the 3D.”
Super Mario 3D World continues what 3D Land started. While the path to finishing a level is still linear, you have a lot more to see and do when it comes to exploration. Up to three friends can help you with that in 3D World's cooperative multiplayer mode.
“And so it was taking those ideas from Super Mario 3D Land and raising them to the highest level imaginable that we came up with Super Mario 3D World,” Miyamoto said. “The change in title from ‘Land' to ‘World' was very significant for me. Now the inclusion of ‘3D' here of course [means] that it's still a 3D world — not that it's a stereoscopic view like on the 3DS, which I guess is a little funny for some people who get tripped up on it.”

Experimenting with a new resolution
Super Mario 3D World marks the first time Mario and their friends have made the jump to the high-definition era in a 3D game. The developers took advantage of this new resolution by experimenting with different gameplay mechanics.
“Now that we're able to have graphics in HD, this is allowing us to express some different ideas that we really haven't done before,” Motokura said. “So for example, the clear pipe is something that's just that much easier to see in this kind of presentation, and this allowed us to connect it to new ideas for gameplay.
“We had a lot of fun thinking about what happens exactly inside the pipe if you could see through it. What sort of things is able to go through? And so we worked on, ‘OK, maybe fireballs can go through. Maybe even Goombas could go through.' We spent a lot of time coming up with different variations.”
The new catsuit is more than just a cute power-up
The catsuit lets Mario and their friends climb walls and slash enemies with their claws. While Miyamoto, Koizumi, and Motokura weren't afraid to show their love for this new power-up — they'd occasionally pose like a cat or casually drop “meows” into the conversation — they assured us that the suit serves a purpose beyond its adorable animations. Koizumi explained that since Super Mario 3D World has both 2D and 3D gameplay, they wanted something that was easy to play and had a “high degree of freedom” so players could explore its multilayered levels.
“We felt like [the catsuit] was especially well suited to achieving both of those goals together,” Koizumi said.
British author Sir Kingsley Amis was famous for their prodigious literary career, boisterous personality and radical political views. They were also the subject of regular monitoring by Britain's MI5 spy service, newly released documents show.
The reports about Sir Kingsley are among thousands of declassified MI5 files that Britain's National Archives released on Tuesday. The material dates back to the 1950s and 1960s, covering the early stages of the Cold War. It provides a rare insight into how MI5 gathered information on presumed communist sympathizers, as well as Soviet spies operating in the U.K., including a famous Russian spy who used a phony Canadian identity to steal plans for Britain's nuclear submarines.
Sir Kingsley's file is among dozens of personal files released and it shows how MI5 kept abreast of their movements. Sir Kingsley, who died in 1995, was best known for their book Lucky Jim and their critical analysis of the James Bond novels, which led them to write a Bond novel after the death of Ian Fleming called Colonel Sun. They were also an ardent communist in their youth and joined the Communist Party while attending Oxford University in 1941. They later renounced communism, embraced conservatism and adored Margaret Thatcher.
Story continues below advertisement
The MI5 files reveal that the agency kept track of where Sir Kingsley lived and compiled reports on their activities, including noting at least one mistress. They relied on information from police departments, consular officials and operatives. One report mentions Sir Kingsley's move to the United States in 1957 to take up a year-long position at Princeton University. By then, they had become disillusioned with the Communist Party because of the Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary to crush a popular uprising. The MI5 note indicates that Sir Kingsley's past Communist Party membership had been flagged in a report to U.S. officials, but they managed to obtain a U.S. visa because of a mistake by a consular officer. The note says that British and U.S. officials discussed rejecting the visa, but decided not to because Sir Kingsley was likely to cause a public uproar that could reveal MI5's interest in him. Instead, a U.S. official contacted Sir Kingsley about their party membership and the author offered assurances that they were no longer a communist.
The documents indicate that MI5 ruled Sir Kingsley out as a security threat but still kept close tabs on him. One report describes them as "an enthusiastic new recruit of the Communist Party" while at Oxford and says that after they were called up for military service in 1944, they "was receiving regular supplies of the Daily Worker," a socialist newspaper. Another says their commanding officer once described Sir Kingsley as "young, inexperienced and inclined to take extremist views towards most aspects of life and to make controversial statements in the hope of creating an impression."
The trove of documents also provided new insights into the Portland spy ring, one of the most notorious cases of spying to hit Britain after the Second World War. It centred around Harry Houghton a British naval officer who worked at submarine base in Portland, England. Throughout the late 1950s, Mr. Hougton stole secret documents, including plans for HMS Dreadnought, Britain's first nuclear submarine, with the help of their lover, a clerk at the base named Ethel Gee. They passed the information on to Konon Molody, a Soviet spy who went by the name of Gordon Lonsdale and sold vending machines in London.
The documents show that Mr. Molody had concocted a detailed Canadian identity that seemed to baffle MI5 agents for a while. In one lengthy report, MI5 put together a biography of Mr. Lonsdale that said they were born in 1924 in Cobalt, Ont., and that their father, Jack, was a labourer, and their mother, Olga Elena, an American who had immigrated to Canada in 1931. It also mentioned that Mr. Lonsdale moved to Vancouver and then to Toronto, where they met up with some communist operatives, a couple named "Bacchus," who had indirect ties to Soviet intelligence. The profile was based on largely fictitious information, and it later emerged that Mr. Lonsdale was Mr. Molody and that they had secured a Canadian passport using a dead man's identity.
The MI5 files show that by 1960, the agency was beginning to figure out Mr. Molody's true identity and properly establish their communist connections in Canada that helped them obtain the passport. The service also managed to track how they moved money from a Swiss bank account to a Canadian bank.
MI5 agents also managed to learn a lot about the spy ring by following Mr. Molody to their meetings with Mr. Houghton, who was surprisingly careless. According to the documents, the men usually met in coffee shops and train stations, exchanging secret documents hidden in newspapers and carrying cases. While Mr. Molody tried to remain low-key and speak quietly, Mr. Houghton spoke in a loud voice, making it easy for the MI5 agents sitting nearby to write down their conversations. During one meeting, the files note, Mr. Houghton talked loudly about plans for upcoming meetings and how their expenses would be covered by Mr. Molody.
Mr. Houghton was arrested in 1961, along with Ms. Gee, Mr. Molody and a pair of Americans who were wanted for spying in the United States. They were all sentenced to 20 years in prison on espionage charges. Mr. Molody served less than four years, and was released in 1966 as part of an exchange with the Soviets for Greville Wynne, a Briton accused of spying in Russia. Mr. Molody returned to Moscow as a hero and their memoirs were eventually turned into a film. An inquiry later blamed lax security at the naval base for the security breach.
KFC is doubling down on one of its most questionable menu items.
The Double Down, a bacon and cheese monstrosity sandwiched between two fried chicken filets instead of bread, is coming back on April 21, USA Today reported Wednesday morning.
KFC spokesperson Rick Maynard told The Huffington Post it would again discontinue the "sandwich" after May 25.
When the 540-calorie fast-food fix first launched four years ago, on April 12, 2010, KFC extended the limited-time offer to meet high demand after it sold more than 10 million Double Downs in the first month.
Many restaurants kept it on menus into 2011, and "a handful" have been offering it as an off-the-menu item for years, they said. But the sandwich hasn't been marketed nationally in four years, Maynard said.
"At this point, we're thinking about this as a limited-time only kind of product," Maynard said. "We'll have to see what America thinks."
KFC is currently planning a national social media campaign focusing on the “Double Down Dare."
Originally discredited as a "stunt food" by critics, the Double Down turned out to be pretty successful internationally, too.
The sandwich was most recently reintroduced in January at KFC's branches in the Philippines.
And while the Double Down may be a nutritionist's nightmare, it hardly stacks up to some other artery-clogging fast-food offerings.
In planning a meeting with Obama (that did not end up happening), Boehner's chief of staff Mike Sommers sent an email to David Krone, Reid's top aide, stating: “We can't let it get out there that this is for [Boehner] and [Reid] to ask the President to carve us out of the requirement of Obamacare." But, as Politico reports,
During a five-month period stretching from February to July, Boehner and their aides sought along with Reid's office to solve what had become a big headache for both of them. They drafted and reviewed a possible legislative fix, as well as continued to push for an administrative one from the Office of Personnel Management.
This revelation illustrates a big fracture in the Republican Party. Vitter has been pushing their amendment for weeks. Sen. Ted Cruz thinks the amendment should be expanded to include all federal employees, like D.C. teachers. But privately, it's clear that Boehner disagrees.
However, Politico reports "Boehner's aides vehemently deny that the speaker's private efforts contradict their public statements on the issue. They insist Democrats were the ones who enacted Obamacare and it is up to them to address the problem."
Reid, for their part, is happy to admit that they and Boehner have worked together on saving the subsidies. Adam Jentleson, Reid's communications director, told Politico, "Senator Reid appreciates Speaker Boehner's cooperation and tireless efforts to work through this difficult issue."
Getting rid of the subsidies would mean essentially handing a big pay cut to (arguably already under-paid) Hill staffers. Sen. Barbara Boxer said in a press conference yesterday that Vitter could have elected to do this on their own, telling their staff that he'd decided to give them a pay cut.
Meanwhile, Vitter claims that getting rid of the subsidies wouldn't really hurt employees. Their press secretary Luke Bolar pointed out this part of the amendment: "In most of these cases [lawmakers and Hill staff] earn well above the maximum income ($43,000 individual/$92,000 family) and would otherwise be ineligible for subsidies or tax credits as defined in the statute."
But there are a lot of cases where Hill staff members do not earn "well above the maximum income." The average congressional staff assistant makes $29,000 per year. One GOP staffer told Mother Jones that "Congress literally threw staff under the bus on this…You're hurting staff assistants who are sorting your mail." Rochelle Dornatt, chief of staff to California Rep. Sam Farr, told Roll Call that she's considering ending their 32-year Hill career. "There's a lot of chatter among chiefs of staff, Dornatt said, "who are ready to leave if this doesn't turn out right." But Bolar insists the Vitter amendment still allows subsidies for those under the $43,000 income level.
Whatever happens with the Vitter amendment, lowly Hill staffers now have an unexpected, private ally: Boehner.

UN Report Says Mass Surveillance May Violate International Law
from the good-to-see dept
Where there is a legitimate aim and appropriate safeguards are in place, a State might be allowed to engage in quite intrusive surveillance; however, the onus is on the Government to demonstrate that interference is both necessary and proportionate to the specific risk being addressed. Mass or “bulk” surveillance programmes may thus be deemed to be arbitrary, even if they serve a legitimate aim and have been adopted on the basis of an accessible legal regime. In other words, it will not be enough that the measures are targeted to find certain needles in a haystack; the proper measure is the impact of the measures on the haystack, relative to the harm threatened; namely, whether the measure is necessary and proportionate.
One factor that must be considered in determining proportionality is what is done with bulk data and who may have access to them once collected. Many national frameworks lack “use limitations”, instead allowing the collection of data for one legitimate aim, but subsequent use for others. The absence of effective use limitations has been exacerbated since 11 September 2001, with the line between criminal justice and protection of national security blurring significantly. The resulting sharing of data between law enforcement agencies, intelligence bodies and other State organs risks violating article 17 of the Covenant, because surveillance measures that may be necessary and proportionate for one legitimate aim may not be so for the purposes of another
Concerns about whether access to and use of data are tailored to specific legitimate aims also raise questions about the increasing reliance of Governments on private sector actors to retain data “just in case” it is needed for government purposes. Mandatory third-party data retention -- a recurring feature of surveillance regimes in many States, where Governments require telephone companies and Internet service providers to store metadata about their customers' communications and location for subsequent law enforcement and intelligence agency access – appears neither necessary nor proportionate.
Consequently, secret rules and secret interpretations – even secret judicial interpretations – of law do not have the necessary qualities of “law”. Neither do laws or rules that give the executive authorities, such as security and intelligence services, excessive discretion; the scope and manner of exercise of authoritative discretion granted must be indicated (in the law itself, or in binding, published guidelines) with reasonable clarity. A law that is accessible, but that does not have foreseeable effects, will not be adequate. The secret nature of specific surveillance powers brings with it a greater risk of arbitrary exercise of discretion which, in turn, demands greater precision in the rule governing the exercise of discretion, and additional oversight.
The good folks over at the EFF have a detailed overview of a new report from the UN , which has basically found that mass surveillance, similar to that which is carried out by the NSA and GCHQ can often violate international law. The full report is just 16 pages, but the EFF version highlights some of the key lines. The biggest is the report's rejection of the whole "collect the haystack" approach to mass surveillance. The UN report makes it clear that this is not a reasonable approach, especially when it is not shown to be "necessary and proportionate."It further finds that many countries do not effectively limit who has access to such bulk data collections, which exacerbates the problem:It also finds requirements for data retention to be problematic:The report condemns the pernicious use of "secret interpretations" of the law, something that has become all too common in the US:While reports like this may notimpact the US's practices, it adds to the growing understanding and recognition both of what the NSA (and others) does, but also why it's totally unacceptable.

EVERYONE can have their 15 minutes of fame, even if your job is as humble as pushing trolleys around a hospital.
India was sent into meltdown when a man wearing a white apron purporting to be a doctor at the Ranchi hospital issued a statement to a throng of waiting media, dropping the bombshell that Virat Kohli – the world's best batsman – was set to miss the rest of the series against Australia with their bung shoulder.

“While the bones are intact, there is a ligament tear and they were having acute problems in hand movement,” the man said.
“We have advised 15-20 days rest.”
The only problem was the man in the white apron, wasn't actually a doctor at all, but a “technician” at the hospital.
In other words, he's the bloke who pushes the buttons to turn the MRI machine on and off.

The hilarious cameo from the trolley man in Ranchi is the latest chapter in the mystery that is, what's up with Mr Kohli?
India's out-of-sorts skipper has a shoulder injury of some significance if the fact they haven't been sighted since midway through day one is anything to go by.
At this stage, there's no proof that the trolley man won't be proven a genius.
Without Kohli India appear directionless and there must be serious concern about how to manage their shoulder now for the rest of this match.
The BCCI has twice giving updates to suggest Kohli would return to the field momentarily, but so far that is yet to happen.
“Relevant investigations have revealed that there are no serious concerns, which will hamper their speedy recovery from a strain in their right shoulder,” said the BCCI in a statement.
“He will continue to receive treatment which will assist them to participate in the rest of the match.
No one saw it coming, but Kohli has become the enigmatic figure of this series.
Conspicuously out of form, Kohli's only real impact so far has been to ignite World War III after the Bangalore Test by accusing Australia of systematic cheating.
Kohli crashed down hard on their right shoulder when attempting to field a ball midway through day one and now they have disappeared again.
In extraordinary scenes at the Ranchi hospital, there were almost more people gathered out the front to give Kohli a rock star reception as they made their exit, than turned up at the cricket stadium for the second day's play.
Perhaps they knew more than the BCCI or even the trolley man – that if there's no Kohli, no India.
At 1:09 a.m. on Jan. 1, Twitter user RichlonelyJuan posted a picture of what appears to be a girl passed out in their own vomit, claiming that they and their brother planned on raping them
They continued to live-tweet throughout the night, declaring that the victim no longer had a pulse.
Both users continued to tweet about the incident, neither denying nor backing down from the rape threat.
The same man also posted a vine saying "I did rape them and kill her."

Who knew a nigger like me with an iPhone cud upset so many ppl
Someone's at my door at 5 in da morning . Hope that's just da TV smh ..
Around 6 a.m., one of the men tweeted that somebody was at theirs door.
The Cobb County police confirmed they were aware of the photograph, and a police dispatcher said that two detectives were on site at the residence investigating the rape allegation.
On Wednesday, Dana Pierce, a public information officer for Cobb County told BuzzFeed that the police department did not have the names of the men who posted the photographs, or any information about the alleged attackers.
"How are we going to find them?" asked Pierce. "We could find their IP addresses, but we're not going to do that on New Years Day... They [the detectives] will probably really sink their teeth into the case tomorrow."
Pierce also told BuzzFeed that investigators received an anonymous call from a female who said they were familiar with the case and that there was "no truth" to it.
"Obviously this doesn't satisfy our investigation," said Pierce. "But the alleged incident that has gone viral is not a crime. We need a lot more evidence to prove that this happened."
The detectives are "working on it," but they have not had any success in validating the claims from the tweet based on the information provided thus far.

A White House panel has recommended significant curbs on the National Security Agency's sweeping electronic surveillance programmes.
Among its 46 recommendations, the five-member panel said the NSA should cease storing vast amounts of data on calls processed by US phone companies.
Details of the snooping programme were leaked by ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden, now a fugitive in Russia.
The review comes after a federal judge found the programme unconstitutional.
'Public trust' needed
In its 308-page report, the Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technology recommended the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), a federal court that handles sensitive national security cases, only authorise the collection of phone data when it was related to a specific international terrorism investigation and was "reasonable" in scope and breadth.
The data should no longer be stored wholesale by the NSA, the panel recommended, instead remaining in the custody of the phone company or a third party.
It also suggested limits on national security letters, which are legal orders giving the government authority to demand financial and phone records without prior court approval. It recommended intelligence agencies obtain a prior "judicial finding" showing "reasonable grounds" that the information sought is relevant.
Image caption Edward Snowden's leaks have generated a debate about how far surveillance should go
President Barack Obama convened the panel in August after Mr Snowden began releasing a trove of internal NSA documents to the news media, bringing highly sensitive electronic intelligence programmes to light for the first time and prompting an international outcry over alleged violations of privacy.
Among its recommendations:
The NSA director should be confirmed by the US Senate, with civilians eligible for the role
The president should give "serious consideration" to ensuring the next NSA director is a civilian and separate the position from US Cyber Command, a military unit
Creation of a Public Interest Advocate to argue in favour of privacy and civil liberties interests before the FISC
More transparency at FISC
Halting spy agencies' efforts to undermine commercial encryption methods
Limits on who can access information gained by the NSA
The president should personally approve all methods used by the intelligence community, including spying on foreign leaders
It is unclear how many of the panel's suggestions, which intelligence officials are likely to oppose vigorously, will be accepted by the Obama administration.
Former NSA director Michael Hayden told the BBC the report's recommendations would complicate the task of intelligence collection.
"Making this more public will shave points off operational effectiveness," they said about the NSA programmes. "But... my personal formula in this is if we don't do that it won't matter because the American people won't let us do it in the first place."
'Respecting privacy'

Mr Obama met the review panel earlier on Wednesday.
In a statement, the White House said Mr Obama told its members that "the United States use its intelligence collection capabilities in a way that optimally protects our national security while supporting our foreign policy, respecting privacy and civil liberties, maintaining the public trust, and reducing the risk of unauthorized disclosure".
The panel was comprised of Richard Clarke, a former White House counter-terrorism adviser; Michael Morell, the former deputy director of the CIA; University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey Stone; former White House technical adviser Cass Sunstein; and Peter Swire, an expert in privacy law.
On Monday, a federal court in Washington DC found the NSA's mass collection of Americans' phone call information was unconstitutional, in a case expected to reach the US Supreme Court.
Judge Richard Leon called the surveillance programme "indiscriminate" and an "almost Orwellian technology that enables the government to store and analyze the phone metadata of every telephone user in the United States".
