Books: The Sagas of the Icelanders, oral tales compiled by various editors, Jane Smiley (preface); Njal's Saga, by Anonymous (Author), Robert Cook (Editor, Translator)
Reviewed by: Glenn P. Hendrix, chair, Arnall Golden Gregory LLP
While planning a trip to Iceland this year, I became interested in Icelandic history, which led me to The Sagas of the Icelanders. Iceland was settled by the Norse starting in about 870 A.D., but functioned without a state until 1262, when the Icelanders submitted to the Norwegian crown.
Beginning in 930, Icelanders would gather annually at an assembly (the “Althing,” considered to be the world's oldest running parliament), but there was no ruler or executive power to carry out its decisions. Instead, the collective will of the community, as expressed by the Althing, was implemented by private action. For certain offenses, a person could be declared an outlaw and subject to being killed by literally anyone.
This world is captured in the Sagas, a series of stories about feuds and other conflicts in 10th- and 11th-century Iceland (based on oral traditions that were first recorded in the 13th century). While curious about the sagas, I thought they'd be archaic and somewhat difficult to read. I initially planned to skim a few pages just to get a sense of them. Instead, I found myself hooked. The stories are entertaining in a Game-of-Thrones kind of way, with well-developed, relatable characters.
Beyond that, and most interesting to me, was the critical importance of law in this stateless society. Despite the absence of any central authority, lawsuits (conducted before a council at the Althing) and arbitrations feature prominently in several of the sagas. In an environment in which the threat of violence was ever-present, the medieval Icelanders developed a complex set of oral codes and legal procedures to resolve disputes. Although fighting prowess was highly prized, as one would expect in a Norse community during the Viking Age, so too was legal prowess.
My favorite saga was Njal's Saga, a book-length tale (300 pages in the Penguin edition) in which the eponymous character, Njal Thorgeirsson, is renowned for his skills in advocacy and legal maneuvering. He utters the memorable phrase, “With laws shall our land be built up, but with lawlessness laid waste.” True in medieval Iceland, and true in our own society as well.

The global Integrated Systems Market is projected to exhibit double-digit growth during the forecast period (2016-2024). This may be attributed to substantial demand for abridged deployments and lower number of standalone solutions. The shift from mainframe systems to internet computing has altered the way consumers buy, build and deliver technology.
Integrated systems are easily managed through a single console leading to lesser operational expenditure. They simplify processes, reduce costs, and are highly flexible. These advantages along with the escalating need to reexamine data center infrastructure are fueling market growth.
Browse Details of Report@ https://www.hexaresearch.com/research-report/integrated-systems-market
However, high deployment costs are a major challenge to widespread adoption of such systems in the coming years.
The integrated systems market is segmented on the basis of services, end-users, products, and regions.
Services are divided into consulting, maintenance & support, and integration & installation. Integration & installation are likely to grow at a lucrative pace till 2024. This owes to huge demand from several small, medium and large enterprises. End-users comprise defense & energy, manufacturing, healthcare, retail, educational institutes, information technology & telecommunication systems, and BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, & Insurance).
Retail and manufacturing are estimated to experience robust growth in the eight years ahead. The retail sector benefits from in-store supervision of complete systems, which reduces store system downtime. Such proactive management lowers ownership costs. Revenues from BFSI could exceed USD 8.5 billion by 2024. Information technology & telecommunication systems are also foreseen to garner high revenues in forthcoming years.
Products consist of pre-integrated systems, tested systems, and validated systems. Validated systems are further split into integrated workload systems and integrated infrastructure systems. The latter is expected to dominate the market in the forecast period.
North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, and MEA (the Middle East & Africa) constitute the regional market segments. North America reigns as a result of high market penetration and latest technological deployments. Asia Pacific could be a key contributor to the global revenues. This would be triggered by data centre transformations in the emergent economies of China and India.
Leading players in the worldwide integrated systems market encompass Cisco Systems Inc., Hewlett & Packard (HP) Company, Oracle Corporation, IBM Inc., and Fujitsu Inc. Many companies ally with those offering cloud-based storage and virtualization solutions for expanding their converged infrastructure installation.

Last year it seemed the corn on the cob season came and went before we even had time to enjoy it. So this year as soon as the corn appeared in the grocery store produce department, we were ready for it. Even the early cut of county corn tasted pretty good.
When the tractor pulled into town with the home-grown corn, I was in line at least once a week to buy some for our table. Then the Silver Queen corn arrived and homegrown tomatoes, and I was in Heaven.
Corn on the cob and fresh sliced tomatoes makes a most satisfying meal in my estimation. Add some meat, and Bill is happy, too.
But, unfortunately, my corn season ended prematurely.
When Bill shucked the last batch he encountered corn bore. Now, that's not really a problem. Usually those worms are very evident and near the top of the cob, easy to eliminate. He shucked, and I cut off the tops.
I let the corn cook while I sliced the tomatoes. We were both enjoying our repast and talking about how we don't seem to get tired of fresh corn during the summer and really miss it all winter. I had just buttered my second ear of corn when I noticed one dark speck. Deciding to remove it, I cut around it and pulled off. That spec proved to be a full inch long, snow white and still wiggling as I pulled it out.
Yes, I know I could go to the produce department at the grocery and buy shucked corn without corn borers, but after having the fresh from the field variety, it's just not the same.
I also know that by the time the corn comes in next year, I will no longer look at it and imagine some kind of skinny worm moving down my esophagus.
Another summer meal we really enjoy is green beans and ham. Green beans fresh from the garden are first-rate, of course. But we can make-do with most any fresh green beans.
I prefer to make a really big batch of them. But now that there are just two of us, if the batch is too big we end up eating them twice a day for too long. The solution to that is fairly simple. I call one of our kids and offer them our leftovers. They never turn them down.
When my younger brother visited during fair week, I asked him if he liked green beans and ham. “Whatever you fix,” he agreed, but I could tell by the look on his face that this Texas resident might prefer something else. But still, green beans, ham and potatoes can wait a long time on the back burner and still be delicious.
I served them with French bread the first night. He took a bite, looked mildly surprised, and said, “These are really good.” No need to call any of the kids to offer them leftovers. Dave enjoyed them every chance he got until they were all gone.
Green beans have always been a favorite around our house. Way back, before we had all eight children, I decided we should plant a garden, and I would can vegetables for us. The garden was planted, and we watched it grow. We tended it, watered it and weeded it. The vegetables did fairly well for a bunch of city gardeners.
First we harvested peas. We got enough for one meal. It seemed like a lot of work for a little pleasure and not everyone took pleasure from the peas.
We worked our way through carrots and radishes, but the rabbits ate the lettuce. Finally the green beans were ready. We picked them, and I cleaned them and processed them on the hottest day of that summer. By nightfall I was exhausted but quite proud of myself as I looked over the quarts of green beans ready for winter. A regular pioneer mother. The exhaustion was worth it.
Then I went to the grocery and there were green beans on special, 10 cents a can. When I figured it up they were a lot cheaper than the ones I canned. After that we just raised enough vegetables to sustain us through the summer.

On March 22, ETSU Diversity Educators will be hosting a coffeehouse community discussion regarding the MeToo movement.
“Diversity Educators has been hosting coffee house discussions since the semester of fall 2016,” said Diversity Educator Jacqueline Duncan. “During that year, many conversations came up regarding race, sexuality, transgender issues, political unrest, sexual assault and other social justice issues. In partnership with the Multicultural Center, we Diversity Educators wanted to offer an outlet and opportunity for campus members to share their experiences and perspectives on what was going on in the world.”
The #MeToo movement aims to bring to light the often-overlooked issues of sexual abuse and assault. The movement focuses especially on sexual crimes perpetrated by men in workplace settings. #MeToo coincides with the wave of reports of sexual assaults and abuse following the substantial 2017 allegations against former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.
“It's important to discuss the #MeToo movement as the community of survivors and allies begin to shed light on the prevalence of the sexual misconduct, sexual assault and sexual harassment that occurs in our national and global community,” Duncan said. “It is vital for survivors to have an opportunity to speak out. It is time to the break the silence regarding this topic.”
The MeToo movement is far more than an ordinary awareness campaign. It has succeeded in removing dozens of men from powerful positions across the world.
The MeToo movement has greatly increased cultural awareness of the underlying issues surrounding sexual crimes, exposing the exploitation of power dynamics in the workplace. Though there are still stigmas surrounding victims of sexual crimes, the #MeToo movement has proven to be an important step in legitimizing their plight in the public's eye.
“Lately, I have noticed people being engaged in more conversations regarding sexual assault and sexual harassment,” Duncan said.
In addition to raising awareness, the #MeToo movement aims for various political outcomes. Many of the movement's supporters use it as a platform to advocate for legislation intended to combat sexual misconduct. Said legislation includes bills that would make it more difficult for companies to cover up crimes and give victims access to better means of reporting their abusers.
Despite the positive underlying goals of MeToo, the movement has been the subject of a wide range of criticisms. Concerns regarding due process, overcorrection and the cultural demonization of men have proven to be the most prominent. Others criticize the movement for ignoring the plights of persons of color and focusing too much on the crimes of individual men rather than the underlying problems they represent. The criticisms levied against #MeToo are many and varied.
However one feels, #MeToo is a topic worthy of communal discussion and debate. Interested persons are welcome to attend the coffeehouse discussion free of charge. The discussion will take place in the Multicultural Center on the second floor of the D.P. Culp Center. The discussion will last from 1-2 p.m. Its tone will be informal, held over snacks and coffee.
“When we allow the campus community a space to converse, we allow a space for learning, understanding and mutual respect,” Duncan said. “During this discussion, I hope that each individual will be heard and enlightened by others' perspectives.”
'One man can't do it,' says the former Barangay Ginebra San Miguel import as Alab Pilipinas shoots for a 2-0 finals series lead
Published 7:57 AM, April 25, 2018
MANILA, Philippines – Alab Pilipinas may have won Game 1 of the Asean Basketball League (ABL) Finals, but Justin Brownlee knows there is a lot of basketball left to be played.
For now, he and the rest of Alab have their sights set on completing their home stint with a huge 2-0 title series advantage before heading to Thailand for Game 3.
“Giving up 130 points is definitely not gonna win us a championship,” Brownlee said after Alab Pilipinas' 146-130 overtime shootout with Thailand's Mono Vampire in Game 1 on Sunday night, April 22, in Sta. Rosa.
In that game, Brownlee dropped a new ABL finals record of 46 points that went along with 11 rebounds and 9 assists for a near triple-double outing. The former Barangay Ginebra San Miguel star import played all but the last 27 seconds of overtime when the game was finally in the bag for the home team.
Brownlee also delivered in the clutch by draining a pull-up triple in regulation that cut Mono's 4-point lead to one. Although he later missed free throws, Renaldo Balkman salvaged it with a game-tying tip that forced overtime. Brownlee then scored 10 of Alab's huge 22 overtime points which put away the feisty Thai squad for good.
Yet after all of that, Brownlee was quick to deflect credit to his teammates, even after Alab coach Jimmy Alapag called his 44-minute masterpiece a “Hercules-type” effort.
“We're a team that depends on [one another],” Brownlee said post-game. “One man can't do it. Unfortunately, I missed those two free throws and I'm still knocking over the head for that one. But like I said, we depend on [one another]. It's a team sport and we got to this point playing together.”
“Balkman, you know, he was there for me,” he added. “I missed the two free throws and the putback to tie the game but Balkman and a couple of other guys just stayed there fighting for me. That's just the character of our team.”
Coincidentally, Brownlee now shares the ABL playoff scoring record with Balkman, who dropped his own 46 points in a crucial Game 1 semifinals win against former champion Hong Kong Eastern led by prized San Miguel Beermen rookie Christian Standhardinger.
Alab will shoot for a huge 2-0 advantage in Game 2 of the best-of-five series on Wednesday, April 25, at 8 pm at the Sta. Rosa Multi-purpose Complex at Sta. Rosa, Laguna. – Rappler.com

On Monday morning, Kathrine Switzer approached the two-mile mark on the Boston Marathon course, and though there were many more to go, she'd already hit a personal milestone.
The 70-year-old was the first woman to ever run the marathon with a bib back in 1967 – albeit controversially.
At the time, women did not participate in the annual race, despite there being no written rules against it, according to CNN.
Switzer entered under her initials, K.V., keeping her gender ambiguous. On race day, though, Switzer says she wasn't attempting to hide her femininity. She told CNN she put on lipstick and earrings, but was forced to cover up in sweatpants due to the temperature.
It was near that two-mile line that Switzer was confronted by the race director Jock Semple, who physically tried to stop the then-20-year-old. The moment was captured on camera, the image now iconic – as well as Switzer's number, 261.
“Instinctively I jerked my head around quickly and looked square into the most vicious face I'd ever seen. A big man, a huge man, with bared teeth was set to pounce, and before I could react he grabbed my shoulder and flung me back, screaming, ‘Get the hell out of my race and give me those numbers,'” Switzer described in her memoir, according to CNN.
Switzer's then-boyfriend pushed Semple away, and Switzer continued the race, finishing in four hours and 20 minutes.
“I realized that if I quit this race, which I felt for a split second like doing because I was so scared and embarrassed, if I quit that race, nobody would've believed women deserved to be there or that they could do the distance,” she told the Boston Globe this year.
Though Switzer was disqualified after finishing, public uproar eventually lead to the formal inclusion of women. She went on to win the New York City Marathon in 1974, and the year after came in second in the Boston Marathon, according to the Globe.
Monday marked Switzer's first return to the Boston race since 1976. She was joined by a team of over 100 women from her running organization 261 Fearless, which encourages and empowers females to take up the sport and stay active.
Switzer regularly checked in with her fans through Facebook live videos while competing on Monday.
Sharing a team photo ahead of the start, Switzer wrote, “Today is the race of my life.”
“After all the marathons I've run, this may be the most important of all,” she said. “Who would have imagined, 50 years later and still toeing the line! What a privilege to be here, to even have the opportunity to try. Even though this is going to be hard, I'm the luckiest woman in the world to be here, surrounded by 261 Fearless friends and supporters.”
TORONTO — U.S. markets sank deeply into the red Tuesday, while precious metals and the materials sector helped mitigate the fall at Canada's main stock index.
The S&P/TSX composite index closed down 75.06 points to 15,477.
In the U.S., the Dow Jones industrial average plunged by 424.56 points to close at 24,024.13. The S&P 500 index closed down 35.73 points to 2634.56 and the Nasdaq composite index closed down 121.25 points to 7,007.35.
Underlying the selloff in U.S. markets was the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield touching the "psychological level" of three per cent, said Luc de la Durantaye, managing director of asset allocation and currency at CIBC Asset Management.
"That probably unnerves the market a little bit," he said.
He added that concerns over U.S. interest rates were further compounded by investor concerns about specific companies, such as Google parent Alphabet, whose shares slid nearly five per cent on higher-than-expected capital spending.
In Canada, however, the materials and gold sector remained buoyant. Barrick Gold Corp. shares were up more than three per cent Tuesday on better-than-expected quarterly earnings and the Toronto-based miner's announcement that it is no longer selling off assets to pay down debt.
"Gold is up... That's certainly helping the market to stay afloat a bit better than in the U.S.," said de la Durantaye.
The Canadian dollar was trading at 77.95 cents US, up from an average value of 77.92 cents US on Monday.
The June gold contract was up US$9 to US$1333 an ounce and the May copper contract was up three cents to US$3.14 a pound.
SEDGWICK COUNTY – A small crowd attended a rally at the Old Wichita Courthouse Sunday evening in Solidarity with those injured or killed in the Charlottesville protests.
The Peace and Social Justice Center of South Central Kansas invitation indicated the rally was an effort to stand up to racism, fascism and hate and to support equality and human rights.
Former Kansas democrat congressional candidate James Thompson and Larry Burks, president of the Wichita chapter of the NAACP addressed the crowd. Groups also held rallies in Topeka and Pittsburg Kansas, according to a social media report.
Protesters decrying hatred and racism say they felt compelled to gather and counteract the white supremacist rally that spiraled into deadly violence in Virginia.
The gatherings Sunday spanned from anti-fascist protests in San Francisco to a march to President Donald Trump's home in New York.
In Seattle, police arrested three men as Trump supporters and counter-protesters converged downtown.
In Denver, several hundred demonstrators gathered beneath a statue of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in City Park and marched about 2 miles (3.22 kilometers) to the state Capitol.
In New York, protesters marched from several locations in Manhattan to Trump Tower, demanding the president denounce white nationalist groups.
A crowd gathered for a vigil in Charlottesville, Virginia, on the street where a day earlier a car rammed into a peaceful crowd of anti-white-nationalist protesters, killing one.

"We don't think about the past. I think that's key," Valeri said. "Think about the next game and prepare well and perform for 90 minutes and improving on things that will make us better."
MATCH OF THE WEEK: The Columbus Crew face Toronto FC in a rematch of last season's Eastern Conference championship. The Reds advanced to the MLS Cup final with a 1-0 victory on aggregate.
This season, the Crew haven't been scored on in a club-record 495 minutes, capped by last Sunday's 0-0 draw with Sporting Kansas City. It was the fifth straight shutout for Crew goalkeeper Zach Steffen.
Meanwhile, the league's reigning champions are struggling with a 3-7-1 record this season, and they're coming off a 1-0 loss to FC Dallas. But they've also been dealing with an unusual number of injuries.
"There are a lot of games left, we have a great team, a team that can win on many days but the reality is we are letting games slip away from us too consistently," Reds captain Michael Bradley said. "We have to respond in a big way now in this next stretch."
This is the second meeting between the two teams this season. The Crew won the first one 2-0 in Toronto.
PLAYER OF THE WEEK: Vancouver's Cristian Techera has been named the league's Player of the Week after scoring a hat trick in the Whitecaps' 3-3 draw with the New England Revolution last weekend.
It was the Uruguayan midfielder's first three-goal game in MLS.
US SOCCER BECKONS: Philadelphia Union sporting director Earnie Stewart will assume the new role of general manager for the U.S. men's national team, according to various reports.
One of his first duties will be to hire a new coach. Dave Sarachan has been interim coach since Bruce Arena stepped down following the Americans' failure to qualify for the World Cup in Russia.
Stewart, who was born in the Netherlands, has been with the Union for the past three seasons after serving as an executive for a pair of Dutch clubs.
A former midfielder, he made 101 appearances for the U.S. team. He also played for D.C. United as well as several Dutch teams.

Book: Short Walks from Bogotá: Journeys in the New Colombia
Author: Tom Feiling
Review by: Kirk Bowman, Jon R. Wilcox Professor of Soccer and Global Politics, Sam Nunn School of International Affairs, Georgia Tech; Founder and Director, Rise Up & Care
Colombia is likely the most interesting country of Latin America and a beacon of optimism and hope in a rather dreary world.
After nearly 60 years of the “violencia” (1948-58), narco-violence and civil war (1964-2016) that together claimed half-a-million lives, displaced 8 million people and still produces more land-mine casualties per year than any place outside of Afghanistan, Colombia appears to be embarking on a new positive trajectory. Colombia is Caribbean, Atlantic, and Pacific, and as the heart of the Americas with 50 million inhabitants a sustained and enduring peace would be transformative for the hemisphere.
This singular historic moment attracted me to this Andean nation where I interviewed dozens of Colombians in 2016. The common observation across the class and political spectrum was the desire to shift the national narrative and discourse of violence to a narrative and discourse of optimism and peace.
I read a number of books, both fiction and nonfiction, to try and understand the emergence and construction of the hegemonic discourse of violence. Feiling's Short Walks from Bogotá is an intelligent and compelling explanation of the conditions and incentives that produced a culture of violence. It also offers some hope for Colombia and the region and would benefit anyone interested in the country, region or cycles of violence.
Feiling travels to villages and towns that were until recently too dangerous to explore and introduces a range of characters and stories that are shocking, ruthless, and insightful. Combining the 11 chapters of short walks builds a complex portrait of a country that is both tired of violence but that has violence and impunity as part of its cultural and political DNA.
Much of the violence of the past 60 years is in large part a cycle of vengeance whereby young men experienced the violent death of a father or other family member and subsequently joined or formed leftist guerrilla groups, right-wing paramilitaries, or death squads to avenge their loss.
Like One Hundred Years of Solitude [reviewed here by Global Atlanta editor Trevor Williams], at some point the ideologies and political causes dissolve. After six decades of extreme cruelty and violence, nearly everyone in the country has a reason to seek vengeance and inflict death on others. At the same time, the weariness of violence and vengeance may be producing conditions for an end of these endless cycles of massacres, tortures, and assassinations.
Feiling published this work long before the current peace process bore fruit and President Juan Manuel Santos won the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize. We would be wise to remember one of the constant themes of Short Walks from Bogotá, that peace in Colombia will not come from the top down, from peace accords, or from government programs.
The United States has spent billions of dollars to weaken the leftist guerrillas and battle the narco-traffickers. Plan Colombia and a military solution may help end the civil war, but it will neither transform the national narrative nor end the violence. A real transformation of Colombia will come from civil society, from below, and from common people making the uncommon choice to forgive and to reject an eye for an eye.

SEQUIM, Wash. -- The Sequim School District has stopped teaching a sexual health education course after some parents said it was not age appropriate.
Superintendent Gary Neal tells Q13 News that some parents had concerns after this year's curriculum concentrated more on gender identity than the lessons in previous years.
Jason Peterson is a single-parent of five children. He said when he first agreed to allow his 12-year-old daughter to take the course in November, he thought the lessons would be about the same when his older two children took the course.
"I assume, like most other parents, that we would be covering pregnancies, STDs and all of those things that you want your kids to know about,” Peterson said.
That wasn't the case for Peterson, who said his daughter came home crying and confused about the class in November.
“They told her that if she was into fishing and wearing athletic gear, or playing basketball, that those were boy things. And that would mean that she was a boy inside and that she was gay,” Peterson said.
Peterson said those stereotypes shouldn't be taught the way the instructor did.
“I think people should be free to be who they are,” he said. “They're discriminating, though, against her identity. And how much of it do you have to put up with?"
Peterson said the issue was that he felt the curriculum focused more on gender identity rather than medically or scientifically based sexual health. He feels that kids that young are very impressionable.
“The thing is, it's front burnered,” he said. “Twenty out of 32 pages are generated to gender identity. It's heavily weighted towards that. It's biased toward that.”
Peterson said learning about this was not age-appropriate for his daughter. A few other parents within the district felt the same way and addressed it with the school's principal and eventually the Sequim superintendent.
After hearing concerns, the superintendent decided to stop the sex -ed program for now.
The program used by the district is known as FLASH, which stands for Family Life and Sexual Health Curriculum. It was developed by King County Health about 30 years ago, according to officials.
Officials agree that the program changes throughout time, but only based on the latest scientific information. Part of that includes talking about gender identity, officials said.
“The issue of gender identity is also based on science. We have medical reviews locally and medical reviews nationally with some of the best experts (who) understand what is the best information that we should be sharing,” said TJ Cosgrove, director of the Community Health Services division for King County Health.
FLASH lessons are tested and reviewed by teachers before being published, according to King County Health officials. School districts have flexibility over how they implement FLASH – including which lessons they teach and at what grade they're taught.
King County Public Health officials add that FLASH aligns with CDC National Health Education Standards and the National Sexuality Education Standards, which includes treating people with respect and dignity, officals said.
Superintendent Neal said that the district will now form a group to discuss which standards need to be met to make sure content is age-appropriate for his students.
Neal tells Q13 that he expects that process to complete before the start of the next school year.

LONDON With France's presidential election a potential banana skin-in-waiting for markets, forecasting sites that rely neither on voter surveys nor real-money betting are becoming a tool of choice for financiers and policymakers in search of an edge.
After years of anxiety about the accuracy of opinion polls, investors had increasingly come to rely on political betting odds as a more consistent barometer of election outcomes affecting billions of dollars of holdings.
But 2016 changed all that, as bookies and pollsters misfired over Britain's referendum vote to leave the European Union and Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election win - though they partly redeemed themselves in last month's Dutch election.
Some reckon France could deliver a similar shock next month: a presidency for the far right, anti-EU Marine Le Pen.
Though polling has consistently shown her losing the May run-off by around 20 percentage points, bookies and U.S. prediction markets put Le Pen's chances of winning at around 1 in 4 – comparable to the odds on a Trump victory on U.S. election eve.
So, with opinion surveys also consistently showing a third or more of French voters could still change their mind, how do markets navigate these murky waters?
"IT'S HOW YOU THINK"
Offering a different perspective are Hypermind, a company that allows punters to "bet" on the outcomes of geopolitical events using play-money, and other crowd-forecasters like U.S.-based Good Judgment Inc.
Hypermind, which selects amateurs for its panel via a test, says some eight in 10 of its almost 2,500 forecasters on the French election come from France.
Its system gives those who consistently predict outcomes correctly an increasingly strong voice, while eventually dropping those who do not - and it puts the chance of a Le Pen victory at around 1 in 8.
"What makes a good forecaster is not previous expertise in the domain; it's not how much you know about what you're trying to forecast," said Hypermind co-founder Emile Servan-Schreiber, who has a background in cognitive psychology. "It's how you think."
He declined to identify any of his clients but said they included hedge funds, banks and government agencies.
That may be down to Hypermind's track record.
Its research shows that, in the two months before the event, it assigned the highest chances of Brexit and Trump out of eight statistics-based and crowd-based forecasters, including U.S prediction market PredictIt, British betting site Betfair and website FiveThirtyEight.
In research after Trump's victory, The Washington Post put Hypermind and the Good Judgment Open - a project of Good Judgment Inc based on the same principle - as the most accurate forecasters.
Hypermind grew out of research funded by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), a U.S. government body set up in 2006 to develop new methods for the secret service work in the post-9/11 era.
Between 2011 and 2015, IARPA ran a contest to predict the outcomes of around 500 geopolitical events.
The winning group was the Good Judgment Project (GJP), which used similar methodology to Hypermind to produce collective “wisdom of the crowd” forecasts.
Hypermind was one of two commercial spin-offs by GJP participants. The other was Good Judgment Inc.
FRENCH CONNECTION
Once chosen, Hypermind's forecasters are given 100,000 units of "play money" to bet with. The more accurately they predict, the more they accumulate, but if they lose it they fall out of the panel, which happens to around 1 in 10.
Hypermind is UK-registered but was set up by two Frenchmen. Its website is in French and English and this has helped to attract many forecasters in France.
Hypermind does not ask the nationality of panel applicants, but given that most of them are based in France, Servan-Schreiber reckons Hypermind's forecast is more representative of the French vote.
"The further you are removed from French territory, the more you see Le Pen as a high probability," he said.
UK bookmaker Ladbrokes says some of the people who bet on Trump and Brexit - and reaped the rewards - are trying their luck again with Le Pen, despite the strong lead enjoyed by centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron.
That is skewing bookies' odds in her favour. There is also a lack of understanding of how France's two-round voting system works, and the bookies' reluctance to leave themselves out of pocket.
On Wednesday Ladbrokes online odds of a Le Pen victory were 3 to 1, reflecting around a 25 percent chance.
"Le Pen's odds are overestimating her chances of winning," said the firm's head of political betting, Matthew Shaddick.
"If the people who were actually voting and really understood the system were allowed to participate in these betting markets, I suspect her odds wouldn't be quite so favourable."
In France, betting is restricted to sports and horseracing.
While it might have done better than others over Brexit and or Trump, Hypermind gave a less than 50 percent chance of each outcome.
But for Servan-Schreiber, assigning 1 in 3 odds on an event that occurs is not "getting it wrong". Rather, it reflects that one in three times, it will materialise.

The National Football League is quickly losing its core audience marking a shift that could bring an end to the sport's dominance, a new poll finds.
The WSJ/NBC poll found several things that should worry the NFL both for its near and long-term future. For instance, in the short-term, fans are paying less attention than ever to the NFL. But, more worrisome, in the long-term, parents are increasingly discouraging their children from playing football over concerns the sport's safety. The latter would tend to create fewer football fans into the future.
The effect does not seem to be localized, either. Fan interest in the NFL has dropped across the various demographics, including in the crucial growth demo of young males, according to the Wall Street Journal.
“The drop in interest spans age groups and the political spectrum—painting the picture of a sport that isn't just experiencing a momentary dip, but a battle against fundamental questions about football's future that have been building for years,” the Journal wrote.
On the heels of a contentious season, fans seem to have become fatigued by the NFL on a myriad of levels:
The problems are taking a heavy toll. Adults who report following the NFL closely have dropped 9% since 2014, the poll finds. More alarming for the league, however, is the makeup of the people moving away from the NFL in large numbers: Just 51% of men aged 18 to 49 say they follow the NFL closely, down from 75% four years ago. The poll did not ask respondents why their interest changed. The Journal/NBC News poll interviewed 900 adults from Jan. 13-17. The margin of error for the full sample was plus or minus 3.27 percentage points.
Interestingly, the drop-offs fell across both Republican and Democrat viewers, but interest fell more among Democrats. While Republican interest declined 14 percent, it fell even further at 16 percent among Democrats.
While all that is bad for the NFL today, the poll also found that the league has long-term troubles on the horizon:
Beyond the scope of the NFL, the poll also revealed that parents are increasingly uncomfortable with the idea of their kids playing football, prompted by a surge in information about the dangers of head injuries. In 2014, 40% of mothers said they would encourage their child to play a sport other than football due to concerns about concussions. That figure has now climbed to 53%. Democrats, the poll found, expressed these concerns with head injuries more frequently than Republicans. … Even people without kids in their households appear to harbor doubts about football, with 49% saying they would encourage their child to play another sport, up from 43% in 2014. Roberts described this data as “a flashing yellow light,” since robust youth participation in a sport typically correlates with a larger adult fan base.
With fewer children joining the sport, this could reduce the number of new fans who might otherwise have come to the NFL when they grow up.
Fans are also skeptical about whether or not the NFL is taking sufficient steps to assure player safety. A recent poll found that only 47 percent say the league is taking meaningful steps to reduce concussions. That is down from the 59 percent who approved of the NFL's actions on the matter in 2014.

MUNICH, Germany, April 6 The labour and capital representatives on Linde's supervisory board remain committed to their opposing positions over a planned merger with Praxair, a supervisory board source told Reuters after a board meeting on Thursday.
"No concessions were made," the source said.
The German and U.S. industrial gases groups have agreed to pursue a merger of equals and are hammering out terms of a business combination agreement, but labour representatives are opposing the deal because it would dilute their influence.

NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana – Four states have declared a “state of emergency” as the Gulf Coast prepares to be hit by Tropical Storm Nate.
Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida have all declared states of emergencies in multiple counties and parishes, specifically surrounding New Orleans, where Nate is projected to make a direct hit, according to the Weather Channel.

In Louisiana, evacuations were ordered for Lafitte, St. Bernard Parish, Grande Isle, Lafourche Parish, and St. John Parish have all been issued a mandatory or voluntary evacuation by Gov. John Bel Edwards (D).
“We do anticipate a direct hit in Louisiana,” Edwards told the Associated Press in a statement. “The bottom line for people is: You need to be where you want to be and in the posture you want to be by dark on Saturday.”
Edwards also announced that 1,300 National Guard troops have been ordered in Louisiana, where they will position themselves in the southeast region of the state where the tropical storm is expected to make landfall.
Additionally, Florida Gov. Rick Scott announced a state of emergency for 29 counties. Alabama and Mississippi's officials followed, with at least 11 shelters in the southern region of Mississippi being opened for potential flood victims.
“Tropical Storm Nate is headed north toward our state and Florida must be prepared,” Scott said in a statement. “I have declared a state of emergency for 29 counties in Florida to make certain that state, federal and local governments are able to work together and ensure resources are dispersed to local communities. By declaring an emergency in these counties, we can also ensure that there is no hindrance in the transportation of supplies and assets.”
Should the tropical storm become a hurricane before hitting landfall, it will be the fourth major storm to hit the Gulf Coast and Florida region this year. Houston, Texas, and surrounding areas suffered severe flooding from Hurricane Harvey as well as Florida residents who saw serious damage at the hands of Hurricane Irma last month.
Most recently, Puerto Rico is still recovering from the damaging aftermath of Hurricane Maria, which knocked the U.S. territory almost entirely off its power grid.
President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump visited all three portions of the U.S. impacted by the devastating hurricanes, giving out food and supplies to victims.

Food waste, poverty, and hunger are three realities for many families in Duncan and the Cowichan Valley.
Approximately two thousand children live below the poverty line in Duncan and with Cowichan Valley residents wasting 40 per cent of their food, the Cowichan Food Recovery Project is aiming to address these issues.
Agriculture Minister, Lana Popham stopped by the Cowichan Green Community office in Duncan Friday and announced $84,000 dollars in funding.
Executive Director of the Cowichan Green Community, Judy Stafford says there are both environmental and community impacts tied to this program.
Popham says Vancouver has a great example of what is possible here in the Cowichan Valley from a food recovery standpoint.
The Cowichan Food Recovery Project provides four participants with an opportunity to gain experience before entering the job market.
Stafford says these participants are an integral part of the project.
Popham says this is a great program that will go a long way to reducing food insecurity.
The money will be used to provide four participants with food safety training, WHMIS and first aid certification, along with opportunities to travel to other parts of the island and the province that offer similar programs, and try and replicate them here.

LONDON Gibraltar's leader on Monday cast EU Council President Donald Tusk as a "cuckolded husband taking it out on the kids" for explicitly proposing that Spain be given a veto over the ties between the British enclave and the European Union after Brexit.
The future of Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory of just over 2-square miles (6.7 sq km) of rock on Spain's southern tip, has become the first big dispute of Brexit since Prime Minister Theresa May filed formal divorce papers on March 29.
In the EU's draft position on the exit talks distributed by Tusk, Gibraltar was given explicit mention. Spain was specifically named as having a veto on the application of any future EU trade deal with Britain.
"Mr Tusk, who has been given to using the analogies of the divorce and divorce petition, is behaving like a cuckolded husband who is taking it out on the children," Gibraltar's chief minister, Fabian Picardo, told Reuters in an interview.
"This is clear Spanish bullying."
Picardo said the EU should remove the reference to Gibraltar, which voted overwhelmingly to stay in the EU, from the draft guidelines.
While years of tortuous negotiations await on issues that could affect trillions of dollars in trade, the Brexit debate in Britain has for three days focused on the future of the "Rock" captured by Britain in 1704 but which Spain wants back.
The row over Gibraltar illustrates how swiftly the United Kingdom's influence has declined since the June 23 Brexit vote -- in this case in Spain's favour -- and how issues perceived by EU powers as marginal can become major complications.
BREXIT ROCK?
After the explicit reference to Spain and Gibraltar became publicly known, May spokes to Picardo and issued a statement saying London was "steadfast" in its commitment to the territory which has positioned itself as a springboard for finance to the EU because of an attractive tax and regulatory regime.
A former leader of May's Conservative party, Michael Howard, even said she would be prepared to go to war to defend the territory, as then prime minister Margaret Thatcher did with Argentina over the Falkland Islands 35 years ago.
"The Spanish government is a little surprised by the tone of comments coming out of Britain, a country known for its composure," Spain's Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis said during a conference in Madrid.
Ceded to Britain "in perpetuity" in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, Gibraltar has long been a bone of contention between London and Madrid and the border was closed for many years during the Franco dictatorship. In a 2002 referendum, Gibralatrians rejected by 98 percent a proposal for joint British-Spanish sovereignty.
"The sovereignty of Gibraltar is unchanged and is not going to change," British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on Monday as he arrived for an EU foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg.
While every EU member state would have a veto over any future trade deal between the EU and post-Brexit Britain, the explicit mention of Gibraltar surprised London and angered the British territory.
May, in her letter to Tusk that triggered Brexit, had not mentioned Gibraltar, which uses the British pound and where Britain operates a military base overlooking the strait.
"The way that the European Council has behaved in allowing Spain to single out Gibraltar in this negative way is really quite pernicious," Picardo said.
When asked if Gibraltar was now a chip in negotiations, he said: "The last time I looked at this monolithic rock of mine and of the people of Gibraltar it doesn't look like a chip and its not going on any table.
"We are not going to be a chip and we are not going to be a victim of Brexit as we are not the culprits of Brexit: we voted to stay in the European Union so taking it out on us is to allow Spain to behave in the manner of the bully," he said.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) was heckled by activists at a town hall meeting in San Francisco on Monday. She was accused of not doing enough to stand up to the Trump administration and not being left-wing enough.
Feinstein, who turns 84 in June, was booed, jeered ,and told to retire at a meeting in her hometown of San Francisco after she rejected the idea of a “total takeover” of healthcare by the federal government.
One of the most prominent points of contention was foreign policy, as Feinstein expressed her support for Donald Trump's recent airstrikes on the Syrian regime while describing North Korea as “the number one” problem for America.
At one point, Feinstein paused the meeting and claimed some of the audience were “rabble-rousing.”
Dissidents also accused Feinstein of failing to stand up to Donald Trump, claiming that there is a “fascist in the White House” who is both “corrupt” and “incompetent.”
Some activists from the anti-Trump group “Indivisible” held up signs that read, “Retire Feinstein,” while protesters outside the event urged her not to run for reelection — a decision she is yet to make.
Feinstein's record as a Democratic Senator from California, a post which she has held 1since 1992, is broadly in line with left-wing ideals. During her tenure, she has fought on issues such as gun control, LGBT rights, and the environment; but she also supported the death penalty and George. W. Bush's invasion of Iraq.
The disharmony raises further questions about the ideological direction of the Democratic Party, with its supporters pushing policies further to the left. A poll conducted by Gallup in January found that the number of self-described political moderates in the party has shrunk from 47 percent in 2001 to 41 percent in 2016.
Since Donald Trump's election last November, left-wing activists have targeted town hall events across the country, but have so far only gone after Republican leaders in an attempt to disrupt the president's agenda.

US chocolate giant, The Hershey Company has pledged to no new deforestation in its global cocoa supply chain.
The company said that its commitment is aimed at “stopping ongoing deforestation and protecting forests” in the cocoa-growing regions where it sources cocoa.
The commitment is comprised of two fundamental components, with the no new deforestation mentioned above and tree planting programmes.
Hershey is working towards this aim through its own forest initiatives and its work with the World Cocoa Foundation (WCF) and its Cocoa & Forests Initiative (CFI).
CFI is an industry commitment announced in 2017 to protect and help restore forests and support sustainable cocoa production and farmer livelihoods.
Hershey will develop a comprehensive forestry plan in 2018 to outline its agroforestry programs, tree-planting goals, supplier guidelines and monitoring, and timelines to achieve its forest protection and reforestation goals. The plan will be completed and publicly shared before the end of 2018.
“Deforestation in cocoa regions must end and every stakeholder in the cocoa supply chain needs to work together to protect the forests for future generations,” said Susanna Zhu, Chief Procurement Officer at The Hershey Company.
“We are committed to working with local governments and civil society to strike the right balance between producing cocoa for the world and conserving the precious natural ecosystem.”
Tuesday on MSNBC's “Morning Joe,” New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, who claimed to be “very conservative” on some issues, urged viewers to vote Democrat in the midterms.
His reasoning is that it is the only way to restrain President Donald Trump, who he called the “greatest threat to our democracy.”
“Look, these midterms are soon to be upon us,” he said. “And I have one piece of advice for people: You have to vote for a Democrat because — and I say that as someone who, you know, I have very conservative issues on a lot of things. I'm free trade. I'm pro-globalization, pro-business. But the fact is, John, the worst Democrat running if the Congress or the Senate today is better than the best Republican because the best Republicans except those who are tragically dying or retiring simply won't stand up to this man. And if you see the norms that he is violating, the way he is trashing our most cherished institutions — things like the FBI, the Justice Department, the spreading of conspiracy theories from the bully pulpit of the White House — that is a threat to the fabric of our society and fabric of our democracy.
So I'm approaching this election coming up, unlike any other election,” Friedman continued. “It's not about — I care about these issues — but for me it's not about gun control or abortion or high taxes or low taxes. It's about whether we can get a lever of power that can restrain this man for the next two years because the man sitting in the Oval Office today is the greatest threat to our democracy. And I will just add one other thing, which people need to remember: We have not had a crisis yet. We've not had a real crisis except a crises Donald Trump has created. Wait until we have a real crisis and you have a president who cannot be believed sitting in the Oval Office. Then you will really see the true impact of all of this lying, all of this undermining of institutions.”

BRAINTREE -- A new collaborative partnership between three Catholic schools in the city of Boston seeks to make maintaining a Catholic education from pre-k to college easier and more affordable.
Beginning as early as this year, the Catholic Urban Partnership (CUP) will see graduates of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Mission Grammar School and St. Patrick School, two Catholic primary schools in Roxbury, automatically accepted into Cathedral High School in Boston.
Graduating students who choose to attend Cathedral High School will be able to carry over scholarships and financial aid received during their primary education, helping to create what school administrators are calling a "seamless" transition between the primary and secondary schools.
"Really, what we're able to do is offer a Catholic urban pathway to college success starting at three months old," said Mission Grammar School principal Ali Dutson, speaking to The Pilot Jan. 26. Just last November, Mission Grammar opened a center for infant and toddlers, which Dutson says is already filled to capacity and has a waiting list.
"Having that opportunity for families in the city of Boston is just priceless," she said.
CUP actually first began during the 2014-2015 school year, creating a formal partnership between just Mission Grammar School and Cathedral High School. The partnership grew out of an "organic process," said Dutson, and it worked well -- Mission provides education from pre-k through 6th grade, while Cathedral provides it from 7th through 12th grade.
According to Oscar Santos, head of school at Cathedral High, his school has been in a "pretty extensive" growth model. Over the last five years, the last three of which have seen the existence of CUP, enrollment has increased "about 43 percent," Santos told The Pilot, Jan. 26.
As a result, Cathedral High is currently in the midst of expanding its campus by building an applied learning center, which Santos estimate will provide enough space to accommodate another 100 students.
On Jan. 31, St. Patrick School announced its formal entry into CUP, a move that principal Tiffany Sawyer said she thinks "will help benefit the students because Cathedral has a lot to offer them, like resources that we can't offer here at St. Patrick."
The announcement was bitter-sweet, as Sawyer also informed parents that St. Patrick School, which had served pre-k through grade 8, will no longer be providing a 7th and 8th grade education after this school year, allowing students, instead, to easily transition to Cathedral High School after 6th grade.
However, Sawyer told The Pilot that the school's pre-k program, which just opened last month, has seen "steady enrollment."
In support of CUP, the Catholic Schools Foundation (CSF) announced a $2.5 million contribution to the collaboration. Speaking to The Pilot Jan. 29, CSF executive director Michael Reardon said the financial commitment will help provide scholarship support, marketing support to assist with enrollment and branding, and support for student retention.
"We look at the Roxbury area as a place where Catholic education has a huge impact, and what we saw was three excellent school leaders doing excellent work, and we want to make an investment in those leaders and in those schools," he said, adding that the partnership was really the initiative of the schools.
"For us, this is exactly serving our mission, and we hope it can become a model in working with the superintendent in others areas in the archdiocese," Reardon said.
He said CSF has provided some support to CUP before St. Patrick School joined, but not to the extent of the current investment.
"Now, with St. Patrick joining the Catholic Urban Partnership, we think that Catholic education in this area of the city really has a bright future," he said.
The collaboration will also be receiving support from the Boston Schools Fund, a non-profit started in 2015 by former teacher and Boston resident Will Austin. Currently, the Boston School Funds support 23 schools in the Boston area, including the three CUP schools.
Austin, also the organization's CEO, told The Pilot Jan. 29 that the goal of the Boston Schools Fund is to increase access for all families to high-quality schools in the areas. All types of schools are considered, not just Catholic schools, and the organization tries to "get to know" schools for six months to a year before having them apply for support, Austin explained.
He wasn't able to say how much of a financial contribution the organization will be providing to the CUP schools, but he did say that planning and support grants typically start from $10,000 to $15,000 per school, and technical support to ensure that schools have good business models, good marketing strategies, and curriculum support is also typically provided.
The Boston Schools Fund only works with two other Catholic schools in the Archdiocese of Boston -- St. Joseph Prepatory High School in Brighton and St. Columbkille High School in Brighton -- but Austin said he looks forward to establishing more connections with Catholic schools in the area.
"Catholic schools in Boston are high-quality schools and I'm certain that with the right supports we'll continue to see Catholic schools continue to serve more and more kids here in Boston and serve them very well," he said.
In the Archdiocese of Boston, the unique partnership the three CUP schools have formed is one that Kathy Mears, the superintendent of Catholic schools, hopes to see repeated in other schools in the area.
"I think it's a great thing when schools collaborate together and work together, and I hope all of our schools are considering these partnerships because we're much stronger when we work together than separately," she said to The Pilot, Jan. 29.

NEW DELHI — Afghanistan is set to play its debut cricket test next year against India, with dates and a venue expected to be announced soon.
Afghanistan and Ireland were elevated to full test membership of the International Cricket Council last June, and Ireland has already confirmed its inaugural test match will be against Pakistan in May.
Board of Control for Cricket in India Rahul Johri posted a message on social media after Monday's special general meeting in Delhi to say "India to play inaugural test against Afghanistan. Welcome them to five-day cricket."
Afghanistan Cricket Board officials met with Johri in October in Mumbai, requesting the No. 1-ranked team take on the newest member of sport's elite.
Dancing with the Stars audiences will see Maksim Chmerkovskiy return to the ballroom very soon!
After he was sidelined as a result of a calf injury during week one, the pro dancer has been recovering and unable to dance with celebrity partner Heather Morris.
But on Monday evening's week five episodes, Chmerkovskiy, 37, revealed that he'll be back next week!
“Alan's officially fired!” said Chmerkovskiy, who has continued to remain involved in Morris' dancing journey by attending weekly rehearsals and the live show. “I'm taking over as of tonight.”
Since Chmerkovskiy was hurt during rehearsals on the Friday following his week one performance, troupe member Alan Bertsen has been filling in as pro dancer — but Chmerkovskiy has continued to impart his guidance on the weekly dance numbers. “Maks really took charge of this studio,” Bersten said in a PEOPLE exclusive clip of the duo's Monday night performance.

On April 3, the new dad said that he was improving faster than expected.
“I'm walking now. I'm making strides a little faster than expected,” he revealed on DWTS. “I'm hoping for like a full comeback end of this week. And then we'll start rehearsing —.”
“Not this week. My goal is next week. This week I just don't want to do something stupid and regret it,” he told PEOPLE at the time. “I want to do the right thing. If this is the result of one week then I'm sure I'll be more than ready.”

PITTSBURGH — There's a picture next to Antonio Brown's locker featuring the Pittsburgh Steelers star wide receiver and quarterback Ben Roethlisberger sharing a laugh. The photo includes a note from Roethlisberger saying "AB, we are unstoppable."
Turns out, there might be one thing that slows down one of the most prolific duos in the NFL: the increasingly viral dustups provided by Brown's antics.
The latest came last Sunday, when Brown took his frustrations out on a water cooler after Roethlisberger failed to see Brown running wide open early in a 26-9 victory over Baltimore. Roethlisberger later likened Brown's outburst to a "temper tantrum," one that forced Brown's teammates to spend a considerable portion of the week not talking about Pittsburgh's 3-1 start but Brown's occasionally diva-like behaviour.
Brown knows it needs to stop. Soon.
"It can take away the morale of the group," Brown said Friday. "It can take away the morale of myself. Obviously I don't want (Ben) thinking I'm spazzing out because he does a great job of me getting me the ball and giving me the best chances to make plays. Just got to control my emotions ... and understand I've got an effect on every guy here."
Roethlisberger initially laughed off Brown's mini-meltdown but then went public during his weekly radio shows, chastising the 28-year-old Brown for setting a poor example for the rest of the roster.
"I never want to make the quarterback feel like I'm being a distraction or I've got any negativity toward him," said Brown, who is currently second in the NFL in both receptions and yards receiving heading into Sunday's game against Jacksonville. "He's the guy who gave me the opportunity. He's the guy who's been in my corner since I got here."
Brown's emergence as one of the most prolific receivers of his generation — he's the only player in league history with four consecutive seasons with at least 100 receptions and signed an extension in March that made him the highest-paid wideout in the league — has moved in lock step with his profile, one that has put him under a microscope. He drew a strong rebuke from head coach Mike Tomlin in January for livestreaming from the locker room following a playoff win in Kansas City. He repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with the six-year deal he signed in 2012 well before it expired even though the Steelers have a long-standing policy of not entering into negotiations until the penultimate season of a player's current contract.
"Obviously, I know the position I'm in," Brown said. "I've got to take responsibility and be a representative not only for the Steelers, but myself, my family. I've got to be smart."
Roethlisberger hinted Brown's behaviour had an effect on Brown's production over the course of the game. Brown was held to season lows in both receptions (four) and yards (34) even as Pittsburgh posted its most lopsided victory in Baltimore since the Ravens relocated from Cleveland more than two decades ago. Brown thinks Roethlisberger may have a point.
Camila Cabello is loving life as a solo artist.
For four years, the now 20-year-old was one-fifth of the girl group Fifth Harmony. But in December 2016, she surprised fans and her fellow group members by simultaneously announcing her departure from the group and plans to break out on her own. Now, the “Crying in the Club” singer is more than embracing her new freedom. She's absolutely loving it.
Not only does it afford her the opportunities to explore who she is musically—“I'm currently on a summer tour with Bruno Mars, and next, I will be putting out a few songs from my set that will also be part of my album,” she tells PEOPLE—but she also gets to show a whole other side of her style.
Whereas before she had to conform to matchy-matchy looks with her four other bandmates, now she can do whatever she wants on the red carpet and on stage. “As a solo artist, I don't have to worry about matching a group look, which can be quite challenging because you have to fit with everyone else,” she says.

And that means more opportunities to show off how her personal style has grown.
“I think my style has evolved because I've evolved as a person,” she says. “I'm always growing and recreating myself, and because style is an expression of how you feel, my style has changed like I have. I'm more comfortable in my own skin now and I don't feel like I have to do as much to feel good. I could wear jeans and a T-shirt with no makeup and feel just as good as when I've been in hair and makeup for two hours and wearing a fancy dress. It's all about feeling comfortable and feeling like yourself.”

One of her favorite trends to try these days? “I love crop tops because when I dance or perform on stage, I [move] my waist a lot, and it makes the movements more visible,” she says. “I also love cut-out jeans because you feel free but you're still wearing pants!”
Her confidence in her solo look also landed her a gig as the new face of Guess Jeans's fall 2017 campaign. “I've always been such a fan of Guess and the timelessness of their style,” she says. “They are all about keeping it simple and feeling confident and sexy in your own skin. I am a causal girl at heart and love the classic feel of Guess. It was really meant to be and I can't believe I'm now a Guess girl!”
OMGOMGOMG, introducing the #guessjeans fall '17 campaign shot by @tatianagigi❤ on a desert adventure w @delliale91 👀#LoveGUESS 🌹thank u @paulmarciano A post shared by camila (@camila_cabello) on Aug 1, 2017 at 4:52pm PDT
Her favorite shot from the campaign is the one in which she poses alongside model Alessandro Dellisola. “Ale were on the motorcycle bike, and I was wearing a turtleneck, some jeans, and a ribbon around my head—that's a very me look,” she explains. “I also got to pretend I had a boyfriend for an hour!”
And while posing with hot models in cool clothes was fun, for now, she continues to focus on her music. “I just want to keep living experiences and then writing about them,” says the singer, who has an album on the way. “I've put everything into this album. I've opened myself up to this music and I think when you hear it you can see that this is all really coming from my heart.”
Friday House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) declared to reporters the House Intelligence Committee memo that will reportedly reveal potential wrongdoing by the Department of Justice and the FBI was “bogus.”
Pelosi said, “First of all, it's a bogus memo. It is not based on fact. But it does reference highly classified intelligence matters. Now we see that he is even altered the memo, so to make matters worse. If he were to release that memo, he would not only be endangering our country, but he would also be violating the rules of the Congress of the United States.”

* Rupee's 4.8 pct rise in 2017 makes imports competitive
* Imports seen at 3 mln bales vs 2.2 mln bales yr ago
* Exports falter as Indian cotton becomes expensive
By Rajendra Jadhav
MUMBAI, March 31 India's 2016-17 cotton imports are set to jump more than a third from a year ago to a record 3 million bales as the rupee's rise makes buying overseas cheaper, senior industry officials and executives said.
The strong rupee - now at its highest level in 18 months - has also braked cotton exports from the world's biggest producer of the fibre, a trend that has helped rival suppliers in Brazil, the United States and some African countries boost their own exports.
"Usually (textile) mills in southern India import cotton," said K. Selvaraju, secretary general of the Southern India Mills' Association (SIMA), in a recent interview. "This year mills from even the north are importing. Overseas supplies have become competitive due to the strong rupee."
India's currency has risen 4.8 percent so far in 2017 versus the U.S dollar. Indian mills have contracted to import around 1.5 million bales and another 1.5 million bales will be imported by end of the current crop year, ending Sept. 30, Selvaraju said.
That total of 3 million bales would be 36 percent more than the 2.2 million bales imported in the 2015-16 crop year, with stocks coming mainly from African countries, the United States, Brazil and Australia.
Tightness in domestic supply is also boosting imports, as Indian farmers hold off on deliveries in the hope of achieving higher prices later in the crop year.
Usually Indian mills import cotton in the second half of the crop year as domestic supplies dwindle. But this year they began importing in January as local prices jumped due to limited supplies, said Chirag Patel, chief executive of Indian exporter Jaydeep Cotton Fibers.
The state-run Cotton Advisory Board has forecast production of 35.1 million bales in the current crop year, but industry officials say production is likely to be around 34 million bales as output was hit in southern states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu by a drought.
The rampant rupee has also dented cotton exports from India.
"Because of currency fluctuation right now Indian cotton is not competitive in the world market," said Jaydeep Cotton Fibers' Patel. "Traders want to export but they couldn't sell."
The country has so far contracted to export 4.5 million bales in the current crop year, and total exports in the season could be around 5 million bales, down 30 percent from a year ago, he said.
Pakistan, Bangladesh, China and Vietnam are key buyers of Indian cotton.

U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez was briefly handcuffed Monday during a sit-in at federal immigration offices in Chicago where activists' demands included revocation of immigration-related executive orders, no future raids and reconsideration of a deportation case.
Gutierrez and other advocates, including clergy members, protested roughly five hours beyond a scheduled meeting with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, saying they'd risk arrest. Federal protective service officers briefly placed Gutierrez and two others in plastic cuffs after they ignored warnings, but they were let go without citation. The Democrat called off the protest just before the close of business.
The outspoken Illinois congressman — who's been arrested for civil disobedience related to immigration issues several times — chronicled the events on Twitter.
"They were scared to arrest us because they know our cause is just," he tweeted. "We ended our sit in but we will #resist."
ICE spokeswoman Gail Montenegro said officials agreed to an "informational meeting" but couldn't provide "actions and assurances" required by the group. She said the three individuals including Gutierrez were released from plastic restraints after "ICE officials relayed that they no longer wanted the individuals removed from the building."
Among their demands was a reversal on a deportation order involving Francisca Lino, an immigrant from Mexico without legal permission to stay in the U.S. The mother of six living in the Chicago area was previously deported but returned and married a U.S. citizen. She acknowledged the deportation during a 2005 citizenship interview and was arrested. She has a pending deportation order. Four of her children are U.S. citizens.
Gutierrez said the case should be low priority for immigration authorities and illustrates a broken system.
BARCELONA, Spain — Eibar crushed Sevilla 5-1 in the Spanish league on Saturday, while Real Betis forward Loren Moron scored twice in his debut.
Eibar outclassed an inexperienced Sevilla side that included Sandro Ramirez, Miguel Layun and Roque Mesa making their debuts following their arrivals in the final days of the January transfer market.
Fabian Orellana led Eibar with two goals. Enrique Garcia, Ivan Ramis and Anaitz Arbilla also netted for the Basque Country hosts.
Pablo Sarabia got Sevilla's only goal from the penalty spot in the first half to make it 2-1.
Sevilla coach Vicenzo Montella has managed to win once only in five rounds since replacing Eduardo Berizzo.
Sevilla faces an important match on Wednesday when it hosts Leganes in the return leg of the Copa del Rey semifinals after a 1-1 draw in the first match.
"I want to ask our fans to forgive us (for the loss), but I am sure that if we stay united we can reach the final (of the cup)," Montella said.
Eibar, whose budget of around 50 million euros is a third of Sevilla's, climbed to seventh place and to just one point behind Sevilla in sixth after losing only once in its last 11 league matches.
Eibar coach Jose Mendilibar said his team's performance was among its very best since the club joined the first division 3 1/2 seasons ago.
"Given the rival, the way we played, the occasions we created, what we didn't let them do . today we played a complete match in every sense," Mendilibar said.
Many voters had trouble deciding who to vote for provincially, or more likely, who not to vote for, but come October, we'll have a bonanza of good candidates.
The province deserves a tongue-lashing. First, many changes to the Municipal Elections Act work against nonincumbents. It takes time to build a profile, raise funds, construct a campaign, and get the message out. Previously candidates could register Jan 1. Now it's May 1, and they can't raise or spend a dime until they've registered.
Today provincial and municipal elections are held in the same year. The province's was June. Try campaigning municipally while a provincial campaign is underway! Two campaigns at the same time are confusing. Realistically, municipal candidates can't do much before mid-June, while incumbents enjoy free ongoing publicity.
That's just the first problem. A municipality where a councillor won a provincial seat has 60 days to fill the vacancy. With only four months before the local election, a neophyte would struggle to learn the complexities of a city and region; so councils often appoint experienced former councillors. These things badly need a fast provincial fix.
Burlington council's rush to approve the new Official Plan (OP) and get regional approval, without the accompanying studies (traffic, transit, and parking) has been aggravating. Halton received it May 11, and has 210 days to make its decision (November). It can request 90-days extension. But how does a region approve an incomplete OP? In bits and pieces?
Citizens are angry that so many development approvals were granted for way beyond our standards. The 23-storey condo opposite City Hall, where only 12 were permitted, was the game changer. Voters are furious, and watching to see if the new OP's 17-storey limit really will be adhered to. Interestingly city planners, next week, will recommend 17 on the opposite corner, where the applicant wants 24!
We recently learned that reduced standards will be recommended for condo parking. Prepare for more neighbourhood disputes and resentment of new densities. In the future we may rely less on our cars, but what happens in the many intervening years? There's talk, too, that commercial land near the Fairview GO station has changed hands. More condos?
There's even a suggestion of parking lay-bys on the costly reconstructed Plains Road. There is a six-storey limit (in both the old and new OP) in Aldershot, but council approved higher and denser projects, with reduced parking. Aldershot amenities like beer and liquor stores disappeared, and Home Hardware must relocate. Its landlord wants highrises and townhouses instead, with small commercial spaces at ground level, probably big enough for more spas.
The effect of a too small council — only seven — has been evident this council term . Get two or three strong opinionated councillors in the mix, and decisions can skew. Oakville has seven wards, one town, one town/regional councillor per ward, plus the mayor — 15. Burlington has six wards. And costs don't double. The town (city) councillor gets one salary, not the combined city/regional $105,400, plus up to $9,000 expense account, plus benefits. (The heavy combined workload merits every cent).
Intensification is mandated. It's how it's done that's the issue. Citizens apparently have a different vision of Burlington than city staff (and council) does. Thankfully, ECoB (Engaged Citizens of Burlington) is holding candidate debates in every ward. There have been few debates in recent elections. Would you buy a car without checking its features? These people plan the community, and set your taxes.

MAZAR-I-SHARIF/KABUL, Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani declared a national day of mourning after scores of soldiers were killed by Taliban fighters disguised as fellow soldiers, in the deadliest attack of its kind on an Afghan military base.
The defence ministry has said more than 100 died or were injured in the Friday attack in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, but no exact numbers have been released.
One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters at least 140 soldiers were killed and many others wounded. Other officials said the toll was likely to be even higher.
The attack starkly highlighted the difficulty of the long struggle by the Afghan government and its international backers to defeat the Taliban insurgency.
After arriving in Mazar-i-Sharif to visit the base on Saturday, Ghani ordered that flags be flown at half mast on Sunday in memory of the troops who died.
Ghani held an emergency meeting with senior security officials and called for a "serious" investigation into the attack.
In a statement online, he condemned the attack as "cowardly" and the work of "infidels".
As many as 10 Taliban fighters, dressed in Afghan army uniforms and driving military vehicles, made their way into the base and opened fire on mostly unarmed soldiers eating and leaving a mosque after Friday prayers, according to officials.
They used rocket-propelled grenades and rifles, and several detonated suicide vests packed with explosives, officials said.
Witnesses described a scene of confusion as soldiers were uncertain about the attackers' true identity.
"It was a chaotic scene and I didn't know what to do," said one army officer wounded in the attack. "There was gunfire and explosions everywhere."
The base is the headquarters of the Afghan National Army's 209th Corps, responsible for much of northern Afghanistan, including Kunduz, a province which has seen heavy fighting.
TALIBAN "RETRIBUTION"
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on Saturday the attack on the base was retribution for the recent killing of several senior Taliban leaders in northern Afghanistan.
The U.S. military command in Kabul said an American air strike had killed a commander, Quari Tayib, and eight other Taliban on April 17.
Mujahid said the attack on the base killed as many as 500 soldiers, including senior commanders.
Four of the attackers were Taliban sympathisers who had infiltrated the army and served for some time, Mujahid said. The Afghan army did not confirm that.
The NATO-led military coalition deploys advisers to the base to train and assist Afghan forces but coalition officials said no foreign troops had been hurt.
U.S. Navy Captain Bill Salvin, spokesperson for the NATO-led Resolute Support mission, said there were a small number of coalition force advisers on the base at the time of the attack.
"They sheltered in place during the incident. The Afghan Special Forces brought the attack to an end," Salvin said.
The commander of coalition forces, U.S. General John Nicholson, said in a statement on Friday that the attack "shows the barbaric nature of the Taliban."
German forces have long led the international mission in northern Afghanistan.
In Berlin, military officials said the work of the mission on the base would be on hold for one or two days while the Afghan army investigated the attack, but would resume.
"The situation shows that we cannot stop supporting, training and advising our Afghan partners," a German Operations Command spokesman said.

While speaking to reporters about the shooting in Alexandria, Virginia, Governor Terry McAuliffe (D) said now is not the time to talk gun control but we must admit “we lose 93 million Americans a day to gun violence.”
McAuliffe said, “This is not what today is about, but there are too many guns on the street.”
Speaking to reporters, he said, “We lose 93 million Americans a day to gun violence. I've long talked about this. Background checks, shutting down gun show loopholes. That's not for today's discussion, but it's not just about politicians. We worry about this every day for all of our citizens.”
A reporter responded, “If it's not for today then why are you bringing it up?”
McAuliffe responded by saying he talks about gun control “every day” because it is “a very serious issue.”
When questioned by a reporter that “93 million is a big number, did you mean to say 93 million?” McAuliffe responded, “93 million… 93 individuals a day.”

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The rival Koreas on Wednesday began two days of friendly basketball games in Pyongyang in their latest goodwill gesture amid a diplomatic push to resolve the nuclear standoff with North Korea.
Female players from North and South Korea were mixed into two teams that competed against each other at the North Korean capital's Ryugyong Jong Ju Yong Gymnasium.
Photos showed a capacity crowd of 12,000 at the arena applauding as the two women's teams — dressed in white jerseys that read "Peace" and green jerseys that read "Prosperity" — marched onto the court holding hands. Team Prosperity defeated Team Peace 103-102, with North Korea's Ro Suk Yong scoring 18 points, according to pool reports.
The men's mixed teams played later in the day.
The South Koreans will play against the North Korean men's and women's teams on Thursday before returning home on Friday.
The games precede a three-day visit to North Korea by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for meetings over the future of the North's nuclear program.
It wasn't immediately clear whether North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, a noted basketball fan, would attend any of the games. Kim wasn't seen at the gymnasium midway into the men's game on Wednesday.
"Once they started playing, the players showed quick chemistry and I was proud of them," said Lee Moon-kyu, the head coach of South Korea's women's team, who will also lead a combined Koreas team at the Asian Games next month in Indonesia. Lee, who plans to bring two or three North Korean players to the Asian Games, said he was impressed with "No. 9 and No. 7 on Team Peace," referring to North Korea's Ri Jong Ok and Jang Mi Kyong.
North Korean sports minister Kim Il Guk said in a speech that the games reflect the "revered determination of the leaders of the North and South to bring forward the future of a self-reliant unification."
The South Korean delegation, including 50 players and government officials, arrived in Pyongyang on Tuesday on two military aircraft.
"It feels like the first time I came here all over again," said Hur Jae, head coach of South Korea's men's national team, who previously visited Pyongyang for a joint game in 2003. Hur, a former guard whose two sons are among the players who traveled to the North, talked about his friendship with retired North Korean player Ri Myong Hun, a 7-foot-9 (2.35-meter) center who anchored the country's national team during the 1990s and early 2000s.
"There was a buzz when I shared a glass of soju and talked with Ri Myong Hun in 2003," Hur said. Ri did not attend a dinner reception for South Korean players on Tuesday, and it wasn't immediately clear whether he was at the games on Wednesday.
The exchanges are the latest result of a diplomatic outreach to the South that Kim announced during his annual New Year's speech. That led to the North's participation in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in February and two summits between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Kim has also met with China's President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump.
The inter-Korean summits have facilitated a slew of goodwill gestures between the Koreas, which have also agreed to field combined teams at the Asian Games.
Basketball diplomacy has something of a history in North Korea.
Former NBA player Dennis Rodman arranged a game in Pyongyang in 2014 for Kim's birthday.
South Korea's Hyundai business group built a basketball stadium in Pyongyang during a previous era of rapprochement between North and South Korea, and a joint game was played there in 2003. Two rounds of inter-Korean basketball games were also played in 1999.
Executive Order Number 17 fulfills the President's campaign promise of elevating the stature of Bisaya heroes
MANILA, Philippines – True to his campaign promise to elevate the stature of Bisaya heroes, President Rodrigo Duterte created the Order of Lapu-Lapu through Executive Order (EO) Number 17.
The EO, released to media on Monday, April 17, states that the Order of Lapu-Lapu is to be awarded to officials, government personnel, and private citizens "in recognition of invaluable or extraordinary service in relation to a campaign or advocacy of the President."
It is divided into 3 types of medals: Lapu-Lapu Medal, Kalasag Medal, and Kampilan Medal.
The Lapu-Lapu Medal will go to those who "contributed significantly" to the success of an activity related to one of Duterte's campaigns or advocacies.
The Kalasag Medal is for individuals who lost their lives or property due to their participation in an activity in line with a Duterte advocacy.
The Kampilan Medal will be conferred on persons who are seriously injured due to their participation in such an activity or event.
Candidates for the Order will be nominated by the heads of agencies in charge of the activity or event. A committee – composed of an official from the Office of the Executive Secretary to serve as head, and two Presidential Management Staff personnel to serve as members – will make the final recommendation to the President on who shall receive the awards.
It can be awarded posthumously, in which case the medal will be accepted by the awardees' legal heirs. If there are no legal heirs, it may be accepted by the nearest of kin.
The Order of Lapu-Lapu is named after the ruler of Mactan, Cebu, who is regarded as the first Filipino hero since he was the first native to resist Spanish colonizers.
During the 2016 presidential campaign, Duterte complained, to great effect, of how Lapu-Lapu has not been honored in the same way other Luzon-based heroes have.
Back then, he promised to create a Lapu-Lapu Day. – Rappler.com

By Gbenga Olarinoye, Osogbo
A Federal High Court, sitting in Osogbo has ordered the National Assembly to immediately commence impeachment process against President Muhammadu Buhari.
Justice Maurine Adaobi Onyetenu Wednesday gave the order based on the suit filed by two Nigerians, Kanmi Ajibola, a lawyer and Sulaiman Adeniyi, a human right activist urging the court to enforce the National Assembly to impeach President Buhari.
The duo had three months ago written to both the lower and the upper chambers of the National Assembly on the need to impeach President Buhari, citing alleged constitutional breaches by the president and threatened that they will approach the court if they fail to act accordingly.
But when the lawmakers refused, they headed for court and filed a suit at the Federal High Court, Osogbo asking for an order of mandamus to compel both the Senate and the House of Representatives to start the impeachment proceedings of President Buhari.
In the suit filed on Tuesday, June 19, 2018, they hinged their arguments on four grounds on why the National Assembly should impeach the Buhari.
In the motion ex-parte, the duo claimed that in flagrant violation of the 1999 constitution, President Buhari contested election, won and was sworn in as the president on the 29th day of May 2015 without possessing the basic constitutional requirement, which would have made him qualified for the contest of the election.
They further alleged that the 4th respondent, which is President Buhari in flagrant violation of section 137 (1) (j) of the 1999 constitution presented a forged certificate to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the purpose of the 2015 presidential election that brought him to the office of the president
“In the light of the 4th Respondent's placement to continue in the office as the president, he has no certificate and basic requirement upon which this placement to continue in the office can be placed.”
Besides, they accused the president of treating the orders of the court with a great disdain and abuses the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria at will, particularly from the angle of the observance of the Federal character as contained in section 14 of the constitution.
“The 4th Respondent on the 29th day of May 2015, took an oath of office, among others, to the effect that, he would rule in accordance to and protect the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, particularly section 14 (2) (b) which stipulates that the security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government.”
“In the contrary, the 4th Respondent has proved to be unable to guarantee the security of lives and properties of the citizens of the federal Republic of Nigeria in fulfillment of his oath of Office. The herdsmen killings of the innocent citizens under the 4th Respondent have been uncountable, unbearable and unprecedented overheating figures in the globe.
“The 4th Respondent in contravention of the due process and sections 80 and 81 of the 1999 constitution spent about $496 Million on the purchase of Tucano Jets without the approval of the National Assembly of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as required by the law.
“The 4th Respondent ordered to be withdrawn, money from the public fund of the Federation without the approval of the National Assembly or the authorization of its act and same used for the purchase of Tucano Jets.
“The 4th Respondent has committed several impeachable offences, that is, gross misconduct.
“By the provision of section 143 of the 1999 constitution, the 1st to 3rd Respondents (The Senate President, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly) have the statutory duty to impeach the 4th Respondent as the president and Commander in – Chief of Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on gross misconduct.
“The 1st to 3rd Respondents have closed their eyes to the gross misconduct of the 4th Respondent.
They told the court that as applicants in the matter, they have the right and duty to compel the 1st and 3rd Respondents to perform their statutory duty of impeachment against the 4th Respondent, having bothered on the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
Citing several constitutional authorities in the written address in support of the motion ex-parte and with 44-paragraph affidavits, the duo posed some questions by putting Nigeria side by side with some developed nations.
“Can the conduct of the 4th Respondent, particularly on the presentation of a forged certificate, be condoned in America or great Britain unchecked?
“Can the 4th Respondent continue to benefits from his act of forgery and infraction of constitution?
“Definitely, an American president cannot be genuinely accused of presentation of a forged certificate and still be allowed to continue as the president, likewise the prime minister of the Great Britain”, they noted.
After moving the application before the, Barrister Ajibola urged the court that with all array of documents before the court, he was of the view that the National Assembly must perform its constitutional duties without fear or favour.
Justice Onyetenu in her ruling granted the application and ordered “that the National Assembly being the 1st,2ndand 3rd respondents commence the impeachment of President Muhammadu Buhari”.
Further hearing of the matter has been fixed to October 30th, 2018.
The software update that is said to boost graphics performance will be available for the P20 and P20 Pro starting August of this year
Published 4:35 PM, July 04, 2018
MANILA, Philippines - Aside from a soon-to-be announced gaming-related phone, Huawei is doubling-down in catering to the growing mobile gaming community by rolling out a software update called GPU Turbo.
The update, first announced in CES Asia 2018, mixes both hardware and software in the way it optimizes a device's graphics processing units (GPU). This means the update can even improve performance for previous generation devices housing older GPUs included in the rollout.
Huawei did not share any numbers or explain how exactly this is done. What they promised is that a number of games – including Arena of Valor and Crossfire – can run in constant 60 frames per second (fps) with the update. They also said the update will increase GPU power by 60% while reducing power consumption by up to 30%.
The company shared an updated rollout schedule for update with the media in an event held in Shenzhen, China.

The Liberals' spring budget pledged free prescription medicine to everyone 24 and under, regardless of their household income or whether they have access to private health insurance through their parents.
This is a massive commitment that starts Jan. 1 and is budgeted to cost $465 million a year.
There are strong arguments for expanding public health care this way.
But it is obvious that as the Ontario government dramatically increases drug coverage, it must get the best value possible for every buck it spends.
Its record as a sound fiscal manager, however, is dismal.
Having driven up the cost of electricity by offering ridiculously generous subsidies for wind and solar generation, the province is borrowing billions of dollars more to give Ontarians rebates on their energy bills.
But as all this is happening, the auditor found Ontario ratepayers had to pay more to help cover as much as $260 million in ineligible power generator expenses.
So as Ontario voters consider all the new policies the Liberals are promising, they should remember how hard the Liberals struggle with the policies they've already put in place.
The warts of every government loom large under an auditor's magnifying glass.
Those of a Liberal government that has more than doubled Ontario's debt seem particularly ugly.
However, considering that government advertising hit a 10-year high of $58 million in 2016-17 and the auditor said 30 per cent of the ads seemed intended to make the government look good, it's likely the Liberals will find some makeup to hide those blemishes.
"It's because of what happens to him that others know they have to toe the line," said New York University historian Jeffrey Sammons. "They can't be seen as defiant or opponents of the system . They know they can't succeed without living up to expectations and being humble, unassuming and supportive of the established order."
Then came along Muhammad Ali, who was not one to toe the line.
Ali was the most visible and influential athlete of his generation when he protested the Vietnam War as racially unjust by refusing to be drafted in 1967, a move that cost him his livelihood, derailing his fighting career for years.
Ali's actions influenced others. Basketball player Abdul-Jabbar boycotted the 1968 Summer Olympics. At the same games, held in Mexico City, American track athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos held raised fists covered in black leather gloves as the national anthem played after winning gold and bronze medals in the 200-meter race.
Abdul-Jabbar, who at 70 represents a bridge between Ali and Kaepernick, went on to a storied NBA career, but Smith and Carlos returned home to the threat of having their medals taken, and faced difficulty finding coaching jobs.
"It was an international stage that was being used to promote how unified and wonderful the world is, but black Americans at that point were still in a very tough struggle to obtain their rights, both human and political," Abdul-Jabbar said of the 1968 games. "The fact that (Smith and Carlos) used an international platform to speak for people who usually don't have any power to be heard made it all the more significant."
Carlos said Mexico City was the only place he could've made such a statement.
"At that time, for me, there was no other vehicle than the Olympic Games," he recalled. "I felt like the humanitarian issues at that time, as well as the humanitarian issues of today, are more compelling to me than an Olympic medal. I love the Olympics and I love sports, but I love a just cause for humanity even greater."
It is a sentiment shared by NFL players.
The killing of mostly unarmed black men by mostly white police officers sparked the Black Lives Matter movement, which has again drawn black athletes into the national conversation on race . The sideline protests in the NFL — started in August 2016 by Kaepernick — have been the most prominent display of players' engagement, though black athletes in baseball and basketball have also had smaller displays of activism.
Because sports are such a prominent aspect of American life, they remain an effective way to bring attention to issues of racial injustice.
"This is our inheritance," said Howard Bryant, senior writer at ESPN and author of the forthcoming book "The Heritage: Black Athletes, A Divided America, and the Politics of Patriotism."
"You're not allowed to check out," Bryant said. "This is going to continue until the United States respects the black brain more than the black body. Then sports can go back to what it was supposed to be — just a game."
Media — and social media in particular — has helped in recruiting athletes to the cause, explained Color of Change Executive Director Rashad Robinson, whose online civil rights organization has joined with athletes in addressing systemic racism and mobilized its membership to boycott the NFL and its corporate sponsors.
Such stands have often come at a cost, even for today's players, who are far more prominent and wealthy than their predecessors. Like players who spoke out before them, they have been met with violence and vitriol, described as unpatriotic, ungrateful and disrespectful.
"The public is used to black guys selling sneakers and making jump shots," said Bryant. "Do white people want to hear what black people have to say? No, they don't. Does it need to be said? Yes."
Abdul-Jabbar agreed, tying Ali's fate to Kaepernick's as two athletes who sacrificed their livelihoods at the height of their careers for a greater cause.
"Anybody that knows anything about football will tell you that he is a talented athlete and should be on somebody's team," Abdul-Jabbar, author of "Becoming Kareem: Growing Up On and Off the Court," said of Kaepernick. "I think he's being blackballed."
But with the cost are also benefits. Using the universal language of sports as a platform to discuss race reveals racism and galvanizes support to end it, Robinson said.
"Part of why people are paying attention is because of exactly who they are," he said. "Throughout time, it has been the people with reputations and something to lose whose risk-taking has helped result in change."

(This story corrects Kamran Afridi's comments to say drone strike was in Afghanistan, not Pakistan)
By Saud Mehsud
DERA ISMAIL KHAN, Pakistan A suspected U.S. drone strike killed several Pakistani Taliban militants in North Waziristan close to the Afghanistan border, one militant commander and multiple intelligence sources said on Thursday.
If confirmed, the air strike, which happened on Wednesday, would only be the second drone attack inside the nuclear-armed nation since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January.
But one regional Pakistani official disputed the location, saying it was inside Afghanistan.
Abdullah Wazirstani, spokesman for North Waziristan Taliban, a group linked to the Pakistani Taliban, said the strike killed three civilian "labourers" and seven militants from the Pakistani Taliban, which is also known as TTP.
Malik Waheedullah, a local tribal leader, told Reuters he saw two missiles strike a mountain home which caught fire. "I drove away as fast as I could," he said.
U.S. officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
One Pakistani intelligence official and government source said they believed the strike to be a U.S. drone attack.
Multiple other Pakistani intelligence and military sources, as well as those from Islamist groups, told Reuters the drone attack occurred inside Pakistan, close to the Afghanistan border.
But Kamran Afridi, who holds the post of 'political agent' in North Waziristan, disputed the location of the attack.
"It was not on our soil," said Afridi.
North Waziristan was a Taliban stronghold until 2014, when Pakistan's military launched a major offensive against the group and pushed many of its fighters across the border into Afghanistan.
Sources from the TTP identified one of the dead militants as Abdur Rahman, a senior commander of the Pakistani Taliban.
U.S. drone attacks inside Pakistan have become rare over the past few years. In its last high-profile attack inside Pakistan, the United States last May killed Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour in the southwestern province of Baluchistan.

FRANKFURT, April 12 European prompt power prices on Wednesday fell as wind power output in Germany held up and consumption began to ease in the run-up to the Easter holiday period.
* Traders said the two factors offset the impact of strikes in France and falling temperatures.
* French baseload power for Thursday delivery was down 3.4 percent on the day to 35.75 euros ($37.96) per megawatt-hour (MWh).
* The German day-ahead contract was down 1.4 percent to 29.1 euros/MWh.
* French state-controlled utility EDF said it had received notice of another strike by workers on Wednesday. Ongoing rolling protests since January in a dispute over wages and benefits have taken small volumes out of the market, but without much impact on prices.
* French nuclear power availability is currently at 72.6 percent of capacity.
* German production from wind turbines is likely to stay above 20 gigawatts (GW) on Thursday compared with Wednesday levels recorded at 20.4 GW, a little less than half of total capacity, Thomson Reuters data showed.
* Power demand will fall by 1.4 GW in both countries together to 113.4 GW on Thursday and ease sharply between April 14 and 17, when most businesses close.
* Along the forward curve, the German Cal '18 benchmark price gained 0.7 percent to 29.8 euros/MWh, taking support from firmer fuels and carbon prices.
* The equivalent French contract did not trade after closing at 34.90 euros.
* Coal cif Europe 2018 gained 1.8 percent to $65.70 per tonne.
* EU carbon emissions rights prices rose 0.4 percent to 4.89 euros per tonne.
* In eastern Europe, the Czech power contract for Thursday did not trade after a 28.75 euros close. The year-ahead position mirrored its more liquid German counterpart, clocking up a 1.4 percent gain to 29.8 euros/MWh. ($1 = 0.9419 euros) (Reporting by Vera Eckert, editing by Jason Neely)
Gilas Pilipinas remains unscathed and sweeps Group B in the tourney
Published 10:49 PM, August 13, 2017
MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Gilas Pilipinas proved to be too strong as they dominated from start to finish to hand Qatar its 3rd consecutive defeat, 80-74, in the 2017 FIBA Asia Cup on Sunday, August 13 in Beirut, Lebanon.
Team Pilipinas – who played in a stadium filled with supporters – remained unscathed with a 3-0 win-loss record to move ahead to the quarterfinals of the tourney.
Philippines ran over Qatar early in the first quarter to take a 25-16 lead behind Matthew Wright's solo 8-0 run including back-to-back triples and never looked back.
Calvin Abueva slipped and hurt his left ankle but Carl Bryan Cruz proved to be reliable for Gilas' backcourt offense as he shot shot two three-pointers and locked in 4 straight points to end the second period, 41-27.
Gilas Pilipinas started with 10 turnovers compared to Qatar's 6 but intensified their defense to force them into committing 6 more errors, ending with a total of 12 versus the Philippines' 11 turnovers.
Qatar stepped up its game in the second half and trimmed Philippines' lead to 9 points but Wright made sure to take away Qatar's hope of bagging a win, closing the 3rd with a trey to push a 59-47 lead.
Yehia Abdelhaleem sank in a shot from beyond the arc to complete a 10-2 run for Qatar but Terrence Romeo and Wright fired off lethal three-pointers of their own to seal the win for the Philippines.
The sharpshooter Wright finished with 25 points, two assists and a steal while Cruz added 13 markers.
Norwood and Romeo contributed 10 apiece to sweep the group phase of the tournament.
Pint-sized Mansour Elhadary gave 23 markers, 6 dishes and 3 boards in a losing effort for Qatar.
The FIBA Asia Cup quarterfinals is scheduled to happen on Wednesday.
The scores:
Philippines (80) – Wright 25, Cruz 13, Romeo 10, Norwood 10, William 6, Pogoy 5, Almazan 4, Aguilar 3, Jalalon 2, Fajardo 0, Standhardinger 0
Qatar (74) – Elhadary 23, Saad 18, Erfan 9, Abdelhaleem 8, Mohamed 6, Al-Muftah 6, Mohamed 6, Mohmmed 4, Al-Darwish 0, Salem 0, Abdelkawy, 0, Al-Rayes 0
Quarter scores: 25-16, 41-27, 59-47, 80-74

South Korean taekwondo athletes have performed for Pope Francis, after a planned show of Korean unity at the Vatican fell apart when the North pulled out at the last minute.
Pope Francis didn't seem to notice or mind, thanking the athletes Wednesday for their exhibition “which was a show of the will for peace, the two Koreas together.”
South Korea's World Taekwondo organization, the Seoul-led international body, said last week that a demonstration team from the North withdrew from the performance over the U.S.-South Korean military drills.
The performance had been planned to ceremonially open the World Taekwondo's Grand Prix competition this week in Rome.
The South's team performed for thousands of people in St. Peter's Square and featured a young girl releasing a dove in a sign of peace.

Caroline Wozniacki has made another early exit from Wimbledon.
The Australian Open champion lost 6-4, 1-6, 7-5 to Ekaterina Makarova of Russia in a second-round match after being bothered by a swarm of flying insects in the second set.
Wozniacki has never been past the round of 16 at Wimbledon, and this is the fourth time in seven years she has lost in the first or second round.
The second-seeded Dane saved four match points at 5-3 in the final set before breaking back to level the match. But she was broken again in the last game.
Organizers used bug spray after Wozniacki complained to the chair umpire about the insects.
She is the fifth of the top eight women seeds to lose before the third round.
___
5:45 p.m.
Serena Williams continued her Wimbledon return by moving into the third round with an emphatic 6-1, 6-4 win over Viktoriya Tomova.
The seven-time champion lost just five of 32 points on her first serve as she took a little over an hour to triumph against her 135th-ranked opponent.
Williams was unable to defend her 2016 Wimbledon title last year because she was pregnant.
Despite her ranking having fallen to 181, Williams is seeded 25th this year.
The 36-year-old American next faces German Tatjana Maria or Kristina Mladenovic of France.

Second-seeded Caroline Wozniacki is battling a difficult opponent and a swarm of flying bugs at Wimbledon.
The Australian Open champion complained to the chair umpire about the bugs that invaded No. 1 Court after she lost the first set 6-4 against Ekaterina Makarova of Russia. After shaking her head repeatedly on court to get the flying insects out of her hair, the Dane asked for bug spray to be used.
That seemed to do the trick — at least when it came to improving her own game. Wozniacki won the second set 6-1 to level the match.

4:25 p.m.
Gael Monfils overcame Paolo Lorenzi 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (5), 7-6 (3) to set up a third-round meeting with 2017 Wimbledon semifinalist Sam Querrey.
After hitting just four winners in the opening set, the 44th-ranked Monfils improved to a total of 49 for the match and reached the third round at the England Club for the seventh time in his career.
The Frenchman has never been beyond that stage and to do so will have to defeat 11th-seeded Querrey.
Querrey earlier eased past Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky 7-6 (4), 6-3, 6-3 to advance to the third round for a third successive year.
Last year Querrey defeated Andy Murray to reach his first Grand Slam semifinal, where he was defeated by Marin Cilic.

4:15 p.m.
Roger Federer won 35 straight points on his own serve en route to beating Lukas Lacko of Slovakia 6-4, 6-4, 6-1 in the second round of Wimbledon.
Federer didn't drop a point on his serve in the entire second set and kept that streak going until he was 30-0 up at 4-1 in the third, when Lacko sent a backhand winner down the line.
In total, the eight-time champion lost just nine of 61 points on his serve and broke Lacko five times, including with a forehand winner to close out the match.

Kyle Edmund is facing some unexpected conflict as he prepares for his second-round match at Wimbledon.
And it's got everything to do with the World Cup.
Edmund is English. His coach, Fredrik Rosengren, is Swedish. Guess which two nations play each other in the World Cup quarterfinals in Russia on Saturday?
On Wednesday, a day after England and Sweden set up their match with victories, the 21st-seeded Edmund posted a photo to his Twitter account, showing him and Rosengren at practice — posing in a fighting position and each wearing his nation's soccer jersey.
"When your coach is a Swede and you tell him it's coming home. let's go England!" Edmund posted, referring to the slogan his country's fans have been using to suggest their team will win the World Cup.
If he beats Bradley Klahn of the U.S. on Thursday, Edmund will be hoping his third-round match on Saturday is scheduled at a time that doesn't conflict with a certain soccer match.

3:15 p.m.
Five-time Wimbledon champion Venus Williams once again dropped the opening set, and once again dominated the rest of the way to win.
The No. 9 seed, at 38 the oldest woman in the draw, came back to beat 141st-ranked qualifier Alexandra Dulgheru of Romania 4-6, 6-0, 6-1 to reach the third round at the England Club.
Williams got broken in the first game and did not recover in the opening set, in which she made 12 unforced errors, twice as many as Dulgheru. Nine of those were errant forehands.
But the American, the runner-up at Wimbledon a year ago, then won seven games in a row.
In the first round, Williams started by ceding a tiebreaker against 58th-ranked Johanna Larsson before taking 12 of the last 15 games.

3:05 p.m.
Lucas Pouille became the latest seeded player to exit the men's draw at Wimbledon after a 6-4, 6-2, 6-7 (8), 3-6, 6-2 defeat to Austrian qualifier Dennis Novak.
The 17th-seeded Pouille saved two match points in the third-set tiebreaker before eventually forcing a fifth set, but Novak regrouped to reach the third round of a Grand Slam for the first time.
The 171st-ranked Novak defeated Peter Polansky on Monday to record the first Grand Slam victory of his career.
Novak will next face 2016 Wimbledon runner-up Milos Raonic, who hit 34 aces in his 7-6 (4), 7-6 (4), 7-6 (4) victory over John Millman.
___
2:40 p.m.
Karolina Pliskova advanced to the third round of Wimbledon for the first time with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Victoria Azarenka.
Seventh-seeded Pliskova didn't face a break point as she cruised through a meeting of the two former No.1-ranked players on Centre Court.
It was the sixth time in seven main draw appearances at Wimbledon that 2016 U.S. Open runner-up Pliskova had advanced to the second round, but she had previously failed to go any further.
Two-time Australian Open champion Azarenka was vulnerable on her second serve throughout, winning just seven of 18 points on it.
Pliskova will next face 29th-seeded Mihaela Buzarnescu, after the Romanian defeated British wildcard Katie Swan 6-0, 6-3.
___
2:25 p.m.
Milos Raonic hit 34 aces to beat John Millman of Australia in straight sets and reach the third round at Wimbledon.
The 2016 runner-up won 7-6 (4), 7-6 (4), 7-6 (4) in a match that only featured one break of serve for each player in the second set.
Raonic reached the third round for a sixth straight year, having lost to eventual champion Roger Federer in last year's quarterfinals.

Wimbledon's commercial director has no issues with Roger Federer pulling off a marketing coup on Centre Court.
Federer drew headlines around the world when he walked onto the court wearing a Uniqlo outfit on Monday for his opening match after ending his decades-long partnership with Nike. It was the first time the eight-time Wimbledon champion had worn the brand publicly, but organizers said he didn't violate any of their strict rules in regards to using the tournament for marketing purposes.
"I guess it was like a huge reveal, wasn't it?" said Mick Desmond, the commercial and media director for the England Club. "That's absolutely fine. It's obviously a marketing coup for Roger. ... We set the stage, he's done a reveal."
Desmond said he was not aware of Federer's plans, though tournament staff check all players' kits before the tournament to make sure they don't violate any rules.
"Providing you're adhering to the specifications in terms of the all-white rule and the amount of measurement in terms of branding, then that's fine," Desmond said. "It would have been checked by the club in terms of a technical perspective. From a commercial perspective, that's his business."

1:05 p.m.
Mihaela Buzarnescu of Romania has become the first player to book a place in the third round of Wimbledon.
The 29th-seeded Buzarnescu beat Katie Swan of Britain 6-0, 6-3, clinching the match with a backhand winner on No. 3 Court. She was joined in the third round minutes later by 10th-seeded Madison Keys of the United States, who dispatched Luksika Kumkhum of Thailand 6-4, 6-3.
Buzarnescu is making her first appearance at the grass-court Grand Slam, having risen from 213th in the rankings a year ago to No. 28. Swan, ranked 204th, was given a wild-card entry to the tournament.
Keys reached the quarterfinals in 2015 but lost in the second round last year.
___
11:45 a.m.
Play is underway on Day 3 at Wimbledon, with former finalist Milos Raonic of Canada among the early starters as the second round begins at the England Club.
The 13th-seeded Raonic was playing John Millman of Australia as he bids to reach the third round for a sixth straight year. He lost the 2016 final to Andy Murray and reached the quarterfinals last year.
No. 10 Madison Keys of the United States was the highest-seeded woman in early action, playing Luksika Kumkhum of Thailand.
Roger Federer and Serena Williams were both set to play on Centre Court later.
___
10:45 a.m.
Roger Federer and Serena Williams are both back on Centre Court at Wimbledon on Wednesday as they look to advance to the third round.
Federer will play Lukas Lacko of Slovakia as he continues his quest for a record-extending ninth title at the England Club. Williams then faces Bulgarian qualifier Viktoriya Tomova as she goes for a 16th straight match win at the tournament — having missed last year while pregnant.
Australian Open champion Caroline Wozniacki and last year's men's runner-up, Marin Cilic, are also back in action as they try to avoid more upsets at the tournament. Three of the top-10 seeded men lost in the first round, while former champions Maria Sharapova and Petra Kvitova also went out on Tuesday.
The forecast calls for more sunny skies, although there is a 30 per cent chance of rain showers in the afternoon.

LONDON, April 7 U.S. coal producers can look forward to an increase in production and jobs during 2017/18 as the industry recovers from the depression of 2015/16.
The medium-term outlook remains challenging but some of the short-term problems that tipped the industry into crisis over the last two years are abating.
Coal production slumped from 1 billion tons in 2014 to just 739 million tons in 2016, according to the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration.
The average number of operators and contractors employed at the coal mines (excluding office staff) fell from 111,000 in 2014 to just 78,000 in 2016.
But production increased by almost 35 million tons in the third quarter of 2016, around 22 percent, according to the latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
And production is likely to have increased further in the fourth quarter, when the figures are published next month.
The increase in output should start to boost employment, with at least some of the 33,000 employees and contractors laid off between 2014 and 2016 likely to be rehired.
PERFECT STORM
Coal producers were hit by a perfect storm of warm weather and a huge oversupply of natural gas during 2015/16.
The three months between December 2015 and February 2016 were the warmest winter on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Electricity generation fell by 4 percent compared with the same period a year earlier than warm temperatures cut heating demand.
But natural gas production was more than 2 percent higher than the previous winter as a result of the shale revolution.
Gas stocks at the end of February 2016 hit a seasonal record and were more than 50 percent higher than at the same point a year earlier.
By March 2016, the average cost of gas delivered to power producers plunged to a low of just $2.23 per million British thermal units, down from $3.55 a year earlier.
Gas was cheaper than coal for all but one month between November 2015 and June 2016, adjusting prices for the different efficiency of gas and coal-fired power plants.
The result was an enormous switch in power generation away from coal and toward natural gas during 2015 and 2016.
The average coal-fired power plant was running around 61 percent of the time in 2014 but that declined to 55 percent in 2015 and 53 percent in 2016.
By contrast, the average gas-fired power plant was generating just 48 percent of the time in 2014 but that increased to 56 percent in both 2015 and 2016.
Lower generation rates left electricity producers with a big and unwanted increase in coal in their stockyards in 2015/16.
Coal stocks held by power producers rose from a low of 118 million tons in March 2014 to a peak of 196 million tons in December 2015.
By November and December 2016, power producers' coal stocks were more than 40 million tons or around 30 percent higher than a year earlier.
As power producers attempted to limit the stock build and cut new orders, the mining sector was pushed into a crisis, with mines closing and laying off thousands of operators and contractors.
RECOVERY SIGNS
After a terrible 2015 and start to 2016, coal producers have good reasons to expect the worst of the industry's recession is over.
Natural gas production has been falling year-on-year since May 2016 and gas prices have been on an upward trend since March 2016.
Gas has become steadily more expensive than coal. The delivered cost of gas moved above coal in July 2016 and by January 2017 gas was almost twice as expensive.
Power producers have responded by switching back from gas toward coal. Gas-fired power plants operated around 51 percent of the time in January 2017 down from 57 percent in January 2016.
Coal-fired power plants operated around 59 percent of the time in January 2017 up from 56 percent in January 2016.
Power producers' gas consumption has been declining year-on-year since October 2016 while coal consumption has been rising.
Critically, the overhang of coal stocks at power plants is clearing, with inventories back down to 157 million tons by the end of January and 30 million tons below a year earlier.
U.S. coal exports also jumped in the fourth quarter to 19.3 million tons up from 12.6 million tons in the third quarter, the highest level since April-June 2015.
FUEL SWITCHING
The short-term outlook for the coal sector remains positive with gas prices for the summer of 2017 rising strongly.
Gas stocks have ended the winter looking much tighter than at this point in 2016 and the futures market has moved into a big backwardation between 2017 and 2018.
Future prices for gas delivered at Henry Hub in June 2017 have risen almost 19 percent from $2.86 on Feb. 22 to $3.40 on April 6.
Gas for delivery in June 2017 is trading at premium of 53 cents per million British thermal units compared with June 2018, up from a premium of just 9 cents on Feb. 22.
Higher gas prices will encourage power producers to limit gas consumption as much as possible this summer and run coal-fired power plants for more hours which should support a significant increase in coal demand.
The coal industry's problems have not gone away but this year should feel much more positive than the last two years for coal companies and workers.

Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney is confident he can play on at the highest level for another two to three years despite spending a significant part of the current campaign either on the bench or out injured.
Rooney has made 31 appearances for United this season, most of which as a substitute, with manager Jose Mourinho relying more on top goalscorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic before a knee injury ended the 35-year-old's season.
Rooney, who played his fourth match in three months in United's 2-0 win over Burnley on Sunday, has also suffered recurring injuries throughout the season.
Asked if he could continue playing for another two to three years, Rooney told SkySports, "Yes. Even longer I think. Everyone mentions that age, I'm 31, not an old person. Of course, I've played a lot of game."
"Who knows, not playing so many games this season might benefit me."
Rooney said his experience could help United end the season strongly as they target a Europa League triumph and a top four finish in the league.
"I feel I can contribute quality, composure, experience, and know-how, how to get over the line, whether it's to win the league or finish top four or get to the final. That's a lot of experience I can contribute to the team," he said.
"Of course it's good to be back. I want to be back playing, and hopefully between now and the end of the season and leave a mark on the games I play."
Rooney said he was concentrating on performing to his best until the end of the season amid media reports linking him to a move away from Old Trafford.
"My focus at the minute is helping us reach the Europa League final, and to win it, and help us get to the top four. That's my focus at the minute," Rooney added.
"I think I've got a lot to offer, and as I keep saying, I'm looking forward to these next few games, get a few under my belt, and get to where I want to be at the end of the season and see what happens there."

“Kim and Kylie live very close to each other and spend a lot of time together. Kylie brings Stormi to Kim's house,” an insider recently told PEOPLE. “Stormi is around the other kids, including Chicago.”

Speaking of Chicago, Kardashian West shared a new photo of her 9-week-old on St. Patrick's Day, which was also the same day as brother Rob Kardashian‘s 31st birthday.
“Morning cutie,” the mother of three captioned a photo of her youngest child wearing long-sleeved, button-up, pink pajamas and a white quilted bib.
While West has been “excited” about expanding his family, his wife recently told Elle that she won't be having more than four children.
Though she said “my home and my heart feel really full right now,” she's not ruling out another child. “I don't think I could handle more than that. My time is spread really thin,” she revealed. “And I think it's important that in all couples, the mom gives the husband as much attention as the kids.”

Bath Rugby came close but not quite close enough to being only the second team after Saracens to beat Toulon in the Champions Cup at Stade Felix Mayol.
They don't have to wait long for a shot at revenge though - the two sides meet again at the Rec on Saturday.
Rugby writer Daniel Evans has picked out a handful of talking points from the 24-20 defeat...
1. Width is the way to go…
Toulon is a big side. Their centres are the size of forwards. Their wingers are not far off.
Bath looked at their most dangerous and had the most attacking joy when they kept the ball in hand and got it out wide early.
A couple of swift, accurate passes and they were in behind their hosts with Aled Brew in the first half the main instigator of damage.
If they can do that again at the Rec – in both halves of the game rather than just one – there's no reason why they can't get swift revenge.

2. The rise of Beno continues to gather pace...
In about seven months, Beno Obano has gone from being an impact sub to a worthy loosehead starter who does not look at all out of place mixing it with some of the best in Europe.
All aspects of his game have come on rapidly and the most impressive are his fitness and workrate.
He's not far off Tom Dunn – arguably the hardest-working front-rower in the Premiership – in terms of his tackling tallies in recent weeks.
If he can reign in the big hits a little bit – they're not always timed perfectly which can lead to missed tackles – he should get even better.
Argentine international Lucas Noguera Paz and traditional first-choice Nathan Catt (currently recovering from back surgery) are really going to struggle to get the shirt off Obano.
3. Stick with the same front five…
As a unit, the front-rowers were excellent. They worked incredibly hard in defence, carried effectively and spearheaded Bath's pack on their way to four scrum penalties.
When Nick Auterac and Henry Thomas – who looked very sharp considering he hadn't played for two months – came on there was no let up in the intensity.
Behind them, Luke Charteris and Elliott Stooke formed a solid partnership too, backed up by replacement Charlie Ewels.
Barring injury, there is no need to make any changes in the front five for the return match.
Taulupe Faletau is expected to be out with his knee injury so if Sam Underhill is fit, he can slot in at openside and Paul Grant - who played well again - can switch to number eight.
4. Bastareaud should be cited…
The Toulon captain's “clearout” from the side of a ruck on Faletau should not only have been a penalty, it was a clear act of foul play and should be treated as such by the citing officer.
It resulted in another knee ligament injury for the Welsh international – his third during his time at Bath – which could keep him out for a while.
To be hit like that by a player of Bastareaud's size (about 19st) could cause a season-ending injury or even worse.

5. Chris Ashton is not a full-back…
Toulon's decision to switch Chris Ashton to full-back has reaped dividends in terms of tries this season, but there are key aspects of full-back play he needs to brush up on.
Number one, of course, is his kicking. Not only did he slice one badly to gift Jonathan Joseph a try, he also put Bath in a good attacking position with a horribly pulled touch kick.
Stick the lethal finisher back on the wing where he belongs.
UNITED NATIONS, April 28 United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the U.N. Security Council on Friday that he is alarmed by the risk of military escalation on the Korean Peninsula.
"The absence of communication channels with the DPRK (North Korea) is dangerous," he told the 15-member council. "We need to avoid miscalculation and misunderstanding. We need to act now to prevent conflict and achieve sustainable peace." (Reporting by Michelle Nichols and Lesley Wroughton; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
0 Man shot in head by wife after Google search ended in argument, deputies say
FERNANDINA BEACH, Fla. - A prominent Florida businessman was allegedly shot in the head by his wife in a Fernandina Beach home during an argument that erupted over a Google search, the Nassau County Sheriff's Office said.

The alleged shooter, his wife Lawanda Brown, 57, told authorities she and her husband own a consulting business and use the loft of their home as an office.
She said while the pair were in the office on Tuesday, her husband asked her to do a Google search for a template on a project they were working on.
Brown said her husband seemed displeased with her and did not appear happy while she was doing the search.
Deputies were called to the couple's home around 1:30 p.m. and when they arrived they found Brown on the floor in a pool of blood with a gunshot wound to the back of his head, investigators said.
Tony Brown was airlifted to UF Health Hospital in Jacksonville with critical injuries, deputies said, but his condition has been upgraded to serious.
He is able to talk and communicate, authorities said.
A .38 caliber handgun was found in a bedroom in the home.

Forest fire crew packs up at the end of a day's work. Politicians should not wear this uniform. (B.C. Wildfire Service)
I'm just back from vacation and a drive from Victoria to Prince George last week to visit relatives. Here are a few observations.
• The closure of Highway 97 through the South Cariboo forced northbound traffic to the Coquihalla and up Highway 5 to Little Fort, then west on Highway 24 to rejoin 97 just south of 100 Mile House. Blackened tree trunks are still visible near Barriere and McLure, north of Kamloops, where fires burned for 75 days in 2003, forcing the evacuation of 3,800 people.
The one visible roadside scar from this year's fires was near Williams Lake, where a brush fire ran up to one of the many widening and paving projects underway this summer. The broad construction area acted as a firebreak and only a small spot burned on the other side before the fire was put out.
• Smoke was visible in the Prince George area, but it wasn't until south of Quesnel that the brown haze and strong smell settled in. Air conditions were worst at Kamloops and Merritt, where smoke followed river valleys while trapped in an extended high-pressure system. A haze was still visible when I returned to Victoria, and when I started my car the next day, the smell from the air vents was a reminder of conditions in the Interior.
• Vancouver media went from bad to worse as they grew bored with the struggles of far-off towns and farms. Among many errors by drama-seeking urban outlets, the CBC announced the rescinding of an evacuation order for Princeton, which was never evacuated. Then for days the people's network flogged the story of a back-burn gone wrong on Hart Ridge Mountain south of Clinton, after the wind shifted suddenly.
The tone of the coverage suggested a reckless, inept effort by the B.C. Wildfire Service, with sound-bites from an angry rancher who went to media instead of filing his damage claim with the province. The unfairness to exhausted firefighting crews seemed lost on them, or unimportant next to the media craving for conflict.
Worst of all was TV coverage of a family's return to the burned-out mobile home park near Ashcroft. Zoom in on the crying, that's gold for a jaded urban audience. If that's what they put their effort into, they should stay home and do another bike lane story instead.
• Speaking of disaster porn, Al Gore cited the B.C. fires during the Toronto stop of the promotional tour for his latest movie, An Inconvenient Sequel. That's the follow-up to his 2006 docu-drama that predicted an ice-free Arctic by 2014, the breakup of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, and other dire events that have not materialized.
• B.C. statistics aren't complete yet, but measuring by area burned, this year likely won't even be close to the record in 1958. Nationally, Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre statistics show so far in 2017, area burned across Canada is far below 1989, 1994, 1995 and 2014.
• On the NDP government's second political tour of the fire zone, Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth, Forests Minister Doug Donaldson and North Coast MLA Jennifer Rice posed for pictures wearing the red uniform of the B.C. Forest Service. Pro tip for next time: don't put on a uniform you haven't earned the right to wear.
They did their helicopter tour and photo opportunity with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who delayed his visit to B.C. until he could attend a lucrative party fundraiser in Vancouver.

* Dlr/yen slumps to 5-mth low
* Trump says prefers low interest rates
* Trump comments raise wariness over Treasury's currency report
* Graphic: World FX rates in 2017 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh
By Jemima Kelly
LONDON, April 13 The dollar recovered from a two-week low against a broad index on Thursday, having slid after U.S. President Donald Trump said the currency was getting too strong and that he would prefer the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low.
The greenback and U.S. Treasury yields took a heavy hit after Trump's comments to the Wall Street Journal, in which he said the strength of the economy would hurt the dollar.
But after losing 0.6 percent on Wednesday - its biggest one-day fall in over three weeks - the dollar recovered on Thursday, trading up 0.3 percent on the day by 1150 GMT.
Having hit a five-month low of 108.73 in early Asian trading, the dollar steadied at 109.14 yen.
"This is a little bit of a correction of the move we saw overnight following the comments from Trump," said Commerzbank currency strategist Thu Lan Nguyen, in Frankfurt. "Yes, it was negative what he said...but it's not a big surprise – it wasn't a U-turn in his rhetoric on the exchange rate so far,"
"The question is: is he able to influence monetary policy in order to get a weaker dollar? That is still an open question."
Trump's comments broke with a long-standing practice of both U.S. Democratic and Republican administrations refraining from commenting on policy set by the independent Federal Reserve. It is also unusual for a president to talk about the value of the dollar, a subject usually left to the U.S. Treasury secretary.
The comments were seen by markets as a fresh reminder of the president's protectionist trade rhetoric, which has been a source of concern for dollar bulls.
"Bearing in mind the administration's continued verbal intervention in the FX market, we think that any near-term rallies in the dollar could stay relatively limited, despite the Fed raising rates at a moderate pace," said IronFX analyst Sakis Paraskevov in Cyprus.
The dollar has shed 2 percent against the yen so far this week, with the safe-haven Japanese currency on a bullish footing because of a rise in geopolitical tensions.
Investors are concerned about the upcoming French presidential election as well as possible U.S. military action against Syria and North Korea and an escalation of tensions with Russia.
That Trump seemed unmoved by the already significant weakening of the dollar against the yen increased nervousness about the U.S. Treasury's semi-annual currency report due Friday, and next week's U.S.-Japan bilateral dialogue.
The euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.0626.
The dollar was on track for its third straight day of losses against China's yuan, after rising to a one-month high at the start of the week.

BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Little Ruya Kadir had sparkling eyes, a few basic belongings and not much else when she arrived in Boise, Idaho more than two years ago.
But at just six months old, she had the most important thing: A mother who loved her so fiercely that she left behind her homeland, her husband and everything she knew so Ruya would grow up in a safe place.
Ruya was at her third birthday party — complete with a pink doll-shaped cake and a Disney princess banner — Saturday evening when a man armed with a large knife attacked. Ruya and five other children were badly injured, along with the three adults who tried to protect them.
Timmy Kinner, a 30-year-old homeless man who had briefly been a guest at the apartment complex where Ruya lived, has been charged with first-degree murder and several other felonies in connection with the attack.
And Ruya's mother Bifituu Kadir is mourning her little girl, slain in the very community that was supposed to keep her safe.
Police say Kinner had recently been asked to leave the apartment complex because of bad behavior. They say the attack does not appear to be a hate crime.
"I remember Ruya when she was just a little bundle in my arms," said Megan Schwab, an employment specialist with the International Rescue Committee who befriended Bifituu and Ruya when they first arrived in Boise as Ethiopian refugees in December 2015.
"It was a very long journey, not something she talks about a lot but I do know she was fleeing violence," Schwab said. "She was alone with her little baby and very strong ... she had a lot of resolves to protect her baby and create a new life for them."
From the very first meeting, Bifituu and Schwab would pass baby Ruya back and forth as they filled out job applications and other paperwork aimed at getting the Kadir family properly settled in. When Schwab realized Bifituu had virtually no baby gear in her one-bedroom apartment, she found them hand-me-down furnishings and clothes.
Bifituu's home was "always a monument to Ruya," full of things the child loved, Schwab said.
"She loved shopping and dressing up very fashionably just like her mother," she said. "Disney princesses were her favorite, and anything at all that was pink."
Schwab saw Ruya just a month before the party, and was struck by how much she had grown. No longer toddling, Ruya flitted through the room where Schwab and Bifituu were talking. She stopped a moment, fixed her big, long-lashed eyes on Schwab and smiled. Then she dashed off in a game of chase with neighborhood kids.
On Monday morning, Schwab saw Ruya and Bifituu again, this time in a Salt Lake City hospital. She and other close friends were there to say goodbye to their sparkling little girl.
"I will say I was very privileged to be able to be there," Schwab said, her eyes filling with tears. "Her mom is very strong and ... the community really surrounded her to help her move through those last moments and help her begin the stages of grief."
One other child injured in the attack has since been released from the hospital, but some of the remaining seven victims face long roads to recovery, said Julianne Donnelly Tzul, the executive director of the IRC of Boise. All of the injured were refugees from Ethiopia, Syria and Iraq.
"I can't identify who got what," Donnelly Tzul said. "But there are slashes to faces requiring surgery and reconstructive surgery. There is at least one spinal injury that might cause paralysis to some degree, and lots of stab and puncture wounds."
Many have reached out to help, including Boise's Muslim community and other religious and social groups. But a crime as horrific as this one means the refugee families will have needs that stretch into the coming years, not just the next few weeks, Donnelly Tzul said.
Some of the injured do not have health insurance, and some of the others require medical care that isn't covered. They will also need counseling and many are losing work time, making it hard to cover basic living expenses. And some will need to find new places to live for their own mental health, said Donnelly Tzul, and so will need help with relocation expenses such as first months' rent and a deposit.
The International Rescue Committee has launched an online fundraiser for those looking to help.
With luck, Bifituu's husband will be able to join her in Boise. The IRC is working with immigration services and government officials to try to get him to the U.S.
"Arrangements have been made to bring Ruya back to Boise," Schwab said, "so that her mom can still be with her baby here."
THE CLOSURE and rehabilitation of Boracay is seen to cost the economy some P1.96 billion in six months, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) said Tuesday, Apr. 24.
But, “(i)n terms of the amount, the reduction in GDP (gross domestic product) itself will amount to around P980 million only, so it's a small amount,” Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto M. Pernia told reporters Tuesday, Apr. 24 on the sidelines of the Development Budget Coordination Committee meeting Tuesday, Apr. 24.
Mr. Pernia clarified that the P980 million is what the economy would lose per quarter. If the rehabilitation of Boracay would extend up to six months, it would cause the economy to lose P1.96 billion.
But he also said there would be tourists and businesses transferring to other tourist spots which would temper the loss from Boracay's closure.
“Boracay and Aklan, they will suffer and also their growth rates will be trimmed…. But then on the other hand there will be other areas in the Visayas earning some increase in growth rates (and) also Luzon and Mindanao will have some increase,” Mr. Pernia said.
“I would assume closer to 70 to 75% of those who used to go to Boracay will go to other tourist destinations,” he added.
The overall impact on the economy would result in a 0.1% deduction. The economy grew 6.7% in 2017.
“We are motivated to work harder especially the DoT (Department of Tourism) to step up its effort to attract more tourists in the country to other destinations and advertise other destinations,” said Mr. Pernia.
The NEDA has said some workers who will lose their jobs as a result of the closure may participate in the government's clean-up drive.
Also on Tuesday, Presidential Spokesperson Harry L. Roque, Jr. said President Rodrigo R. Duterte may sign the executive order (EO) placing Boracay Island under a state of calamity before he leaves for Singapore to attend the 32nd Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit on April 27 to 28.
“I'm sure he'll have to sign [it] before leaving for Singapore, because [it] is the first day that Boracay will be closed to tourists,” Mr. Roque said in an interview with CNN.
Yet in his briefing at the Palace, Mr. Roque gave no details even when repeatedly asked.
“Well, wala pa (none yet). But come on, it's just a matter of the President signing it. Okay? The people have been told, they know that there will be a closure; there will be a declaration of state of natural calamity. It's just a matter of the President signing the documents, and it can be signed any time now. Okay?” Mr. Roque told reporters.
Also in his television interview, Mr. Roque said the state of proclamation is only needed for purposes of fast-tracking procurement.
He added: “But government officials are already at it. In fact, we had a final inter-agency Cabinet level meeting to spell out the different obligations of the different departments. The DoLE (Department of Labor and Employment) and DSWD (Department of Social Welfare and Development) will be at the forefront of providing stop gap measures as far as loss of income is concerned; DENR (Department of Environment and Natural Resources) of course will spearhead the master plan of rehabilitating the island; Tourism is already initiating the task of coordinating with airlines and ensuring the tourists will come back after the closure, things like that.”
The spokesman also pointed out that he himself has asked the Boracay inter-agency task force to ease media restrictions in the island.
For its part, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) will be updating the master plan on Boracay to include neighboring islands around Northern Aklan.
In a statement on Tuesday, Environment Secretary Roy A. Cimatu said the revision of the master plan, which will be undertaken during the six month-long closure, will be done to boost tourism revenues.
“Within that period, we intend to put in place what we might call the ‘First aid' solution to Boracay's problems: […] putting the sewage and solid waste systems in place; demolish illegal structures, whether big or small — in the foreshore, on wetlands, in forest lands or even within road easements,” he said.
“[We will also] set up rules and regulations to keep Boracay safe, including the use of jetty ports, vehicles and other means of transport, the entry and exit of people and the like. And of course, the governance of the place.”
The master plan, which initially only covered Boracay island, will now cover Carabao, Caticlan, Malay and possibly the island province of Romblon. — Elijah Joseph C. Tubayan, Arjay L. Balinbin, and Anna Gabriela A. Mogato
VALLETTA/BRUSSELS The European Union offered Britain talks this year on a future free trade pact but made clear in negotiating guidelines issued on Friday that London must first agree to EU demands on the terms of Brexit.
Those include paying tens of billions of euros and giving residence rights to some 3 million EU citizens in Britain, the proposed negotiating objectives distributed by EU summit chair Donald Tusk to Britain's 27 EU partners showed.
The document, seen by Reuters, also sets tough conditions for any transition period, insisting Britain must accept many EU rules after any such partial withdrawal. It also spelled out EU resistance to Britain scrapping swathes of tax, environmental and labor laws if it wants to have an eventual free trade pact.
The guidelines, which may be revised before the EU27 leaders endorse them at a summit on April 29, came two days after Prime Minister Theresa May triggered a two-year countdown to Britain's withdrawal in a letter to Tusk that included a request for a rapid start to negotiations on a post-Brexit free trade deal.
"Once, and only once we have achieved sufficient progress on the withdrawal, can we discuss the framework for our future relationship," Tusk told reporters in Malta -- a compromise between EU hardliners who want no trade talks until the full Brexit deal is agreed and British calls for an immediate start.
"Starting parallel talks on all issues at the same time, as suggested by some in the UK, will not happen," Tusk said, while adding that the EU could assess as early as this autumn that Britain had made "sufficient progress" on the exit terms in order to open the second phase of negotiations, on future trade.
Brussels has estimated that Britain might owe it something of the order of 60 billion euros on departure, although it says the actual number cannot be calculated until it actually leaves.
What it does want is to agree the methodology of how to work out the "Brexit bill", taking into account Britain's share of EU assets and liabilities. Britain disputes the figure but May said on Wednesday that London would meet its "obligations".
Her spokesman responded to Tusk on Friday by saying: "It is clear both sides wish to approach these talks constructively, and as the prime minister said this week, wish to ensure a deep and special partnership between the UK and the European Union."
The Union's opening gambit in what Tusk said would at times be a "confrontational" negotiation with May's government also rammed home Brussels' insistence that while it was open to let Britain retain some rights in the EU during a transition after 2019, it would do so only on its own terms.
Britain would have to go on accepting EU rules, such as free migration, pay budget contributions and submit to oversight by the European Court of Justice -- all things that drove last June's referendum vote to leave and elements which May would like to show she has delivered on before an election in 2020.
Existing "regulatory, budgetary, supervisory and enforcement instruments and structures" would apply after Brexit, Tusk's draft guidelines stated in reference to a transition period that diplomats expect could last two to five years beyond 2019.
"NO DUMPING"
It also stressed that a future trade pact, allowing for not just low or zero tariffs on goods but also regulatory alignment to promote trade in services, should not allow Britain to pick and choose which economic sectors to open up. That would prevent London giving undue subsidies or slashing taxes or regulations -- "fiscal, social and environmental dumping", in EU parlance.
The negotiations will be among the most complex diplomatic talks ever undertaken, and the EU guidelines are only an opening bid. EU officials believe they have the upper hand in view of Britain's dependence on exports to the continent, while British diplomats see possibilities to exploit EU states' differences.
Tusk and Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, who holds the Union's rotating presidency, warned against such efforts and insisted the EU would negotiate "as one", through their chief negotiator, former French foreign minister Michel Barnier. He expects to start full negotiations in early June.
In a move to avoid long-running disputes between Britain and Spain over Gibraltar holding up an orderly exit, Tusk proposed that Madrid should have a veto over the future application of any EU-U.K. treaty to the territory -- but only after Brexit.
Tusk spelled out priorities for the withdrawal treaty, which Barnier hopes can be settled by November 2018, in time for parliamentary ratification by Brexit Day on March 29, 2019:
- the EU wants "reciprocal" and legal "enforceable" guarantees for all EU citizens who find their rights to live in Britain affected after a cutoff on the date of withdrawal
- businesses must not face a "legal vacuum" on Brexit
- Britain should settle bills, including "contingent liabilities" to the EU
- agreement on border arrangements, especially on the new EU-U.K. land border in Ireland, as well as those of British military bases on EU member Cyprus.

LONDON, April 23 The euro surged in early trading in Asia on Sunday, while French bond yields were expected to fall and French stocks to rally on Monday morning, on relief that France had not been left with a choice between two radical, anti-EU presidential candidates.
Multiple projections showed centrist Emmanuel Macron and far-right leader Marine Le Pen set to face each other in a May 7 runoff for the French presidency, after coming first and second in Sunday's first round of voting.
Investors' greatest worry had been that the far-left, eurosceptic Jean-Luc Melenchon, who had surged in the polls in recent weeks, could jump ahead of Macron and make it into the final run-off against Le Pen, giving voters the choice between two radical candidates who would threaten the future of the EU.
That this worse-case scenario looked likely to have been averted, therefore, was seen as positive for risk sentiment. While Sunday's results looked broadly in line with polls, failures to predict the outcome of the Brexit referendum and U.S. elections had shaken investors' trust in them.
And while the anti-EU Le Pen looked likely to have made it through to the second round, polls have consistently shown Macron will beat her in the runoff.
"The assumption now is that centrist voters will rally around Macron, denying Le Pen the presidency and hence this will effectively be a pro-establishment, pro-European result which will be positive for risk appetite on Monday morning," said Rabobank's head of rates strategy in London, Richard McGuire.
"We are likely to see a notable tightening of European sovereign spreads and this would also be positive for the euro and stocks," he said, although he added that the exit polls must be viewed with a degree of caution.
The spread between French 10-year government bond yields and their German equivalents has been a key gauge of investor sentiment around the French election in recent months.
That gap was widely expected to narrow on Monday as investors buy back into French debt, and as safe-haven German Bunds are sold off on higher risk appetite.
FREXIT FEARS FADE
The euro jumped as much as 2 percent to $1.09395, its highest level since Nov. 10, the day after the results of the U.S. presidential election, as some markets opened in Asia.
Against the yen, which investors tend to flock to when they perceive high levels of risk, the euro jumped as much as 3 percent to trade at a five-week high of 120.905 yen .
"I think people will be fairly confident that Macron will win in the second round, and the market will be relieved by that," said Insight fund manager and head of currency investment in London, Paul Lambert.
"The euro will benefit from the perceived decline in the break-up risk in the euro area," he added, though he said the single currency's moves would be limited by the fact that this outcome had been expected.
French and European equities were expected to rally when they begin trading on Monday morning, while peripheral bond yields were expected to fall as investors regained their risk appetite.
The projected result will mean a face-off between politicians with radically contrasting economic visions. Macron favours deregulation measures that will be welcomed by financial markets, while Le Pen wants to ditch the euro currency and possibly pull out of the EU - markets' biggest fear.
Even if Le Pen springs a surprise on May 7, her "Frexit" ambitions will require constitutional change which experts say will be difficult, especially as her National Front party only has a handful of federal lawmakers and is seen as highly unlikely to win anything like a majority in June's parliamentary elections.
June's legislative elections also pose a challenge for Macron, who wants to win a parliamentary majority with his brand-new party "En Marche!" ("Forward!")
"We can now conclude that (Frexit) is off the table, assuming that most people will now regard Mr. Macron as the likely winner of round two," said Marie Owens Thomsen, head of economic research at Indosuez Wealth Management in London.
"But, the open question is still the June parliamentary election, what the future president's government will look like and whether or not he will have a majority."

PAWNEE, Okla. — Two earthquakes have struck in the area of northern Oklahoma that was rattled last year by the largest earthquake in state history.
The U.S. Geological Survey says the back-to-back earthquakes hit Monday morning near Pawnee, about 75 miles northeast of Oklahoma City. The USGS says the quakes had magnitudes of 3.2 and 3.3 and there are no reports of injuries or damage.
In September, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake struck Pawnee and caused widespread property damage. Scientists have linked Oklahoma's recent spate of earthquakes to oil and gas production, and state regulators have issued new regulations on the practice of injecting wastewater into underground disposal wells.

Not many places along the Coast can say they've been around as long as Camp Wilkes. Since its start in 1942, the site has been a staple in Biloxi, serving youth groups, scout troops and more.
To celebrate 75 years of adventure, the camp finished off its anniversary with a flag raising ceremony and a cake on Sunday.
"We're still here and we're growing every year, [it's] an amazing accomplishment. That's what this is all about. This is about letting kids have a place to come to that they don't normally get to see," said Heather Stover, board of trustees president.
Judge Sandy Steckler has been a part of the Camp Wilkes family since the 1950s. He says the years may go by, and faces may change, but one thing is always staying the same - memories that last a lifetime.
"When I would go to speak at civic clubs like Rotary, or Lions, or whatever, so many of the members of those clubs would say, 'Oh yeah, I went to Camp Wilkes and then talk a lot about their days at Camp Wilkes. They have very fond memories," said Steckler.
As the celebration came to a close, those closest to the camp say they would like to see it continue to serve the Coastal community for generations to come.
"I'm hoping we do another 75 [years], that would be great. I don't think I'll be around for that, but if I could be around for as much of that as possible, that would be great," said Stover.
The camp is a non-profit organization, so Stover says donations and volunteers are always accepted and appreciated.

Washington, D.C. (CBSMiami/CNN Money) — President Donald Trump took a step further in cutting off Venezuela's government from American investors.
Trump signed an executive order on Monday banning US citizens from buying Venezuela's newly created cryptocurrency, the petro, the world's first sovereign digital currency.
Trump considers Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro a dictator. Venezuela is in the midst of an unprecedented economic and humanitarian crisis in Latin America. Maduro is seeking re-election in May.
The measure comes after the Trump administration banned American investors from buying newly issued Venezuelan bonds from either the government or the state-run oil company, PDVSA. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is also meeting Monday with Latin American leaders at the G20 meetings in Buenos Aires, where Venezuela will be a topic of discussion.
Maduro drummed up the petro as a way for his administration to tap foreign investment amid the initial wave of US financial sanctions. The petro went on sale in private auctions in February.
Maduro tweeted at the time that the private auctions raised $735 million, though CNN could not independently confirm that amount. The government said the petro would be backed by Venezuela crude oil reserves, the largest in the world. But investors would not actually have an ownership stake in Venezuela's oil.
The petro drew criticism from both mainstream investors and cryptocurrency experts. Critics treated it like a joke and a direct conflict to the purpose of digital currencies as unregulated and not controlled by a government.
Venezuela's government has been slowly running out of money for years. But the pace of the cash drain is accelerating as Venezuelan oil production has plummeted in recent months. The country's central bank only has $9.4 billion left in reserves, most of which is held in gold bars, central bank filings show. Reserves are meant to serve as a cushion for the economy.
International critics say Maduro will rig the presidential election in May. Many top opposition candidates are boycotting the election for that reason — and Maduro has also banned many of them. There are other candidates, such as Henri Falcon, running for president. But Falcon, a former member of Maduro's political ideology “chavismo,” has struggled to convince Maduro's critics that his candidacy is, in fact, legitimate.
Trump's executive order follows US sanctions he slapped on dozens of Venezuelan leaders last year, including Maduro.

Looking back to the 1950s and 60s, David Hinchliffe can recall visiting the old Pinderfields hospital in Wakefield, where his father was being treated in huts built for World War Two casualties.
Four decades later, the then-Wakefield MP and chairman of the Parliamentary health select committee saw his daughter being treated for appendicitis in the same huts.
Former MP David Hinchliffe. (W512A327)
He was among those who campaigned for a new hospital to serve the city, and warmly welcomed the news in 2001 that the Labour Government of the time was to provide just that.
But fast-forward 16 years, the now-retired Mr Hinchliffe, who at the time questioned the use of the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) to finance the hospital's construction, believes the costs of the ‘buy now, pay later' scheme have become an albatross around the necks of NHS bosses.
£112m-a-year PFI costs ‘an albatross round the neck of Yorkshire hospital bosses'
The state-of-the art Pinderfields hospital was officially opened by the Princess Royal in 2011, while the new Pontefract Hospital, also paid for under PFI, was opened by the Duke of Gloucester in July 2010.
The fact it does represent good value for money does not mean the cost of the investment year on year is not insignificant. Martin Barkley, chief executive at Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust
As part of the deal signed with Consort Healthcare, Mid-Yorkshire's hospital trust will pay £1.61bn over 35 years, including £38.8m last year, for buildings with a capital value of £312m.
Describing the cost of the scheme as “nothing short of scandalous”, Mr Hinchliffe told The Yorkshire Post: “In my view, there should have been much more vigorous efforts by them and local MPs to press nationally for a renegotiation of the debt repayment arrangements.”
During his spell as chairman of the health select committee, Mr Hinchliffe recruited Professor Allyson Pollock, a strong critic of PFI, as an advisor as it looked at the increasing involvement of the private sector within the NHS under New Labour.
“When, during my last Parliament, the health committee, at my behest, specifically looked at PFI, my wish to involve her again was blocked by ‘loyalist' Labour MPs then appointed to the committee”, he said.
Pinderfields Hospital, which was officially opened in 2011
“The report eventually issued by the committee was far less critical of PFI than I would have liked it to be but the minority of MPs against it were simply outvoted by Labour MPs in favour who had Conservative support.”
Around Yorkshire, hospital trusts have signed PFI deals which will ultimately cost taxpayers £3.8bn, though the schemes signed locally are not even among the most expensive in the country.
In addition, four mental health trusts in Yorkshire, Leeds and York Partnership, Rotherham, Doncaster and South Humber, Bradford District Care Trust and Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys, have committed to paying £748m as part of similar projects.
Supporters of the projects, first used by the Conservatives before becomeing widespread under New Labour, say they transfer the risk of major investment to private contractors, who take on maintenance and other costs.
Martin Barkley, the new chief executive of Mid Yorkshire Hospitals Trust.
Martin Barkley, chief executive at Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: “The PFI scheme was approved on the basis that it represents good value for money. The fact it does represent good value for money does not mean the cost of the investment year on year is not insignificant.
“Those costs, compared to the costs of the old, poor environment hospitals Pinderfields and Pontefract have replaced, could be as much as an extra £20m per annum.
“For that money though, the local population and staff have the benefit of being served by two new, modern, fit for purpose hospitals.”
Union officials at Unison have long campaigned against the PFI scheme in Mid-Yorkshire, and in 2013 published a 28-page document describing the ‘impossible burden' it had placed on the struggling trust.
Branch secretary Adrian O'Malley said the PFI bill was the direct cause of the financial problems for the trust, whose total yearly overspend is dwarfed by its payments to Consort, and called tor the contract to be ripped up.
He said: We support Jeremy Corbyn's call to end PFI which is drain on NHS resources. If Jeremy Hunt can impose new contracts on the junior doctors he can do it to the PFI companies.”
One of the country's biggest hospital trusts says it is considering using a PFI scheme to pay for new buildings more than a decade after signing similar deals which will cost in excess of £1bn over 30 years.
Government figures show Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust paid £33.6 million last year as part of Private Finance Initiative contracts to build the Bexley Wing at St James's Hospital and Wharfedale Hospital in Otley.
The deals for the Bexley Wing and Wharfedale were signed in 2004 and 2002 respectively. The total capital cost of the buildings is £237m but over 30 years, £1.016bn will be paid back.
The original funding for the Bexley Wing part of the scheme came from the Treasury, making the contract one of only two health PFIs to be funded in this way.
Earlier this year the project was refinanced via a £261 bond issued by the insurance company Assured Guarantee.
According to advisor Bevan Brittan, the renegotiation means nearly £2 million annually can be saved over the lifetime of the agreement and the trust can now build a £3 million specialist clinical trials centre. at St James's Hospital. The trust says the overall unitary charge for its PFI deals will be £32.2 million for this financial year, a cost which includes repayment of the original capital, interest, maintenance and other expenses.
A spokeswoman said: “PFI charges represent only a small proportion of the trust's overall costs given the turnover of the trust is in excess of £1bn.
“The Trust has benefitted from a recent refinancing of the Bexley PFI and works proactively with our PFI partners to obtain benefit for the trust for example by enhanced medical equipment provided within the Bexley Wing via the PFI agreement.
“The business case for each project included a value for money assessment which took account of the risk transferred to the private sector under a PFI contract arrangement.”
She added: “The trust is in the process of developing a business case for ‘Building the Leeds Way' which will be a significant development including new build and some refurbished accommodation.
“A number of options for funding including potentially PFI will need to be considered within the business case.”

Between 2012 and 2015, 1,565 refugees were diagnosed with active tuberculosis (TB) in the United States, according to annual reports published by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
The CDC data, which has been public but obscure until now, shows that the number of refugees diagnosed with active TB in recent years is more than three times greater than previously reported by any media outlet.
SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER
The number of refugees diagnosed with TB in the United States has increased every year since 2012, the first year the CDC began publishing data on foreign-born cases of the disease by category, when 358 were diagnosed. In 2013, 396 refugees were diagnosed with TB. The following year, 2014, 402 refugees were diagnosed with TB, and in 2015, the number of refugees diagnosed with TB rose again to 409. Data for 2016 has not yet been reported.
In October, Breitbart News reported that 476 cases of active TB among refugees have been reported in the fifteen states that made that data available. Thirty-five states did not make the data available, even though they had apparently reported it to the CDC:
Until Breitbart News discovered the public, but effectively hidden, CDC reports, the scale of the TB problem among refugees was underreported by more than 1,000 cases over recent years – off by a factor of more than three.
The number of refugees resettled annually in the United States increased from 58,238 in FY 2012 to 69,933 in FY 2015, according to the Office of Refugee Resettlement.
The number of refugees resettled in FY 2016 increased to 84,995, according to the Department of State's interactive website. During the first three months of FY 2017, the number of refugees resettled in the country increased to 25,671, almost double the 13,791 resettled during the first three months of FY 2016.
The increase in the number of refugees diagnosed with active TB from 358 in 2012 to 409 in 2015 was partially responsible for the increase in the total number of foreign-born cases of active TB increased from 6,274 to 6,350 during those four years.
Other categories of foreign-born cases of TB that increased included those who arrived under regular immigrant visas, which increased from 1,437 in 2012 to 1,670 in 2015, those who arrived in the “other” category, which includes illegal immigrants (called “undocumented immigrants” in the CDC reports), which increased from 1,312 in 2012 to 1,408 in 2015, and those who arrived under student visas, which increased from 158 in 2012 to 191 in 2015.
Foreign-born TB cases as a percentage of all TB cases diagnosed in the United States increased from 63.1 percent in 2012 to 66.4 percent in 2015.
The total number of TB cases diagnosed in the United States declined from 9,945 in 2012 to 9,421 in 2014. In 2015, however, for the first time in 23 years, the number of TB cases diagnosed in the United States increased, instead of declined, to 9,557.
Two other important findings arise from the CDC data:
(1) Several of the 35 states for which no data was previously available about the number of active TB cases among refugees have a significant, and previously unreported, public health problem associated with unusually high rates of active TB among refugees. (2) The number of cases of active TB among refugees in several of the 15 states for which complete or partial data was reported by those states significantly and inaccurately underreported the true incidence of active TB among refugees
Georgia, for instance, is the most surprising untold story. During the four years between 2012 and 2015, 96 cases of active TB were diagnosed among refugees in the Peach State. On a per capita basis, Georgia has one of the highest instances of refugee TB of any state in the country. Yet nowhere has this important story been reported.
Texas is known to have one of the highest rates of foreign-born TB in the country. What was not previously reported, however, is the significant role refugees have played in that phenomenon. During the four years between 2012 and 2015, 186 cases of active TB were diagnosed among refugees in the Lone Star State.
Similarly, it has been widely reported that TB is a public health issue in California.
Breitbart News was unable to obtain the full story from the California Department of Public Health about the number of refugees diagnosed with active TB in California until discovering the CDC annual reports. We had only been able to document three cases of active TB among refugees in California based upon publicly available data from the state.
The CDC data, however, makes clear that California has a significant problem with active TB among refugees. During the four years between 2012 and 2015, 251 cases of active TB were diagnosed among refugees, which is 248 more than the three cases previously reported.
Breitbart News will provide a number of additional reports based on the data contained in these annual CDC reports in the coming weeks.
0 Delta flight diverted due to disruptive passenger singing, dancing and threats
TULSA, Okla. - Officials arrested a man Wednesday after a transcontinental flight from Portland, Oregon, to Atlanta was diverted to Tulsa International Airport.
>> Read more trending news
The pilots of Delta Air Lines Flight 1156 declared an emergency during the flight because of an unruly passenger. They requested that law enforcement meet the plane at the gate.
Passengers told KOKI-TV via Twitter that a man was singing loudly in his seat and violently thrashing and dancing to the music that he was listening to.
Passenger Lisa Zimmerman told KOKI that a flight attendant asked the man to quiet down on multiple occasions and even moved a woman who was sitting next to the man.
Zimmerman said after officials made a couple of attempts to get the man to quiet down, "he flipped out."
Passengers sitting nearby reported that the man threatened to harm the flight attendant if she bothered him again and he told her she "will regret it.”
An air marshal reportedly stepped in to try to calm the situation, but when she intervened, passengers said the man raised his fists to the marshal.
After the landing, airport police boarded the plane and arrested the passenger. Zimmerman said he was screaming about God, Judgment Day and how everyone needed to repent of their sins. He also claimed that he had authority over the police because cops are "sin."
The FBI said its agents took custody of the man, and the U.S. Attorney's Office is looking at possible charges, since threatening a member of a flight crew is a federal offense.
Delta 1156 took off again for Atlanta around 2 p.m. Wednesday.
Here's a statement from U.S. Attorney R. Trent Shores about the incident:
“Today, a Delta flight traveling from Portland to Atlanta was diverted to Tulsa due to the alleged conduct of an unruly passenger. Federal Air Marshals on the plane successfully deescalated and controlled the situation, and the flight landed in Tulsa without further incident. The passenger-at-issue has been taken into custody. Law enforcement officials with the Federal Bureau of Investigation will investigate this matter moving forward. The Transportation Security Administration, Homeland Security Investigations, and Tulsa International Airport authorities assisted in the response and initial investigation.
"The United States Attorney's Office will review whether the alleged unruly conduct violated federal law. I am thankful no one was hurt and that the other passengers may resume their travel to their intended destination. I commend the Federal Air Marshals who reacted decisively in this situation. Their efforts – combined with the resulting joint investigation – remind us all that our local, state, and federal law enforcement partners are working together to ensure the safety and security of the traveling public.”

Trammell was the 1984 World Series MVP, hitting .450 as the Tigers trounced San Diego in five games and finished off a season in which they started out 35-5.
A six-time all-star and four-time Gold Glove winner, Trammell scored 1,231 runs and drove in 1,003. He batted .285 with 185 home runs and a .352 on-base average — he walked 850 times and struck out 874.
Trammell never came close to election during his 15 tries on the Hall ballot in voting by Baseball Writers' Association of America members. His best showing came in his last year, when he got 40.9 per cent in 2016.
Morris got a lot closer.
Starting at 22 per cent in his first Hall ballot appearance in 2000, Morris peaked at 67.7 per cent in '03, falling 42 short. He dropped to 61.5 per cent four years ago in his final time on the writers' ballot, 78 votes shy.
Hall of Fame players George Brett, Rod Carew, Dennis Eckersley, Don Sutton, Dave Winfield and Robin Yount were on the panel that voted.
Steve Garvey, Tommy John, Don Mattingly, Dale Murphy, Dave Parker and Luis Tiant were also on the ballot.
Miller, who headed the players' union from 1966 to '82 was on the ballot for the seventh time.
Miller drew 44 per cent in 2003 and 63 per cent in '07 when all Hall of Famers could vote on the veterans panel. After the Hall downsized the committee, he got three of 12 votes in '07, seven of 12 in '09 and 11 of 16 in '10, one fewer than the necessary 75 per cent. Four years ago, he was at least six votes shy.
In '08, four years before he died, Miller sent a letter to the association saying he didn't want to be considered anymore.
The annual vote on players will be announced Jan. 24.
Chipper Jones, Jim Thome and Omar Vizquel are among 19 first-time candidates, and Trevor Hoffman, Vladimir Guerrero, Edgar Martinez, Roger Clemens are Barry Bonds among the holdovers.

The Office of Civil Defense is prepared should the alert level rise and force further evacuations, however
Published 9:45 PM, February 02, 2018
LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – The Office of Civil Defense (OCD) in Bicol sent home Mayon evacuees in the 9-km extended danger zone to lessen the possibility of an outbreak of sickness occurring in the evacuation camps here.
Claudio L. Yucot, OCD regional director, directed the decampment of evacuees inside the evacuation centers residing outside the 8-km extended danger zone based on protocols and alerts from the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) and the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs).
“We are ordering the decampment of Mayon evacuees outside the 8-km permanent danger zone to return to their residences because we don't want them to expose them to diseases. But we will continue to monitor them even after the decampment,” Yucot said.
Yucot added the decampment of Mayon evacuees living in 9-kilometer extended danger zone (EDZ) is based on Phivolcs's bulletin guidelines.
“All Mayon evacuees outside the 8-kilometer (danger zone) will be sent home tomorrow but in the event that alert level 5 will be raised we will evacuate them,” Yucot said in a press briefing at the hall of the Albay Public Safety and Emergency Management Office (Apsemo) here.
Cedric Daep, Apsemo chief, said that the towns of Daraga and Camalig and the two cities of Ligao and Legazpi need to decamp its evacuees outside the 8-kilometer danger zone because there is no danger on lahar and pyroclastic flow.
Daep added those residents living in the 6-kilometer to 8-kilometer danger zone in the towns of Camalig and Daraga and cities of Legazpi and Ligao must stay put in the temporary evacuation shelters for safety.
“The 7-kilometer to 8-kilometer buffer zone is enough for safety of the people. But we're reiterating for farmers not to venture within the “no man's land”,” Daep said.
Currently, there are 21,950 families or 84,415 individuals staying in evacuation shelters, causing illnesses to spread.
Children and the elderly are vulnerable to coughs and colds, fever, hypertension, loose bowel movements, and skin diseases.
Alert level 4 remains in effect over Mayon volcano. The public is strongly advised to stay away from the 8-kilometer-radius danger zone and to be vigilant against pyroclastic density currents, lahars and sediment-laden stream flows along channels draining the edifice. – Rappler.com

0 Memphis goes 18 days with no homicides
MEMPHIS, Tenn. - There has not been a homicide in the City of Memphis in 18 days.
So far this year, homicides are down 44-percent compared to this time 2016. We've been looking into the numbers and talking to law enforcement.
Every Wednesday, U.S. Attorney General Mike Dunavant has a meeting to review every firearms offense that occurs in Memphis and Shelby County on a weekly basis.
The meeting is with Memphis Police Department, Shelby County Sheriff's Office, Amy Weirich and the ATF.
Trending stories:
Dunavant said they discuss strategies and gun crimes to target.
"We are seeking them out. We are aggressively investigating and prosecuting them at the highest levels, and we are not imposing the strictest penalties that we can find in the federal law," said Dunavant.
The new U.S. Attorney General has been in office for six months.
"We have increased our firearms prosecutions and indictments over 58% from the previous time period over previous years," said Dunavant.
Another statistic...homicides are way down! Memphis has only had 25 so far in 2018. There were 34 this time in 2017, and 45 in 2016.
The recent decrease in homicides has a positive ripple effect across the MPD.
“This gives our investigators more time to concentrate on cases that have not been solved,” said Louis Brownlee, a Public Information Officer with the MPD.
Cold cases like Laylah Washington, Richard Jordan, and many others are able to be worked aggressively in the rare “downtime” that a 18-day no-homicide period allows.
"I'm not surprised. I am very pleased to see that what we are doing is working, and taking them off the streets before they commit another shooting, another homicide, another carjacking, another robbery," said Dunavant.
Not everyone is sold on the recent trend.
"I don't believe that's going to keep the crime down. I think it's the economy," said Dewayne Moore.
Dewayne Moore told us he doesn't think the decrease is worth celebrating.
"It got too out of hand, so really to get in a range of something that is still unacceptable, I don't think it's worth commending. There's still more work that needs to be done," said Moore.
The Wednesday meetings aren't going away anytime soon and neither is the top prosecutor's approach.
"We are going after the worst of the worst, and we believe that it is working," said Dunavant.

After years of singing backup for Jennifer Hudson, Kyla Jade is stepping into the spotlight.
During the top 12 live playoffs of The Voice on Monday night, Jade had a full-circle moment when she closed out the show by performing Hudson's showstopper “One Night Only” from Dreamgirls — with some encouragement from Hudson herself.
“It gives me anxiety,” Jade, 33, told reporters after the show of taking on the hit. “Jennifer is one of my ‘sheroes.' She's one of the women I look to because she is grace and professionalism and talent and all of these rolled into one. Any time I'm able to sing a song and honor anyone who has been such an example to me, I love to do it.”
After her powerhouse performance, Jade received a standing ovation from all four coaches, as well as praise from her coach Blake Shelton.
“J-Hud was just texting me 12 minutes ago,” Shelton said. “She was excited to see this. Let me say on behalf of her, welcome to the front of the stage. No more insecurities about taking your moment and stepping out here. Let's start mowing them down. This is your time.”
Earlier on the show, Jade said during rehearsal that she was “really nervous” for the performance and talked about how much her life has changed.
“Before I started singing for Jennifer three years ago, I was sleeping on couches,” she said. “I wasn't making enough money to live on my own. And the only time I slept in beds was when I was on tour.”

The Nashville resident said that Hudson, who was a coach last season, had no idea she was even planning on auditioning for the show.
“I was actually nervous to tell her,” Jade said. “I was through executives before I even told her. She had no idea.”
The Voice airs Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on NBC.

Cristiano Ronaldo's girlfriend says they are "happier than ever" following the birth of their child.
Georgina Rodriguez and the 32-year-old footballer - who also has twins Eva and Mateo, and seven-year-old son Cristiano Jr. - welcomed daughter Alana into the world last month and the youngster has brought the couple "closer".
She said: "It has definitely brought us closer. We're happier together than ever.
"The children are our joy. We wake up and the first thing we do is hug and kiss them, put them in their little chairs and watch them while they have their breakfast, make sure they have everything they need, and so on all day long. This is a very special time for us all."
Following Alana's birth, the Real Madrid star set up a surprise dinner to welcome his newborn daughter and girlfriend home.
Georgina said: "I'm very proud of him. When we got home from hospital, he'd organised a surprise dinner, with all our nearest and dearest. I felt like the luckiest woman in the world."
The 22-year-old star admitted she feels "loved and cared for" with Cristiano.
She added to HELLO! magazine: "I have found love. We complement each other very well. We have a beautiful relationship and when I have him beside me, I have everything. I feel loved and cared for. Love conquers all."
Cristiano became a father for the fourth time following the birth of Alana.
He has never revealed the mother of his son, Cristiano Jr., and his twins are believed to have been born via a surrogate in the US earlier this year.

ACCRA, April 13 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - At the heart of Ghana's capital, on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, sits Lavender Hill, a former dumping site for raw sewage better known for its aroma of human waste than fragrant flowers.
For decades, cesspit tankers emptied their cargoes of sewage here, collected from across the Accra metropolitan area, while residents traditionally used the site for open defecation.
Some 500 metres away in Jamestown village, 32-year-old Maxwell Lamptay fishes every day in water locals say is contaminated with faeces.
“I do not disclose that I have fished here,” said the father of three. “In Accra people refuse to buy the fish when they know it's been caught in this area”.
In Jamestown, hundreds of people share public toilets, with the majority defecating openly along the beach.
Ghana approved a revised environmental sanitation policy in 2010 that was meant to put an end to the tradition of emptying untreated sewage into the ocean, now more than a century old.
But the practice continued as the government provided no alternative methods of disposal.
Now it is hoping a new modern wastewater treatment plant, which started operating in November, will finally allow the restriction to be enforced. The site by the sea where the tankers used to dump their load has been blocked off.
Haidar Said, managing director of Sewerage Systems Ghana Limited, said work began on the new plant at Lavender Hill in 2012, in an effort to tackle waterborne diseases and stop the discharge of raw sewage into the ocean.
Under a partnership between a group of companies and the ministries of local government and rural development, Sewerage Systems Ghana and its private-sector partners run the sewage treatment facility, with the government paying a management fee.
The plant also produces biogas from solid waste in the sewage, and in turn uses that gas to generate electricity.
CHOLERA RISK
The world's population produces an estimated 9.5 million cubic metres of human excreta and 900 million cubic metres of municipal wastewater every day, according to a 2016 report by the U.N. Environment Programme.
Meanwhile, more than 80 percent of the world's wastewater is released into the environment without being treated, according to the U.N. World Water Development Report 2017 – a figure that tops 95 percent in some of the poorest countries.
Ghana, like many sub-Saharan African nations, is an economy on the move. Between 2000 and 2011, it recorded an average annual growth rate of 7.5 percent.
Its expanding population, along with industrialisation and urbanisation, has increased the amount of waste generated and put tremendous pressure on landfills.
According to U.N. data, some 5 million people in Ghana still lack toilets and practice open defecation.
For over 45 years now, the West African nation has suffered recurring cholera outbreaks. In 2014, the Ministry of Health recorded more than 15,000 cases, resulting in around 130 deaths in eight out of its 10 districts.
But the situation may be improving - for 2016, the World Health Organization reported 596 cases in only two districts.
Lamptay's two children got sick with cholera in 2014.
“It was the worst diarrhoea my family has suffered in the more than 10 years we have lived here,” he said. Because the Lavender Hill dump is close to settlements, children are prone to picking up infections, he added.
Naa Amerley Sawa, a 47-year-old mother of four from Korne Gonno, some 800 metres from Lavender Hill, spent around 430 cedis ($101.78) to treat her 13-year-old daughter when she got sick with cholera several months ago.
She and her children also fall ill with frequent bouts of malaria.
“This neighbourhood has an influx of mosquitoes and houseflies,” she said. “Malaria and cholera have become common - every household suffers from one of them.”
LOW INVESTMENT
Joy Hesse Ankomah, a senior programme officer at Ghana's Environmental Protection Agency, said only seven of the country's 44 sewage treatment plants are functioning properly.
Companies will recoup the cost of building the new wastewater treatment plant at Lavender Hill - nearly $40 million - from the government's monthly fee of around 2.4 million cedi over the next 15 years.
The plant has the capacity to accommodate around 2,400 cubic metres of liquid waste - 300 to 400 truckloads per day – and is now receiving about two-thirds of that. Each truck pays a small fee of 20 cedis to offload at the plant.
The plant generates 0.5 megawatts of electricity per hour, which it uses for its own operations. It is now self-sufficient in power and plans to produce electricity for commercial use, according to Say.
“The aim is to improve the sanitation levels in Ghana,” said George Kwesi Rockson, research and development director at Zoomlion Ghana Limited, which manages some 95 percent of municipal waste in Ghana's 10 regions and is also working on the new plant.
Around 80 percent of health cases are related to sanitation and environmental problems, he noted. But managing waste is not a priority among many sub-Saharan African governments, he added.
“We have failed to understand that investing properly in waste could resolve our increasing health burden,” he said.
Currently, less than 0.1 percent of Ghana's GDP is invested in the waste management sector, said Rockson.
“Waste only gets attention during major disasters such as cholera outbreaks,” he said.
CLEANER AIR AND WATER
The new Lavender Hill plant releases ultraviolet-treated water into Korle Lagoon, which empties directly into the sea, hoping to clean the lake's water over time.
The rest of the treated water is used for irrigation at the plant and washing equipment.
As African cities gear up to pursue the Sustainable Development Goals and reduce their planet-warming emissions, Rockson believes waste management can reduce methane emissions, black carbon and other hazardous gases from landfills.
Lamptay said the air quality, which used to be unbearable, has already improved in Jamestown.
“The few pit latrines we have are being emptied, and our garbage at the communal collection point is being collected for free,” he said. “I can't wait for the day it will rain and not flood - maybe that will bring cholera infections to an end.” ($1 = 4.2250 Ghanaian cedi) (Reporting by Sophie Mbugua; editing by Megan Rowling.

VOL. 41 | NO. 23 | Friday, June 09, 2017
NASHVILLE (AP) — A new lawsuit invokes the plight of a baby born dependent on opioid drugs, as three Tennessee prosecutors and the baby's guardian accuse several drug manufacturers of unleashing an epidemic through deceptive marketing about the risks of addiction to painkillers.
"Baby Doe spent his first days in the neonatal intensive care unit writhing in agony as he went through detoxification," according to the suit filed Tuesday in the Sullivan County Circuit Court in Kingsport, Tennessee. The infant boy, who is not identified, was born in March of 2015.
The baby born to an addicted mother survived after spending 14 days in a neonatal intensive care unit, often crying uncontrollably and was given morphine to wean him from his dependency, the suit says. The child, the documents say, continues to suffer from numerous health and learning disabilities.
The lawsuit was filed by three district attorneys who represent parts of the east Tennessee mountains in Appalachia, which has been the epicenter of the prescription drug epidemic that has ravaged the country. It's among a growing number of lawsuits filed recently around the country against opioid drugmakers.
The lawsuit was announced at Niswonger Children's Hospital in Johnston City, Tennessee, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of the Virginia state line. The hospital recently added a new neonatal intensive care unit to treat babies with neonatal abstinence syndrome because it has been inundated with infants born dependent on opioids.
Standard treatment for babies born dependent on opioids is giving them small doses of morphine or methadone to help them cope with their withdrawal symptoms before weaning them from the drug.
Tennessee has the second highest statewide opioid prescription rate in the country outside West Virginia, said Barry Staubus, a district attorney who represents Sullivan County. Tony Clark and Dan Armstrong are the other prosecutors who joined in the suit against three drug companies and their subsidiaries.
The lawsuit targets Purdue Pharma, maker of OxyContin; Mallinckrodt PLC, which manufactures and sells multiple painkillers; and Endo Health Solutions, which develops and sells several painkillers, including Opana. The federal Food and Drug Administration recently called for Endo Health Solutions to remove Opana from the market, saying the risks of abuse outweigh the painkiller's benefits. The suit also names two convicted drug dealers and an alleged pill mill.
The lawsuit seeks to stop the flood of opioids in Tennessee and to recover an unspecified amount of money for the costs of combatting the epidemic, including medical expenses, drug treatment, and pain and suffering. The suit also seeks to invalidate a Tennessee law limiting the amount of punitive and non-economic damages that people can win in a lawsuit, saying the statute is unconstitutional.
Staubus said he, Clark and Armstrong plan to join with other prosecutors to pressure Tennessee lawmakers to control the explosion of pain clinics and overprescribing of opioids.
Tennessee House Speaker Beth Harwell, a Nashville Republican, asked the state's attorney general to consider suing painkiller manufacturers on behalf of the entire state after Ohio filed a lawsuit against five drug companies last month.
A spokesman for Endo Health Solutions did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment.
"We have broadly supported efforts to combat the opioid abuse health care crisis through a range of advocacy initiatives, direct lobbying campaigns, and charitable activities," a statement from Mallinckrodt said. "We take our responsibility as an opioid manufacturer very seriously." The statement said the company only makes generic drugs and does not promote them.
"While we vigorously deny the allegations in the complaint, we share public officials' concerns about the opioid crisis and we are committed to working collaboratively to find solutions," a statement from Purdue Pharma said. The statement said Purdue works "with policymakers, public health officials and law enforcement to address this public health crisis" to develop abuse-deterrent technology, advocate for prescription drug monitoring programs and support access to Naloxone.
Plaintiffs' attorney Gerard Stranch, managing partner in the Nashville firm Branstetter, Stranch and Jennings, said, "We expect this to be a long drawn out battle and we're ready."

Teleah Maureen Kear has been jailed for committing fraud against her former employer to the tune of more than $90,000.
Teleah Maureen Kear has been jailed for committing fraud against her former employer to the tune of more than $90,000. Contributed
FOUR children will be motherless for nine months after their serial fraudster mum was jailed for stealing more than $90,000 from her employer.
Teleah Maureen Kear, 29, spent four years following her most recent fraud waiting for police to come knocking at her door and had a history of taking money from her employers between 2007 and 2011, a court heard.
In 2009 she faced the Maroochydore Magistrates Court on a range of offences - which included fraud as an employee - and was given a 120 hour community service order.
Just five months after the order expired, she was back at it again while working for bathroom and kitchen renovation company, Mac McConnell in Nerang on the Gold Coast.
Between October 2010 and September 2011, Kear transferred more than $42,000 from company bank accounts into her own.
She also used the company's money to buy a car worth $35,000 which was later repossessed and sold off at a loss of $18,000.
Although the court heard some of the money was used for "necessities", Kear also bought cosmetics, two tablet computers and a gaming console.
The matter was reported to police by Kear's boss in 2011 and a warrant was issued the following year, but police didn't find and arrest her until 2016.
Kear today pleaded guilty in Maroochydore District Court to two counts of fraud of more than $30,000, four counts of fraud and one count of attempted fraud.
The offences were aggravated by the fact Kear committed fraud against her employer.
Kear's mother, Tracy Maureen Denham, and partner were supporting her from the gallery and appeared upset throughout the proceedings.
Ms Denham gave evidence in court that her daughter was told by a lawyer at the time to not hand herself in, but wait for police to contact her.
Judge John Robertson commended Kear's efforts at rehabilitation and told the court he would refer the lawyer she spoke to to the Legal Services Commission for "unprofessional conduct".
While Kear's former fraud charges in 2009 were the result of methamphetamine use, Judge Robertson said the more recent charges showed some "sophistication" and suggested she was "reasonably high functioning" at the time.
Kear was ordered to serve a head sentence of four years in prison.
The term will be suspended, after she serves nine months, for an operational period of four years.
Serving up success, schools across the coast are reminding kids to start the day off right during National School Breakfast Week.

BARCELONA Dani Alves was a serial winner with Barcelona, yet the exuberant Brazilian never felt loved by the Catalan club and on Tuesday will have a chance to show them what they are missing when Juventus host his former side.
The Champions League quarter-final first leg at the Juventus Stadium will be the first time Alves has faced Barça since he left for Turin last summer.
Alves had been one of the architects of Barcelona's dominance in Spanish and European soccer in past years. He won 23 titles over eight seasons at the Nou Camp -- including three Champions League trophies and six La Liga titles.
The right back provided 42 assists for Lionel Messi, more than any other player, and notched a total 100 assists in the league.
Before the club's 2015 Champions League final triumph over Juventus, Messi hailed Alves as the best right back in the world, also saying: "It's very difficult to find a player like him today."
A year later, though, he left the Nou Camp on a free transfer, announcing his departure after the 2015-16 season had ended.
Despite his brilliant understanding with his teammates on the pitch, Alves' flamboyant manner was often viewed as a lack of professionalism by the club's hierarchy.
His sometimes eye-catching social media posts also frequently irked fans. On one occasion last year, he drew criticism from supporters when he posted a video of himself dressed up as a woman and saying Barcelona's elimination from the Champions League was "just a game of football".
"UNGRATEFUL"
In an interview earlier this year with newspaper ABC de Sevilla, Alves was scathing of the Barcelona's board.
"The people who run Barcelona have no idea how to treat their players," he said.
"They were very false and ungrateful. They did not respect me. They only offered me a renewal because of the FIFA transfer ban. That's when I played their game and signed a renewal, which included a clause that allowed me to leave for free a year later."
"I like feeling loved and as they did not want me I left."
Alves' departure left a gaping hole in the Barcelona team, however. The club opted against signing a replacement, leaving Aleix Vidal and Sergi Roberto to take his place.
Vidal spent much of the season sidelined from the squad by coach Luis Enrique. Shortly after winning his place back in the team in February, the Spaniard sustained a season-ending ankle injury.
Meanwhile, Roberto, originally a holding midfielder, has had an inconsistent season, earning rave reviews in some games but reinforcing the views of his doubters when up against tougher opposition.
Roberto suffered a torrid time in the defeats to Manchester City and Paris St Germain in the Champions League, though he wrote himself into Barcelona folklore by scoring the goal that completed the historic 6-1 win over the French side in the last 16 second leg.
Barcelona appeared to miss the energy and vision of Alves as they floundered to a 2-0 defeat at Malaga on Saturday, a loss which further dented their chances of catching La Liga leaders Real Madrid.
Should the Brazilian engineer Barcelona's elimination from this season's Champions League, they may wish they had shown him a little more of the appreciation he so craved.

Members of the Church of Freedom in Christ Ministries stood at the main entrance of the parade holding signs that offered apologies for how the LGBT community has been treated by Christians.
(CNN) — Religion has often been used to put down the LGBT community. But at a pride parade this past weekend in Marikina, a city just east of the Phillipines' capital of Manila, a group of Christians gathered to say something different: I'm sorry.
Members of the Church of Freedom in Christ Ministries stood at the main entrance of the parade holding signs that offered apologies for how the LGBT community has been treated by Christians.
Their banners read, “We're here to apologize for the ways that we as Christians have harmed the LGBT community.”
Some of the signs had more personal sentiments.
One man's stated, “Can we hug you?”
According to parade-goer Kohlin Lallabban, many took the group up on the offer.
“It was so genuine and most of us got teary eyed when we saw them,” Lallabban said.
The demonstration was part of the church's “I'm Sorry” campaign, through which members seek to apologize on behalf of their fellow Christians for the way biblical writings have been used against the LGBT community.
In a statement on its Facebook page, the church wrote, “We do not need the recognition of people but the heart-warming response of those who accepted our sincere apologies motivates and encourages us to continue doing this mission of our church.”
Lallaban thinks the act means an exceptional amount to the Filipino LGBT community, which has often been at odds with the nation's heavily Catholic culture.
“It was just so empowering to have that kind of support from the very people who shunned us away.”

PASADENA, Calif. — The Rose Parade is underway under cloudy skies and with additional security.
The 128th annual parade got started Monday with an added police presence and measures to prevent a vehicle from barreling into the route.
Sturdy barricades are erected at more than 50 intersections to prevent a terrorist attack like ones that happened in Berlin and France last year when trucks plowed into crowds.
Flower-covered floats feature waterfalls, a roller coaster and surfing dogs. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation has a float honoring the 49 killed in the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Three survivors of that attack were on the float titled “To Honor and Remember Orlando.”
Three Olympic gold medalists, runner Allyson Felix, diver Greg Louganis and swimmer Janet Evans, are grand marshals of the parade.

If not for the heroic actions of her fiancé, a woman could have been seriously injured when a driver rammed his car into a group of protesters demonstrating against a downtown Charlottesville white nationalist rally Saturday afternoon.
Marissa Blair told The New York Times that her fiancé, Marcus Martin, pushed her out of the way of the oncoming vehicle. Although Blair walked away with just a scraped arm and a bruise on her leg, Martin attended the memorial service for 32-year-old fatal victim Heather Heyer in a wheelchair with a broken leg.
Blair, who was friends with Heyer and used to work with her, recalled the horrific moment when the car crashed into a group of protesters.
“We were just marching around, spreading love — and then the accident happened,” she said. “In a split second you see a car, and you see bodies flying.”
Blair, 27, began looking for Martin, who had been hit by the car. When she first spotted him, he was in his red baseball cap on the ground, covered in blood.
“It terrified me,” she said.
The couple were reunited and went to the hospital to tend to his injury.
They later learned from a detective that Heyer had been killed.
“I kind of knew and didn't want to believe it,” Blair told the newspaper. “When the cop told me, I cried and sank to my knees.”
Blair said, “Heather was such a sweet soul, she did not deserve to die.”
Martin, along with others at the memorial service, wore a purple shirt with a photo of Heyer's face and a quote from her recent Facebook post where she asked friends to be outraged about racism in America.
“What happened here is 100 percent wrong,” Martin said, according to the New York Daily News.
At least 26 people were taken to a local hospital from the rally and counter-protests, the Northwest Herald reports. At least 19 of those victims are believed to have been injured in the car crash, according to the New York Times.
Police identified the alleged driver as 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. of Maumee, Ohio, according to CNN, Washington Post and the Associated Press. He is being held for second-degree murder, malicious wounding and failure to stop in an accident that resulted in death.
It was not immediately clear if he has retained an attorney. He is expected to appear in court on Monday.
Samantha Bloom, Fields' mother, said he dropped his cat off at her apartment on Friday so he could attend the rally, according to the Toledo Blade.

“I told him to be careful,” Bloom told the outlet. “[And] if they're going to rally to make sure he's doing it peacefully.”
The mother shared that Fields told her about the rally last week but said she didn't know the racist nature of the gathering.
Bloom told the Associated Press that she had no idea her son supported alt-right views, noting that he had an African-American friend.
“I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump's not a white supremacist,” she said.

Ahmed Best contemplated suicide almost "20 years ago" after he was targeted by vicious trolls for his portrayal of Jar Jar Binks in the 'Star Wars' prequels.
The 44-year-old actor has revealed he almost took his own life two decades ago when die-hard fans of the original trilogy bombarded him with death threats because they felt his goofy character, which was loved by kids, was too out of place.
Taking to his Instagram account, Ahmed uploaded a photograph of him and his young son standing at his suicide spot and he wrote: "20 years next year I faced a media backlash that still affects my career today.

Ahmed first starred in franchise in 1999 when his role was written into 'Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace' - his first major film role - but despite the backlash he received for his portrayal, creator George Lucas liked the character and Jar Jar appeared again in 'Attack of the Clones' and 'Revenge of the Sith'.
CLEVELAND — Browns coach Hue Jackson is confident owner Jimmy Haslam will stick to his plan and bring him back next season.
Jackson, who is 0-13 this season and 1-28 in two years with Cleveland, laughed on Monday when asked about a report that new general manager John Dorsey wants to hire his own coach.
Dorsey was hired as the club's new GM last week by Haslam, who fired vice-president of football operations Sashi Brown.
Haslam announced Jackson will return for the 2018 season. Jackson said he has no indication that Haslam will change his mind and "you've got to trust what he said. I know I do."

In less than a week Subcon will open its doors at Birmingham's NEC for the 42nd time alongside the launch of its brand-new sister show The Engineer Expo. We caught up with event director Gordon Kirk ahead of next week's festivities.
Now in its 42nd year, Subcon is firmly established as the must-attend event for subcontract manufacturing professionals. Why is that?
Partly because we've been around for 42 years. We know the industry inside out. We invest time to understand our visitors' pain points, how these change year by year and what they need from us to stay competitive in a global marketplace, which is riddled with uncertainty but also full of promise and opportunity. Many of our exhibitors have invested significantly in machinery, people and premises over the last 12 months increasing their capacity, expanding their capabilities and extending their geographical reach, which is fantastic news.
We've got over 400 world class exhibitors in the hall this year
Over 3,500 manufacturers from so many different industries attend Subcon each year looking to source new suppliers, benchmark capabilities and build new business relationships throughout the UK manufacturing industry. And helping them to achieve this is what Subcon excels at. We've got over 400 world class exhibitors in the hall this year. Anyone visiting Subcon will find the best of British manufacturing on display alongside a wealth of market-leading international suppliers all looking to help them optimise their supply chain strategy in 2018 and beyond.
This year also heralds the introduction of new show The Engineer Expo
Yes, it does. The Engineer Expo will take place alongside Subcon this year for the very first time and allow us to deliver the UK's engineering and manufacturing industry with a single dedicated event, which is a really exciting prospect. The show provides a unique platform for engineers to source the latest advanced engineering technology, products and services, and optimise production across the manufacturing cycle.
What else should visitors look out for?
The Engineer Conference, without a doubt. This year's programme is phenomenal, full of truly inspiring and insightful content. It's a three-day, six-track, 36-session programme across two theatres and it's free!
Topics will cover everything from robotics and augmented reality to autonomous vehicles, electric aircraft, composite materials and next-generation metrology technology. The Engineer team has done an amazing job of creating a programme that really focuses on stories that will make a difference to our visitors and their businesses.
They've also used their contacts to secure a raft of incredible speakers: eminent engineers and industry leaders who will reveal the jaw-dropping stories behind some of the UK's most interesting engineering and manufacturing projects, including Nadine Stech (read our interview with her here) and her award-winning Linx prosthetic leg, BAE Systems' Henry White on technology transfer between the worlds of defence and sport, Jaguar Land Rover's head of autonomous vehicles and, of course, our keynotes: Rolls-Royce CTO Paul Stein; and Mclaren Applied Technologies CTO Dr Caroline Hargrove.
It's going to be unmissable.

Ed Sheeran collects rude artwork.
The 'Shape of You' hitmaker admitted he is into "mad, weird art" and enjoys shocking guests who come to his house with the paintings around his home in particular, one that features the C-word.
Speaking to the Metro newspaper, Ed said: "I'm into mad, weird art. I actually have a big painting in my house that just says the word '****' - actually it says 'pipe down, ****'.
"People walk in and they're like, 'What is that?' So I do like stuff that offends people."
In February, Ed revealed his latest tattoo was designed by celebrated artist Damien Hirst, whom he personally asked to design an inking for him.
At the time, Ed said: "Damien has drawn my next tattoo so I'm going to get that done. It's a skull, it's very cool."
Ed, 26, also revealed that he created the artwork for his new album 'Divide' in Damien's studio.
He said: "He just left me in there with a load of paint and I just threw it on this spin machine and created my album cover."
Ed and Damien are friends and the millionaire artist even personally pimped up the musician's plaster cast when he broke his right wrist in a cycling accident in London.
Damien, 52, cultured the medical appendage black and then added multiple polka dots.

SAN FRANCISCO The U.S. judge overseeing a blockbuster case over self-driving car technology suggested Uber could face an injunction if a key Uber executive does not testify for fear of exposing himself to criminal prosecution, according to a transcript seen by Reuters.
Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), sued ride services company Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] last month, alleging that a former Waymo executive, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded over 14,000 confidential documents before leaving the company to subsequently join Uber. Waymo said Uber benefited from those documents.
Levandowski is not a defendant in the case, but he is a central figure in the high-profile litigation that pits two Silicon Valley technology giants against each other, both of which are vying to dominate in the competitive autonomous vehicles sector.
Waymo is seeking a preliminary injunction from the court, which would temporarily stop Uber from using any of the allegedly stolen intellectual property. A hearing is scheduled for May 3.
Uber, which has said the allegations are baseless but has not yet responded to Waymo's complaint in court, has argued that the trade secrets issue should be sent to arbitration.
"You represent somebody who's in a mess," U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup in San Francisco told the attorney for Levandowski, Miles Ehrlich, during a closed court hearing on Wednesday. Reuters saw the transcript of that hearing.
Ehrlich had told the court that based on the "potential for criminal action" against Levandowski, the engineer would be asserting his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.
Contacted on Thursday, Ehrlich denied further comment. Uber did not respond to a request for comment.
'GOOD STORY TO TELL'
In the hearing, Alsup bandied with lawyers for Uber and Levandowski over the allegedly stolen documents, some of which Uber said were not in its possession, but in Levandowski's.
Gonzalez said he would like to put Levandowski on the stand, because "he has a good story to tell," but could not force him. But were the case sent to arbitration, Levandowski might choose to testify, Gonzalez said, because arbitration proceedings are not public.
"At least it's not in the public where it's going to be in the front page of The New York Times the next day," Gonzalez said, an argument rejected by the court, which said the public had a right to know details of the case.
"I'm sorry that Mr. Levandowski has got his -- got himself in a fix. That's what happens, I guess, when you download 14,000 documents and take them, if he did. But I don't hear anybody denying that," Alsup said.
Gonzalez suggested Uber's strategy would be to convince the court that Uber was "not using any of these things" Waymo says he stole.
"That would be a legitimate point," responded Alsup. "Maybe you can convince me of that."
Still, Alsup warned Uber of its difficulty in dodging a preliminary injunction in light of Levandowski's Fifth Amendment privilege.
"If you think for a moment that I'm going to stay my hand because your guy is taking the Fifth Amendment and not issue a preliminary injunction to shut down that ... you're wrong," Alsup said.

Many in Johnston are still in grief from the loss of a police officer. Corporal Eric Chapman died in a car crash on December 8 while responding to an emergency call. FOX54 spoke with members of the community who say Corporal Chapman will be missed.
Johnston Police Department consisted of eight officers who had a family bond but now their hearts are broken. Corporal Eric Chapman was a marine, husband, father, son, and friend. Those close to him describe him as a man with a unique personality and a sense of humor that could make anyone around laugh. Chief Lamaz Robinson of the Johnston Police Department says above all Corporal Chapman's passion for his job was great; he loved protecting others. "I know without a shadow of a drop that Eric loved what he did as an law enforcement officer. And there are plenty of times we have been put in short staff situations and there was no problem with him coming out to cover shifts"
Just last March he made supervisor. Corporal Chapman work ethic never went unnoticed and it was easy to see how much he loved Johnston and the people in it.
"I don't think a lot of people realize sometimes how much a law enforcement officer risk their lives. You never know what's going to happen on a traffic stop you never know what's going to happen on any encounter so you have to be a brave person to take those risk.", says Chief Robinson.
The Police Department has received an overwhelming response of sympathy and support; calls, text, emails and folks just simply stopping by. Local store owner Kathy Holmes says she is heartbroken for the police department and the family "It is more painful to know that he was in the line of duty when he was called. Our hearts and prayers are with them. Anytime we can be of service let us know."
Chief Robinson says the community will get through this together and will remember Officer Chapman as a Johnston hero. Officer Eric Chapman's funeral services will be December 12 at Saluda Church of God in Saluda, South Carolina. The services are open to the public from 6 p.m.- 8 p.m.

An Arizona lawmaker who repeatedly harassed women has become the first since the swell of the #MeToo movement to get kicked out of office by colleagues but likely will not be the last to face repercussions amid intensifying scrutiny of sexual misconduct in state legislatures.
The heightened focus on harassment and misconduct has led to growing calls for change in a year that already has seen an unusually large number of women expressing interest in running for office.
“This conduct perpetuates the good-old-boys culture all too familiar to women in workplaces across the nation,” said Ohio state Rep. Teresa Fedor, one of several female Democratic lawmakers who called this week for the resignation of Republican Rep. Bill Seitz because of offense remarks. “Women and men deserve better, not more of the same tired excuses. It's time for a change.”

With his expulsion on Thursday, Arizona Rep. Don Shooter became the 15th state lawmaker to leave office since the start of 2017 (the others resigned) after being accused of sexual misconduct. About 20 others have faced lesser consequences, ranging from forced apologies to suspensions to the loss of powerful leadership posts, according to a state-by-state review by The Associated Press.
Sexual harassment investigations are ongoing against other state lawmakers, including in California, Hawaii, Kentucky and Oregon. On Friday, the Democratic leaders of the California Assembly and Senate released records that show four current lawmakers have faced such complaints since 2006, although none was formally disciplined. They include a 2017 allegation against a female lawmaker, Democratic Assemblywoman Autumn Burke, who later took responsibility for engaging in sexually charged banter.
The issue is already beginning to resonate in election campaigns. Women have stepped forward as candidates in five of the eight upcoming elections across the nation to replace lawmakers who resigned amid sexual misconduct allegations.
In California, a former legislative staffer who says she was aware that a co-worker was being sexually harassed is now running for the lawmaker's seat. The alleged incident happened years ago when former Assemblyman Raul Bocanegra was serving as chief of staff for another lawmaker. Bocanegra resigned in November amid multiple allegations.
Yolie Anguiano said she decided to run for Bocanegra's seat in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley after the allegations surfaced and that she regrets not speaking up at the time about what she knew. Anguiano said she was fearful of retaliation and believes electing more women is critical to addressing issues such as health care and education.
“I want to have that seat at the table to bring up these policy issues but also to hold those folks who are hurting other people, whether they are men and women, to hold them accountable,” she said.
In Oklahoma, Amber Jensen, a Democrat who represents a rural part of the state, is running to replace former state Sen. Bryce Marlatt, who resigned in September after being charged with sexual battery stemming from an incident with an Uber driver. Jensen said she attended last year's women's march in Oklahoma City and was inspired to see so many women stepping forward.
“I feel like a woman's voice is missing from the very conversations that affect all women,” Jensen said. “I am tired of men making decisions for women.”
In what could be a historic election, many women have said they plan to run for office this year for the first time at all levels of government, from statehouses to Congress. That is driven largely by Democratic frustration over the election of President Donald Trump, but the #MeToo movement also is playing a role.
Experts say lawmaker resignations and retirements can provide an opportunity for women, because it's easier for a political newcomer to be competitive in an open seat rather than challenging an incumbent with name recognition and a stockpile of campaign cash.
“When the issue is sexual harassment and men behaving very badly, it also opens up a window for a woman candidate,” said Debbie Walsh, who leads the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. “Whether it's true or not, women are perceived to be more ethical and honest and far less likely to behave in the manner that these lawmakers did.”
Some men also are citing accusations of sexual misconduct against male lawmakers as part of their impetus for mounting electoral challenges this year.
Brian Kent Strow, an economics professor at Western Kentucky University, said he was frustrated when negotiations to fix the state's multi-billion public pension debt fell apart last fall following reports that four Republican lawmakers had secretly signed a sexual harassment settlement. One of those lawmakers was Rep. Michael Meredith, Strow's representative and someone he had voted for in the past.
When the daughter of one of Meredith's Republican colleagues subsequently accused the lawmaker of sending her inappropriate Facebook messages, Strow decided to challenge Meredith in the Republican primary.
“That made me upset, that the real business of the state would get sidetracked because people were misbehaving personally,” said Strow, adding: “I had basically had enough.”
Meredith declined to comment Friday about the accusations or his re-election bid.
Associated Press writers Adam Beam in Frankfort, Kentucky, Bob Christie in Phoenix and Julie Carr Smyth in Columbus, Ohio, contributed to this report.

Guy Fieri doesn't mess around when it comes to grocery shopping.
The chef and host of Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives appears on this week's episode of Jay Leno's Garage and showed off an impressive “car” of his own.
In a sneak preview of Thursday's episode, Fieri pulls out of a big red garage, driving an enormous shopping cart while seated in the top basket.
“It's called the express lane,” Fieri says as Leno laughs in disbelief.
“Is this what you use to go shopping?” Leno asks before jumping in and exclaiming, “Let's go shopping!”
The 2012 “Shopper Chopper” has a 300-horsepower engine and can hold up to 146 paper bags—probably enough for about a year's worth of groceries for a single person.
The two take the cart for a spin, driving the roaring creation through a peaceful countryside while making jokes about its appearance.

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI Some of the world's biggest pension funds, seeking long-term returns on green investments, are scouting for deals in India's solar power sector, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is targeting $100 billion in investment in the next five years.
Power demand in Asia's third-largest economy is set to surge as the economy grows and more people move into the cities. India estimates peak electricity demand will more than quadruple in the next two decades to 690 gigawatt (GW), which would require rapid growth in generation and transmission capacity.
That potential, helped by cheaper solar material costs and government efforts to curb pollution, is drawing global investors, including Canada's top pension fund managers - Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), and Ontario Teacher's Pension Plan (OTPP).
Investors' focus is primarily on solar power generation, funding large-scale solar parks.
CDPQ, which has C$270.7 billion ($199 billion) in net assets, says it plans to invest in India's solar sector with Azure Power (AZRE.N), a New York-listed firm with about 1 GW of solar capacity under various stages of development.
"We plan to do more with them. Our approach is really to pick the right partner and then build a platform that can be sustained over several years," said Anita George, CDPQ's South Asia head, adding she wouldn't rule out investing in other solar ventures in future.
Other international investors have already entered India's renewable energy sector, such as Dutch fund manager APG, Canada's Brookfield Asset Management (BAMa.TO), the private equity arms of Goldman Sachs (GS.N), JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), and European utilities EDF (EDF.PA), Engie (ENGIE.PA) and Enel (ENEI.MI).
APG Asset Management, which last year agreed to jointly invest $132 million with India's Piramal Enterprises (PIRA.NS) into solar power, is looking for more deals.
"We expect to be able to announce another investment in the Indian renewable energy sector in the coming months," said Hans-Martin Aerts, APG's infrastructure head for Asia Pacific.
Alok Verma, an executive director at Kotak Investment Banking, which has advised companies on renewable deals, said he expects at least 5 GW of solar power to be added from next year, most of it supported by overseas funds.

AIMING HIGH
Solar power generation capacity in India has more than tripled in less than three years to over 12 GW, helped by lower module prices and borrowing costs, and a government drive - but that is still only around 4 percent of total power capacity of about 315 GW.
China, the world's biggest solar producer, more than doubled its capacity last year, to 77.42 GW.
Suyi Kim, Asia Pacific head at CPPIB, Canada's largest pension manager, said solar appears more attractive in India than wind power. "In India, my impression is that solar seems to be more attractive. But it's case by case," she said.
India typically logs more than 300 days of sunshine a year.
Kim declined to comment on any specific investment plans, but two people with knowledge of developments said CPPIB was scouting for deals.
Funding and M&A in India's solar sector amounted to around $1.6 billion in January-March, says research firm Mercom.
While deal sizes have been relatively small, some companies such as Japan's SoftBank (9984.T), along with partners, have pledged to invest $20 billion in Indian solar power generation projects.
SoftBank said the timeline for investments would depend on state and central governments. "We remain committed to building a GW-scale portfolio of solar projects in India," said Raman Nanda, CEO of SB Energy, a joint venture of SoftBank, Foxconn Technology Group (2354.TW) and Bharti Enterprises. "We will do this through strategic partnerships."
NOT ALL SUNSHINE
None of this comes without risk, of course.
Investors could face payment delays from India's heavily-indebted power distribution firms, and some experts note that the bidding for projects in government auctions is too aggressive, with per unit prices slumping more than 70 percent since 2010.
"Getting returns on investments ... and getting paid by distribution companies are the major risks being assessed by foreign investors," said Sumant Sinha, CEO at ReNew Power, a renewable energy firm backed by Goldman.
Intermittency - power is only produced under bright sunlight - is another issue, as there are additional costs for using inverters or diesel generators to use solar power at night.
"Based on current market conditions and policies, I see a path to 65-70 GW (solar capacity) by 2022, but not more," said Mercom CEO Raj Prabhu.
That's still some way short of the government pledge for 100 GW by 2022.
"To reach 100 GW by 2022, distribution company finances need to improve drastically, power demand has to increase quickly, and transmission infrastructure needs to keep up," Prabhu said.

Chinese Communist ruler Xi Jinping claimed the office of the presidency a second time on Sunday, beginning a term in office that, with term limits on the office repealed, could be the second of an unlimited number in the future.
Xi also serves as the head of the Communist Party and commander-in-chief of the People's Liberation Army, a “trinity” of offices that Chinese state media insists is necessary to keep in the hands of one person.
In addition to assuming the office of the presidency, Xi took an oath of allegiance to the Chinese constitution, the first such act in the history of China. Following this month's National People's Congress, Xi's name is part of that Chinese constitution, in which legislators enshrined his governing philosophy, “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.”
The Global Times, a Chinese government newspaper, reported that various government media outlets praised Xi as “helmsman of the country” and “guide of the people,” celebrating at least another five years of his rule. The Times claimed in its headline that his re-election—by a small circle of Chinese regime elites, not by popular vote—was “supported by [the] whole nation”
Citing the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party, the newspaper declared: “Practices have proved that Xi is the pathfinder of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era and the navigator in achieving the great dream of national rejuvenation.”
“He is no doubt the lingxiu, or leader, who is supported by the whole Party and loved by the people,” the People's Daily reportedly declared.
Lingxiu roughly translates to “leader,” but invokes the rule of Mao Zedong, when the title was more commonly used. Xi would be the first Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping to be commonly referred to as lingxiu.
“Usually lingxiu has broad meaning and refers to several people at the highest level. But in the current circumstances, it has specific meaning which may endow Mr. Xi a role equivalent to Deng and Mao,” political analyst Roger Woo told the Hindu, according to the Guardian.
The People's Daily referred to Xi as lingxiu for the first time in January, as well, in a column urging Chinese people to do away with any public displays of dissent or criticism and “faithfully follow the lingxiu, use our courage and morale … and make strides toward a brighter future.”
The Global Times explained that month, quoting a Chinese Communist Party professor, “The word lingxiu means more than just a leader. It is often bestowed to a leader who enjoys the highest prestige, who is the most capable and who is widely recognized by the entire Party.”
Xinhua, a Chinese government newswire service, celebrated the beginning of Xi's second term with effusive praise, deeming him the “chief architect” of reforms that have made China increasingly repressive yet influential through programs such as the installation of “Confucius Institutes” in foreign universities and “One Belt, One Road,” a global infrastructure project that would grant China near-total control of world transport.
“He is regarded as the chief architect,” Xinhua proclaims. “In the five years, more than 1,500 reform measures were issued, affecting economic, political, social, cultural, environmental fields, national defense and Party building. Government red tape was cut. Foreign investment was made easier.”
“Xi has said happiness comes out of arduous work,” the news service continues, in an article that features several photos of what appears to be Xi engaging local residents in rural and underdeveloped areas of China.
Xinhua reported that “thunderous applause reverberated in the Great Hall of the People” when the National People's Congress re-elected Xi unanimously. Yet cracks have begun to appear in Xi's public approval, indicated by the government's growing efforts to silence dissent. When Chinese officials first announced that they would repeal term limits to allow Xi to remain in power forever, Chinese internet censors shut down anything that even distantly seemed like dissent, resulting in Chinese social media outlets blocking searches for phrases like “I don't agree” and the letter N, which some dissenters had begun to use to criticize Xi.
The son of a prison officer murdered by the IRA has said Sinn Fein must expel its Irish senator who shared an offensive tweet about his father.
Senator Maire Devine was suspended from the party over an offensive tweet in relation to Brian Stack – a senior figure at Portlaoise prison when he was killed in 1983.
The party suspended her for three months following what it described as “unacceptable Twitter activity” on Sunday night.
Senator Devine issued an apology following her suspension, but Mr Stack's son Austin felt it was “not sincere”.
The offensive tweet which had been retweeted by Senator Devine – Sinn Fein's mental health spokesperson – appeared to come from a fake version of the Irish Government News Service.
In it, Mr Stack was described as a “sadist prison officer”.
Brian Stack was shot in the neck in March 1983 and died 18 months later
His son Austin, who engaged in conversation with Senator Devine on Twitter following her offensive retweet, said: “Suspending her for 12 weeks and then welcoming her back into the party is not acceptable.
“If they really want to show that they are democrats they need to expel her immediately.
“Also we need a full investigation of these troll accounts.”
He added: “There is no apology from SF in their statement. I note that Senator Devine made an apology through SF but has not contacted myself or the family.
Senator Maire Devine retweeted a post that appeared to come from a fake Irish government news service site
“We believe that this apology is not sincere as she was offered lots of opportunities last night to withdraw the tweet and subsequent tweets. Instead she tried to belittle me by claiming I was sensitive.”
He urged her to follow the example of Barry McElduff and resign her senate seat.
West Tyrone MP Mr McElduff stepped aside over a social media posting about the Kingsmills shootings earlier this year.
Of the defamatory remarks about his father he said: “The Provo movement have a tactic of blackening victims' names as a way of somehow justifying what they did. They took my father's life but I will not allow them to take my father's good name.”
Austin Stack
Sinn Fein national chairman Declan Kearney said: “This is unacceptable behaviour from a Sinn Fein elected representative.
“The ard chomhairle has suspended, with immediate effect, Senator Devine from party membership and all party activities for a period of three months.
“The whip has been removed and Senator Devine will be outside of the Leinster House team for that period.
“Sinn Fein strongly disapproves of what has happened. There can be no excuse for the hurt and offence which has been caused to the Stack family.”
Following the suspension a statement was issued on behalf of Senator Devine: “It was never my intention to cause any distress or hurt, particularly to victims of the conflict.
“I want to offer my most sincere apologies to the family of the late Brian Stack.
“I accept the decision by the party national chairperson to suspend my membership of Sinn Fein for three months.
“I deeply regret what has happened, and want to profusely apologise for all the offence and hurt caused by my twitter activity.”
Senator Devine is a mental health nurse and trade unionist from Dublin and has been a member of South Dublin County Council.
Brian Stack was the chief prison officer in Portlaoise prison when he was shot in the neck as he left a boxing match in Dublin.
He was left paralysed and brain-damaged by the shooting as he crossed a road outside the National Stadium in Dublin in late March 1983.
He suffered for 18 months before dying from his injuries at the age of 47.
He was the only prison officer murdered in the Republic of Ireland during the Troubles.
In 2013 the IRA acknowledged in a statement to the Stack family that it had been responsible for the murder, though said it had not been sanctioned by its leadership.
* Dollar drops to three-week low versus euro * The Biggest gold ETF sees the biggest one-day inflow since Sept * GRAPHIC-2017 asset returns: tmsnrt.rs/2jvdmXl (Updates prices; adds comment, byline, NEW YORK dateline) By Marcy Nicholson and Jan Harvey NEW YORK/LONDON, April 20 Gold steadied on Thursday after its biggest one-day drop in more than six weeks, with a retreat in the dollar arresting the slide, though moves were muted as markets await the outcome of the looming French presidential election. Polls ahead of the French vote, which begins this weekend, give both far-right and far-left candidates a chance of making it into next month's run-off, though centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron is shown in the lead. The euro rose to a three-week high against the U.S. dollar. Spot gold was up 0.16 percent at $1,281.02 an ounce by 2:32 p.m. EDT (1832 GMT). The metal hit a five-month high of $1,295.42 on Monday before pulling back, and was on track to fall this week after five straight weeks of gains. U.S. gold futures for June delivery settled up 0.03 percent at $1,283.80. "Even though momentum has been positive there are other factors preventing a quick move higher from here - the sentiment is still that there will be stronger data from the U.S., and yields will probably rise. That will likely limit the upside (for gold)," said ABN Amro analyst Georgette Boele. Improving appetite for equities, which edged higher in Europe and the United States, was also undermining demand for gold as a haven from risk, she added. Holdings of the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, New York-listed SPDR Gold Shares , rose 11.8 tonnes on Wednesday for their biggest one-day inflow since September, data from the fund showed. "While the metal is well positioned for a test of $1,300 with geopolitical concerns underpinning its safe-haven status, the failed tests of $1,290 are beginning to weigh upon investor confidence," MKS said in a note. Among other precious metals, spot palladium was the strongest gainer of the day, rising 3.2 percent to $799.58 an ounce, on track for its biggest one-day jump since early February. "Supply will struggle to register any growth, and indeed is likely to show a small decline following unusually high production in Russia in 2016. Demand, on the other hand, will continue to expand," said Johnson Matthey Precious Metals Management in a quarterly report. "Higher vehicle production, combined with an increase in average catalyst loadings at a global level, will drive autocatalyst demand for the metal to another record level." Silver was down 0.4 percent at $18.01, while platinum was up 1.1 percent at $973.24. (Additional reporting by Nallur Sethuraman in Bengaluru; Editing by David Goodman and Chris Reese)
× ‘Do not turn a blind eye:' Expert says rising numbers of teens joining gangs
DES MOINES, Wash. – A 13-year-old boy killed a 14-year-old boy in an argument over the color of a pair of shoes.
The shooting happened Thursday in Everett and police say the crime was gang related.
A local gang expert shared his insight with Q13 News about the warning signs parents should know.
Local and federal law enforcement revealed gang related violence is on the rise in Snohomish County, while experts say gang leaders are sometimes recruiting kids beginning in elementary school.
“Parents, we want our kids to like us,” said educational consultant Gabriel Morales. “But sometimes we don't even know we're being enablers when we allow them to do this stuff.”
Morales spent his career alongside gang members as a corrections officer for more than three decades. He says some kids could easily fall into the wrong group and start finding trouble fast.
“Do not think it can't happen to you, do not turn a blind eye,” he said.
In a report prepared for to local lawmakers this past summer, police say in South Snohomish County alone there were at least 56 gang related shootings since early 2015. Fourteen people were injured, and Wednesday's shooting in Everett raises the total deaths to 3. Many of the victims share a striking commonality.
“We're looking at suspects and victims who are in their teens,” said Shari Ireton from the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office.
“There's an allure,” says Morales. “There are a lot of things that makes them feel like they have power over their lives. A lot of times the kids are feeling powerless, so we have to empower kids more.”
Morales says some of the signs can be right in front of your face; like finding drawings or pictures glorifying gang members and gang signs — or finding spray paint cans, or drug paraphernalia.
That's why he says parents have to be more engaged but also use tough love with kids.
“Go into their room,” he said. “You have to go through their notebooks, find out who they're hanging out with. Set curfews, set limits.”
Morales says many times kids join gangs because they aren't getting structure and affection at home, so those needs get filled by gangs but it rarely ends in anything positive for a teenager.
“What they usually find is misery, agony, and life in prison or death,” Morales warned.
Hancock County supervisors say a massive infrastructure project is now underway, paving roads and adding improvements to bridges and drainage throughout the county. (Photo source: WLOX)
Hancock County supervisors say a massive infrastructure project is now underway, paving roads and adding improvements to bridges and drainage throughout the county.
Supervisor Greg Shaw said money from a $3 million bond is paying for road improvements, starting in the northern part of the county.
"They're moving in, and moving fast," Shaw said. "It won't hold traffic up much."
He said the county identified where the new asphalt was needed most, and where it would benefit the greatest number of people, before deciding where to concentrate their efforts.
"There will be improvements in the areas of Leetown, Flat Top, Necaise, Dedeaux, Rotten Bayou, Lakeshore, and Bayou Lacroix."
Board President Blaine LaFontaine said other areas receiving upgrades include White Cypress, Lot McCarthy, Highway 43, Caesar-Necaise, Fenton-Dedeaux, Standard-Dedeaux, and Standard-Cemetery.
"We knew it was something long overdue," LaFontaine said. "Statewide, infrastructure has been such a hot topic. We feel taking responsibility on a local level is a priority."
LaFontaine said improvements to the roads are part of a four-year plan.
"Initially, we approved $1.5 million in improvements. We're starting the first phase of improvement projects, and we're still looking to identify, over the next two to three fiscal years, an additional $1.5 million," Lafontaine noted.
LaFontaine said along with the bond money, funds from an $800,000 a year local gaming tax will go toward county improvements.

Plans have the old library in Gulfport coming back to life. (Photo source: WLOX)
Ground work on one of the most anticipated projects on the coast is moving right along. The future site of the Mississippi Aquarium in Gulfport is undergoing dirt and drainage work.
There's another project in the works that ties right in to the needs of the big attraction. While technically not a part of the incoming aquarium's property, plans have the old library in Gulfport coming back to life to play a big role in the operations of the attraction.
"We're restoring the library, maintaining the architectural integrity of the building, and re-purposing it to a highly functional, brand new, intermodal center," said Coast Transit Authority Executive Director Kevin Coggin.
Coggin just signed a 40-year lease with the city for the $1.6 million property. Once renovated, Coggin said the bottom floor will be dedicated to CTA business, including a hub for transportation and possibly a food court.
The top 14,000 square feet will be rented out to the aquarium for administrative offices and classrooms. According to Coggin, the only thing standing in the way of construction is an approval by archives and history, which he says is almost there.
"The community will see actual renovation take place on this library this summer," Coggin said.
He hopes to be up and running in the location when the aquarium opens. Then, future plans include a public tram way across Hwy. 90.
"We're going to operate a public tram across to bring people back and forth with a route. You'll be able to bike across and walk across, and there are a lot of good elements to that, too. One of them is safety," said Coggin.
So far, Coggin said work to bring the $8.9 million library renovation to light has been making big strides, and he's looking forward to being a part of the economic boom expected in the city once the attraction opens.
The Gulfport City Council is considering an agreement Tuesday to fund part of $633,000 in improvements near the future CTA center.

The big guns are all primed up for global football's quarterfinal battles
Published 4:41 PM, July 04, 2018
SAINT PETERSBURG, Russia – Just 8 teams remain from the 32 who started the World Cup in Russia.
AFP looks how each side are placed ahead of the quarterfinals on Friday and Saturday.
URUGUAY vs FRANCE
Uruguay
One of only two teams to win all 4 games so far, Uruguay boasts one of the meanest defenses in Russia marshalled by talismanic captain Diego Godin, and a lethal strikeforce in Edinson Cavani and Luis Suarez.
Cavani's fitness is the big concern ahead of Friday's meeting. The Paris Saint-Germain striker limped off with a calf injury after scoring twice to end Cristiano Ronaldo and Portugal's World Cup dreams in the last 16.
France
After cruising through the group stage in underwhelming fashion, France kicked through the gears thanks to Kylian Mbappe's blistering pace to blow Argentina away in a 4-3 World Cup classic in the last 16.
A very different task awaits in breaking through Uruguay's brick wall of a defense that will not allow Mbappe the same space to exploit. But as legs start to tire in the latter stages, France's strength in depth could start to make the difference.

BRAZIL vs BELGIUM
Brazil
Along with Uruguay, Brazil shares the best defensive record, having conceded just once in 4 games so far and are slowly starting to hit their stride at the other end of the field too as Neymar struck his second goal of the tournament in the last 16.
After a disappointing 1-1 draw against Switzerland, 2-0 wins over Costa Rica, Serbia and Mexico have taken Brazil into a 7th straight quarterfinal and they remain the favorites to erase the scars of a humiliating 7-1 semifinal thrashing at the hands of Germany 4 years ago.
Belgium
Belgium will be the true test of how good the Brazilian back line is in Kazan on Friday, but coach Roberto Martinez has some big decisions to make after a stunning comeback from 2-0 down in the final 21 minutes avoided a shock exit to Japan in the last 16.
Japan picked the holes in Martinez's attack-minded 3-4-2-1 system and the Red Devils had to rely on their superior physical power in the latter stages with Jan Vertonghen and Marouane Fellaini heading home before Nacer Chadli completing the comeback at the end of a stunning counter-attack.
Martinez must now find the right balance to harness the best from Kevin De Bruyne, Eden Hazard and Romelu Lukaku without leaving Belgium exposed.
SWEDEN vs ENGLAND
Sweden
They are not the prettiest side, but Sweden is extremely effective and happy to play the role of underdog, having seen off the Netherlands and Italy in qualifying and Germany in the group stages.
Their run to the last 8 for the first time since 1994 has been built on 3 clean sheets in 4 games, but while hard to break down, they lack a potent force up front.
England
Freed from the curse of the penalty shootout after they beat Colombia from the spot, England will be favorites to reach a first World Cup semifinal since 1990.
For 92 minutes in Moscow, the Three Lions kept their cool as Colombia lost theirs and played with patience in possession rarely seen by England sides in recent years.
Yerry Mina's stoppage-time header threatened to change all that, but a first World Cup win on penalties in 4 attempts gives Gareth Southgate's men reason to believe this time really will be different.
RUSSIA vs CROATIA
Russia
The hosts have delighted their public by surpassing all expectations to make it to the last 8 thanks to a stunning penalty shootout elimination of 2010 winners Spain.
Russian players were on their knees in exhaustion after defending for 120 minutes in Moscow with just 26 percent possession and they must now summon another huge physical effort, with Croatia expected to dominate the ball once more.
Croatia
Arguably the outstanding performers of the group stage, Croatia was made to suffer to make it past Denmark on penalties.
Luck often has not accompanied Croatia in the knockout stages after bright tournament starts, but having bounced back from the blow of Luka Modric's missed penalty 4 minutes before the end of extra time in the last 16, the time for a highly talented generation may have come. – Rappler.com

Man jailed 3 years for 'stealing to buy Christmas groceries'
Bulawayo – A Zimbabwean man has been sentenced to three years in jail after he admitted to stealing property worth $1 310 from his two neighbours so he could raise money to "buy Christmas groceries", a report has said.
According to The Sunday News, Ngiri Ncube, 33, pleaded guilty to two charges of unlawful entry, and theft.
Pleading for lenience, Ncube said that he committed the offences in a bid to raise money to buy Christmas groceries and to pay school fees for his children.
Passing down judgement, Plumtree magistrate Taurai Manwere sentenced Ncube to three years in jail. Twelve months were, however, suspended on condition that he does not commit a similar offence in the next five years.
This came just a week after a teenage boy appeared before a court for stealing over $2 000 from his father to host a party for his friends.
The 15-years-old boy stole the cash which his father had been saving to build a house.
The boy's father was based in the United Kingdom and had come back home for the Christmas holiday.

Up to 600 more units planned for Vancouver with help of $66 million from the provincial government
Stack them up. Take them down. Move them around. Repeat.
What could easily pass as a description of the children's toy Lego could also be a portrait of British Columbia's latest tool in the fight against homelessness.
The province is turning to modular housing to help with a critical lack of short-term accommodation. Temporary modular housing involves the construction of small, self-contained living quarters, which can be shipped directly from a factory and quickly assembled.
Proponents applaud the technique not only for its cost savings, but also because it slashes delivery time from years to months.
“I liken it to being six months from idea to occupancy,” said Luke Harrison, CEO of the Vancouver Affordable Housing Agency.
Harrison's organization has assembled 40 units, each about 23 square metres, in Vancouver as part of a pilot project.
Up to 600 more units are planned for the city with the help of $66 million from the provincial government. Another 2,000 modular units are planned across B.C. over two years.
Permanent housing can take years to get approved and built, but prefabricated modules can quickly be moved to new locations and reassembled in new configurations depending on local needs. As a result, vacant sites waiting to be developed are suddenly candidates for temporary complexes that can house 50 or more people.
“It's not a solution for everything, but it's a great tool that we have in our arsenal now to deal with things like the homeless population that requires an urgent and critical response that just doesn't come as easily through traditional forms of construction and development,” Harrison said.

A recent homelessness survey of Metro Vancouver communities between 2011 and 2016 found the number of people without shelter grew by 40 per cent, to 4,211 people. That's four times faster than general population growth over that same period, the survey said.
Ethel Whitty, Vancouver's director of homelessness services, said the initiative marks a shift in the city's approach to helping the homeless that promotes finding accommodation as a priority.
“Up until recent years, it was thought that you had to house people who were ready for housing. They had to be dry and sober and, say, they had to have their goals organized,” she said. “Actually, people who are housed are much more likely to be able to organize their life plan.”
Where to place modular complexes depends on a number of factors, including access to health care and transit, zoning, environmental factors and community consultation, she added.
Kathleen Llewellyn-Thomas, who oversees community services for the city, said housing is only one element of a broader overall program, which will include support workers and other resources for tenants.
Part of the inspiration for the project came from temporary camps and catering facilities used in the resource industry to house workers in remote locations. Vancouver's pilot project used expertise from Horizon North, which operated in the industrial sector for years before expanding to residential and commercial development.
Scott Matson, the company's chief financial officer, said the key to modular housing is the timeline.
“Imagine Lego blocks being completed in a controlled and closed environment, in a manufacturing environment rather than an outdoor construction environment, shipped to site and assembled on site,” Matson said.
The company builds the modules in Kamloops, B.C., transports them on site by truck and assembles them using a crane.
He estimated the typical lifespan of a module to be as long as 25 years and said the aesthetic of residential projects are “very, very different” from work camps.
“Once constructed, … you'd be unable to tell that it was anything different than a regular apartment building or hotel complex.”

April 28 Qualcomm Inc said on Friday Apple Inc will not pay royalties to its contract manufacturers, that are owed to the chipmaker, for sales made in the first quarter of 2017.
Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips used in smartphones, also said the iPhone maker will withhold further payments until the ongoing legal dispute with Qualcomm is resolved.
Apple sued Qualcomm in January accusing Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates.
Shares of Qualcomm fell 4.3 percent to $50.91 in premarket trading, while shares of Apple were up marginally at $143.92.
Qualcomm also slashed its profit and revenue forecasts for the current quarter, to exclude royalty revenue from Apple's contract manufacturers.
The company said it now expects current-quarter revenue of $4.8 billion-$5.6 billion, down from the $5.3 billion-$6.1 billion it had expected previously.
Qualcomm also cut its forecast for current-quarter adjusted profit to 75-85 cents per share, from 90 cents-$1.15 per share. (Reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar)
PLATINUM mining company Zimplats says the redevelopment of Bimha Mine remains on schedule to reach full production in April 2018.
By Melody Chikono
Bimha Mine, which collapsed in 2014, affected output, resulting in a 50% drop. This was, however, mitigated by the subsequent opening of South Pit Temporary Mine as a stop-gap measure.
As at December 31, 2017, a total of US$46,8 million had been spent on the project against an approved total project budget of US$101 million. A conveyor system is expected to bring ore from underground. A transfer tower is being set up to enable full operationalisation of the mine.
The project is expected to cost more than US$100 million. It comes at a time the mine is also developing the Base Metal Refinery in Selous as part of the beneficiation process.
In a statement accompanying its results for the Q4 ending December 30 2017, Zimplats said it was also on schedule for the development of Mupani Mine (the replacement for the Ngwarati and Rukodzi mines).
The project is targeting ore contact by May 2020 and full production in August 2025. “A total of US$20,1 million had been spent on the project as at December 31 2017 against an approved total project budget of US$264 million,” Zimplats said.
Meanwhile, Zimplats' revenue for Q4 2017 increased by 80% from the previous quarter on the back of the sale of concentrates accumulated from the previous quarter and a 4% increase in the basket price of the metals sold.
Net operating costs increased by 84% compared to the previous quarter largely due to increases in 4E sales volumes, selling expenses arising from the export of concentrate stockpiled in the previous quarter and smelter costs.
Due to increases in revenue, royalty and commission expenses rose by 76% from the previous quarter. During the period, production increased by 2% from the previous quarter due to the ramp-up in production at Bimha Mine and a better performance at the South Pit Mine.
“Tonnes milled decreased by 3% from the previous quarter due to a seven-day mill reline shutdown at the Selous Metallurgical Complex concentrator. 4E head grade was maintained at 3,24g/t,” Zimplats said.
“The furnace, which was switched back on in October last year after a successful planned 46-day sidewall reline shutdown, smelted 32 009 tonnes of concentrate, up from 22 654 tonnes done in the previous quarter.”
The company also added that during the period under review, cash cost per 4E ounce increased by 15% from the previous quarter despite the rise in production volumes mainly due to selling expenses and smelting charges for the concentrates produced in the previous quarter, but only exported during the current quarter.
NRA President and current Unified Sportsmen of Florida (USF) Executive Director Marion Hammer says Yeti coolers demanded the NRA cease using the cooler company's logo after the Parkland school shooting.
On April 21, Breitbart News reported Hammer's announcement that Yeti coolers cut ties with the NRA Foundation. Over the next 24 hours, a #BoycotttYeti movement emerged on Twitter and videos of people shooting, crushing, and otherwise destroying their Yeti coolers began making their way onto Facebook, YouTube, and other social media outlets.
Yeti released a statement on Monday claiming the NRA-ILA's statement about the cooler company cutting ties with the NRA Foundation was “inaccurate”:
On Tuesday, Hammer emailed Breitbart News a response to the Yeti statement. The statement said:
YETI severed ties with the NRA and is now engaging in damage control after a backlash from many of its customers. In early March, YETI refused to place a previously negotiated order from NRA-ILA, citing “recent events” as the reason – a clear reference to the tragedy in Parkland, Florida. YETI then delivered notice to the NRA Foundation that it was terminating a 7-year agreement and demanded that the NRA remove the YETI name and logo from all NRA digital assets, as well as refrain from using any YETI trademarks in future print material. While YETI is trying to spin the story otherwise, those are the facts. While Yeti can choose to run from the NRA, they can't run from the facts.
Hammer concluded her statement by noting, “Whether this is due to the recent cancellation of the IPO from their New York City owners is a question only they can answer.”

WASHINGTON May 3 The White House is working on filling all three open slots at the Federal Reserve Board and will announce a new interim boss for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a key banking regulator, Wednesday morning, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
Four months into his administration, President Donald Trump is beginning to put his stamp on U.S. financial regulation, with the Senate approving Jay Clayton late Tuesday as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Trump has also ordered Mnuchin to review the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law by June 3, as well as look into other areas of rulemaking, a difficult task given the government's lean crew of regulators.
Mnuchin told a conference of community bankers on Wednesday that Trump has also signed off on a nominee to fill the role of vice-chair of supervision at the Federal Reserve, but did not name the person. Reuters had previously reported that Randal Quarles, who worked as under secretary for domestic finance at the Treasury under President George W. Bush, was a leading candidate for the role.
Mnuchin said the vice-chair post, created in Dodd-Frank, is an “enormously important” position and they want to name that as soon as they can, adding the administration would not package all three Fed Board nominees into one announcement and confirmation. Still, Mnuchin said the administration was close to naming the two other Fed selections.
A crucial role in overseeing Wall Street's banks, the vice-chair position has been vacant since its creation. Former Fed governor Daniel Tarullo had stepped in to fill the supervision void before leaving the central bank in April.
Nearly every major financial regulator has had significant leadership gaps since Trump was inaugurated in January, and there are more openings on the horizon as the terms expire for rulemakers who were appointed by former President Barack Obama. The U.S. Senate, where Trump's fellow Republicans hold only a slim majority, must sign off on most of the postings which could slow down Trump and Mnuchin's work on changing the reforms that came out of the 2007-09 financial crisis.

LOS ANGELES — NFL Network has suspended pro football analysts Marshall Faulk, Heath Evans and Ike Taylor after allegations of sexual harassment and assault by a former employee, several media outlets reported Monday.
The New York Times reported that the allegations were made in a lawsuit by the former NFL Network employee Jami Cantor, who sued NFL Enterprises in Los Angeles Superior Court in October. The Times said Cantor worked as a wardrobe stylist for the network from 2006 until she was fired in October 2016.
The Times said that Cantor filed an amended complaint on Monday saying that Faulk asked personal questions about her sex life, fondled her and pulled out his genitals while demanding oral sex, that Evans sent nude pictures, and that Taylor sent her a video that showed him pleasuring himself.
The lawsuit and suspensions were first reported by Bloomberg News.
The High Court of England and Wales ruled Monday that a “no-prayer zone” around a London abortion clinic is legal, in a move expected to encourage the establishment of similar buffer zones in the United Kingdom.
In his decision, Mr. Justice Turner agreed that the ban interfered with pro-life activists' human rights, but said it was legitimate for the council to conclude it was a “necessary step in a democratic society.”
“There was substantial evidence that a very considerable number of users of the clinic reasonably felt that their privacy was being very seriously invaded at a time and place when they were most vulnerable and sensitive to uninvited attention,” the judge said.
The “public space protection order” (PSPO) that mandated the buffer zone around the clinic in the London borough of Ealing was challenged by Alina Dulgheriu, a woman who was helped by people she met at a pro-life vigil. Dulgheriu is now the mother of a six-year-old girl.
“I am devastated for those women that since the introduction of the Ealing PSPO, have not been able to access the loving help that I did,” Dulgheriu said after the ruling. ““I am saddened and shocked that the Court has upheld a PSPO that prevents good people giving help to mothers who desperately want it.”
Mrs. Dulgheriu said she is considering other alternatives for appeal.
“I am discussing every option available to me to be able to challenge this decision, which for the sake of vulnerable women and the future of our fundamental freedoms, should not be able to stand,” she added.
The PSPO passed in April created a 330-foot buffer zone around the Marie Stopes clinic, a leading abortion provider in London, effectively banning public prayer, distributing materials, and offering counsel to women seeking an abortion.
Bishop Philip Egan of Portsmouth has said he is “deeply concerned” by the imposition of such “no-prayer zones.”
Elizabeth Howard, spokeswoman for the Be Here for Me campaign, called the decision “a major blow for free speech and human rights in this country.”
“But the struggle for human rights has never been easy,” Howard said. “And while there are women who feel they have no choice but an abortion they don't want, we will do their best to reach them.”
“This decision is certainly not the end of pro-life witness in this country,” she added.

President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will formally inaugurate a partnership Wednesday, a symbolic united front at the White House that, if history is a guide, cannot last intact.
On the U.S. side, the expectations could not be higher for a clean break from what Trump sees as the failures of President Barack Obama's years and a bold stroke for Mideast peace — what the businessman calls “the ultimate deal.”
Success hinges on Netanyahu's cooperation in the near-certain event that Trump asks him to make political or other concessions, the ground on which Netanyahu's relationship with Obama was irreversibly damaged. It may also depend on Trump's own reaction if, as participants in past peace efforts said is likely, Netanyahu attempts to get the better of the new U.S. dealmaker-in-chief.
On the Israeli side, Netanyahu is counting on the Trump administration's aggressive and skeptical U.S. approach to Iran and the nuclear deal, as well as nearly unqualified support for policies toward the Palestinians that have brought international condemnation. And to his political right at home, an increasingly powerful Israeli political constituency wants carte blanche from the new U.S. administration to turn away from the once shared U.S.-Israeli goal of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.
“As the president has made clear, his administration will work to achieve comprehensive agreement that would end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict so that Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace and security,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday. “The way forward toward that goal will also be discussed.”

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - The UK's pension pickle is a key credibility test for Theresa May. The UK prime minister is dithering over whether to keep guaranteeing above-inflation increases to pensioners. She shouldn't.
The triple lock, which fixes increases in the state pension to the highest of inflation, earnings, or 2.5 percent, was a clumsy way of doing something good. It is expensive and arbitrary, but in 2010, when it was introduced, pensions had stagnated for decades.
That's no longer the case. The new state pension is just below 25 percent of UK full-time earnings, similar to the peak in the 1980s, and above the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average. It is close to the minimum income needed to live, as defined by Loughborough University – before private pension provision and other giveaways are taken into account. The median household income of UK pensioners is higher than non-pensioners.
Keeping the lock is expected to increase the amount spent on public pensions by about 1 percentage point to more than 7 percent of GDP by 2067, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. That assumes the triple lock pushes up pension spending by 0.34 percent, on average, over average earnings growth. It could be more expensive if earnings and inflation stagnate due to the spread of automation. Higher social security will push up costs for employers and workers.
Theresa May hinted this week in parliament that she would scrap the triple lock. But reform could still be bungled. One plan, tying pensions to the highest of inflation or earnings, would still be bad: pensions would rise above earnings in scenarios where the economy is weak but inflation is high. A better proposal to align pensioners' and non-pensioners' interests would be to fix pensions just to earnings, perhaps with minor smoothing tweaks.
Such a move could easily be ducked. Current high-ish inflation means the lock will not cost much for the coming parliament. But the UK's decision to leave the European Union gives May a reason to prioritise spending on jobs and investment. Keeping it now will make scrapping it harder in future, and her opposition is weak. Tough action would cement the prime minister's so-far unsubstantiated claim of strong and stable leadership.

UPDATE 2-U.S. regulators still reviewing Fiat Chrysler diesel vehicle fix -lawyer
WASHINGTON, June 14 A U.S. Justice Department lawyer said at a court hearing on Wednesday it could take "weeks or months" before regulators decide whether to approve a software fix for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV diesel vehicles.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions vowed Monday that the Justice Department will “take the most vigorous action” to protect Americans against “racism and bigotry” in the aftermath of the tragedy in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend.
Sessions said on CBS's “This Morning” that he and FBI Director Christopher Wray will meet with President Donald Trump Monday to discuss the violence that left one woman dead after white supremacists clashed with counter-protesters. The meeting was not originally on Trump's schedule.
“You can be sure this Department of Justice in this administration is going to take the most vigorous action to protect the right of people like Heather Heyer, to protest against racism and bigotry,” Sessions said on NBC's “Today” show. “We're going to protect the right to assemble and march. And we're going to prosecute anybody, to the full extent of the law, that violates their ability to do so.”
The Justice Department opened a federal civil rights hate crime investigation after white supremacist groups descended on the Virginia city. James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio, is accused of running his Dodge Challenger into a crowd of people, killing Heyer, a 32-year-old woman, and injuring at least 19 others.
Federal criminal civil rights statutes, including those for hate crimes, may be applicable in Fields' attack, a Justice Department official familiar with the investigation said Sunday.
Scores of federal and local law enforcement officials are working together to gather evidence before determining whether the matter should proceed in the federal or state system or both, the official said.
“There's no bigger case right now that we're working on,” Sessions said on CBS. “Every resource that's needed will be dedicated to it. We're going to study what happened in Charlottesville.”
“We'll have our top people in Charlottesville,” he added.
While there is no single domestic terrorism statute, “domestic terrorism” is defined under federal law for purposes of other crimes and investigations, as criminal acts “dangerous to human life” and “appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population.”
“Motive often is not clear, but we have enough evidence to be suspicious that the suspect intended to send a message and not just harm immediate victims,” the official said Sunday.
The department is also investigating whether others may have been involved in planning the attack.
Trump has been widely criticized for not directly calling out white supremacists for inciting violence and promoting racist rhetoric. But Sessions pushed back on that criticism Monday, saying on CBS that Trump's condemnation of the events was “strong.”
“It was a long statement on violence, bigotry and hatred,” he said on CBS, referring to Trump's remarks on Saturday. “He condemned it. He called for unity in our country. He called on us to get along with one another and have love and affection and unity under the American Constitution.”
“It was just shortly after the event happened, within a couple of hours, actually, from him I'm sure, knowing about it, so I thought that was strong,” Sessions added.

Elasto Painters finally string 2 wins in a row in the PBA Philippine Cup
Published 10:19 PM, February 02, 2018
MANILA, Philippines – Chris Tiu stayed true to being more aggressive for Rain or Shine as he knocked down timely buckets in crunchtime to lift the Elasto Painters over the reeling Meralco Bolts, 90-84, in the 2018 PBA Philippine Cup at the Mall of Asia Arena Friday, February 2.
Tiu scored 5 points in a 7-0 run that Rain or Shine used to turn a 79-all deadlock to an 86-79 lead with 52 seconds left in the game. The Elasto Painters preserved that advantage to get their second win in a row.
Meralco cut the deficit to 4 points after a Reynel Hugnata triple with 26.1 seconds left but could not find the bottom of the net in the dying seconds. It dropped to a 2-5 card, tying the Blackwater Elite.
Tiu finished with 18 points, 7 assists and 3 rebounds and two steals for the E-Painters, who improved to 4-3 to join the TNT KaTropa at 4th place.
Ed Daquioag added 16 points and 3 steals in the win while Beau Belga registered a double-double of 13 points, 13 rebounds and 3 assists.
"I hope tuloy tuloy na (it continues) but we play Magnolia on Friday and I think they're the hottest team now. And Paul (Lee) will play that game. Like I said, we just have to think how we can get better," said Rain or Shine head coach Caloy Garcia.
The Bolts had 11 more assists but committed 23 turnovers which Rain or Shine used to score 27 points. The E-Painters swiped 13 steals to the Bolts' 1.
KG Canaleta had 24 points and 8 rebounds while Hugnatan added 13 in the losing effort.
The Scores:
Rain or Shine (90): Tiu 18, Daquioag 16, Belga 13, Yap 11, Ahanmisi 9, Ponferada 9, Almazan 6, Borboran 4, Norwood 3, Cruz 2, Nambata 2

Self-exiled Chinese real-estate mogul Guo Wengui blasted what he called the “kleptocracy” running China, and warned that a wave of Chinese spies are being dispatched to “decimate” the United States – where Guo is currently sheltered.
CNBC reports that his remarks come as the Chinese government has doubled down on its allegations against the billionaire, accusing him of crimes including corruption and rape – crimes he firmly denies.

“What the U.S. ought to do is take action, instead of just talking to the Chinese kleptocracy,” Guo said through a translator at an event at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.
“They are just a tiny group of Mafia, pure and simple,” said Guo, who also goes by the name Miles Kwok on social media. “I would like all the members of the Chinese Communist Party to wake up and say no to this ruling clique.”
Guo applied for asylum in the U.S. this month after arriving on a tourist visa. He is currently working out of a $78 million penthouse in New York City as he fights off the accusations from the Chinese government surfacing after he accused powerful officials of serious corruption, including the head of the Communist Party's anti-corruption board.
Although his social media accounts have been wiped on occasion, he has managed to often restore them and continue his barrage of attacks against the “kleptocracy.”
Guo himself is no stranger to corruption. As part of his rags-to-riches story, he befriended a Chinese intelligence official who later was accused of taking $8.8 million in bribes from Guo.
The 50-year-old has promised to continue as he wants to “change China” even in the face of the lengthy accusations against him. The Wall Street Journal reports that he has amassed a $150 million war chest with which to fight back.
“The U.S. is the last land of justice,” Guo told the Journal. “I would not be alive were it not for the U.S.”
However, he is still having issues in America. His Facebook account was taken down over the weekend, purportedly for violating terms of service and CNBC reports that a planned speech on Tuesday at the Hudson Institute was postponed.
In his remarks this week, he said he was aware of multiple attempts by the “kleptocracy … to weaken the United States, to bring about turmoil in the United States and to … decimate the United States.”
“These plans pose great threats to the American people and their property,” Guo said, according to CNBC, adding that those efforts are “100 times, or even 1,000 times” as potentially damaging as the 9/11 terror attacks.

Students and faculty of the Hungary-based Central European University listen to the school's rector, Michael Ignatieff, address a town hall meeting after the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban tabled a new bill that could force the 25-year-old school out of Hungary, in Budapest, Hungary March 29, 2017. REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo
BUDAPEST Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday a Budapest university founded by financier George Soros had "cheated" in awarding its diplomas and violated Hungarian laws.
Orban, outspoken critic of liberal civil organisations funded by Soros, said the Central European University's fate depended now on talks between Hungary and the United States.
The U.S. State Department said in a statement that CEU was a "premier academic institution" that promoted academic excellence and critical thinking.
"We urge the Government of Hungary to avoid taking any legislative action that would compromise CEU's operations or independence," acting spokesman Mark Toner said.
In an interview on state radio, Orban said the CEU violated rules by issuing diplomas recognised both in Hungary and the U.S. as the university operates exclusively in Hungary and has no campus in the United States.
"Hungary is a sovereign country, it supports knowledge in all cases but does not tolerate cheating," Orban said. "Not even a billionaire can stand above the law, therefore this university must also obey the law."
The CEU said it operated lawfully and was accredited to award Hungarian and U.S. degrees.
"The CEU utterly rejects the Prime Minister of Hungary's false allegations that CEU is 'cheating'," CEU said in a statement. "We have been lawful partners in Hungarian higher education for 25 years and any statement to the contrary is false."
A year before 2018 elections, Orban has raised the stakes in his fight against civil organisations funded by U.S. financier and philanthropist Soros.
Earlier this week, his government submitted a bill to parliament to regulate foreign universities, which could force the CEU founded by Soros in 1991 out of the country.
CEU has said the bill, which Hungarian news web site 444.hu said could be discussed in Parliament as early as Monday, threatened academic freedom in Hungary.
Hungarian scholars and teaching organisations have come out in support of CEU, saying it was one of the preeminent centres of thought in the country and deserved to be saved.

SPD chief Martin Schulz is deeply skeptical about another GroKo power pact, and aware much of his party base is openly hostile to another coalition
Published 1:21 PM, December 12, 2017
BERLIN, Germany – To many German Social Democrats it sounds like a monster that will destroy their party if not democracy itself: the GroKo.
The term is shorthand for "grand coalition", the mega-alliance of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and their own SPD labor party that has ruled Europe's top economy for the past four years.
"Never. Again. GroKo," read a pin-on button handed out by the party's youth wing at a fractious party congress in Berlin last week that was dominated by painful soul-searching over its worst election result in post-war history.
The blunt message was illustrated with a picture of two hands forming a diamond shape, Merkel's standard gesture in front of cameras, which has come to symbolize the veteran chancellor dubbed "Mutti" (mummy).
"We don't want a grand coalition," said one member, Michelle Rauschholb, 25, who fears the SDP will be forced to "betray its ideals" if it has another stint as Merkel's junior partner.
Going into talks with Merkel this Wednesday, December 12, SPD chief Martin Schulz is deeply skeptical about another GroKo power pact, and aware much of his party base is openly hostile to another coalition.
But after months of post-election deadlock, Schulz has agreed to meet Merkel to sound out plans to give the unhappy partnership another lease of life, even though many Social Democrats fear it spells a mortal threat to their 150-year-old party.
'Political suicide'
The U-turn came after Schulz declared on the night of his September 24 election defeat that he would take the battered party into opposition rather than again play second fiddle to Merkel.
But he had to eat his words 3 weeks ago when Merkel's efforts to build an alternative alliance with two smaller parties collapsed and pressure rose on the SPD to avert political paralysis.
Schulz consented to "open-ended" talks that may or may not allow Merkel to lead another GroKo government from sometime in early 2018.
At the Berlin party congress, speaker after speaker argued passionately that to again govern under Merkel would further weaken the party's message and credibility.
The revolt was led by the party's youth wing, which collected reasons against a GroKo in messages stuck onto a white board.
"Political suicide," read one, while another stated: "GroKo is the final nail in the coffin of Social Democracy."
A third featured a drawing of a "GroKodile" with a gaping jaw about to swallow up a hapless SPD stickman.
One declared simply: "I already have a Mutti."
'A little lost'
The SPD leadership itself has been brutally honest after four election defeats in a row, stating in a discussion paper that "many voters are unclear about what the SPD stands for".
It was a sobering admission for the traditional working class party that long battled for the rights of workers, women and minorities, and whose members start their speeches with "dear comrades".
Now the SPD is struggling to reinvent itself in the age of vanishing factories, mines and dockyards and as robots and algorithms threaten to destroy ever more jobs.
"That's the big question that hovers above everything," said youth wing leader Kevin Kuehnert, 28. "In future who will be the SPD's voter base?"
At the congress, Kuehnert vowed to push on with the #NoGroKo campaign when delegates and members get to vote on a potential coalition deal.
"The last GroKo was voted out when the two big parties between them lost 14 percentage points," he told Agence France-Presse. "That's certainly not a mandate for a new coalition."
He argued that the SPD should instead seek to broadly support a Merkel minority government and then fight for key issues on a case by case basis.
Not just the young are up in arms – dismay runs through the rank-and-file, including Bjoern Steinborn, 47, a Berlin bank employee and SPD member since 1989.
"For us this isn't simply about power but about ideas that mean progress for our country, and I don't see how we can achieve that with a GroKo," he said.
"The sad thing is that the other options, a minority government or new elections, aren't good either," he said.
"We're finding ourselves in a situation where we're all a little bit lost." – Rappler.com
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), former chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, argued during a conference call on Friday that members of the DOJ and FBI dressed up an opposition research document to “spy on an American citizen during a presidential campaign.”
The White Hous and the House Intelligence Committee released the FISA memo that details how the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) allegedly used the Steele dossier to spy on Trump campaign staffer Carter Page.
Breitbart News's Kristina Wong asked Rep. Jordan, “Do you agree with Comey's assertion today that the memo has wrecked the House Intelligence Committee, destroyed trust with the IC [Intelligence Community], damaged its relationship with the FISA court, and exposed classified investigations?”
Jordan responded to Breitbart News:
What destroys trust is when you dress up an oppo reseearch document that Jim Comey himself, this is not my words or Marks' words, he said under oath that they were ‘salacious' and ‘unverified.' What destroys trust is when you take that kind of document dress it up make it appear like it is legitimate intelligence and then take it to a court to get a warrant you don't tell them important facts like, ‘oh by the way the Clinton campaign paid for this,' and you do all of this in the context of a presidential campaign. It is really that basic. He's the one that said it was unverified and salacious. McCabe said we had to use it or we wouldn't get a warrant. When they went to the judge why they didn't tell them who paid for it? They used the Isikoff story that they knew was Steele was giving information to the reporter and they presented it as a separate and corroborating piece of information? That's unbelievable. That's what took place here. So Comey can say what he wants here but look at what happened. This happened at a secret court to get a secret warrant to spy on an American citizen during a presidential campaign.
In the wake of the memo's release, Comey tweeted, “That's it? Dishonest and misleading memo wrecked the House intel committee, destroyed trust with Intelligence Community, damaged relationship with FISA court, and inexcusably exposed classified investigation of an American citizen. For what? DOJ & FBI must keep doing their jobs.”

House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) also argued, “It's really about spying on American citizens.”
Rep. Jordan also added that, given the troubling details of the FISA memo, he argued that “I think that's why we need a second special counsel.”
UPDATE 1-Germany's Merkel says EU ready to negotiate Brexit, no change seen
MESEBERG, Germany, June 14 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday the European Union was ready to start negotiating with Britain about its exit from the EU on June 19, as planned, despite surprising election losses for London's governing Conservatives.
MADRID May 3 Spain's High Court is to question seven current and former Banco Santander bankers, including a current non-executive board member, as part of a probe triggered by leaks of tax information from HSBC's Swiss private bank.
The court said in a ruling published on Wednesday it had decided to summon the bankers after analysing documents provided by Santander and French bank BNP Paribas over the past year, as well as reports from Bank of Spain inspectors.
These documents and reports revealed funds were moved between Santander, BNP and HSBC, hidden from tax authorities, which could constitute money laundering, Judge Jose de la Mata said in the ruling on Wednesday.
Three current and former bankers from BNP Paribas's Spanish unit would also be summoned to the hearings which are set to begin on June 12, he added.
Representatives for Santander, the euro zone's largest bank by market value, and BNP Paribas Spain declined to comment, while the bankers named could not immediately be reached.
The Spanish investigation is one of many by national tax authorities as a result of the leak in 2008 of client data belonging to HSBC's private bank by Herve Falciani, a former IT employee at the bank. France, Austria, Belgium and Argentina have launched their own investigations.
Falciani, a French citizen, has said he is a whistleblower trying to help governments track down citizens who used Swiss accounts to evade tax. In 2015 a Swiss court sentenced him, in his absence, to five years in prison for aggravated industrial espionage.
The High Court said it will question Ignacio Benjumea Cabeza de Vaca, former head of Santander's analysis and resolution committee and a current non-executive board member; Jose Manuel Araluce Larraz, former head of compliance; and five other current and former senior compliance officials at the Spanish bank.
Reuters was not immediately able to contact Benjumea Cabeza de Vaca, while Araluce Larraz did not reply to a message via LinkedIn.
The court also said it will question Jose Andres Fernandez Espejel, former head of compliance at BNP Paribas Spain, and two other senior compliance officials. Fernandez Espejel did not reply to a Linkedin message sent by Reuters.
Under the Spanish legal system people can be named as formal suspects until a more detailed investigation is carried out.
Between 2005 and 2008, HSBC's Swiss private bank channelled almost 74 million euros ($81 million) through Santander to pay clients at other banks, according to the court ruling. The transfers had stopped by 2010, after the banks began to request identification from people making and receiving transfers. ($1 = 0.9164 euros) (Editing by Alexander Smith)

WASHINGTON, D.C. — On Tuesday, President Donald Trump will give a major speech on “Buy American, Hire American” as he signs a new Executive Order at Snap-On Tools in House Speaker Paul Ryan's district — but Ryan is away on a congressional delegation in Europe… an Administration official telling Breitbart News that their schedules simply “did not mesh on this.”
In 2015, Rep. Paul Ryan held a Congressional listening session at Snap-On, but the now-Speaker of the House won't be able to make Trump's trip to the Wisconsin tool manufacturer.
Asked if there was any reason that the event was taking place while Ryan was out of the country, an Administration official told Breitbart News:
There is no reason for that, he is happens to be on a codel. We were trying to coordinate, this was a, this, just, the President's schedule and the Speaker's schedule did not mesh on this. I have seen the copy of the text, he's going to thank the Speaker in the text to make sure that that question isn't asked, but I am here to tell you it was just scheduling.
Snap-On's headquarters is located in Kenosha which is also the hometown of White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, who according to the same official, is expected to be in attendance.
Senior administration officials told reporters on Monday afternoon that Trump's speech will focus on buying American products and hiring American workers and the erosion of these longstanding policies.
One official went so far as to call “Buy American” the administration's highest priority when it comes to spending American taxpayer dollars.
Officials drew a clear distinction between “Buy American” and “Hire American”. They also made a distinction between the problems of fraud and abuse in the guest worker system. “Buy American refers to a set of procurement laws about how goods and manufactured parts are obtained and how they're used if federal projects or federally funded projects and Hire American generally refers to the body of law and policy concerning how our immigration, visa and guest worker programs are operated to ensure proper protections for American workers.”
One official emphasized the great dilution of such policies in the United States and the resulting lost job opportunities for American workers. The official said just the acknowledgment of the problem is remarkable and represents a fairly historic event.
The President's new Executive Order will “call for the strict enforcement of all laws governing entry into the United States of labor from abroad for the stated purpose of creating higher wages and higher employment rates for workers in the United States.”
Four agencies will be primarily involved on the “Hire American” side: the Department of Labor, Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security and Department of State. These agencies will be tasked with taking prompt action to crack down on fraud and abuse in the immigration system in order to protect workers in the United States.
The order includes a specific clause for the H1-B visa program that calls on the four agencies to put forward reforms that ensure that visas are awarded to the most skilled or highest paid applicants. One suggestion involved changing the H1-B lottery system, which one official said disadvantages master's degree holders.
“About 80 percent of H1-B workers are paid less than the median wage in their fields,” one official stated.
Some reforms will take place administratively and some will have to be pursued legislatively, one official clarified.
A second official spoke on the Buy American portion of the order, telling reporters that agencies will be held strictly accountable for these policies and will be required to complete top-to-bottom performance reviews including assessments of their use of waivers and exceptions. The official continued, “President Trump has tasked the Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross with revealing all the agency findings and submitting a report to his desk within 220 days. This report and its recommendations will serve as a blueprint for additional executive and regulatory actions to further strengthen Buy American as well as guide possible legislative proposals.”
The official was clear that one objective of the order is to “maximize the use of domestic content and minimize the granting of waivers.” One official stated that waivers may be properly renegotiated or revoked.
The officials said that some free trade agreements have weakened Buy American laws, putting America at a disadvantage. One official stated that agreements will be reviewed to determine whether these agreements meet the standard of being fair and reciprocal for the U.S. The U.S. will reserve the right to renegotiate these deals.
The officials emphasized and produced evidence of bipartisan support for both the Buy American and Hire American objectives. November statistics produced by the Mellman Group showed 60-74 percent support among Clinton voters, Trump voters, Republicans, Democrats, and Independents for requiring all taxpayer-funded construction and manufacturing to use American-made goods whenever possible. Of the 1,200 surveyed in regards to the Hire American portion of the order, 71-79 percent of Clinton voters, Trump voters, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents favored employing “American workers” over “Built by low bidder.”

With Shonda Rhimes now moving Shondaland to Netflix, should fans be worried about the future of Grey's Anatomy?
On Sunday, it was announced that Rhimes has signed a multi-year deal with Netflix, moving her production company from ABC to the streamer. Here's the good news: Rhimes' move will not affect Grey's, Scandal, How to Get Away with Murder, midseason legal entry For the People or the upcoming Grey's Anatomy spin-off. As long as those shows are on the air, they will air on ABC, and Rhimes/Shondaland will still be involved with their production.
But how much life is left in the veteran medical drama, which is heading into its 14th season this fall? ABC chief Channing Dungey had previously expressed hope that Grey's would outlive NBC's stalwart medical series ER, which ran for 15 seasons. “That'd be lovely,” Dungey told Entertainment Weekly in January. “I'll take even more! Honestly, I think that the show is going to continue as long as Shonda and the gang have a creative passion for telling those stories. At the moment, it feels like we're full steam ahead.”
FROM PEN: Shondaland Stars Share Their #TGIT Viewing Party Rituals
ABC sources say that hope has not changed in the wake of Rhimes' move. Shondaland sources, meanwhile, are confident Grey's Anatomy will continue to air on ABC for a very long time to come. In other words, Grey's Anatomy won't be ending any time soon.
Grey's Anatomy will return with a two-hour premiere on Sept. 28 at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.

If you want to understand just how effectively the American media have turned Republicans into second-class citizens, watch the superb Chappaquiddick, the true story surrounding U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA) on the fateful night he left an innocent young woman to die in order to save his political career.
Despite his illegal and morally appalling behavior, despite his depraved indifference towards Mary Jo Kopechne (a 28-year-old woman with her whole life in front of her), Kennedy was not only allowed to remain a U.S. Senator for another 40 years, until the end of his life, he did so as an “esteemed” senator, as a “giant” venerated and cherished by our depraved media culture.
What I mean by “second-class citizen” is this: had any Republican politician been guilty of the least of Kennedy's sins that night, had any conservative-leaning public figure been caught drunk driving, nabbed with “another woman,” or busted leaving the scene of an accident on the night of July 18, 1969, that would have been the end of them. Only infamy and disgrace would have followed, not 40 years of media worship and whitewash, and certainly not the opportunity to sit in judgment of a great man like Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.
That was my prime takeaway from Chappaquiddick; the fact that the far-left has such a tight grip on our culture, George W. Bush practically lost a presidential election over a (then) 25-year-old drunk driving incident, and Edward Moore “Ted” Kennedy remained a viable presidential candidate despite behavior so grotesque, your jaw will drop.
Chappaquiddick works as well as it does for a number of reasons. First off, Chappaquiddick tells the truth, the unvarnished truth; and because fact is always more compelling than fiction, at times you will not believe what you are witnessing. Secondly, Kennedy is not portrayed as evil. At times, you cannot help but sympathize with him. This is a fully-fleshed human being, not a caricature, not a mustache-twirler, and this only makes his behavior all the more monstrous.
I call this the “Downfall Effect.”
For decades, Adolf Hitler had been portrayed only as a raving lunatic, a one-dimensional sociopath. Then, in 2004, Oliver Hirschbiegel's Oscar-winner Downfall came along, and we were finally given a glimpse of the grandfatherly man who conquered the heart of a nation and enjoyed cult-like loyalty. On display were Hitler's charms, his charisma, his ability to be kind and gracious. Seeing Hitler as a person, as a man capable of decency, only makes his crimes even more obscene because they were committed by a man. not a rabid dog.
Ted Kennedy also knew better.
Written by Taylor Allen and Andrew Logan, and ably directed by John Curran, Chappaquiddick opens by reminding us of the burden on the 39-year-old Kennedy's shoulders: those three dead brothers who refuse to go away. Joe Jr. died a strapping WWII hero. John died a handsome, charming martyred president. Bobby died a martyr to youth and idealism. And so, all that remains is Teddy, the chubby and awkward little brother born without the charm, charisma, good looks, or brains.
Teddy is the Peter Lawford of the Rat Pack, the Chris Cuomo, the Fredo Corleone. Naked nepotism has dropped a marginal man into a circumstance he is in no way prepared for. Had his brothers lived, Teddy would have been much happier, he would have been the Kennedy no one cared about, which would have left him free to live off his inheritance, to drink, and to commit adultery.
Instead, his future is rushing up to meet him in the form of a Mack Truck called the 1972 presidential election. His family and half the country desperately need Teddy to do what he cannot: bring back John's Camelot and Bobby's Utopia. But all Teddy wants is to drink and commit adultery.
To make matters worse, as 1972 crushes him like a bug, this is the weekend a man will land on the moon, fulfilling brother John's promise that America could do the impossible before the decade was over. As Teddy parties with the Boiler Room Girls (Bobby's devoted and beautiful campaign staff) at a remote cabin on Chappaquiddick Island, Apollo 11 and Neil Armstrong are on their way to the moon.
And then the unthinkable happens.
To its great credit, Chappaquiddick does not try to fill in the holes of what we do not know. While there is no question Teddy (a superb Jason Clarke) was drinking and driving recklessly, since we will never know if he had a sexual affair with Kopechne, the movie only uses the facts to suggest the possibility. That the two were close, and at the very least intimate friends, is not in doubt.
Another question the movie does not answer is how in the hell Ted Kennedy got out of that car.
Speeding and intoxicated, Kennedy flies the car off a bridge where it overturns in about five feet of water. Somehow Kennedy got out, even though Kopechne was found dead with all the windows and doors closed.
What happens next beggars belief.
In no hurry, and filled with only self-pity, Kennedy walks back to the cabin to enlist the aid of Joe Gargan (Ed Helms) and Paul Markham (Jim Gaffigan), two longtime Kennedy loyalists and fixers.
Gargan and Markham make a real effort to save Kopechne and then, assuming she is already dead, put Kennedy in a rowboat so he can turn himself in.
Instead, Kennedy returns to his hotel room, takes a hot bath, goes to bed, gets up the next morning, and is enjoying brunch with friends when Gargan, horrified to learn Kennedy has not gone to the police, finally convinces Kennedy to do so.
Kennedy needed time to sober up and to think, think of a way out of this. But again, he's not Joe Sr., Joe Jr., John, or Bobby — he's Teddy, and his public relations mishaps begin to pile up.
Meanwhile, John's legacy is fulfilled as Armstrong steps foot on the moon, which works to Teddy's benefit in keeping the media occupied.
Upon his arrival at his family home, Teddy is again reminded of his inadequacies. His disabled father (Bruce Dern) and the mercenaries who protect the Kennedy brand at all costs (Ted Sorensen, Robert McNamara, etc.) had a plan to salvage the situation, but one that Teddy's fumbling has already defeated.
In the end, Teddy is offered a choice; the choice to do the right thing and save his soul, or to do the wrong thing and save his career. We all know the choice he made, and to his great shame and to the great shame of all those around him, only one man had the dignity to walk away.
Oh, sure, the movie portrays the media as rabid, but we all know that once Teddy made his nationally televised speech, this gave the media the out they were desperate for. And that is all the media want when one of their own is in trouble — an excuse to move on.
How do we know this?
Well, here is a stunning fact that should be common knowledge, but thanks to a national media desperate to protect a fellow Democrat, is not: Mary Jo Kopechne did not drown. There was a pocket of air in the car. She died slowly and painfully as the air ran out.
But she really died because we live in an unjust media world where a Democrat knows he can take a leisurely bath instead of running for help.

LONDON, April 6 Cyclone Thomas, which hit Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany on Feb. 23, caused 213 million euros worth of losses according to an initial estimate from Zurich-based PERILS, an independent provider of data on catastrophe insurance.
PERILS said on Thursday that the cyclone, known as Doris in Britain, caused the majority of those losses in Britain and Germany.
The data are based on gross loss data reported by primary insurance companies.

The world will soon get its first look at the new Golden Fisherman when the monument is dedicated just outside the Biloxi Maritime and Seafood Museum.
Wednesday work crews installed the stand where statue will permanently live. He remains shrouded in secrecy until Thursday night.
For now, the base of the statue, which like the old one, contains 811 names of Biloxi families that established the city's rich seafood history and heritage along with past shrimp kings and queens.
"Everyone is honored on the base, and the fisherman is on top," said Addison Riemann, who's with the group of monument designers. He's 6-foot-tall and weighs 1,000 pounds. "He's lifelike. There's a lot of definition with his arms, and you'll see his veins popping out. You'll see a lot of definition, even in his knuckles."
The statue made its way to the Coast from Europe, much like the journey many of those families he represents have made over the years.
“This Golden Fisherman made the same exact voyage as so many of our ancestors did,” said Kim Ross Bush, president of the museum's board of directors. “He came across the same Atlantic Ocean they did from Italy. He's beautiful, he's significant, and he means so much to all of us and he stands for all of us."

Toronto police say they will resume digging at a property where accused serial killer Bruce McArthur worked as a landscaper.
Police have already found the remains of at least seven men buried in planters at the property in midtown Toronto.
McArthur, 66, has been charged with eight counts of first degree murder for the deaths of men with ties to the city's gay village.
Investigators say they began excavating the home's backyard in January, but nothing was found.
They say opposites attract. But these days, maybe not so much.
A growing number of singles are adding a clause to their online dating profiles telling either Trump haters or Trump supporters — depending on their political preference — that they need not apply.
"This was like a dealbreaker for me," says 50-year-old Elizabeth Jagosz from the Detroit area. "If you are Trump supporter, I'm not even going to consider meeting you for coffee."
It's not just an issue of party politics, Jagosz says. It's about core values. Love, she says, cannot conquer all.
"If you don't care about a person who says you can grab women by the pussy and that's OK — I don't wanna date you if you think that behavior's OK," Jagosz says. "If that's not a dealbreaker for you, then you and I have nothing to talk about."
As another single put it in her profile, "Red hats need not apply."
But the people wearing those red hats — the ones stamped with "Make America Great Again" — have been feeling the same way.
This lack of desire from liberals and conservatives to date each other is what David Goss says prompted him to launch TrumpSingles.com.
"Yeah, it's both ways," Goss says. "You know, like a liberal doesn't want to date a Nazi. And a republican doesn't want to date, well, a whiny snowflake, and that's what they're viewing each other as."
TrumpSingles.com is a kind of safe space for Trump supporters who say they're sick of the "lefties" refusing to even give them a chance.
"[The liberals] are just repeating this left echo chamber of 'Oh, you must be a racist; oh, you must be a homophobe; oh, you must be a misogynist,' " Goss says. "They're judging the people based on who they voted for without actually getting to know them."
Helen Fisher, the chief scientific adviser to the Internet dating website Match.com, says new research from the website shows both liberals and conservatives are moving away from the center of the political spectrum.
"There's a real distinct difference that we're seeing today, and all singles are becoming more rigid in their views," she says.
The data also shows that singles are more likely now to shun those who are at the other end of the political spectrum. And liberals are more likely to spurn conservatives than the other way around.
"I think it's very natural to the human animal to bring it into the idea of 'OK, you like this person, well, you must be like that person then,' " Fisher says. "America is taking this very, very personally. No question about it."
Looking back now, it seems almost unfathomable that even two opposing campaign advisers could cross the aisle and then actually walk down the aisle as James Carville and Mary Matalin did in 1993.
As Carville famously put it once, "You can love the sinner and hate the sin."
The couple says their secret to survival and harmony at home is simply agreeing to disagree.
But today, singles seem to be saying they just can't do that.
"I mean, I wish I could just go out and tell everyone to knock it off and be cool with each other, but it's just not going to work that way," Goss says.
His Trump Singles dating site is up to 35,000 members. LiberalHearts.com, founded by Salvatore Prano, is up to nearly 50,000.
"There's more activity now than ever," Prano says. "I knew liberals would only find comfort in each other's arms."
But there is one other option for lonely liberals. Single Joe Goldman founded MapleMatch.com, a dating site that helps Americans find Canadians "to save them from the unfathomable horror of a Trump presidency." Goldman became his own first client.
"I can't tell you the sinking feeling I felt [after the election]," he says. "That's not the country I want to live in. So why not consider places that might be more in line with my values, like Canada."
It may be better than the alternative. According to the new Match.com survey, a growing number of liberals today are simply choosing to not date at all.

× Homeless man pleads not guilty to raping woman in Seattle car dealership restroom
SEATTLE — A 24-year-old homeless man pleaded not guilty Wednesday with raping a woman in a Seattle car dealership bathroom when she dropped her car off for repairs.
Christopher Edward Teel was arrested May 14 when car dealership employees heard the assault and ran to help the woman.
He was charged May 16 with first-degree rape and unlawful imprisonment. He was being held in the King County Jail in lieu of $1 million bail.

The King County Prosecutor's Office said Teel said he had been in Seattle since 2016. At the time of his arrest, he had a $5,000 bench warrant out of Seattle Municipal Court after he failed to appear for a hearing for alleged trespassing. He has been on warrant status since March 2017, the prosecutor's office said.
According to probable cause documents:
At about 7:15 a.m. Monday, the victim dropped her car off for service at Carter Volkswagen on Leary Way in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood. She left the dealership to get a cup of coffee, and returned to use the dealership's temporary bathroom since the building is under construction.
The victim walked up a ramp, by dealership offices and entered the women's restroom.
Teel went into the bathroom behind her and locked the door. He banged loudly on the stall door loudly and tried to open it. The victim used her feet to try to keep the door closed, but Teel busted down the door and dragged the woman out.
The victim told police the defendant stated, "You want this, God wants this," and that she replied, "God does not want this!"
Teel removed the victim's clothes and sexually assaulted her. She screamed for help, but the suspect choked the woman to make her stop.
A dealership employee using the restroom next door heard the commotion and tried to enter the woman's bathroom. The door was locked, but the victim managed to unlock the door and let the dealership employees in. Two dealership employees held Teel until police arrived.
The suspect was arrested, and he admitted to raping the victim, according to court documents.
The man has prior convictions for trespassing. His last known address is listed in probable cause documents as "Homeless Street."
The large-scale exercises involving tens of thousands of ground troops are a perennial source of tension between the two Koreas
Published 10:09 AM, March 20, 2018
SEOUL, South Korea – The United States and South Korea announced Tuesday, March 20, that their annual joint military drills would go ahead next month, with no significant downsize in scale despite an ongoing diplomatic thaw with North Korea.
The large-scale exercises involving tens of thousands of ground troops are a perennial source of tension between the two Koreas, with Pyongyang condemning them as provocative rehearsals for an invasion of the North.
With talks under way to set up a North-South summit, followed by a proposed face-to-face meet between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, there was speculation that this year's drills might be scaled back to avoid derailing the discussions.
They had already been delayed to avoid clashing with the Pyeongchang Winter Games in the South last month.
But Washington and Seoul said the exercises would kick off on April 1 and be "similar" in size to those of previous years.
"Our combined exercises are defense-oriented and there is no reason for North Korea to view them as a provocation," the Pentagon said in a statement, adding that Pyongyang had been informed in advance of the dates and nature of the drills.
According to a senior South Korean envoy who made a rare visit to Pyongyang earlier this month, Kim had made it clear he "understands" the need for the drills to go ahead.
Such an acknowledgement is in stark contrast to the Kim regime's denunciations of the exercises in the past. The North has often responded to the drills with its own military actions, and last year fired 4 ballistic missiles close to Japan.
"Foal Eagle" is a series of field training exercises with approximately 11,500 US forces taking part, together with 290,000 South Korean troops, while "Key Resolve" is a command post exercise using mainly computer-based simulations.
The United States has close to 30,000 troops permanently stationed in South Korea.
Following an extended period of escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula, the Winter Olympics provided the catalyst for a sudden and very rapid rapprochement that resulted in the announcements of the planned summits.
Those announcements were made by the South Koreans, who have been orchestrating the diplomatic preparations and acting as the messenger between Washington and Pyongyang.
Trump's administration is pushing ahead with plans for a summit before the end of May, but North Korea has yet to independently confirm it even extended an invitation to leadership talks – maintaining a silence that has raised some concerns in Washington and Seoul.
According to the South Korean envoy who met with Kim in Pyongyang, the North Korean leader also offered to consider abandoning his nuclear weapons in exchange for US security guarantees, and flagged a halt to all missile and nuclear tests while dialogue was under way. – Rappler.com
A Thai provincial governor says all 12 boys and their coach have been found alive in the cave

Their skinny faces illuminated by a flashlight, the Thai soccer teammates stranded more than a week in a partly flooded cave said they were healthy on a video released Wednesday, as heavy rains forecast for later this week could complicate plans to safely extract them.
The 12 boys and their coach are seen sitting with Thai navy SEALs in the dark cave. The boys, many wrapped in foil warming blankets, take turns introducing themselves, folding their hands together in a traditional greeting and saying their names and that they are healthy.
The video lasting about a minute was recorded sometime Tuesday and was posted on the navy SEAL Facebook page Wednesday morning. The navy later released two more videos of the boys.
The boys, aged 11-16, and their 25-year-old coach disappeared after they went exploring in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in northern Chiang Rai province after a soccer game June 23. The teammates, who were trapped inside when heavy rains flooded the cave, were found by rescue divers late Monday night during a desperate search that drew assistance from experts around the globe.
Authorities said the boys, who had also been shown Tuesday in a video shot by the British diver who discovered them, were being looked after by seven members of the Thai navy SEALs, including medics, who were staying with them inside the cave. They were mostly in stable condition and have received high-protein drinks.
In all of the videos the boys have appeared in good spirits. In the most recent videos a navy SEAL is shown treating minor cuts on the feet and legs of the boys with antibiotic ointment. Several of the boys are seen smiling as they interact with the navy SEAL, who cracks jokes.
Seeing the boys has boosted the mood of relatives, and officials are working to install an internet cable to the cave so that parents can talk to their children.

Kian Kamluang, whose 16-year-old son Pornchai is inside, said she had thought it was a 50 per cent chance that her son would be found.
“It's like he has been given a new life,” she said, adding that she'll never let her son go into a cave or near water again.
SEAL commander Rear Adm. Arpakorn Yookongkaew said Tuesday that there was no rush to bring the group out of the cave, since they're safe where they are. The current flooding situation means the boys would have to dive, which rescue experts have said could be extremely dangerous.
While efforts to pump out floodwaters are continuing, some Thai officials have indicated that heavy rains forecast for this weekend could force them to decide the boys should swim and dive out using the same complicated route of narrow passageways through which their rescuers entered.
Chiang Rai provincial Gov. Narongsak Osatanakorn said Wednesday that the boys have been practicing wearing diving masks and breathing, but he doesn't believe they have attempted any practice dives.
He said it is unknown when an extraction could be attempted, but it is unlikely to be Wednesday.
“If it's risky or not safe, we will not proceed yet,” Narongsak said. “It has to be 100 per cent safe.”
Authorities said they were still exploring other options, such as scouring the mountainside for other ways into the cave and finding faster ways to pump water from the cave.
Cave rescue experts have said it could be safest to simply supply the boys where they are for now, and wait for the water to go down. That could take months, however, given that Thailand's rainy season typically lasts through October.
The British Cave Rescue Council, which has members taking part in the operation , said in a statement that “although water levels have dropped, the diving conditions remain difficult and any attempt to dive the boys and their coach out will not be taken lightly because there are significant technical challenges and risks considering.”
Gary Mitchell, the group's assistant vice chairman, said getting out of the cave requires about a kilometre (half a mile) of diving total, though not all in one stretch, and takes about three hours.
“There's air pockets along the way,” he said. “It's confined spaces. It's almost zero visibility. There are currents to battle against in places as well. So it's a really quite a strenuous environment to be in,” he said.

Bears play a well-known role in fertilizing Alaska's temperate forests. They catch, carry, and digest fish, spreading nutrients through the undergrowth.
But two scientists using remote control cameras near Haines show that bears are making contributions on a different front.
They're not just fertilizing seeds: They're planting them.
It started when two scientists were overwhelmed by the number of berries in a Southeast forest near Haines. S
almonberries, high bush cranberries, soapberries, blueberries, devil's club berries, and more, not just in one or two places, but all throughout the forest.
Others might reach for a pie pan.
These two thought: these plants must have a really successful reproductive strategy.
Laurie Harrer is a biology instructor at Central Oregon Community College and Oregon State University, Cascades.
“There are just a ton of berry-producing plants in Southeast Alaska, all throughout the under-story. In particular, devil's club we noticed was everywhere,” Harrer said. “If it was that prolific, and all over the place, it must have a very successful method of dispersing its seeds around.”
So, what was it?
Oregon State University assistant professor of wildlife Taal Levi says they had a guess.
“These fruit in Southeast Alaska appear to be morphologically adapted for birds, because they're small berries,” he says. “In the case of Devil's Club, small red berries.”
So the two set up a study.
Over two summers, they identified more than 400 clusters of berries in a stretch of forest about 30 miles north of Haines.
They calculated an average number of berries per plant.
They trained motion-triggered cameras on the plants, to see what was eating them.
And what they found was a surprise.
“A bird would fly in and maybe peck and eat anywhere between two and five berries at a time,” Harrer said. “But when a bear would visit these clusters of berries, they would just demolish the entire area. But it wasn't until we finally crunched the numbers that we realized how huge of an effect bears were having.”
Bears weren't just eating more berries: they were eating magnitudes more berries.
The two scientists estimate a single bear could eat over 100,000 berries an hour.
Robins and thrushes couldn't begin to keep up.
Bears were like cargo carriers, taking seeds in their stomachs far away from the original berry patch, Harrer said.
“The whole reason they want their seeds to be dispersed in the first place is so you don't have the parent plant competing with its offspring, growing up in the exact same area competing for resources and sunlight.”
Bears were helping plants fulfill their biological imperative to reproduce, without sacrificing their own access to resources.
And dispersed berries had a better chance than those that just dropped from the bush, Levi says: When bears finally released the seeds, they left something to help them grow.
“They're deposited in a place that was just fertilized by bear scat and has good moisture retention. It's like this little patch of potting soil that this seed is left in.”
When Levi and Harrer went back to count how many berries were left behind in their patches, they realized they had a unique opportunity to increase their data.
“(Bears) are placing their whole mouths over the thing,” Harrer said. ”So they're probably leaving behind a lot of saliva all over that central stalk.”
They started swabbing the stalks for DNA, to see exactly what kind of bears they were dealing with, even if they couldn't catch them on camera.
All the bears — black, brown, male, female — ate berries.
Brown bears ate early in the season, allowing black bears into the patch later in the summer.
The shift happened when the sockeye started to run.
“Brown bears start to dominate these devil's club patches as soon as the fruit ripens,” Levi said. “And then a lot of those animals move to feed on salmon primarily, opening that space up for black bears.”
Based on their research, Levi and Harrer believe bears are the most important seed dispersers in the region for berries.
While jungle plants often depend on mammals to eat their fruit and carry their seeds to new places, the scientists said it's the first known temperate example of plants relying on a mammal's digestive tract as their primary method to travel.
“Because there are so many bears, if they really, truly are the most important seed dispersers, it's understandable, then, why you have so many more berries in Alaska,” Harrer said.
But bears aren't the only animals contributing to better berry hauls, the scientists say.
Salmon are, too.
Dependable salmons runs help Alaska maintain its high density of large bears, compared with places on the East and West Coast where bear populations have dwindled and salmon no longer return.
“A large population of bears spreading berry seeds is helping those understory plants grow,” Harrer said. “Salmon supporting that bear population is vital for bears to help assist all those berry-producing plants.”
Levi said it's likely that losing salmon could have changed the growth of berrying plants down south — they could no longer travel in the bellies of the bears.

On page 7 and page 17 of this newspaper, you will see two stories that pertain to criminal justice and sentencing.
The story on page 7 is part of an exclusive series of News Letter stories on how serious criminals have absconded from prison, without even a police appeal for information. Two of the men are murderers.
In an almost amusing illustration of a ‘human rights for murderers' mindset, Thomas McCabe, 53, who murdered an 18-year-old relative of his girlfriend in 1990, even complained about not getting damages for having been returned to prison when his pre-release was suspended.
But in fact nothing about his case is funny. This repulsive man was sentenced to a mere 11 years for his murder and was due to be free almost 20 years ago. He kept absconding during his pre-release scheme.
On page 17 a report refers to an American court that gave a doctor 175 years for sexually abusing young girl gymnasts systematically. It was an unforgivable breach of trust for which he has deservedly been sentenced to decades in jail. But is a murder not as bad or worse? And if so, why do courts in the UK and most of Europe treat it so leniently?
McCabe should not even yet be eligible for release in the first instance, after a murder conviction as recently as 1990, let alone having been first let out of prison long ago. Since then he has serially exploited his early release opportunities, yet repeatedly been given further chances.

March 28 Indian shares gained on Tuesday as losses in the previous session were seen as overdone, with sentiment also improving as Asian markets recovered after some of the anxiety about U.S. President Donald Trump's ability to push his agenda subsided.
But broader gains are likely to be capped in the near term as India approaches the earnings season starting next month, analysts said.
Global factors will also continue to play a role as many of the recent gains have been predicated on Trump implementing massive stimulus measures to boost the U.S. economy.
"Markets are waiting for the results season. Structurally, we have got most of the reforms getting in place and things are positive on the political front. Only concern is higher valuation levels. That makes the upcoming earnings all the more crucial," said Siddharth Sedani, vice president, equity advisory at Anand Rathi.
The broader NSE index was up 0.61 percent at 9,102.20 by 0638 GMT, while the benchmark BSE index was 0.58 percent higher at 29,406.14.
Among gainers, IT and drugmakers recovered from losses in the previous two sessions with HCL Technologies up 1.7 percent and Aurobindo Pharma Ltd climbing 1.6 percent, leading gains in these sectors respectively.
Telecom tower company Bharti Infratel surged as much as 3.63 percent after global private equity investor KKR & Co LP and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board bought a 10.3 percent stake in the company for more than 61.9 billion rupees.
Meanwhile, Dishman Pharma soared as much as 20 percent to an all-time high after company's partner Tesaro Inc got the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's nod for an ovarian cancer drug.

NEW YORK — A growing grassroots movement is helping children with special needs swap wheelchairs for motorized toy convertibles.
Go Baby Go, a non-profit research program based at the University of Delaware, offers a wheelchair alternative for children who aren't able to walk or need assistance. The effort doesn't replace wheelchairs but provides a fun, temporary supplement.
Car designs range from Power Wheels convertibles to all-terrain toy car models. Although the models are the same as what's offered in stores, they're modified for kids with wide-ranging conditions, from down syndrome to health needs that require the aid of a ventilator.
Although you Go Baby Go started in 2012 by Cole Galloway, a professor of physical therapy at the University of Delaware, it now has 75 chapters nationwide and is gaining international traction. Most recently, Go Baby Go chapters opened in New Zealand and Israel.
The program has modified 5,000 toy cars for infants and kids up to three years old, according to Sam Logan, assistant professor at Oregon State University's College of Public Health and Human Sciences. OSU opened its chapter in 2014.
The changes are simple but impactful. For example, Go Baby Go replaces a car's typical activation switch or foot pedal with tools easier for the children to maneuver. Meanwhile, new seats add extra support. The cost to modify each car is about $200.
Experts say it's important to enable and encourage independent movement among children with special needs at a young age. Although motorized wheelchairs are common, they can cost $17,000 or more each. Wheelchairs can also be intimidating for kids under the age of five.
“Research shows their interaction with [rideable] cars help advance developmental, physical, social, language and cognitive skills,” said Logan.
The program was initially funded by the University of Delaware and later by the National Institute of Health for two years.
“Now, parents, engineers and others are organizing and funding Go Baby Go efforts in their community,” said Logan. “Anyone can do it, but you'll need someone with the expertise to make sure every [modified] car is safe.”
Go Baby Go encourages chapters to collaborate with local pediatric clinics and work alongside people with engineering backgrounds.
The program has plans to expand to older age groups, likely up to age 5, and eventually find a commercial partner.
“Right now, there are no commercially produced [motorized] toy cars for kids with disabilities,” said Logan.”It'd be great to have an off-the-shelf model designed for all kids for parents to easily buy.”
LINCOLN — The Town of Lincoln and Brock University have formally launched a partnership that will help guide the town with future policy development and decision-making.
On Oct. 3, Brock and town officials celebrated the launch of the Brock-Lincoln Living Lab at an event at Vineland Estates Winery. The goal of the initiative is to have university students, through Brock's Environmental Sustainability Research Centre, contribute to the Living Lab's work through their research and the partnership offers a conduit for experiential education that extends curriculum into the community.
Ryan Plummer, director of Brock's Environmental Sustainability Research Centre, says efforts will focus on addressing specific local needs around sustainable municipal planning and advancing areas such as economic, social and community development.
“It's a platform to interact and bring together community leaders, policy-makers, researchers and students who all have a shared commitment to explore and investigate issues vital to the community and its well-being,” Plummer said. “It's working together to figure out what the issues and questions are and then developing on that, with students embedding their research, our course projects and coop experiences in the community.”
Phil Cianciolo says his love of bodybuilding was “embedded in me,” growing up in a household where he woke up to the sound of his father lifting weights every morning.
“I fell in love with weight training more than I did with any sport,” Ciancolo, 60, tells PEOPLE. “When I got to college, I started powerlifting for the University of Cincinnati. I started competing as a bodybuilder, and started winning local shows and regional shows. I went on to compete in the 1980 and 1981 Mr. America shows, but then career and family took priority and I stopped.”
Even though the Cincinnati, Ohio-based produce industry professional stopped officially competing, he never stopped training.
“Bodybuilding has always been a part of my lifestyle,” he says. “That's who I am and who I've always been.”
In addition to keeping him in good physical health, continuing to bodybuild helped Cianciolo to get through some tough times in his personal life. One of his twin daughters was born with disabilities, and working out helped get him through long nights at the hospital and helped him heal when she died at the age of 10 due to kidney failure. He turned to training again after his former wife filed for divorce shortly after Christmas 2015.

“It really devastated me,” says Cianciolo. “I was losing weight and losing muscle. After six months I thought, ‘I've got to move on and I've got to get muscle back.' As I started training harder and eating better, I thought, maybe a show would get my mind, body and soul back to where it should be.”
Cianciolo decided to compete at the NPC Northern Kentucky Grand Prix Championships at the end of March, and began “secretly training” for the show.
“I didn't tell anyone because I didn't know if I could do it at the age of 60,” he says. “It had been 36 years since I competed. I always stayed in shape but not competitive shape.”
To get back into competition shape, Cianciolo upped his cardio from three times a week to hour-long runs on the treadmill every morning. He followed that with 15 minutes of core work, which he upped to a daily routine from his usual twice a week. In the afternoon, Cianciolo returned to the gym for an hour and a half of strength training, working out each body part twice a week.
“It was a goal to just get me out of my rut and to move on, and after 36 years I stepped on stage and I did it,” he says. “It really helped me move on and get my life in order. Getting up on stage and competing against 20 and 30 year olds, it was a blast.”

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Latest on California wildfires (all times local):
5:30 a.m.
Crews aided by calm overnight winds kept a wall of flames from descending from mountains into coastal towns after a huge Southern California wildfire exploded in size over the weekend.
Thousands remain under evacuation orders Monday as the fire churns west through foothill areas of Carpinteria and Montecito, Santa Barbara County seaside towns about 75 miles (120 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles. Much of the fire's new growth occurred on the eastern and northern fronts into unoccupied areas of Los Padres National Forest.

The fire, which had already destroyed more than 750 buildings, burned six more in Carpinteria on Sunday. It's just 10 percent contained after burning nearly 360 square miles (930 square kilometers).
Officials say the blaze, which broke out a week ago in neighboring Ventura County, is now the 5th largest in California history.
NEW YORK — Luis Severino struck out 11 in seven overpowering innings, beating longtime Yankees nemesis Dallas Keuchel for the second time this year as New York topped the Houston Astros 5-3 on Wednesday night.
Gary Sanchez snapped an 0-for-19 slump with a two-run single and the Yankees took two of three from the reigning World Series champions this week to win the season series 5-2. Houston defeated New York in the 2017 AL Championship Series, with the home team winning all seven games.
If these budding rivals meet again this year, it will be in October.
Severino (8-1) allowed four hits, including Max Stassi's two-run homer, and walked one in winning his sixth consecutive decision. The ace right-hander, who hasn't lost since April 10 at Boston, threw a five-hitter with 10 strikeouts for his first career complete game in a 4-0 victory over Keuchel at Houston on May 2.
David Robertson struck out two in a scoreless eighth and Aroldis Chapman got three outs for his 12th save in 13 chances. Stassi, subbing for injured catcher Brian McCann, hit an RBI double with two outs in the ninth before Chapman fanned George Springer to end it.
After dominating the Yankees for years, Keuchel (3-7) dropped his third straight start against them — including the playoffs. The left-hander gave up four runs and seven hits in five-plus innings.
Keuchel entered 6-4 with a 1.82 ERA and two complete games in 10 outings against New York, including three post-season starts.
The 2015 AL Cy Young Award winner walked two batters in the first inning, and centre fielder Jake Marisnick made a diving catch on a sacrifice fly by slumping slugger Giancarlo Stanton.
Sanchez rolled a two-run single through an open right side with two outs in the fifth to put the Yankees ahead 3-2.
Gleyber Torres doubled to start the sixth and scored from third on Didi Gregorius' single through a drawn-in infield that chased Keuchel. Aaron Hicks looped an RBI double off Collin McHugh later in the inning that got past a diving Marwin Gonzalez in left field.
ZURICH, April 5 Switzerland's highest court has rejected a French request for help in investigating a married couple for tax offences, ruling that data stolen from HSBC's Geneva private bank was inadmissible.
The ruling comes amid the latest scandal to hit Credit Suisse after an anonymous tipster alerted Dutch authorities to thousands of suspect accounts that triggered police raids last week.
The French couple were discovered via information leaked by Herve Falciani, a former IT employee who fled HSBC in 2008 with files that he alleged showed evidence of tax evasion by clients.
The French newspaper Le Monde has said it identified more than 106,000 clients.
French officials asked Swiss tax authorities in 2014 for assistance in investigating the French couple suspected of having an undeclared bank account in Switzerland.
The Swiss authorities agreed, but their decision was overturned after an appeal by the unnamed couple.
In a March ruling announced on Wednesday, the Swiss Federal Supreme Court confirmed the lower court's decision. It said requests for administrative assistance would not be approved when based on information obtained illegally.
"The criminal origin of the Falciani data is undisputed," the court said in a statement. "Especially because Herve Falciani was convicted in 2015."
A Swiss court sentenced Falciani to five years in prison for aggravated industrial sabotage, but he has avoided serving time by remaining in France.
Falciani, a French citizen, has said he is a whistleblower trying to help governments track down citizens who used Swiss accounts to evade tax. Spain, Austria, Belgium and Argentina have also launched their own investigations.
Switzerland last year received an overall rating of "largely compliant" in an international review of how well it shares information with other countries on tax matters, but how it handles stolen data remained an issue. (Reporting by John Revill; editing by Mark Heinrich)

Ostensibly conservative NeverTrump news media figures scorned Friday's release of a declassified House Intelligence Committee memo detailing alleged abuse by senior FBI and Justice Department officials.
The memo claims that in obtaining warrants to spy on an associate of Donald Trump under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), the FBI relied on the “Steele dossier” — an unverified document put together by opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which was funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.
It further alleges the FBI hid the political origins of the dossier from the FISA court, and exaggerated its accuracy, though it was aware that the source, Christopher Steele, had political and financial motives.
Fusion GPS's initial research on Donald Trump was funded, via the Washington Free Beacon, by billionaire Paul Singer, “a major funder of the #neverTrump campaign.”
So it is perhaps no surprise that the members of NeverTrump defended the dossier and attacked Friday's memo.
MSNBC's Rick Wilson, who markets himself as a “GOP Media Guy” on his Twitter profile, derided supporters of President Donald Trump as “mouthbreathers” while dismissing the memo's revelations as unimportant.
Wow. This Nune memo is even less impressive than I thought. All these mouth-breathing idiots who called this worse than Watergate just got clowned. — Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) February 2, 2018
The Washington Post‘s Jennifer Rubin — who presents herself as belonging to the right — described the memo as a “nothingburger,” linking to a Friday-published op-ed of hers in which she advances the narrative of “Russian meddling in the 2016 election” as axiomatic.
everything you need to know about Nunes nothingburger, and why it hurts Trump. Is this guy not very bright?? https://t.co/sxcYSoNdIV — Jennifer Rubin (@JRubinBlogger) February 2, 2018
“There is no proof anything in the dossier was in fact false,” wrote Rubin, advancing an absence-of-evidence claim with respect to allegations against Trump within the “Christopher Steele dossier.”
“If Trump is not a Russian agent, he surely is acting as effectively as one,” concluded Rubin.
Newly-minted Washington Post columnist Max Boot joined his colleague Rubin in shifting the burden of proof for determining the veracity of allegations within the “Christopher Steele dossier.”
According to Boot, Trump must disprove allegations made against him by Christopher Steele.
The nonrevelation in Nunes memo: FISA application for Carter Page based in part on Christopher Steele's work, and he was paid by DNC and anti-Trump. Big deal. Memo doesn't impugn his actual info. And it confirms that Steele didn't launch investigation. https://t.co/QbuqtafyqG — Max Boot (@MaxBoot) February 2, 2018
The New York Times‘ Bret Stephens described the memo as a “nothingburger” while linking to an article omitting all details of the memo's allegations.
So now I know what a Nothingburger tastes like: https://t.co/zwdPdXNvl7 — Bret Stephens (@BretStephensNYT) February 2, 2018
Evidence exists of Carter Page's “collaboration with Russian [intelligence],” claimed Evan McMullin, a former presidential candidate and key NeverTrump figure. He further described Fusion GPS founder Christopher Steele as a “trusted source and ally of the United States.”
It's no surprise that the Nunes memo fails to acknowledge other evidence – in addition to the dossier – contained in the FISA applications for surveillance of Carter Page, the least of which would've been evidence of his collaboration with Russian intel even before the campaign. — Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) February 2, 2018
If the FISA applications failed to mention who funded Chris Steele's research, perhaps they should have. Regardless, it would've been careless of law enforcement to have excluded such alarming national security information from such a trusted source and ally of the United States. — Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) February 2, 2018
The Weekly Standard‘s editor-in-chief Stephen Hayes acknowledged “evidence of law enforcement bias [and] sloppiness” while framing Robert Mueller's ostensible investigation as a legitimate and good faith endeavor in response to malevolent Russian state influence.
Quick initial thought: There's disturbing evidence of law enforcement bias & sloppiness. But hard to see how this derails Mueller investigation, particularly as it confirms that FBI investigation began w/Papadapolous before FISA application targeting Page. #MemoDay — Stephen Hayes (@stephenfhayes) February 2, 2018
According to National Review‘s David French, the FBI's “counterintelligence investigation” and surveillance of George Papadopoulos reinforces the narrative of Mueller's ostensible “Russia investigation” as a legitimate and good faith endeavor.
Here's potentially the most important paragraph in the memo.

Former ethics lawyer for George W. Bush Richard Painter – a new regular across MSNBC and CNN – cast Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) as resembling a “Putin stooge,” adding that the “Cruz/Clinton funded dossier is probably true.”

WASHINGTON U.S. President Donald Trump told The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that he might consider withholding billions of dollars of Obamacare payments to health insurers to force Democrats back to the negotiating table on healthcare.
Insurers and major medical groups have warned that not funding the payments, called cost-sharing reduction subsidies, which help cover out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income Americans, could wreak havoc in the individual insurance markets. Trump told The Wall Street Journal that by withholding the payments, Democrats will call him to negotiate.
Major medical and insurance groups penned a letter to Trump on Wednesday urging him to maintain funding for the subsidies, which amount to about $7 billion a year and are paid directly to insurers. They help cover premiums, deductibles and other medical expenses for about 7 million people who purchase health insurance on the individual health insurance market. [n1N1HK25D]
House of Representatives Republicans sued the Obama administration for funding the subsidies, which they argue have to be appropriated by Congress. A federal judge in May 2016 ruled in favour of the Republicans, prompting an appeal by the Obama administration. The case is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Major insurers, including Humana Inc and Aetna, have left or announced their intention to leave the Obamacare exchanges, citing multi-million-dollar losses and patient populations that are far costlier and sicker than they expected. They warned that withholding the subsidies would destabilise the market further and leave millions of consumers with little or no choice in picking a health insurance plan.

The genre so scorned by the elites has suddenly found a massive new market with the global success of Luis Fonsi's song 'Despacito'
Published 7:26 AM, June 14, 2017
MIAMI, USA – Reggaeton music has long been a fixture in nightclubs around the Spanish-speaking world, but that hasn't brought it critical acceptance, with the genre rooted in Puerto Rico's marginalized communities.
The genre so scorned by the elites has suddenly found a massive new market with the global success of Luis Fonsi's song Despacito.
Despacito is the first Spanish-language song to hit number one on the benchmark US singles chart, the Billboard Hot 100, since Macarena in 1996.
A remix of the song, which features the Puerto Rican rapper Daddy Yankee and an assist from pop celebrity Justin Bieber, spent its fifth week at number one on the latest chart published Monday, June 12.
Reggaeton – defined by its blend of the fast-paced and club-ready rhythms of Jamaican dancehall with a rap vocal delivery that is often pouring with machismo – took off in Puerto Rico in the 1990s. It was initially simply called "underground."
Puerto Ricans had been active in the birth of hip-hop in New York, while the beats came via Panama, where Jamaicans and other West Indians worked to build the canal.
"Underground was essentially party music, but it also provided a space to offer political critiques about issues like poverty, police brutality and racism," said Petra Rivera-Rideau, an assistant professor in American studies at Wellesley College and author of the book Remixing Reggaeton.
"As underground spread, it was subject to a censorship campaign in the mid-1990s that, ironically, wound up providing publicity to the music and exposing it to new audiences," she said.
Bringing out race and sexuality
Critics attacked reggaeton for its hyper-sexuality, with the Puerto Rican Senate in 2002 holding hearings on the portrayal of women in music videos.
But Rivera-Rideau said that reggaeton also provided a new means of expression, especially for black people in the US Caribbean territory.
"Reggaeton offered an opportunity for artists to articulate connections to the broader African diaspora, particularly urban black youth, and this threatened the fundamental tenets of racial democracy because it called out racism in Puerto Rico," she said.
Despacito, which means "slowly" in Spanish, is driven by a reggaeton beat with lyrics full of sexual innuendo. Bieber delivers a breathy opening verse and later sings in Spanish – which he recently mangled in a live performance.
Bieber collaborated for the remix released in April after Despacito was already a megahit on Latin charts.
The original video, which came out in January, has amassed more than 1.9 billion views on YouTube – the most of any 2017 release.
A hit even without Bieber
Fonsi has said that Bieber's participation was the Canadian's own idea after he heard the hit playing in a club in Colombia.
While the song was already a major hit, Rivera-Rideau said that the remix with Bieber "exposed the song to many people who had never heard it before."
But complicating the narrative of reggaeton's rise, Fonsi – not to mention Bieber – does not hail from the genre. Fonsi, 39, has scored hits over the past two decades with ballads and Latin pop tracks rather than reggaeton.
"Many people have talked about Justin Bieber as appropriating reggaeton for his own gain, and that may be the case, but one could argue that Luis Fonsi is doing the same – borrowing from a genre associated with a marginalized community for his own commercial success," Rivera-Rideau said.
Fonsi, in an interview with Rolling Stone, said he had not set out to write a "crossover record."
"I felt as though I needed a little bit more movement," he told the magazine.
"That's where Latin pop is headed: It's the right time to put a little rhythm into this record." – Rappler.com
The Pittsburgh Steelers finally dipped their toe into the free agency pool this week by signing linebacker Jon Bostic. As of now he's probably the second-best inside linebacker on the roster and would be the opening day starter next to Vince Williams. But does the signing of Bostic deter the Steelers from using a top pick on an inside linebacker?
According to the guys at Draft Wire the answer is no. They put out a brand new two-round projection and for the Steelers, they stick to the script. In the first round, they have the Steelers taking Alabama linebacker Rashaan Evans.
Evans is an intelligent player who would be a great fit as an inside linebacker in Pittsburgh's system. He's a good athlete who is solid in coverage, and he also does a good job of assessing the play before it happens. Evans is also an efficient blitzer and a hard hitter. The Steelers' defense has some promising pieces, but they could still use some more young pieces. Evans would serve as a great temporary replacement for, and eventually a great complementary linebacker with, Shazier.
In the second round, Draft Wire goes with Wake Forest safety Jessie Bates III. All in all this would be a tough draft to complain about. But of course some will. Even with the addition of Bostic, Evans would be tremendous. He's able to play all four linebacker spots and would be an interesting situational pass rusher.
As for Bates, he's one of the really good coverage safeties in this draft. He and Stanford's Justin Reid are both in that group of prospects that a team will be able to count on to play a single-high or drop down and cover in man. This is exactly the type of player Pittsburgh needs.

People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) could benefit from a wearable technology that has received funding for further development.
L-R: Prof Keir Lewis with Bond Digital Health's Dave Taylor, Ian Bond, Phil Groom, Vicky Agova and Rui Zhang
Cardiff-based Bond Digital Health, which develops software and other technology to support health providers, practitioners and patients, has received a private equity investment of £200,000 in addition to a £68,583 grant from Innovate UK.
The £200,000 equity investment, which was advised by Severn Seed Finance, is part of a planned £1m funding round for 2018 and will be used to support the growth of the business.
The grant, awarded as part of Innovate UK's Precision Medicine competition, will allow the company to develop its new wearable technology.
According to Bond, the device will help patients monitor their condition and provide more accurate and comprehensive health data to their doctor.
Described as a ‘digital stethoscope', the device attaches to the patient via a patch to record lung and heart noises.
These are then sent to a smartphone before being uploaded to a central analytical system and then stored in a secure cloud database that clinicians can access at any time.
Ian Bond, the founder of Bond Digital Health, who suffers from COPD, said the device could transform the doctor-patient relationship.
“With a chronic condition like COPD there is often lack of information for days or months between appointments, which we call the ‘whitespace void', during which the doctor has to rely on anecdotal evidence or, at best, inaccurate paper diaries detailing the patient's condition,” he said.
“Using the application of machine learning, we can empower COPD patients to self-manage their condition, improve their wellbeing and reduce consultations and admissions.”
Bond has also been awarded £7,500 by the Bevan Commission, an independent think tank that advises the Welsh Government on health matters, to help develop an electronic diary app that will help COPD patients self-manage their condition.
Dubbed myCOPDnurse, the project, a collaboration between Bond and Hywel Dda University Health Board, will allow patients to record factors such as medication use and symptoms while monitoring environmental factors such as air quality, pollen and weather.
It will also integrate with the wearable device to provide continuous monitoring of lung disease patients after discharge from hospital.

LONDON On the face of it, the first quarter of the year followed the 'risk on' script.
U.S. stocks surged to new highs, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, high yield debt rallied yet again and Wall Street volatility slumped to its lowest in a decade.
But that masks a palpable deterioration in sentiment and sharp market turnaround in recent weeks, so much so that the best two performing asset classes in the quarter, according to a Reuters checklist, were at the opposing ends of the risk spectrum - emerging market equities and gold.
The first half of Q1 continued from where Q4 last year left off. Investors piled into riskier, high-yielding assets at the expense of safe-haven bonds on the view that Donald Trump's election victory would propel U.S. growth and markets higher.
But that optimism has evaporated. The dollar slid from a 14-year high in January to a four-month low on Monday, safe-haven gold had its best quarter in a year and oil fell 12 percent, its worst quarter since the end of 2015.
The turnaround is encapsulated in the performance of U.S. financial stocks. They soared 30 percent in Q4, much of that following the U.S. election on Nov. 8 in the hope that new president Donald Trump would slash taxes and bank regulation.
The steepening yield curve - a widening gap between longer term and shorter term yields - helped boost them too. But the curve has since flattened on growing doubts about the Federal Reserve's ability to embark on a sustained path of rate hikes. U.S. financials are ending the quarter flat.

What's more, asset correlations have started to break down, most notably in the dollar's inverse relationship with commodities. Normally, a rising dollar means lower commodity prices, and vice versa. But both have fallen in recent weeks.
Analysts are now wondering if the "Trumpflation" trade has come to a premature end. U.S. stocks are the most overvalued in 17 years, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch fund manager survey.
Or is this just a pause before the next leg higher?
"Perceived delays to U.S. tax reform and fiscal stimulus have led to underperformance of 'Trump' trades and have generated a short-term top in yields and equity prices," Citi strategists and economists said in a note to clients on Monday.
"We can see this extending .. (but) we doubt this is an end of cycle moment, since monetary policy remains supportive. Hence we would be inclined to buy a dip in risk assets and sell a further rally in fixed income if this transpires," they added.
Mirroring what appears to be the broad consensus, Citi remains overweight in equities and cash, underweight in government bonds and neutral in credit and commodities.

This weekend, a video combining the trailers for Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Star Wars: The Last Jedi started circulating on the web, purporting to show, well:
Check out what the Last Jedi and the Force Awakens teaser trailers look like compared to one another.... pic.twitter.com/gR5582QHIb — jessicanne. (@xwithmywoes) April 16, 2017
It would have been a pretty darn cool Easter Egg for audiences if it were accurate. Why did they make the exact same trailer again? What could we read into who or what appears in the matched shots in each teaser?! The questions are endless!
But, as with many "really cool, kinda crazy" things on the internet, the video isn't accurate. Here's the actual teaser for The Force Awakens:
To be fair, both teasers start with one of the main good guys (Finn in Force Awakens, Rey in Last Jedi) appearing suddenly and breathless. But beyond that, these are two different teasers, with standard "Star Wars" stuff: major characters, light sabers, the Millennium Falcon doing stuff.
It's a fun comparison, but please, don't spend your afternoon trying to construct an elaborate theory about how The Last Jedi will end based on it.

ROME A sudden collapse of loss-making national airline Alitalia [CAITLA.UL] would be a great shock for Italy's economy, Industry Minister Carlo Calenda said on Sunday.
Rome has thrown the crisis-hit airline a short-term lifeline, a bridging loan of up to 400 million euros ($436 million) to see it through a process whereby an administrator will decide if it can be sold as a going concern or should be liquidated.
"It (sudden closure) would be a shock for GDP (economic output) much greater than the scenario that we are looking at: a brief period of six months covered by a bridging loan from the government so as to find a buyer who could provide services that Italians need as travelers," he said in an interview with Sky TG24 television.
Rival airlines have shown little interest in buying Alitalia and creditors have refused to lend more money after workers last Monday rejected a rescue plan that would have reduced pay and cut 1,700 jobs.

SEATTLE – The Seahawks haven't always drafted well. Look no further than last year for evidence of that.
With Seattle's first pick in 2017, general manager John Schneider and coach Pete Carroll took defensive lineman Malik McDowell in the second round. At the time, it was considered a reach by some draft analysts. Since then, it has come to be known as a disaster.
McDowell never played for the Seahawks in 2017 after being injured in a reported ATV accident last summer. Now, there are reports Seattle may release McDowell before he ever steps foot on the field.
“That has got to be considered a horrible pick,” Q13 sports director Aaron Levine said recently.
Assuming McDowell is done in Seattle, the pick lands firmly on the list of the Seahawks' worst draft selections of all time. But Seattle has drafted other players who haven't worked out, some whom were taken much higher than 35th overall.
To put things into perspective, we asked our experts to help compile the definitive list of Seattle's worst draft picks. We also put together a list of the team's best draft picks. We'll unveil those tomorrow. But for now, let's look at the duds.
In addition to Levine, we talked with NFLDraftScout.com's Rob Rang, sports reporter Michelle Ludtka, producer Marc Rosen, photojournalist Steve Schrammeck, and a host of other knowledgeable producers, editors and reporters around the newsroom. This year's draft will be broadcast on the home of the Seahawks, Q13 FOX, with Draft Day coverage beginning at 6 p.m. Wednesday, 4 p.m. Thursday and 3 p.m. Friday.
To make things easier we did not consider players taken in the supplemental draft, such as Brian Bosworth, or players the Seahawks acquired after they were drafted by other teams, like Kelly Stouffer.
Here's what we came up with:
10. Lawrence Jackson, drafted in the 1st round (28th overall) in 2008 out of USC.
Perhaps the biggest statement about Jackson is what Carroll, his college coach, did when he took over the Seahawks. Halfway through his first training camp in Seattle, Carroll traded Jackson to the Lions for a sixth round draft choice.
Even before Carroll arrived, the writing was on the wall. In two seasons with the Seahawks, Jackson totaled just 6.5 sacks even though he started 24 games and was turned loose regularly as a pass rusher.
Jackson played another three seasons in Detroit, never starting a game for Lions, before retiring from the NFL.
9. Marcus Tubbs, drafted in the 1st round (23rd overall) in 2004 out of Texas.
Coach Mike Holmgren had hoped Tubbs would turn into a run-stuffing force in the middle of Seattle's defensive line, similar to what Sam Adams and Cortez Kennedy had been before.
Tubbs played 29 games.
He appeared for a moment to be on his way, finding his stride late in 2005 as the Seahawks made a run to their first Super Bowl appearance. Tubbs racked up 5.5 sacks from Week 7 to Week 13 that year, and he even played in all three playoff games including the Super Bowl loss to Pittsburgh in Detroit.
But his 2006 season was cut short after five games with a knee injury. Then Tubbs missed all of 2007 after suffering another injury in preseason and never played again.
8. John Moffitt, drafted in the 3rd round (75th overall) in 2011 out of Wisconsin.
Even the shrewdest draft analysts don't expect teams to hit on all of their picks, so it may seem harsh to point out a disappointing third rounder in an otherwise terrific draft for the Seahawks.
Then again, the fact Seattle found so many gems after wasting this pick on Moffitt makes it stick out all the more.
First, let's looks at Moffitt's resume. He played in 17 games with Seahawks over two seasons before he was traded to Denver. With the Broncos, he played in two games before retiring.
So, who were the guys taken after Moffitt? K.J. Wright (4th round), Richard Sherman (5th), Byron Maxwell (6th) and Malcolm Smith (7th). You may have heard of them.
7. Lamar King, drafted in the 1st round (22nd overall) in 1999 out of Saginaw Valley State.
King was the first pick of the Holmgren era in Seattle, and with that likely came unfair expectations.
Ultimately, though, he was just another NFL player plagued by injuries.
He did not start a game his rookie year and was limited because of a torn labrum in his left shoulder. But he showed promise, recording two sacks and blocking a field goal attempt in a Holmgren's much-anticipated return to Green Bay.
King started 14 games in 2000 and managed six sacks, looking like an emerging talent. But the excitement was short-lived. He finished three of the next four seasons on injured reserve, playing in just 29 more games.
He was effective when he was on the field, but he spent far too much time off of it.
6. Chris McIntosh, drafted in the 1st round (22nd overall) in 2000 out of Wisconsin.
McIntosh was drafted three picks after Shaun Alexander, perhaps showing just how much of a crapshoot the draft can be.
McIntosh played in 24 games over two seasons with the Seahawks. He started 13 of them and never played in the NFL again.
Alexander played in 119 games for the Seahawks, ran for 9,453 yards, scored 112 touchdowns and won the first NFL MVP in franchise history.
What led to McIntosh's short stint? Once again, injuries. He suffered a neck stinger in training camp in 2001 and after playing in 10 games that year, he was never heard from again.
Rang says it's difficult to label a player as a bust after such bad luck.
“Anytime there's an injury, I have a hard time characterizing a player as a bust,” he said. “Morally, I struggle with that. I have a hard time saying that Chris McIntosh or Brian Bosworth were busts in the NFL because physically their bodies broke down.”
Fair point. But if we didn't include players with injuries, we wouldn't have much of a list.
5. Steve Niehaus, drafted in the 1st round (2nd overall) in 1976 out of Notre Dame.
Niehaus was also a victim of injuries. The collegiate All American defensive lineman was named NFC Defensive Rookie of the Year after totaling 9.5 sacks in the Seahawks' inaugural season.
He started all 14 games as a rookie, but played in just 22 more games in his career thanks to a slew of setbacks and was out of the league by the time he turned 26.
The loss was extra devastating to Seattle since the team used the franchise's first draft pick on Niehaus and hoped to build around him. That never happened.
To add insult to all the injuries, defensive back Mike Haynes was taken three picks after Niehaus in the 1976 draft by New England and went on to a Hall of Fame career.
4. Malik McDowell, drafted in the 2nd round (35th overall) in 2017 out of Michigan State.
Injuries on the field are one thing. Football is a violent game.
But McDowell's case is different.
He was injured in what appears to be a fluke off-the-field accident before his first training camp a few months after he was drafted.
He has yet to play in a game and will reportedly be released by the Seahawks before ever stepping onto the field.
When asked Monday if McDowell might play this season, Carroll didn't offer much hope.
“We haven't had any indication to think that yet,” he said. “We're waiting to see what happens and we're hoping that we get good information soon.”
3. Rick Mirer, drafted in the 1st round (2nd overall) in 1993 out of Notre Dame.
Mirer earns such a high spot on this list not only because of how high he was drafted, but also because of who was drafted around him.
The “Golden Boy” was taken directly after WSU legend Drew Bledsoe and right before future Pro Bowl running back Garrison Hearst. Hall of Famers Willie Roaf and Jerome Bettis also were taken in the Top 10 that year.
But the Seahawks needed a quarterback, and since they beat New England in the regular season, they were stuck with the second-overall pick and Mirer instead of Bledsoe.
Mirer didn't start out all that bad. He won rookie of the year over Bledsoe, even though he threw 17 interceptions to go with 12 touchdowns.
Throwing interceptions became a routine for Mirer, who finished his career with 76 picks and 50 touchdowns. Not the best ratio.
Q13 executive digital producer Dusty Lane sums up the circumstances of Seahawks fans' angst.
“Had Seahawks cornerback Patrick Hunter not intercepted a pass from the Patriots' Hugh Millen in the fourth quarter of a September game that turned out to be one of Seattle's only two wins that season, the Seahawks would've had the No. 1 pick instead,” Lane surmised. “A pick the Pats used to draft the great Drew Bledsoe. Instead, they got Rick Freakin' Mirer.”
2. Aaron Curry, drafted in the 1st round (4th overall) in 2009 out of Wake Forest.
Curry was labeled the one can't miss prospect in the 2009 draft.
It was the perfect decision, analysts said, of the Seahawks selecting him with the No. 4 overall pick. It did not pan out that way.
Curry played in 35 games for the Seahawks, producing 158 tackles and 5.5 sacks.
When the Seahawks traded him midway through his third season to the Raiders, some of the same analysts that praised Curry in '09 predicted the change of scenery could be just what he needed to get his career on track.
Instead, he played in 13 games for Oakland before signing as a free agent with the Giants. He was cut in training camp and never played again.
Rang admitted, he was among those that never saw it coming.
“It wasn't just the Seahawks that missed on Aaron Curry,” he said. “There were a lot of us, myself included.”
Rang said he looks back at all his grades every year after players develop to see what he got right and what he got wrong. Most of the time he can make sense of things. Players end up in the wrong system. Circumstances, such as injuries intervene. In Curry's case, Rang is still a bit baffled. As are most fans.
1. Dan McGwire, drafted in the 1st round (16th overall) in 1991 out of San Diego State.
There can be only one all-time bust on our list, and McGwire is the hands-down winner.
Standing 6-foot-8 and weighing more than 240 pounds, he stood out among quarterback prospects in 1991.
Owner Ken Behring was said to be so enamored with the San Diego State signal caller he made the pick himself, overruling coach Chuck Knox who reportedly lobbied for “the kid from Mississippi.”
That kid went No. 33 overall to Atlanta, where he rode the bench for a season before being traded to Green Bay and embarking on a Hall of Fame career.nTo be fair, most analysts agreed that the top two quarterback prospects in the draft were McGwire and Southern Mississippi's Brett Favre and the separation between the two could go either way. ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr. even had the two tied on his draft board.
But Behring was dead-set on McGwire. The younger brother of baseball slugger Mark McGwire, Dan started five games with the Seahawks and appeared in 13 games in his entire NFL career. He threw for a total of 745 yards. His two touchdowns are the second-fewest of any QB taken in the first round since 1980 and 506 behind Favre's career total.
McGwire was so bad, it turned out, the Seahawks were in the market for another quarterback just two years later. Unfortunately for them, though, they beat New England in 1992.

PARIS The populist tsunami that slammed into Britain last year, before sweeping across the Atlantic to the United States, may have faded on the shores of France on Sunday.
Despite a strong performance from far-right leader Marine Le Pen in the first round of France's presidential election, the bigger news was the success of Emmanuel Macron, an independent centrist who rode to victory with a counter-intuitive campaign that embraced globalisation, immigration and the European Union.
The polls suggest Macron will beat Le Pen soundly in the second round runoff on May 7. If he does, it could open the door to more ambitious reforms of the French economy and an elusive compromise with Germany on overhauling the troubled euro zone.

Just 39 years old and with only four years of political experience under his belt, Macron represents a generational change and a break from the left-right divide that has defined French politics for over half a century.
He would face formidable challenges as president. Nearly half of French voters opted for candidates on the extreme right and left of the political spectrum. These people are unlikely to embrace Macron's liberal democratic vision, leaving France a deeply divided nation.
A president Macron could also struggle to cobble together a centrist majority in parliament after legislative elections in June.
COMMENTARY: Winning French presidency is easy part for Macron
But after Brexit and the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, his first round victory -- which comes after setbacks for far-right politicians in Austria, the Netherlands and Germany in recent months -- shows that the political centre is holding in the heart of Europe.
"It looks as though populism is in retreat in Europe," said Iain Begg of the London School of Economics.
WAVING EU FLAGS
Macron was the only candidate among the four frontrunners who embraced the idea of closer European integration during the campaign.
WATCH: Macron and Le Pen through to French vote runoff
Le Pen and hard-left politician Jean-Luc Melenchon were openly hostile, floating the idea of a French exit from the EU. And conservative Francois Fillon, in the Gaullist tradition, spoke mainly about boosting France's influence in Europe.
At the post-election party at Porte de Versailles in the south of Paris, Macron supporters waved both French and EU flags. His victory was hailed from Brussels to Berlin on Sunday evening.
"Great for Europe" said German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, who worked with Macron on ideas for reforming the European Union when both were economy ministers.
Central to Macron's approach to Europe is his belief that France must reform its own economy in order to restore a level of trust with Germany. He wants to pursue a comprehensive deal with Berlin that includes reform of the euro zone and closer cooperation on defence and migration.
Macron travelled to Berlin twice this year, meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel in March. His European advisers have said that if he wins the presidency, he will not wait until German elections in September to begin discussing a roadmap for European reform with the German government.
"We will go to them with a list of options," Sylvie Goulard, a member of the European parliament and adviser to Macron who is seen as a possible foreign minister, told Reuters last month. "Now is the time to ask ourselves what is the right architecture."
Macron is in favour of transforming Europe's bailout fund, the ESM, into a full-blown European Monetary Fund, an idea that has supporters in Berlin. He is also in favour of a euro zone budget and finance minister, ideas that are less popular in Merkel's entourage.
Europe's economy is recovering after years of sluggish growth, but years of financial turmoil have exposed flaws in the bloc's architecture that experts believe have left it vulnerable to future shocks.
Many express concerns about how highly-indebted countries like Italy will cope when the European Central Bank begins pushing up interest rates and unwinding the bond-buying scheme that has kept borrowing costs artificially low.
"If Macron is elected there is an historic opportunity which may not come around again," said Jeromin Zettelmeyer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and former top official in the German economy ministry.
"It will be very difficult for Germany not to engage with Macron on serious euro zone reform if he goes about this in the right way, reforming at home first and reassuring the Germans that Europe will not turn into a transfer union."
Others are sceptical about whether Macron can convince the Germans to do a deal.
Christian Odendahl of the Centre for European Reform points to a lack of "intellectual convergence" between Berlin and Paris on what Europe really needs.
"In Berlin, there isn't a great sense of urgency. They see this as a marathon, not a sprint. There is a preference for incremental improvements in Europe rather than bold new projects," he said.

TOKYO Mitsui Life Insurance Co plans to shift some funds to euro-denominated bonds from dollar bonds this year, as currency hedging costs for the dollar are expected to rise, a senior company official said on Thursday.
While the company pays close attention to political risks in Europe, it would view a spike in European bond yields triggered by such concerns as a good opportunity to buy, Yoichiro Matsuta, head of the investment planning department, told a news conference.
Japanese investors have stepped up buying of foreign bonds in recent years as an alternative to low-yielding domestic bonds.
In the last financial year ended in March, Japanese insurers bought a record 7.76 trillion yen ($71.2 billion) of foreign bonds. (For a graphic of the trend, see tmsnrt.rs/2oZOJ7E)
Because they do not like exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations, they use currency hedging on a large part of their foreign bond investment.
But that strategy is increasingly facing a challenge.
The hedging costs are closely tied to short-term interest rate gaps between currencies and rises in dollar interest rates mean hedging will become costlier for Japanese investors.
On the other hand, because the euro zone's short-term interest rates are deep into negative territory, hedging for the euro costs almost nothing, or sometimes even produces extra returns.
"To deal with rising dollar hedging costs, we are planning to shift to euros," Matsuta said.
The company also plans to reduce the overall holding of currency-hedged foreign bonds by around 50 billion yen ($460 million) this financial year, after having boosted it by around 170 billion yen to around 1.1 trillion yen last year, he said.
"Last financial year, because domestic bonds yields had dropped to negative levels, foreign bonds were the only thing we could buy. But now, long-term domestic bond yields have risen. So foreign bonds remain attractive, but less so than last financial year," he said.
Mitsui Life, which has total assets of about 7.2 trillion yen ($66.1 billion), reduced domestic bond holdings by 50 billion yen last year and plans to lower it further, Matsuta said.
But he added the company could buy long-dated bonds given that their yields have risen after the Bank of Japan started a new policy framework last September, allowing long-term bond yields to rise considerably since then.
Matsuta also said the insurer plans to increase the holding of foreign bonds without currency hedging by more than 100 billion yen.
It has been buying mostly Australian dollar bonds this way to have matching assets for Aussie-denominated products it sells to Japanese customers.

WASHINGTON U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said the Trump administration would unveil a $1 trillion infrastructure plan later this year, but she did not offer details of funding for projects.
Chao said at an event at the department's headquarters that the infrastructure initiative would include "a strategic, targeted program of investment valued at $1 trillion over 10 years. The proposal will cover more than transportation infrastructure, it will include energy, water and potentially broadband and veterans hospitals as well."
Chao's comments were the most detailed timetable from the administration about its plans to unveil a plan to modernize U.S. roads, bridges, airports, electrical grid and water systems. Chao said the administration plans to offer incentives for public-private partnerships rather than simply fund improvements.
It was not clear how much new federal funding the Trump administration would propose.
She said the plan would aim to speed the processes for government projects.
Investors have been growing more skeptical that the infrastructure plan will win approval this year. The Dow Jones Transportation Average rose after the election and closed at a record high on March 1 but is now down 4.3 percent for the month.
Some investors have questioned how soon Trump's pro-growth policies may be implemented.
Earlier this month, Trump proposed $16.2 billion for the Department of Transportation's discretionary budget for fiscal year 2018, a reduction of 13 percent.
The budget would eliminate $175 million in annual funding for the Essential Air Service, a program to support commercial air service to rural airports and end subsidies for Amtrak to operate long-distance train service.
The Trump budget would also eliminate the Obama administration's "TIGER" grant program, saving $499 million. That program has been used to fund a variety of transportation projects, including high-speed and intracity rail, highway construction and transit bus systems.

The Pittsburgh Steelers star running back was in Minnesota on Friday, a guest on numerous shows along Super Bowl media row. With most of the interviewers asking Le'Veon Bell the same questions about his contract and the Steelers playoff loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, his responses were rather repetitive.
At least they were until he sat down with Tiki Barber and Brandon Tierney from CBS Sports Radio. When the conversation turned to the playoff defeat, Bell suggested it was not a lack of focus but a lack of energy that doomed Pittsburgh on the day.
“We didn't play good, Jacksonville came out and they wanted it more than us. We didn't start playing good football, for real, on offense, until the second half … For me, when I was out there playing, I had a sense they were playing with more energy … I get my first carry, they're in the backfield and then getting up talking trash, they had more energy, you know what I'm saying.”
When asked why his team didn't have that same energy, Bell's answer was somewhat surprising.
“I did, but you can't control everybody, you know what I'm saying. I did, I wanted that game badly.”
When pressed by Barber if he was saying that he was ready for the game but his teammates were not, Bell double down on his comments.
“Certain guys out there who was not ready to play football. Don't get me wrong, guys woke up in the second half, but its like, it's kinda too late.”
Attributing this lack of energy in part to the effects of the bye week, Bell appears to believe some of his teammates took Jacksonville too lightly.
“Guys got complacent, we had a bye week, we're at home, we're playing the Jaguars, it's whatever. That's how guys looked at it. I already knew the Jaguars were good, we played them earlier in the year.”
Considering his tweet the night before the game suggesting he was already looking forward to a rematch with the New England Patriots, it is interesting to note Bell is calling out other unnamed teammates for their complacency.
It is also hard to ignore how flat the team appeared and not give Bell's words some credence. He was one of the better performers during the first half and a key reason why Pittsburgh was still in the game until the last few minutes. Effort and energy from Bell was not the issue in their loss.

The District of Sicamous announced late Friday that a conditional purchase offer has been made on the acquisition of the Sicamous Medical Clinic, located at 217 Finlayson St.
“Council has been pursuing additional community space for our recreation programs as well as aggressively recruiting for a second physician to improve quality health care for our residents,” said Mayor Terry Rysz in a news release. “Council determined that this was an opportune time to meet both objectives by purchasing the Medical Clinic below its fair market value. This purchase will position council to actively recruit a second physician and nurse practitioner for our community.”
The conditional purchase offer of $690,000 is below the property's 2017 assessment value of $929,000 and appraised value of $790,000, states the release. In addition, the long-term tenants that will remain in the space yield a healthy capitalization rate of seven per cent for the District of Sicamous.
“All of these factors led to a final decision to make a purchase offer on the land and building complex. No debt will be issued, the district will be financing this acquisition through available internal resources. Outstanding conditions on the purchase offer include public consultation through a financial plan amendment and a building structural inspection, with a closing date of Nov. 10,” the release states.
An amendment to the 2017 Financial Plan will be introduced to council on Oct. 11 reflecting this purchase. A press conference is scheduled for Friday, Oct. 13 at noon at municipal hall for anyone to ask questions and learn more about the acquisition.
0 Woman who slipped note to vet staff about armed boyfriend: 'I thought he was going to kill me'
DELAND, Fla. -
A woman who escaped her boyfriend, who's accused of holding her at gunpoint, spoke to WFTV on Wednesday.
Police said Jeremy Floyd held his girlfriend captive and now faces more charges because he tried to contact her from jail 47 times in three days.
"I was terrified. I thought he was going to kill me," said the woman, who asked to not be identified. "It just became too much, because I would wake up and I would have 10 missed phone calls."
She said she answered her boyfriend's calls, but she told him several times to stop calling her.
Deputies said they arrested Floyd Friday after his girlfriend slipped a note to staff members at a DeLand animal hospital asking for help.
Floyd's charges were upgraded to stalking, and the victim changed her number, but she said he called her sister's phone at least three times Wednesday.
The badly bruised victim said Floyd beat her days earlier during an alcohol- and drug-fueled argument and held her hostage. She said she had to think quickly to save her life because Floyd was armed with a gun.
"I slipped a pen off the vet's desk," she said. "I went to the women's restroom, and I wrote a note. I had it on my hand. I was still wearing my sunglasses, and I passed the note to the vet."
The note asked for a call to police for help.
"I was shaking really bad (because) I knew the cops were going to come," she said. "But I took off my sunglasses so she could see my bruised eye, and we kind of had a secret head nod type thing like I understand."

Floyd was arrested and ordered to not contact the victim, but investigators said that didn't stop him.
Floyd was charged with violating pretrial release conditions, but investigators amended that charge to stalking.
WFTV legal analyst Bill Sheaffer said there is nothing in place to stop inmates from contacting victims they've been ordered to not contact, but legislators hope to change that during the next legislative session.

LONDON British company finance chiefs are their most optimistic in 18 months, but their risk appetite has recovered far less from the battering it took in the run-up to and aftermath of last year's vote to leave the European Union, a survey showed on Monday.
Britain's economy enjoyed the second-fastest growth of any large advanced economy last year, but with consumer demand fading in the face of surging inflation, the Bank of England hopes business investment will keep growth going this year.
Accountants Deloitte said the mood among chief financial officers who decide investment plans at some of Britain's biggest companies was the most upbeat since June 2015.
Some 31 percent of CFOs surveyed last month said they were more optimistic about the prospects for their company than three months earlier, up from 27 percent in December and just 3 percent immediately after the June 2016 referendum.
"The UK corporate sector enters the negotiation phase of Brexit in far better spirits than seemed likely in the months after last year's referendum vote," David Sproul, a senior partner at Deloitte, said.
However, while business optimism is pretty much back to its level before the EU referendum started to weigh on corporate sentiment, risk appetite is far from having recovered.
Some 26 percent of CFOs said they still expected to reduce capital spending because of Brexit and 30 percent plan to slow hiring - though this is down from an outright majority who planned to cut investment and jobs just after the referendum.
Just 26 percent of CFOs think now is a good time to take a risk - up from 3 percent after the referendum, but far below the 51 percent who were prepared to add risk to their company's balance sheet in June 2015.
Last week Prime Minister Theresa May formally told the European Union that she wanted to start two years of exit talks.
"Businesses will hope that the UK can secure the best possible deal on trade and market access, but must continue to plan for an exit in 2019, several years of trade negotiations, and a transitional phase to bridge the two," Sproul said.
The Deloitte survey was conducted between March 8 and March 22 and was based on responses from 130 CFOs, including 25 of Britain's 100 largest listed companies, and 53 mid-cap firms. Other participants included finance directors of large, privately held companies and British subsidiaries of foreign firms.

HKMA chief expects city's banks to raise rates after Fed rate hike

MILAN, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Sunday called on world leaders to work in favour of nuclear disarmament to protect human rights, particularly those of weaker and underprivileged people.
The pontiff said that there was a need to “work with determination to build a world without nuclear weapons”, speaking from the window of the papal apartment overlooking St. Peter's Square and citing his 2015 encyclical letter Laudato Si (Praised Be).
His remarks came on the day that the group which won this year's Nobel Peace Prize urged nuclear nations to adopt a U.N. treaty banning atomic weapons.
With rising tensions between the United States and North Korea, the pope has repeatedly warned against the catastrophic humanitarian and environmental effects of nuclear devices and has called for a third country to mediate the dispute.
At his weekly Angelus prayer, Pope Francis added that men and women in the world had “the liberty, the intelligence and the capacity to guide technology, limit their power, at the service of peace and true progress”.
Speaking aboard the plane back from his trip to Myanmar and Bangladesh, the pope suggested that some world leaders had an “irrational” attitude towards nuclear weapons.
Last month he appeared to harden the Catholic Church's teaching against nuclear weapons, saying countries should not stockpile them, even for the purpose of deterrence.
Pope Francis, a strong defender of environmental protection, also hoped that an upcoming Paris summit would adopt “efficient decisions” to contrast climate change. (Reporting by Giulia Segreti; Editing by Toby Chopra)

By Trevor Hunnicutt NEW YORK, April 5 Investors amped up their bets on the fixed-income market during the latest week, adding cash to U.S.-based taxable-bond funds for the 17th straight week, Investment Company Institute data showed on Wednesday. The move into U.S.-based bond funds, which has lasted more than a year, comes despite a risk of rising U.S. interest rates and as the Federal Reserve incubates a plan to cut its cache of bond holdings this year. Fixed-income funds attracted $7.6 billion during the seven days through March 29, the trade group said, including $7 billion in taxable-bond funds and the remainder in municipal debt. Minutes from the latest meeting of the Fed's policymaking committee released on Wednesday showed its members think the U.S. central bank should take steps to begin trimming its $4.5 trillion balance sheet this year as long as the U.S. economy holds up. Bond funds have nonetheless remained immensely popular. They took in $261 billion in the United States over the 14 months through February, earlier ICI data showed. Equity funds posted nearly $19 billion in withdrawals over that period. By contrast, bond markets reacted violently in 2013 to the possibility that the Fed might slow down its bond buying. Bond mutual funds posted $71 billion in withdrawals during the "taper tantrum" that year. In March, U.S. ETF investors sopped up investment-grade bonds, emerging markets sovereign debt and Treasuries, according to data service FactSet Research Systems Inc, while mortgage-backed securities also attracted cash. Those moves could be a bet on stable rates, said Rusty Vanneman, chief investment officer at CLS Investments LLC, but he said the more obvious reason is investors are "just reaching for more yield." That behavior did not extend to stocks, which attracted just $1.7 billion during the week, ICI said, a reversal from withdrawals during the prior week. Investors added $1.3 billion into funds focused on international shares, their 17th straight week adding cash, while $339 million went to equity funds focused on domestic companies. The following table shows estimated ICI flows, including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (all figures in millions of dollars): 3/29 3/22 3/15 3/8 3/1/2017 Equity 1,659 -1,752 10,992 9,112 9,116 -Domestic 339 -6,849 9,014 4,284 5,766 -World 1,320 5,097 1,978 4,828 3,350 Hybrid -1,066 -778 -242 -376 -912 Bond 7,626 13,190 2,834 6,921 9,707 -Taxable 6,985 12,511 3,037 6,868 9,432 -Municipal 641 679 -203 53 274 Commodity 100 -151 237 -663 192 Total 8,319 10,508 13,821 14,994 18,103 (Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by James Dalgleish)
OTTAWA — The co-founders of a Canadian company at the centre of the international scandal over the alleged inappropriate use of Facebook data are defending their work in support of political campaigns around the globe.
Speaking to a parliamentary committee, Jeff Silvester of the B.C.-based political advertising firm AggregateIQ says the company helps its customers craft their messages for online political ads and how to effectively make use of data for their campaigns.
But Silvester, the firm's chief operating officer, insists AggregateIQ does not harvest data and only uses what it is provided — nor does it undertake any kind of voter profiling, including psychographic profiling.
He says the company's work differs little from what political campaigns in Canada do to promote a candidate or a party, such as putting up lawn signs, sending volunteers to knock on doors and making phone calls.
The Victoria firm has been suspended by Facebook and is under investigation by privacy commissioners in Ottawa, B.C. and the United Kingdom for its role in a controversy that allegedly involved a breach of millions of users' private information to help the "Leave" side win the U.K.'s 2016 Brexit referendum.
AggregateIQ has also been linked to Cambridge Analytica, the political consultancy firm accused of improperly accessing the private Facebook data to help the Leave campaign in Brexit as well as Donald Trump's winning 2016 U.S. presidential bid.
In his testimony Tuesday, Silvester said AggregateIQ has always complied with laws in Canada and abroad. He also disputed allegations raised by Canadian data expert and whistle-blower Christopher Wylie, saying AggregateIQ has never been part of Cambridge Analytica nor its parent company, SCL.
"We are not data harvesters by any stretch of the imagination and, certainly, we don't do psychographic profiling or profiling of any other type," he told the committee on access to information, privacy and ethics, which is holding hearings this month on the data breach involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.
"We're not psychologists, we're tech guys."
Efforts by volunteers and political candidates themselves to persuade voters are no different from the work of AggregateIQ, he added.
But only part of the newsroom hears from an especially vicious type of person: the misogynistic troll.
This is the troll that is drawn out by female bylines and whose messages usually read like a disturbing Mad Lib:
Dear (slur for female body part or word for female dog). You're a (slur for female body part or word for a female dog). I hope you (horrible violent act). (Verb) my (male body part).
The scariest ones take it further and scrutinize photos, so they can highlight flaws. These can be related to hair, skin, teeth, weight, the shapes of someone's eyes. I know because I recently asked some of my female colleagues to send me some they had received. Minutes later my inbox was filled with vitriol.
"If your boyfriend/husband/father hasn't beaten the [expletive] out of you, then they've done you wrong," read one.
"Do the world a favour [slur for female body part], and eat a bullet!" read another.
One of the only printable ones read, "You should go get married, obey your husband, and make babies."
I try to respond to most emails sent to me, even the ones that contain racist sentiments because on occasion, when people receive a respectful reply, they realize a person is on the other end and suddenly act human again. I also believe hearing other perspectives make us all more informed, and for that reason, I have never Facebook banished anyone for a political post.
Without exception though, I immediately delete the misogynistic messages. But even after they are gone, I find myself thinking about them for way too long, and I am always nagged by the same question: What would their mothers think?
I am raising two boys and I ask them often, "What is something kind you did today?" I would want to know if ever they spoke to a woman the way these men do. I know from talking to my colleagues that some of these messages have driven them to tears, ruined vacations and even pushed them to get cosmetic work.
And so, here was my idea for the column that you will not read. I planned to ask a few female journalists for the emails that struck them the hardest. I would then try to reach out to these men to see if they stood by their words enough to let me talk to their moms. If they said no, that in itself would be revealing. But if even one was bold or stubborn enough to say yes, it could lead to a potentially enlightening encounter.
The reason you will not read that piece any time soon is because my mama didn't raise a fool. To find that one man open enough to let me speak to his mother, I would have to invite the anger of others who don't want to be exposed and the shooting at the Annapolis newspaper showed us the danger in that. There, a troll who harassed a woman and blamed a newspaper for printing the truth became a killer. He went from using words to a gun. And now, police officers stand guard in front of other newsrooms, and people who spend way too many hours working, eating meals at their desks, worry about what it is they are guarding against.
There may come a time when I can do that column, but it is not now, when the country's highest authority has described the media as an "enemy of the public" and his wife wears a jacket with a message supposedly directed at reporters that reads, "I really don't care, do u?"
Maybe though, we can hope, a man somewhere will read this, realize there are real women on the other side of the send button and before typing a string of curses and insults pause just long enough to ask himself: "What would my mother think?"
The actress is a self-proclaimed “chicken lady,” and she's proud of her new title — so much so she decided to post about “one of our ladies,” Regina George, on Instagram. “Regina loves long walks, dehydrated bugs, and kale,” she wrote alongside a pic of herself walking an adorable chicken, whose name is inspired by the Mean Girls character. As for her dislikes? “Regina hates….carbs.”
In May 2018, she introduced Insta followers to another little chick, this one named Hennifer.

A rally being held by French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen faced a security risk on Monday evening after a protester attempted to storm the stage, eventually being dragged off by the Front National leader's security detail.
Ms. Le Pen — who is expected to reach the second round of this month's presidential election — was giving a speech to a massive crowd at a hall in the Parisian neighborhood of Aubervilliers when a female got onto the stage and attempted to throw flowers.

According to reports on Twitter, the suspect was successfully detained, while Ms. Le Pen blamed the “extreme left” for the incident and reemphasized that she is a defender of women.

Protests against Ms. Le Pen took place in the neighborhood of Aubervilliers, a suburb severely affected by mass immigration, as far-left activists through firebombs at police, who responded with bottles of tear gas.

Similar protests against Ms. Le Pen's candidacy have taken place across France in recent months, as far-left and ‘anti-fascist' groups organize to bring her down.
Polls ahead of this month's election suggest that Ms. Le Pen, who is running on a candidacy of opposing mass immigration and the European Union and, will win the first round of voting, yet faces an uphill battle to win against globalist candidate Emmanuel Macron in the second round.
Some of her policies include a referendum on France's membership of the European Union, taking tough stances on radical Islamism, as well as implementing a Trump-style “France First” form of economic nationalism.
However, polls in recent days suggest the race is tightening, with centre-right candidate François Fillon and the communist-backed left wing candidate Jéan-Luc Melechon seeing increased support.

Saltspring RCMP have two Nanaimo men in custody following a pair of break, enter and thefts on Lower Ganges Road.
Mounties say significant damage was done at one of the businesses and numerous tools were taken from both.
Police say through the course of the investigation, a suspect vehicle and general description of one of the suspects was generated and then on Friday, the suspect vehicle, with two occupants, was located at the south end of the Island.
The pair, aged 44 and 43, are facing numerous charges.
The "wardrobe malfunction" that occurred during the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show is firmly etched in popular culture memory. When a "Rock Your Body" duet between Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake ended with him ripping off a piece of her leather top and revealing her jewelry-covered nipple for about half a second (9/16 of a second, to be exact), audiences were stunned and then quickly outraged. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the FCC received over 200,000 complaints, CBS was almost fined for $550,000 for "public indecency," and as for Janet Jackson, well, her career was never quite the same again.
Timberlake, however, didn't face the same backlash as Jackson, an injustice exemplified by the fact that he was selected to perform at this year's Super Bowl halftime show. With the Super Bowl kicking off this Sunday, we wanted to revisit what really happened during the Super Bowl 14 years ago and why the moment made such a huge cultural impact.
To This Day, No One Can Clearly Say Who Was At Fault
"Was it planned or not?" seems to be the question that comes up most when discussing the Janet Jackson-Justin Timberlake wardrobe malfunction. Shortly after the incident, MTV, the producer of the 2004 halftime show, issued an apology, saying "The tearing of Janet Jackson's costume was unrehearsed, unplanned, completely unintentional and was inconsistent with assurances we had about the content of the performance."
Jackson's representative later followed with a statement that slightly differed with MTV's accounts, stating that there were plans for a costume reveal, but that it went awry: "[I]t was not intentional... He was supposed to pull away the bustier and leave the red-lace bra."
While both CBS, the broadcaster of the game, and MTV were quick to absolve themselves of blame, former FCC chairman Michael Powell, however, when interviewed by USA Today recently, maintains that he is not so convinced that the corporations were as innocent as they claimed:
"To this day, despite some ambiguity about who knew what, I think we were relatively convinced that somehow those producing the show knew what was going to happen... Their story to this day was that they had absolutely no idea on how the artists just did this up on their own. That's plausible, but didn't seem to us where the evidence pointed."
[USA Today]
The Repercussions, However, Were Swift
Within days, the FCC reportedly received more than 200,000 complaints about the Super Bowl performance. A few months later, the FCC also issued a $550,000 fine against CBS, the largest fine ever of its kind, for public indecency, although the fine was later overturned by the Supreme Court in 2012 (yes, it took eight years).
Other casualties of the incident included the Super Bowl turning away from more youth-oriented pop in their halftime shows and embracing older, less controversial figures of male rock, like Paul McCartney and the Rolling Stones, for nearly a decade. MTV was also blacklisted from producing another Super Bowl show.
"We were extremely disappointed by elements of the MTV-produced halftime show," NFL executive vice president Joe Browne said at the time. "They were totally inconsistent with assurances our office was given about the content of the show. It's unlikely that MTV will produce another Super Bowl halftime."
[Rolling Stone]
Jackson Bore The Brunt Of The Blame
Despite the fact that it was Timberlake who tore off part of Jackson's costume during the performance, it was, unfortunately, the latter who faced the most severe criticisms as well as insinuations (or outright accusations) that she was responsible for the whole nip slip. Tom Freston, chief executive of MTV, claimed that Jackson had "engineered it." Salli Frattini, the producer of the 2004 halftime show, believes the exposing of the breast came either from Jackson or Jackson's stylist, and not from Timberlake.
The public shaming of Jackson began with the Grammys, which happened a week after the Super Bowl that year. Both Timberlake and Jackson were slated to present and perform, but Jackson was later uninvited from the event. The blacklisting of the singer would continue on in various forms.
Clear Channel Communications, which owned Infinity Broadcasting and Viacom (MTV and CBS), blacklisted all of Jackson's singles and music videos, banning her music from all the TV channels and radio stations the company owned, stifling airplay and making her new album, Damita Jo, her lowest-selling album since 1984. The disgraced singer was forced to resign from a set movie deal she had just signed, and even a statue of Mickey Mouse wearing Jackson's "Rhythm Nation" costume was dismantled following continued backlash.
[Billboard]
Attitudes Towards The Incident Have Changed In Recent Years
When asked by Oprah Winfrey in 2006 whether she believes that people were harder on her than Timberlake in regard to the wardrobe malfunction, Jackson replied yes, "I think they did put all the emphasis on me, as opposed to us" and that he had left her hanging "to a certain degree."
Timberlake, on his part, apologized in a 2006 interview, saying he could have handled the aftermath of the Super Bowl incident better. "If you consider it 50-50, then I probably got 10 percent of the blame," he said. "I think America is harsher on women. I think America is unfairly harsh on ethnic people." In a Noisey interview this year, Timberlake also said that he and Jackson had since made peace with the incident.
In 2014, a decade after "Nipplegate" had happened, former FCC chairman Michael Powell conceded that the FCC had overreacted and behaved unfairly towards Jackson.
"I personally thought that was really unfair. It all turned into being about her," Powell said. "In reality, if you slow the thing down, it's Justin ripping off her breastplace." The comments are a complete turnaround from Powell's own words 10 years earlier, when he called Nipplegate "a new low from primetime TV."
[Rolling Stone]
Why Was The Wardrobe Malfunction Such A Big Deal?
There is never any shortage of gaffes or faux pas in popular culture, so why is the Janet Jackson nip slip so indelible in our memories? One reason may be that the incident coincided with the tech boom and the takeoff of the Internet. Not only did "Janet Jackson" break records to become the most Googled search term to date, but the idea of YouTube also reportedly came from one of its creator's frustration with searching for the video clip online.
The wardrobe malfunction also came during a time of moral unrest, when Americans were embroiled in two wars, in Afghanistan and Iraq. Compared to the uncertainties of rocky international politics and warfare, it seemed easier to impose moral order upon an incident that created a big sensation but was relatively inconsequential.
Perhaps another reason why the incident remains so gripping to us after 14 years is that the Janet Jackson-Justin Timberlake Super Bowl controversy is a prime example of how factors like gender and race can impinge on a person's career and fate in the public eye. It is difficult not to examine the punishment exacted upon Janet Jackson, a female performer of color, by the entertainment industry without also thinking about the #MeToo movement that has swept the nation since last year. As the New York Times' Jon Pareles put it:
More than a decade later, particularly in the context of the #MeToo movement, the situation comes across as a demonstration of the victim-blaming that sustains male privilege. He grabbed, she was vulnerable — yet she faced the consequences.

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. -- He died doing what he loved. That is what Rick Ulerick's fiancee told WTKR after the photographer was killed taking photos at a weekend truck race on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.
Ulerick's death, at the Muddin' at the Moose race Easter weekend, was called a "freak accident" by witnesses.
Ulerick, 48, was taking photos of a truck racing through a mud pit at the Exmore Moose Lodge when he was struck by a racing truck, according to Virginia State Police. His death, police said, was being investigated as an accident.
"I lost the love of my life," Ulerick's fiancee Barbara Wright said. "I keep waiting for him to walk in the front door."
The Virginia Beach man had taken photos at mud racing or "mud bogging" events for the past three years. His weekend job took him up and down the East Coast.
"He always put himself out there to get the best shots," friend and racer Phillip Edward Hall Sr. said. "It's hard when you lose somebody like that because he did it tirelessly and he did it for nothing."
Ulerick worked at Hepaco Inc. in Norfolk as a environmental specialist for his full-time job for the past 25 years.
Wright said she was coordinating with Ulerick's family to plan a Celebration of Life. A date for the celebration has not been set yet.
Dennis Anderson's Muddy Motorsports Park posted on Facebook that their next event, the "Spring Sling" on April 29, will be held in Ulerick's honor.

Robert Pattinson and FKA twigs are still going strong.
Despite recent photos of the 29-year-old English singer touring Ibiza with French male model Brieuc Breitenstein, a source tells PEOPLE that the couple are “definitely still together.”
Twigs (née Tahliah Debrett Barnett) has been dating Pattinson, 31, since 2014. In late July, the actor made headlines when he told Howard Stern that they are “kind of” engaged after he proposed to the singer in early 2015.
When asked by GQ if he was getting married in an interview for the September cover, Pattinson responded with a noncommittal “eh.”
Rumors of a split were heightened when the Twilight star was spotted having dinner in Los Angeles with Katy Perry and a group of friends earlier this month. A source close to Pattinson told PEOPLE the two were “just friends.”
“They're super cuddly always,” the insider said. “They've known each other forever.”
Twigs and Breitenstein also seemed close while sightseeing on the Spanish island, with the two talking closely at one point, Breitenstein resting his lips on her head.
Pattinson told Stern he prefers to keep his personal life private in order to protect both twigs and their relationship.
“It's one of the most frustrating things in the world, you want to be able to [be more open], but it's literally like, you get stuck in this position but you have to make this decision whether you want to let the crazy people in,” said the actor. “I mean basically, for whatever reason with Twilight – I don't know whether it is a specific thing with the audience – there's like a crack group of crazies that think every single decision you're making is either creating some kind of conspiracy…”
“So you kind of think, like, to protect it, I want to create a big boundary,” said Pattinson.
The couple have previously been candid about the online bullying that twigs, 29, has dealt with since going public with the Twilight star.
Relationship status aside, Pattinson couldn't help but chime in when Stern praised twigs, agreeing, “she's amazing” and gushing that “she's like super talented.”
‘Is that sweat or is it raining outside?' my mother enquired while looking up towards the stunning 1200m² glass-roof atrium of the Sheraton Grand Kraków. It was overcast this sub-zero December morning so she could not have seen droplets and, at 100-odd feet tall, it would have been especially difficult to make them out, even if possessing the binocular vision of an eagle or outstretched neck of a crane. ‘It's sweat,' I replied before gulping down a glass of arctic-cold water at the juice bar. ‘Did you do what you needed to', she asked as I returned to the breakfast table wiping my forehead, ‘since you said you couldn't pay sufficient respect yesterday?' Not since Luxor, when driving from the airport to the city centre, did I see such a long convoy of coaches (then en route to Hurghada) as that which snaked around roundabouts before slithering into a theme park-like parking lot in Oświęcim, a town better known by its Germanized name: Auschwitz. The coaches – displaying an array of European registration plates as well as windows emblazoned in both Arabic and Hebrew script – disgorged people at such an alarming yet life-affirming rate that numbers resembled those outside football stadia, with queues at turnstiles and in terms also of noise generated. The sight of so many sightseers at Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum (ABSM) is to be expected (since the concentration and extermination camps, arguably the most infamous places on the planet, received 2,100,000 visitors in 2017); ear-splitting, selfie-snapping crowds less so. Visitors taking selfies in front of the Arbeit Macht Frei sign at Auschwitz-I and, approximately 1.5 miles away, behind the iconic watchtower on railway tracks at Auschwitz-II has caused a stir recently, leading a documentary-filmmaker to position cameras around former Nazi death camps in order to better comprehend “dark” tourism. One of those camps filmed was Dachau, which limits the size of a tour group (30-35), the number of groups allowed to enter daily (15) as well as those starting at the same time (3). These measures ensure, says Dr. Sarah Hodgkinson, ‘that [the site] is not generally crowded as you wander around.' Despite similar restrictions being in place at ABSM, hordes hinder the opportunity to absorb content and reflect on the c.1.1 million who perished in these death factories. (It is not before time that Anne Frank House, which received 1.3 million through its doors in Amsterdam in 2017, took steps to alleviate the snake-like queues which have become features both inside and outside by granting only pre-purchased ticketholders access for large segments of the day.) Unlike Michael Palin, who observed at length and in silence one of the gas chambers and two tonnes of human hair during his visit, I – like other non-BBC travel presenters – was exiting an exhibition room within a barracks near-enough as soon as entering it for another party of people was pouring in behind. And it was one of these party members who, while waiting in a corridor lined with prisoner photographs, mockingly referred to one as The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas. It was for this, among other reasons, that the next day I set off from the Sheraton (the overpriced surroundings Palin similarly inhabited), walking the five-odd mile round-trip – via the deeply affecting Ghetto Heroes Square – to the Płaszów Camp in the Podgórze district prior to checking out. Steven Spielberg's 1993 worthy Oscar-winning film Schindler's List (about German industrialist Oskar Schindler who performed a humane act during a time of horrifying inhumanity) introduced Płaszów – known hitherto merely among survivors and scholars – to the masses and yet, a quarter of a century on, I had a solitary dog-walker for company in the sparsely wooded hills. For this I was thankful given the lower number of casualties and less sanitized surroundings enabled me to engage with the past without pressure. After placing a stone – as is Jewish custom – at a memorial, I walked back, fast, past the hectares of advertising hoarding which provides a backdrop to the slow-running Vistula before answering my mother's question in the affirmative since only now had I respected those 10,000 (primarily Jewish souls) who died at the forced labour-turned-concentration camp. Future visitors might not be able to reflect at such length and in silence, what with the planned commemorative project at this semi-neglected site of Holocaust history (where there is currently a pervasive lack of signage, with only small placards containing rudimentary information dotting the landscape), yet to paraphrase Palin: ‘[T]he evidence of brutality [must be] kept in good condition [if] people [are to] never be like this again.'

CLEVELAND (AP) — Authorities in several states were on the lookout Monday for a behavioral health case manager who posted gruesome Facebook video of himself randomly shooting a Cleveland retiree who was collecting discarded cans.
Cleveland police allege 37-year-old Steve Stephens shot a 74-year-old passer-by on Sunday in an apparently random attack.
While authorities said Stephens might have left Ohio, the city's police chief added that his last known location was at the site of the shooting Sunday afternoon and that detectives spoke with the suspect by cellphone.
Officers have searched dozens of places around the city, said Chief Calvin Williams, who warned residents to be careful as the go about their day.
“He could be a lot of places,” said Stephen Anthony, the FBI's top agent in Cleveland. “He could be nearby. He could be far away or anywhere in between.”
Authorities have warned people in Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana and Michigan to be alert for Stephens, who is wanted on a charge of aggravated murder.
The victim, retired foundry worker Robert Godwin Sr., apparently was shot while out on a walk to collect discarded aluminum cans in a plastic shopping bag, something his son told Cleveland.com that Godwin did often.
Police said Monday that Godwin is the only victim so far linked to Stephens, despite the suspect's claim in a separate video on Facebook that he killed over a dozen people.
The motive for the shooting wasn't entirely clear from the shaky video, in which Stephens tells Godwin a woman's name and says, “She's the reason that this is about to happen to you.” Godwin didn't seem to recognize the woman's name.
The suspect then points a gun at Godwin, who shields his face with the plastic bag.
Facebook said the video was posted after the killing but wasn't broadcast on Facebook Live as police initially indicated. The suspect did go live on the social media site at another point Sunday.
The video of the killing was on Facebook for about three hours before it was removed. Stephens' Facebook page also was eventually removed.
“This is a horrific crime and we do not allow this kind of content on Facebook,” the company said. “We work hard to keep a safe environment on Facebook, and are in touch with law enforcement in emergencies when there are direct threats to physical safety.”
The victim's son, Robert Godwin Jr., told Cleveland.com that he couldn't bring himself to watch the video but learned about it from others.
“I don't really want to see it,” he said.
In the separate video, authorities said Stephens claimed to have killed more than a dozen other people.
“Like I said, I killed 13, so I'm working on 14 as we speak,” Stephens said.
Police have not verified any other shootings or deaths, Police Chief Calvin Williams said.
Police said they have talked with family and friends of Stephens, who is a case manager at Beech Brook, a behavioral health agency headquartered in Pepper Pike, near Cleveland.
Beech Brook spokeswoman Nancy Kortemeyer said Sunday that news of the shooting shocked and horrified the agency.
“We are hoping that the Cleveland police will be able to apprehend Mr. Stephens as soon as possible and before anyone else is injured,” Kortemeyer said in a statement.
In one of the videos, Stephens can be seen holding up his Beech Brook employee identification badge.
“I'm killing with my Beech Brook badge on too,” he says.
Stephens also mentioned his fraternity, Omega Psi Phi, in one of his Facebook posts. The fraternity issued a statement Sunday night offering “our sincere and heartfelt prayers and condolences of comfort to the families” affected by the shooting.
LONDON — Arsenal record signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang made a scoring debut and Henrikh Mkhitaryan provided three assists on his first start.
But Aaron Ramsey seized the limelight from the January recruits by scoring a hat trick as Arsenal crushed Everton 5-1 in the English Premier League on Saturday.
It was an emphatic response from Arsenal to losing at Swansea 3-1 on Tuesday a day before Aubameyang joined from Borussia Dortmund for $80 million.
Aubameyang dinked the ball over goalkeeper Jordan Pickford for Arsenal's fourth in the 37th minute after being set up by Mkhitaryan.
× Disney reveals new details about Star Wars Land — and it sounds incredible
ORLANDO — Is it 2019 yet?
During a Star Wars event in Orlando on Saturday, Disney revealed new details about the Star Wars lands coming to Walt Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in California.
During a panel at the Star Wars Celebration event, Walt Disney Imagineering and Lucasfilm representatives said guests will be able to control their theme park experience by choosing to work for the Resistance or the First Order.
Visitors will also get the opportunity to pilot the Millennium Falcon. Disney Imagineer Asa Kalama hinted there may be “consequences” for how well you pilot the ship.
“An experience might begin on board the Millennium Falcon and follow you right out the door of the attraction and into the local watering hole,” Kalama said. Pablo Hidalgo of Lucasfilm said technology will allow guests to “build a reputation” inside the land. Disney did not reveal how this will be accomplished, but the land will likely utilize RFID technology currently used in MagicBands.
Panelists at the event said the land will have its own distinct smells and tastes, including “blue milk/Bantha milk.”
Here's how Disney Parks described the land on its official blog:
“The team shared exciting new details about the story behind this mysterious destination somewhere on the Outer Rim — lying on the edge of the Unknown Regions. The remote village was once a busy crossroads along the old sub-lightspeed trade routes, but the prominence of the outpost has been bypassed with the rise of hyperspace travel. Now home to those who prefer less attention, it has become a thriving port for smugglers, rogue traders and adventurers traveling between the frontier and uncharted space. It's also a convenient safe-haven for others intent on avoiding the expanding reach of the First Order.”
The $4 billion investment was first announced in 2015.
The land will be built within Disney's Hollywood Studios park at Walt Disney World and inside Disneyland Park in Anaheim, California. Both lands are expected to open in 2019.

* Greece preparing sale of seven-year bonds
* Economy showing signs of improvement
* Greece hoping to attract conservative bond investors
* Many still worried about high debt levels
* Hedge funds attracted by exciting returns
By Dhara Ranasinghe, Abhinav Ramnarayan and Fanny Potkin
LONDON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Greece's economy is growing, its credit ratings are on the up, the government has returned to bond markets and hopes to leave the 86 billion euros bailout that kept it from default.
But it will still be a challenge to lure long-term investors to an imminent sale of seven-year bonds.
Greece returned to the bond markets last year for the first time since 2014. The 3 billion euros sale of five-year bonds was deemed a success with a yield of 4.625 percent.
That sale was heavily supported by hedge funds. It would be a sign of confidence if Greece can attract a higher proportion of conservative funds, in it for the longer haul, at the new debt issue which could come as early as next week.
Two big bond investors told Reuters they were unlikely to take part in upcoming Greek bond sales because they were still concerned about the sustainability of Greece's debt. Another said he would approach it with caution.
Greece has had three bailouts in the last decade and a debt-to-gross domestic product(GDP) ratio approaching 200 percent, the highest in the 28 member European Union.
“Greece is a controversial story because on one hand, the economic picture is better and reforms asked for by the European Commission were voted through, whereas on the other hand, the total amount of debt is still there,” said Patrick Barbe, head of European bonds at BNP Paribas Asset Management.
His European sovereign and aggregate bond team has no exposure to Greece as its low credit rating puts the country below the threshold that would allow the firm to invest there.
He said he was cautious about buying upcoming Greek bond issues.

S&P last month lifted Greece's rating for the first time in two years but at ‘B,' Greece remains five notches below the “investment grade” threshold that would open it up to a much wider pool of investors.
Its rating also puts Greece on par with Nigeria, Rwanda, Cape Verde and a notch below serial defaulter Argentina.
Other numbers are pointing in the right direction. Economic growth is running at 1.3 percent on an annual basis and data on Thursday showed factory activity expanding at decade-highs and a record pace of job creation.
Seamus Mac Gorain, senior fixed income portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management, which manages assets of $1.6 trillion, said although the strong growth environment means more confidence in high-yield borrowers such as Greece, debt levels would be a “headwind” for a move to lower borrowing costs.
Greece's relatively small and illiquid bond market also makes it hard for big investors to trade. The vast majority of its outstanding 316 billion-euro debt is held by official lenders, with only about 40 billion euros trading in the market.
That is a fraction of the 2 trillion euros or so in debt that trades in markets such as Germany and France.
TEMPTING
For other investors, Greece has offered exciting returns and the upcoming auction will present them with a new opportunity, particularly given the generally bullish mood towards “risk assets”, including emerging markets and high-yield debt.
Those who stuck with Greece reaped returns of more than 40 percent in U.S. dollar terms last year - the best in Europe - as two and five-year Greek bond yields fell, touching record lows recently.
Among those looking at the new debt sale is Mark Dowding, a portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management.
“The only Grexit we think we're going to see is a Greek exit from the bailout,” he said. He was referring to speculation during Greece's financial troubles that it would be forced to leave the euro.
“We would certainly consider adding to our holdings on an attractive new issue,” he added
A banker who has worked closely with the Greek debt agency on recent debt sales was confident Athens would attract more mainstream funds this time.
“A portion of real money focused, buy-and-hold investors have returned to this market now,” the banker said, citing for instance strong demand at a recent covered bond sale from Greek lender Alpha Bank.
The money raised from the government debt sales will be part of a pot of up to 19 billion-euros together with other bond issues and unused bailout funds.
This is designed as a safety net as Greece eases itself out of the bailout. Greece is hoping to make a clean break with official lenders when the rescue package expires in August.
Jeffrey Franks, the director of the IMF's Europe office sounded a note of caution.
He told Reuters Greece had impressed with the speed of its reforms and recent over-performance with fiscal targets and the IMF did not see the need for more austerity measures this year.
However, he said longer-term improvements to the economy are still required.
“There shouldn't be a sense of complacency that even if the programme completes this year that all will be good forever,” he said.

PLYMOUTH, Pa. -- A pregnant cat is recovering after someone shot her in the leg over the weekend – yet another act of animal cruelty in a Pennsylvania borough where residents are trying to track down the person responsible.
The friendly shorthaired cat named Pandora had already lost a lot of blood before she was found near an intersection in Plymouth Saturday, according to WNEP. She was rushed to Pittston Animal Hospital where Dr. Inayat Kathio and the veterinary staff managed to save her life.
"(The) bullet…fractured the cat's long bone and a tendon and cut some blood vessels," Dr. Kathio explained. "It was infected, too, and if I didn't perform surgery, gangrene would've set in and the cat would have lost its leg and ultimately lost its life."
Dr. Kathio, who did emergency surgery on Pandora, is offering a $1,000 reward for more information on who shot Pandora.
"Do you realize the pain when the bullet hits bone and hit the tendon?" Dr. Kathio said. "The animal can feel the pain like we can feel the pain."
Dr. Kathio told WNEP he has treated six cats suffering from gunshot wounds this year, including three from Plymouth. He hopes the reward will lead to justice for Pandora and the other cats.
"One was shot with an arrow from here, came out from the other side. Another cat's jaw was blown off."
Meet Pandora, found this weekend under a car with a bullet in her leg. After life-saving surgery this pregnant cat is recovering in Luzerne County.
Now there's a $1,000 reward for info. Full story later. pic.twitter.com/GZYodD16I3 — Allen Vickers (@AllenWNEP) May 29, 2018
Mary Fromel and Jeff Hollock are a part of "Whisker's World," a nonprofit animal rescue group. They were visiting family when they first saw the cat under a car.
"I stretched the leg out to see what kind of wound it was and the light so happened to catch a bullet sticking out of the leg," Fromel said.
The cat was found just under a car next to a tan brick wall on Parrish Street.
"I am angry," said Mary Fromel. "I am very angry that someone would go to this extent to harm an animal."
Pandora continues her post-surgery recovery at Pittston Animal Hospital, and Dr. Kathio said she's already able to walk, despite the severe injury.
Officials with Whisker's World tell WNEP they along with the SPCA are investigating this incident.

BEIJING (AP) — The co-chairman of HNA Group, a conglomerate that operates China's fourth-largest airline and finance, logistics and other businesses around the world, has died in an accident while on a business trip in France, the company said Wednesday.
Wang Jian, a co-founder of the company, suffered "severe injuries" in a fall in Provence in southern France and died Tuesday at age 57, said an HNA Group statement. It gave no other details.
Launched in 1993 on the southern island of Hainan, HNA expanded into finance, hotels, logistics and other businesses in a multibillion-dollar global acquisition spree.
More recently, HNA has been selling some assets as Chinese regulators tighten lending controls and press companies to rein in debt.
Wang graduated from the Civil Aviation University of China and received an MBA from the Maastricht School of Management in the Netherlands, according to his company.
HNA agreed last year to acquire a hedge fund operated by Anthony Scaramucci, an aide to U.S. President Donald Trump. That never received regulatory approval and the two sides called off the deal in April.
On Thursday's broadcast of CNN's “AC360,” Representative Jim Himes (D-CT) accused Republicans of engaging in a “profoundly unpatriotic” effort to sow doubt in the fairness of the FBI without any evidence.
Himes stated, “[T]his [the House GOP Intel memo] is part of a much larger effort that got kicked off the day after Jim Comey announced to our committee that there was an investigation. … When Devin Nunes made his midnight run to the White House alleging that there had been spying on Trump Tower, and then we get the allegations that Susan Rice and Sam Powers were unmasking improperly. Both of those things turned out to be false. Both of those things exist only to throw dust — sand in the gears of this investigation and to create doubt in the American population that the FBI and specifically the Mueller investigation are happening in an unbiased way. They are happening in an unbiased way. There is zero proof or even evidence that there is political bias in the FBI, but if you say it longs enough and often enough, there will be people who have doubts about it. And it's a profoundly unpatriotic thing to do.”

CEBU Landmasters, Inc. (CLI) will be issuing P5 billion worth of corporate notes this year to partially finance its projects in Cebu and Davao.
In a statement issued Tuesday, local debt watcher Philippine Ratings Services Corp. (PhilRatings) said it has assigned CLI a PRS Aa rating, the second highest in its credit rating scale. This indicates that the issuer's capacity to meet its financial obligations is very strong, while the issuance itself is of high quality and is subject to very low credit risk.
PhilRatings likewise gave the offering a stable outlook, which means that the rating is unlikely to change in the next 12 months.
“PhilRatings shall continuously monitor developments relating to CLI and may change the rating and outlook at any time, should circumstances warrant a change,” the company said in a statement.
CLI is tapping the bond market less than a year after it first listed its shares at the stock exchange last June. The company had then raised P2.9 billion to support its aggressive expansion in the Visayas and Mindanao regions.
Proceeds from the offering will be used to partially finance CLI's projects, which includes the first central business district in Davao City called Davao Matina Business Park, as well as Ming-Mori Technobusiness Park in Minglanilla, Cebu.
The debt watcher cited CLI's sound management and strategy, competitive advantage in the Visayas and Mindanao markets, and the positive economic and industry outlook as some factors for coming up with the credit rating.
CLI continues to be bullish on the Visayas and Mindanao markets, with plans to launch 20 new projects this year. This will bring the total number of developments under CLI's portfolio to 66.
The scheduled project launches are expected to translate to P7 billion in reservation sales for the company. In turn, revenues will likely increase by 35% to P5.3 billion, while net income is projected to climb by 31% to P1.7 billion.
The company is banking on the government's infrastructure project to help spur economic growth outside Metro Manila, given its focus in Visayas and Mindanao.
CLI earlier said that it will be spending P8.8 billion in capital expenditures this year, in a bid to expand in General Santos City, Butuan City, Ormoc City, and Roxas City.
The listed property developer delivered a 66% increase in net income to P1.294 billion in 2017, fueled by a 66% gain in revenues to P3.929 billion for the year.
Shares in CLI added two centavos or 0.44% to close at P4.60 each at the Philippine Stock Exchange on Tuesday. — Arra B. Francia
* Korean IPOs $3.7 bln so far in 2017, world's third-highest
* Pipeline expected to include Jin Air, Kyobo Life, Celltrion
* New rules allow more companies to launch IPOs
* Korean currency, stock gains underscore investors' deal appetite
By Elzio Barreto and Joyce Lee
HONG KONG/SEOUL, May 4 South Korea has emerged as an unusual hot spot for initial public offerings this year, shooting up to the third most-active market in the world despite political upheaval and tensions with its neighbours.
Investors have spent $3.7 billion in South Korea so far in 2017, behind U.S. IPOs of $13.5 billion and Chinese listings of $11.1 billion, Thomson Reuters data shows.
IPOs of $974 million from ING Life Insurance Korea and $2.3 billion from mobile games maker Netmarble Games Corp last week have been the driving force behind the Korean IPO splurge.
The pipeline is set to continue in coming months with budget airline Jin Air Co Ltd, Kyobo Life Insurance and Celltrion Healthcare among those expected to go public.
"Most of the Korean corporates as well as investors are more comfortable with the recent political issues, so that they're ready to do something," said June Won, head of capital market origination Korea at Citigroup, which helped manage the Netmarble IPO.
"Investors are taking it in stride. If you look at the Korean currency, which is getting stronger, and bond trading numbers, all these indicate Korea is quite stable even though there is some noise," he said, referring to Korean tensions.
The impeachment and ousting from office of President Park Geun-hye cleared the way for an election next week and put an end to a political crisis that had lasted for months.
Investors are also seeing through tensions with North Korea as the United States, its allies and China, increase pressure on Pyongyang to rein in its nuclear weapons ambitions. They see conflict as unlikely.
Healthy exports and stronger-than-expected GDP figures for the first quarter have boosted confidence in the economy.
That has translated into stronger financial markets. The won is the second-best performing major Asian currency against the U.S. dollar in 2017, up 6.8 percent. Stocks are up about 9.5 percent and at six-year highs.
South Korea's IPO market this year is more than seven times bigger than at the same time last year. It's ranking is all the more surprising because the global market is also much stronger, with IPOs so far this year of $49.8 billion more than double the year-earlier level.
UP NEXT
ING Life debuts in Seoul on May 11 and Netmarble the following day. Jin Air said last week it wanted to list by the end of 2017, but it did not disclose how much it aims to raise.
Celltrion Healthcare, the marketing affiliate of biosimilar drugs firm Celltrion Inc, plans to raise up to 1 trillion won ($886 million) in an IPO.
Kyobo Life, South Korea's third-largest life insurer by assets, said in March it plans to raise funds to boost its capital, but gave no fundraising target, local media said. ING Life is about a third of the size of Kyobo Life by assets.
Even Hotel Lotte Co Ltd, which shelved a $4.5 billion IPO last year amid an investigation of parent Lotte Group from prosecutors, could revive the listing in 2017.
Bankers said deal activity is also being boosted by new rules introduced at the start of the year that allow high-growth startups yet to be profitable to seek a public listing. Only companies with a profit record were permitted to list previously.
South Korea's largest mobile-commerce company Coupang could be among tech companies set to go public under the new rules, local media reports have said. Repeated calls to a Coupang spokesman went unanswered.
The new rules also put underwriters on the line if newly listed companies tumble, demanding they guarantee that they will buy back the shares if they fall more than 10 percent within three months of listing.
"The new rules more or less let the market decide how to list a company," said Alpha Asset Management fund manager CJ Heo.
"With more companies able to be listed, and a variety of valuation and other techniques, sooner or later IPO advisors will... begin new ways of bookbuilding and listing, which means both new risk and new opportunities for investors in South Korea."

A traffic accident that claimed the life of an Olmitz teenager has prompted Barton County Commissioners to consider action to try and ensure that something like that doesn't happen again. On Tuesday, April 17th, 18-year old Shealee A. Stover of rural Olmitz died when she was struck by a cement truck at Washington Avenue and Northeast 30 road. It appears that the Stover vehicle failed to stop at the stop sign and was struck by the International truck. According to Barton County Operations Director Phil Hathcock, Commissioners Monday talked about the possibility of making the intersection a four way stop.
Phil Hathcock Audio
Hathcock says a study done a few years ago by the Kansas Department of Transportation did not result in a K-DOT recommendation for a four way stop to be being implemented at the intersection. But after last week's accident, it appears the Commission is prepared to make it one now.

The topic was discussed Monday during a study session meaning that the board could not vote on any resolution at that time. It's expected the topic will be on the agenda when Commissioners meet again in two weeks.
LONDON, April 28 Japanese Prime Minister pledged on Friday to face down threats to international order from North Korea and building tensions over the South China Sea by working with British Prime Minister Theresa May.
In a visit to May's official residence, Abe said that Britain was Japan's number one ally in Europe, and that they would work together in face of destabilisation from North Korea's missile programme and a dispute with China in the South China Sea.
"The world is faced with serious threats to the international order... including those posed by the nuclear and missile development of North Korea, and the situation in the eastern South China Sea," Abe said.
"It is extremely significant that the Prime Minister and I agreed that the UK and Japan should closely co-operate on a global scale in the face of this situation." (Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge, writing by Alistair Smout; editing by Michael Holden)
Alyssa Valdez's aces pave the way for the Philippines to silence 2015 SEA Games silver medalist Vietnam
Published 8:07 PM, August 14, 2017
MANILA, Philippines – After two straight losses, the Philippines already had enough.
The women's national volleyball team shone bright behind Alyssa Valdez's clutch aces to secure a victory against Vietnam, 27-25, 26-24, 17-25, 25-23, in the 9th Asian Senior Women's Volleyball Championship on Monday, August 14, at the Alonte Sports Arena.
With just a few days to go before the 29th Southeast Asian Games, the Philippines put on a show to shock 2015 SEA Games silver medalist Vietnam as they improved to a 2-2 record.
After trailing by as much as 6 points, the Philippines went on a 4-0 run led by Maika Ortiz's stonewall blocks to tie the game at 24-all, while Valdez broke an electrifying rally followed by a service ace to clinch the first set.
Jaja Santiago stepped on the gas pedal for a 19-17 advantage, but Vietnam answered with attacks of their own to force a 21-24 lead.
While Santiago continued to be efficient, Valdez unleashed more of her lethal attacks to drop a 5-0 bomb and seal the second set with an ace.
The Vietnamese then mounted attacks, securing an early 16-7 lead in the 3rd set to snatch it away.
But the Philippines, through collective efforts from Kim Fajardo, Jovelyn Gonzaga and Santiago, managed to pull off the upset. Despite Vietnam trimming the lead to two markers, 24-22, the Philippines intensified its defense and gave Valdez a good set to power a killer attack.

Many questions were raised by last week following the surprise announcement that police were seeking to life the immunity of ANO leader Babiš and the second placed party leader, Jaroslav Faltýnek, over the accusations that European Union funds were fraudulently used for the Stork's Nest development, an hotel and recreation centre linked to Babiš' massive agro-chemical firm Agrofert.
While the parliamentary committee dealing with such matters is likely to meet at the end of this week, the lower house will not be able to deal with the police request until the start of September when the election campaign is expected to start in earnest.
Will ANO leader Babiš take a backseat in the election campaign as a result of the police move? Will he stand down as leader temporarily? And would he be eligible to become prime minister if he stayed the campaign course and emerged the election winner?
The response to the last question was answered over the weekend by president Zeman's spokesman, Jiří Ovčáček. He made clear in comments to the news server Aktualne.cz that a possible police investigation overshadowing the ANO leader would not stand in the way of the head of state tasking Babiš with forming a government and becoming prime minister even if he had been charged with fraud.
To put it bluntly, Ovčáček spelled out that October's election winner will be invited to become prime minister. He added that he expected the president to be subject to a post election campaign for Babiš to be excluded from being prime minister because of the charges that might be hanging over him.
If the head of state's comments appear to be run of the mill, president Zeman's previous words and actions cast a somewhat different light on them. Four years ago in June 2013 president Zeman took a very different standpoint when police were at the centre of the scandal that erupted around the then Civic Democrat leader and prime minister Petr Nečas.
Nečas stood down as party leader and prime minister over the scandal over alleged abuse of power, which directly affected him and other members of the party.
In the political chaos that followed President Zeman brushed off the offer of replacement Civic Democrat leader Miroslava Němcová to form a government although she maintained she could muster enough support for a parliamentary majority. Zeman argued that some of the new ministers could end up in custody. Instead, Zeman appointed a caretaker government to run the country until early elections in October.
The president's latest magnanimous standpoint is one point. Whether party leaders will share the same view if the ANO leader needs to seek support outside his party following an election win is another matter.

The Vatican has once more waded into the uncharted waters of environmental protection, urging nations to practice “multilateral governance” in order to combat the evils of rising sea levels and the loss of coral reefs.
Writing on behalf of Pope Francis, Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin addressed the Fourth International Conference on Our Ocean, an Ocean for Life, encouraging participants to abandon “cynical or indifferent ways of acting” and to become fully engaged in care for the oceans “as part of an integrated vision of human development.”

We cannot “remain indifferent before the loss of coral reefs, essential places for the survival of marine biodiversity and the health of the oceans,” he wrote, “as we witness a marvellous marine world being transformed into an underwater cemetery, bereft of colour and life.”
Care for creation is a concrete way of honoring the “covenant between humanity and the environment,” Parolin wrote, which requires ongoing education, training and the contemplation of the grandeur of the created world.
The health of the oceans is an imperative for Christian action, the Cardinal suggested, requiring awareness as well as commitment.
The welfare of “countless men and women” is directly affected by human trafficking, slave labour and the “inhumane working conditions associated with the fishing industry and commercial shipping,” the Cardinal wrote, as well as “the situation of islands threatened by rising sea levels.”
The best way to address these critical issues is through “multilateral governance aimed at the pursuit of the common good and equipped to operate at the global and regional levels,” Parolin said, since the oceans “are the common heritage of the human family.”
“We cannot pretend to ignore the problems of ocean pollution resulting, for example, from plastic and microplastics that enter the food chain and cause grave consequences for the health of marine and human life,” he said.
Since the beginning of his pontificate in 2013, Pope Francis has been a vocal advocate of clean, renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions. His groundbreaking 2015 encyclical letter, Laudato Si, on care for the environment was the first teaching letter of its sort in the history of the Catholic Church.
In that text, Francis wrote of an “urgent need” to take steps leading to the substitution of fossil fuels with alternative energy sources.
“Carbon dioxide pollution increases the acidification of the oceans and compromises the marine food chain,” the pontiff asserted. “If present trends continue, this century may well witness extraordinary climate change and an unprecedented destruction of ecosystems, with serious consequences for all of us.”
“A rise in the sea level, for example, can create extremely serious situations, if we consider that a quarter of the world's population lives on the coast or nearby, and that the majority of our megacities are situated in coastal areas,” he said.
In an address to members of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences (PAS) last November, Pope Francis called climate change skeptics to an “ecological conversion” capable of supporting and promoting sustainable development.
“Never before has there been such a clear need for science to be at the service of a new global ecological equilibrium,” Francis told his hearers while painting a picture of a world on the verge of “ecological collapse” and a “consequent increase of poverty and social exclusion.”
At the same time, Francis has insisted that when it comes to climate change he is encouraging debate rather than trying to impose his own understanding of environmental concerns.
“On many concrete questions,” he wrote in Laudato Si, “the Church has no reason to offer a definitive opinion; she knows that honest debate must be encouraged among experts, while respecting divergent views.”
“Here I would state once more that the Church does not presume to settle scientific questions or to replace politics,” Francis said. “But I am concerned to encourage an honest and open debate so that particular interests or ideologies will not prejudice the common good.”
Francis also said it is necessary to create “a social debate” in which of those involved in any way can explain their problems and “have access to adequate and reliable information in order to make decisions for the common good,” something rarely seen in contemporary discussions of climate change that tend to exclude those with divergent views.

Claire's has filed for bankruptcy. The hub for ear piercings at malls across America are the latest retailer to succumb to its massive pile of debt.
Claire's, which says it has pierced more than 100 million ears around the world, reached a restructuring agreement with its creditors. In a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing on Monday, Claire's said it will reduce its debt by $1.9 billion. It held $2.1 billion in debt at the end of 2017.
The company will continue to operate its approximately 1,600 Claire's and Icing brand stores in the United States during the bankruptcy process and expects to complete it by September. International stores are not part of the restructuring agreement.
"This transaction substantially reduces the debt on our balance sheet," Claire's CEO Ron Marshall said in a statement. "We will complete this process as a healthier, more profitable company." Marshall came from now-defunct bookstore chain Borders.
Claire's struggles stem from a deal it struck more than a decade ago that left it burdened with debt.
In 2007, Apollo Management, a private equity firm, bought Claire's for $3.1 billion and took the company private in what's known as a leveraged buyout.
Claire's could never escape its debt load. As traffic slowed to its brick-and-mortar stores, shoppers moved to digital channels and fast fashion chains such as H&M, Zara and Forever 21 chipped away at sales.
Claire's joins a long line of retailers that have filed for bankruptcy in recent years, including Toys "R" Us, Payless Shoes, Gymboree, Rue21, The Limited and RadioShack.
Toys "R" Us, another company left deep in debt from a leveraged buyout, said last week that it was liquidating its 735 stores in the United States.
Claire's believes a lighter balance sheet will help it avoid Toys "R" Us' fate and still remain a "Girl's Best Friend." And the company says its business is Amazon-proof because you can't pierce your ears online.
STILLWATER, Okla. — Oklahoma State avenged its loss to Alabama from four years ago while blasting the Crimson Tide to win the NCAA men's golf championship on its home course Wednesday.
Vitkor Hovland never trailed in the opening match against Lee Hodges in a 4-and-3 victory. Zach Bouchou won five straight holes, holing out a bunker shot on his way to an 8-and-7 victory over Jonathan Hardee.
Matthew Wolff delivered the clinching point, a 4-and-3 victory over Davis Riley, and the celebration was on at Karsten Creek Golf Club.
The Cowboys had the home crowd on their side, and they gave their orange-clad fans plenty to cheer.
Oklahoma State won its 11th NCAA title, second only to Houston's 16. Its previous championship was in 2006 when it was stroke play. Since switching to match play in 2009, the Cowboys have been runner-up twice.
One of those years was to Alabama in 2014 at Prairie Dunes in Kansas, about a three-hour drive north of Stillwater. Alabama won big for back-to-back titles.
The Tide advanced to the championship match by sweeping the five matches against Duke in the semifinals. Alabama fell behind big in three matches against Oklahoma State, and trailed in all five matches when Wolff clinched it.
The final score was 3-2 because the other two matches, which no longer mattered, ended where they were.

Friday on CNN's “The Situation Room,” network counterterrorism analyst Phil Mudd warned the FBI was going to push back against President Donald Trump's release of the House Intelligence Committee memo and further suggestions of corruption existing within that agency.
Mudd noted the long-running operation of the FBI versus Trump's 13 months as president and noted the FBI was vowing “to win.”

YEKATERINBURG, Russia A Russian state prosecutor asked a court to jail a blogger who played Pokémon Go inside a church for three-and-a-half years on Friday, saying he was guilty of inciting religious hatred, a court employee told Reuters by phone.
Ruslan Sokolovsky, 22, a popular blogger, last August posted a video online of himself playing Pokémon on his mobile phone inside a church in Yekaterinburg built on the spot where the last Russian tsar and his family were killed in 1918.
In the video, which contains strong language mocking Christianity, Sokolovsky likens Jesus Christ to a Pokémon character and says he had decided to play the popular game inside the church because he had seen a news report saying people who did so could be fined or jailed.
Soon after the video appeared, state prosecutors accused Sokolovsky of inciting religious hatred, the same charge used to successfully prosecute the Pussy Riot punk band in 2012 when they staged a cathedral protest against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"I believe that there is no reason to exempt the defendant from liability," the prosecutor told the court on Friday, the TASS news agency reported. "There is also no reason to sentence him to a fine ... I request that the court sentence him to 3.5 years in a penal colony."
A suspended sentence would create a dangerous impression of impunity, the prosecutor added.
Sokolovsky, who was previously confined to a pre-trial detention centre, is currently under house arrest.
"I'm in shock," Sokolovsky told the court after listening to the prosecutor, video footage of the proceedings showed.
"I have been in jail, I was there for three months, and it is the doorway to hell.
“I do not consider myself an extremist, maybe I'm an idiot, but not in any way an extremist.”
Leonid Volkov, a prominent opposition activist, condemned the prosecutor's stance on social media, saying the sentence requested was far too harsh.
"It's some kind of hell. The full-on inquisition, the middle ages and (George Orwell's) 1984 rolled into one."
The court is expected to issue a verdict on May 11.

Q: The last film you wrote was "The Divorce" in 2003. What about "Call Me by Your Name" made you want to write the film?
A: One thing about it is the story was set in Italy. I love Italy and go there all the time. The idea of working in Italy was very attractive to me, and I liked the story. I had done another film a bit like that, which was "Maurice," which I had also written.
Q: In adapting the book, what liberties did you take with the story?
A: I pretty much wanted to follow the story, but up to a point. There were two things I didn't want to do. The entire (third part) has to do with a trip the two boys take to Rome before Oliver is about to leave to go back to America. They go to a big book party and meet people and have a wonderful last fling. That took up like a fourth of the book. I thought, well, we can't really have a sequence like this coming at the end of a film; no one's going to sit through all of that. So the boys need to take a trip and go off together but not to this whole thing.
In the book, it's told from the point of view of a young man now age 40 looking back and remembering the whole thing. He's telling his story in a narrative. At the end of it, they meet up again in Italy and Elio thinks that they could get back together, but they can't. I didn't think that was a way to end the film. I thought it would be a downer to do that.
Q: While most people love the film, some have highlighted a "coyness" around the depictions of intimacy between the two main characters. This is in slight contrast to a number of your films where male nudity, for example, is kind of matter-of-fact.
A: With "A Room With a View," in the book and film, three young Englishmen go to have a swim in the pond. They take off all their clothes and jump in the water — one of them is a reverend. They're splashing in the water and wrestling and whooping like Englishmen like to do and who should come down the path but two proper English ladies and they are ambushed by these three nudes. It's a comical scene ... it had to be like that and I wasn't going to change that. My attitude about that was whatever is seen and what is not seen is not seen, so let's shoot.
Q: Was there any frontal nudity written into the script?
A: Well, it was all implied. They get undressed before they have their first night together. But there's plenty of nudity in that scene as it exists.
Q: You're known for the 1987 film "Maurice," which is credited with redefining queer cinema because it had a happy ending. How would you evaluate the changes over time regarding LGBTQ representation?
A: There are plenty of stories in that period from different countries about love between two women or two men. Generally, we're more relaxed about that now than people were even in the '80s. Earlier, of course, they weren't relaxed at all. But just about anything goes now.
We've had gay characters in many of our (Merchant Ivory) films. We made a short film with James Mason in which he plays a gay man some time ago. It's one of our best films, only an hour long. It's an Indian film called "Autobiography of a Princess." When we tried to sell it to the BBC, the guy who was buying it said he refused to show it (and that) he personally felt so sorry for James Mason being in such a film. That was 1976. It was turned down for immorality and expressions of distaste.
Ten years later, we're making "Maurice" and there (wasn't) a peep out of anyone. Everyone liked it and I knew we had come to a place where you could make a film about same-sex romance and nobody's going to charge you with obscenity, even if it had a happy ending.
Q: Why do you think "Call Me by Your Name" is doing so well with audiences and critics alike?
A: I think every adult who sees the film or reads the book has gone through the splendours and terrors of first love, what that brings with it, the good and the bad. Everybody can identify with that. For some people, looking back it's a marvellous experience. For others, it's a terrifying one.

Three wildfires are currently burning in Glacier National Park. (Parks Canada)
With the fire season winding down in the mountains, Parks Canada continues to monitor three wildfires in Glacier National Park.
The Mountain Creek, Prairie Hill and Incomappleux fires are “still smouldering in some area” said a Parks Canada press release, but “pose no rick to people or assets.”
The Mountain Creek fire is about 1944 hectares in size, while the Prairie Hill wildfire is about 3420 hectares and the Incomappleux wildfire is 780 hectares.
The Beaver Valley trails and area remains closed.
Of the 29 wildfires that the Mount Revelstoke and Glacier National Parks fire management team responded to this summer, 22 were lightning-causes and seven were illegal campfires.
Crews are currently clearing trees and brush in Mount Revelstoke National Park in preparation for a prescribed burn. The Parkway Bend prescribed burn is supposed to “create a landscape level fuel break limiting the potential spread of wildfire on the front face of Mount Revelstoke,” said the release.
Tree and brush clearing is also taking place lower on the mountain for wildfire risk reduction.

× Vogel, Fairfax agrees on 1 issue – but disagree on most – in Lt. Gov. debate
RICHMOND, Va. — Virginia Lieutenant Governor candidates Sen. Jill Vogel and Justin Fairfax squared off in a heated debate Thursday night at the University of Richmond School of Law. The candidates discussed hot-button issues such as gun control, energy, and healthcare in what would be their second and final meeting before the Nov. 7 election.
Fairfax, the Democratic candidate, attacked his Republican opponent for her allegiance with President Donald Trump, while Vogel criticized Fairfax for his lack of experience and liberal ideologies.
The debate began where most of America's collective mind rests — the Sunday-night shooting in Las Vegas that left more than 50 people dead and at least 500 injured.
Vogel, while denouncing the Las Vegas shooting suspect, stood by her support of the Second Amendment and argued that guns are a crucial means of self-defense for many Virginians.
“I'm not running for lieutenant governor to take anybody's rights away,” Vogel said. “If you restrict people's gun rights, it does violate the Constitution.”
Fairfax was quick to point out Vogel's A+ rating with the National Rifle Association and criticized her strict loyalty to the Second Amendment — something Fairfax said would put Virginian lives in danger.
“Sen. Vogel thinks there should be no restrictions on any type of weapon,” Fairfax said. “She said we need to find out whether or not the weapons (the Las Vegas suspect) used were legal; my point is he was able to fire 600 rounds every couple minutes. Whether or not that's legal today, it shouldn't be.”
The discussion then shifted toward fiscal topics like minimum wage and infrastructure before tensions raised during a discussion on abortion. During that discussion, Fairfax brought up a 2012 bill sponsored by Vogel that would have required women getting abortions to submit an ultrasound. Vogel later pulled the bill from consideration.
Vogel responded by questioning whether Fairfax, who has never held elected public office, was informed enough to “talk intelligently” about issues surrounding the campaign.
“You just saw a perfect example of the way Senator Vogel engages in elections,” Fairfax responded. “She said that I am not intelligent enough to understand a piece of legislation…and so what we can expect is for Senator Vogel to keep going in the gutter.”
Vogel claimed Fairfax was twisting her words and that her opponent was issuing personal attacks.
“I did not question his intelligence,” Vogel said. “I questioned how informed he is. I have no doubt Justin Fairfax is very intelligent. In fact he's an incredibly nice person. I enjoy actually being on the trail with him. But I will question how informed he is on many of these issues and that is why I take the position that he has taken very extreme positions that are incredibly hard for him to defend.”
Tensions remained high as the two candidates discussed what each referred to as the most important topic of next month's election — healthcare.
Fairfax, a staunch supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare-for-all plan, stood firmly in his belief that all Virginians should have effective, affordable healthcare and argued for the state to accept Medicaid expansion.
“What I believe and what we're fighting for is that everyone should have access to high-quality healthcare,” he said. “We believe that that should be a right and not a privilege.”
Vogel countered, arguing the cost of such expansion would result in a massive budgetary burden for Virginia. She added that her legislative experience would help her bridge the gap between party lines so that the two sides could come to a mutual agreement that is in Virginians' best interests.
“I have Democrats who support me; I have Independents who support me,” Vogel said. “I have friends on both sides of the aisle who all work with me and all talk about health policy all the time. I can't think of where I've had any discussions with anybody who thinks having government-run healthcare is a solution.”
The rest of the evening consisted of debates on energy, abortions and judicial appointments — all topics where the two candidates continued to fall short of seeing eye-to-eye.
The sole issue where Vogel and Fairfax were able to find common ground was in their discussion of Title IX. Vogel was quick to voice her support for victims of sexual assault without specifically denouncing the recent comments of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.
“I am not in favor of doing anything that walks us back in terms of protecting victims,” Vogel said. “Doing everything we can to protect victims has to be our highest priority.”
Fairfax used this as another opportunity to attack Vogel's support of the president and his often-divisive policies.
“This really goes back to whether or not we're going to have leaders in the Commonwealth of Virginia who are willing to stand up to Donald Trump and his administration when they are taking us down a dark political path,” he said. “We know that Sen. Vogel will not stand up to Donald Trump.”
The night concluded with each candidates' closing remarks, where they pled their case to Virginia's voters on why they believe they deserve to be the commonwealth's 41st lieutenant governor.
Vogel stood behind her experience within the Virginia legislature as evidence to her ability to lead the state as lieutenant governor.
“I have worked on these issues for 10 years,” she said. “Leveraging the position of lieutenant governor — strong, statewide leadership with a vision — is what it takes to actually get people on both sides of the aisle to agree to work together.”
Fairfax used his closing remarks to denounce Vogel's “politics of destruction” while promoting what he claimed was a positive vision for Virginia's future.
“We can do the things that allow the great American story to be possible,” he said. “It's a story that I'm passionate about and it's one that I want us all to live.”
With less than a month left until Election Day, several notable polls around the state show Fairfax leading Vogel by margins as thin as a single point, making Thursday's debate a crucial moment in each candidate's hopes for victory in November.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Devin Mitchell scored a career-high 38 points to lead Georgia State to its ninth straight Sun Belt Conference victory, an 81-51 thrashing of Little Rock on Saturday night.
The Panthers ran away with this one in the second half in preparation for their showdown with league-leader Louisiana on Thursday. Georgia State (18-6, 9-2) will host the Ragin' Cajuns, who have won 10 straight and remain undefeated in conference play.
Georgia State started its current win streak by beating Little Rock in Atlanta 73-64 last month.
Mitchell nailed a career-best 10 of 13 from beyond the arc while grabbing six rebounds and dishing out four assists. D'Marcus Simonds added 12 points with eight assists, and Jordan Session chipped in 11 points with nine rebounds and two blocks.
​The district is set to benefit from a £600,000 boost to help deliver traffic improvement and maintenance projects.
Wakefield Council has successfully secured the funding from the Government's National Productivity Investment Fund (NPIF), which will provide much needed extra resources to develop its transport networks.
​Coun Matthew Morley, Cabinet Member for Transportation and Highways at Wakefield Council, said: “It's great news that we have secured this new funding. It will make a real difference by benefiting local communities and supporting improvements to the district's overall transport network.”
The funds will be spent on a variety of schemes to improve journey times across the district including the management of traffic signal junctions across the district, the Pontefract to Knottingley Connect cycle scheme, and the Sharleston to Streethouse footpath.
The money will also be used to fund a new pedestrian crossing on the A650 dual carriageway, improvements on the Pontefract corridor junction and a road resurfacing programme from Holywell Lane to Fryston.

The day after former Seahawk and current Raider, Marshawn Lynch, sat on the bench in protest during the playing of the national anthem. Current Seahawk Bennett followed suit on Sunday night, by sitting during the anthem before the Seahawks game against the Chargers at StubHub Center:

Bennett has been an outspoken supporter of Colin Kaepernick. According to ESPN, Bennett, “…spent time with Colin Kaepernick during the offseason and wore a T-shirt supporting Kaepernick's “Know Your Rights” camp during a spring news conference.”
Bennett has also spoken about what he thinks it would take, for a team to take a shot on Colin Kaepernick: “It's going to take the organization. I think the players have spoken up enough. I think the media has spoken up. It just takes the ownership for someone to say we want this guy in our locker room. I think a lot of teams, like we said before, were really affected by what he did and what he did this year. It wasn't criminal.
“There's been guys who have criminal records, guys who have been accused of murder, guys who have been accused of rape and domestic violence who are still in the NFL. It's crazy to see this guy not have an opportunity in the NFL. It's just weird. I mean, some quarterbacks, as we all know, shouldn't be playing, but they are, and this guy is sitting on the side. We all know why. It's just hard to fathom that he's not having a job this year.”
Bennett has also said he believes the reaction to the Kaepernick protest showed the racial divide between NFL players, and the fans: “I think the league is built on middle America, and most of the middle of America is predominantly a white crowd. That's just the truth of it. I think race is not something that the NFL wants to be a part of or get behind. But the league is predominantly African-American.
“So the issue that he's dealing with is what we're all dealing with. We all come from the inner city or we've been a part of communities where we felt like we've been judged because of the color of our skin or who we like or if a woman — any issue to deal with. We've all been dealing with it with someone in our family.”
0 Man accused of making SXSW bomb threat vowed to 'watch everyone dies,' affidavit says
AUSTIN, Texas - A man accused of threatening to bomb The Roots' show during South by Southwest last weekend told a producer via email that he would “watch everyone dies,” according to court documents.

Trevor Weldon Ingram, 26, faces a charge of a making a terroristic threat, a third-degree felony punishable by two to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000.
An arrest affidavit made public on Monday said the producer called police after receiving two emails from a Gmail account belonging to “t9ingram” just after 3 p.m. Saturday.
Man accused of making SXSW bomb threat vowed to ‘watch everyone dies,' affidavit says https://t.co/FCTa1O4h4X pic.twitter.com/SNGlKIrMaz — Austin Statesman (@statesman) March 19, 2018
The first email said, “(Expletive) u I'm gonna pant a bomb and watch everyone die,” misspelling the word “plant.”
The second email said only “BOMB,” the affidavit said.
Austin police sent its bomb squad out to the Fair Market Venue, where the concert was scheduled, and used bomb-sniffing dogs to sweep the area. Neither Austin police dogs nor Travis County Sheriff's Office dogs found any sign of an explosive device.
Still, event promoters canceled the event, saying it was done out of an abundance of caution.
Investigators searched the Texas Department of Public Safety's driver's license database and identified Ingram as the suspect.
He was the registered account holder of the Gmail account and had already been investigated by Austin police in February for making threats against eBay employees from the same email address, according to authorities.
The threats began on Feb. 16 and included messages like “I hope you die in a horrible car crash,” “(Expletive) you. You will die slow,” and “I have 10k on everyone's head in the Austin office,” the affidavit said.

The United States and Belarus will meet in the Fed Cup final in November after winning their respective semi-finals on Sunday.
In Tampa Bay, Florida, the U.S. edged the Czech Republic 3-2, winning the deciding doubles rubber before a raucous crowd on the outdoor green clay.
World number 24 CoCo Vandeweghe was the heroine for the Americans, winning her singles match on Sunday before returning a couple of hours later to team up with Bethanie Mattek-Sands for an emphatic 6-2 6-3 win over Kristyna Pliskova and Katerina Siniakova.
Vandeweghe appropriately clinched the victory on serve, finishing the weekend a perfect 3-0 and sending the Americans through to the final for the first time since 2010.
The loss by the second-string Czech team, missing several top players, ended any hopes of a fourth title for the three-time defending champions.
In Minsk, Belarus won both Sunday singles to take an insurmountable 3-1 lead against Switzerland before the visitors won the dead doubles rubber.
Aryna Sabalenka sent Belarus into the final when she beat Viktorija Golubic 6-3 2-6 6-4, after teammate Aliaksandra Sasnovich had beaten Timea Bacsinszky 6-2 7-6(2).
The U.S. has not won the Fed Cup since 2000, while it will be the first final for Belarus, who will host the Nov. 11-12 decider.

Buddhist monk Ashin Wirathu looks on as he attends a convention held by the Bodu Bala Sena (Buddhist Power Force, BBS) in Colombo September 28, 2014. REUTERS/Dinuka Liyanawatte/File Photo
YANGON A Myanmar Buddhist monk renowned for his anti-Muslim sermons travelled to Rakhine State on Wednesday, an official said, sparking concern over religious tension in the region, where more than one million Rohingya Muslims live.
Wirathu - who once called himself the "Burmese bin Laden" - would visit the Muslim-majority northern part of the western state, said Police Colonel Nyan Win Oo of Maungdaw district police.
Police would provide security for the monk, Nyan Win Oo said, adding he was unaware of the reason for Wirathu's visit.
"He will go to ethnic villages and will be here for two or three days," he said, referring to settlements where non-Muslims live.
The Rohingya are not considered one of Myanmar's indigenous ethnic groups and are denied citizenship. They are instead regarded as illegal immigrants from neighbouring Bangladesh.
An estimated 75,000 Rohingya fled across the border to Bangladesh from the Maungdaw area during a recent crackdown by Myanmar security forces in response to militant attacks on border posts.
The insurgents - who say they are fighting for Rohingya rights - killed nine policemen on Oct. 9, igniting the biggest crisis of national leader Aung San Suu Kyi's first year in power.
Soldiers and police stand accused of killings and gang rapes during the counterinsurgency operation that followed.
Several thousand non-Muslims, including members of the Buddhist Rakhine ethnic group, were also displaced by the unrest.
'SPREADS HATE'
Wirathu, once jailed by Myanmar's former military regime, rose to prominence after the country began a transition to democracy in 2011, uncorking long-suppressed ethnic and religious tensions.
Clashes between Rohingya and Rakhine Buddhists in 2012 displaced about 140,000 people, mostly from the Muslim minority.
As violence and hate speech against Muslims spread to other parts of the country - where Muslims who are not Rohingya live among the Buddhist majority - Wirathu delivered sermons and preached on Facebook, urging Buddhists to boycott Muslim business and shun interfaith marriages.
He has continued to travel around the country despite Myanmar's highest religious authority in March barring him from preaching. Wirathu reacted to his silencing by posting online photographs of himself with his mouth taped over.
Although the recent conflict in northern Rakhine has abated in recent weeks, tensions remain high and Rohingya residents told Reuters late last month they feared travelling beyond their villages in case they encounter military patrols.
A Muslim community leader in northern Rakhine told Reuters that after hearing of Wirathu's visit, elders met and decided to issue a warning through religious networks.
“We are concerned about his trip because he always spreads hate of Muslims," said the leader, who declined to be identified for fear of reprisals.
"We informed our people to avoid any confrontation in their communication with non-Muslim people, and to be aware and not to panic."

TERRY GROSS, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. For a few months in 1968, jazz pianist Bill Evans led a trio with Jack DeJohnette on drums and Eddie Gomez on bass. They spent five weeks in Europe. A newly unearthed concert recording catches them live in a Dutch radio studio. Jazz critic Kevin Whitehead has a review.
(SOUNDBITE OF BILL EVANS' "ALFIE")
KEVIN WHITEHEAD, BYLINE: The Bill Evans Trio in 1968, whispering Burt Bacharach's "Alfie." Evans is getting some renewed attention lately. That's partly due to Bruce Spiegel's documentary "Bill Evans: Time Remembered," a detailed dive into his complicated life. Like other jazz docs, it left me wishing for more uninterrupted music. But there are plenty of Evans records for that. Those now include a previously unissued gem from 1968, "Another Time: The Hilversum Concert." Evans' trio plays with spontaneity and grace and is always swinging some kind of way.
(SOUNDBITE OF BILL EVANS' "YOU'RE GONNA HEAR FROM ME")
WIHTEHEAD: Bill Evans is best remembered for bringing Euro-romantic harmony and gauzy atmospherics to jazz piano, as on Miles Davis' "Kind Of Blue." But Evans came up digging the great bebop pianist whose right hand sang improvised melodies like a saxophone. Eddie Gomez, his bassist for a couple of years already, could walk behind him or step up to play counterpoint. Jack DeJohnette might use his brushes to slap out running commentary or goose them along.
(SOUNDBITE OF BILL EVANS' "VERY EARLY")
WIHTEHEAD: As a pianist himself, Jack DeJohnette knows how the overtones of cymbals and drums can interfere with piano and how to avoid that. He's a master of cymbal textures, knows all the sounds they can make depending on where and how hard you strike them and what with. DeJohnette brings a playful quality to this sober trio. On Evans' break tune "Five," drums play an odd game of peekaboo before settling down to a serious swing.
(SOUNDBITE OF BILL EVANS' "FIVE")
WIHTEHEAD: Bill Evans had worked with independent-minded bass virtuosos before Eddie Gomez. But none had more lasting influence. During his years with Evans, Gomez set the style for piano trio bass solos. Soon, dozens of bassists were scooting up the neck to pluck fast melodies in the cello range.
(SOUNDBITE OF BILL EVANS' "EMILY")
WIHTEHEAD: After this 1968 concert, Eddie Gomez would go on to play with Bill Evans for another nine years. That says it all about their compatibility. Good as Jack DeJohnette sounded with them, three months later, he was gone. By the end of the year, he'd record his first album as leader and start playing with Miles Davis. A decade later, DeJohnette would draft Eddie Gomez into a new quartet. And they'd also reunite behind other leaders. Bill Evans continued on with trios until his death in 1980. He led some very good ones. This was one of his best.

GROSS: Kevin Whitehead writes for Point of Departure and TONEAudio and is the author of "Why Jazz?" He reviewed the previously unissued recording "Another Time: The Hilversum Concert" by the Bill Evans Trio, recorded in 1968. It's on vinyl now and will be available on CD and download September 1. Tomorrow on FRESH AIR, my guest will be Max Brooks, author of "The Zombie Survival Guide," "World war Z" and a new novelization of the video game "Minecraft." His zombie books are his way of dealing with fears he grew up with, like the AIDS epidemic, earthquakes, war. He now works with the military on preparedness training.

Spanish stocks - Factors to watch on Thursday
The following Spanish stocks may be affected by newspaper reports and other factors on Thursday. Reuters has not verified the newspaper reports, and cannot vouch for their accuracy:
DOUGLAS COUNTY — Law enforcement authorities are investigating the death of three people including a 3-year-old girl.
Just after 1:30p.m. Sunday, deputies responded to report of a shooting in the driveway of a home in the 1000 Block of E900 Road southwest of Lawrence, according to a media release.
Upon arrival, deputies found a 36-year-old woman with several gunshot wounds. She died at the scene. She was not affiliated with the residence, according to the sheriff's department.
Authorities later found the woman's vehicle in the parking area at Baker Wetlands south of 31st and Haskell Avenue. A 41-year-old man and 3-year-old girl were found dead in the wetlands not far from the vehicle. Authorities have not determined how they died.
Authorities believe the man shot the woman and the child is their daughter and no other individuals were involved. Names of the victims were not released.
Deals of the day-Mergers and acquisitions
June 14 The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 2000 GMT on Wednesday:
Due to limited salary cap space, the Pittsburgh Steelers have been as quiet as any team on the free agent market. However, despite that notion, many fans of the Steel Curtain have been clamoring for Pittsburgh to spend what little money they have on a player to fill the team's void at inside linebacker or safety.
While many of the top ILB's on the market have already signed for overpriced deals, there are still plenty of quality safeties available for Steelers general manager Kevin Colbert to snatch up, including Morgan Burnett, Tre Boston, and Kenny Vaccaro.
Tim Benz believes while although the signing of LB Jon Bostic remains underwhelming now, the Steelers may be able to make a splash in their secondary with what could be a shrinking price on the top available safeties.
March 31 Rafa Nadal rolled by unseeded Italian Fabio Fognini 6-1 7-5 on Friday to reach his fifth Miami Open final and a potential rematch of the Australian Open decider with Roger Federer.
The fifth-seeded Spaniard, with a display of powerful serving and opportunistic returns, did not face a break point against Fognini and put his opponent's serve under pressure throughout the 90-minute match.
Nadal raced through the first set in 26 minutes, losing only four points on serve while Fognini made 14 unforced errors.
The Italian came to life in the second set, including a stretch where he erased five break points during his first two service games.
But at 5-5, just when it looked as if Fognini might force a decisive third set, he double faulted and Nadal got his break before sealing the match four points later.
Nadal, who has never who won the Miami title, will face the winner of Friday's second semi-final between twice champion Federer, the fourth seed, and the 12th-seeded Australian Nick Kyrgios.
Federer made a stunning return from a six-month injury layoff to win the Australian Open in January, and also beat Nadal in the last 16 at Indian Wells en route to winning a record-tying fifth title there. (Reporting by Frank Pingue; Editing by Ken Ferris)

For nearly two months, American International Group Inc (AIG.N) has planned to replace its chief executive but a successor has yet to be named, creating a void that has stoked investor concerns about the insurance company's future.
Indeed, analysts and investors say they want to know more about the succession plans of AIG, which reports its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday.
Chief Executive Officer Peter Hancock said on March 9 he would depart once the board found a replacement, citing a lack of confidence among directors and investors.
But AIG has said little about the board's progress since then.
Chairman Douglas Steenland has said AIG's board remains committed to the existing turnaround effort.
"The board and management team believe strongly that we are on the right strategic path," he said in a letter to shareholders last month.
Nonetheless, analysts doubt that a new chief executive would carry out Hancock's strategy.
"We need to know" about the impending choice of CEO, said Sandler O'Neill analyst Paul Newsome. "The lack of a CEO puts the strategy for the company completely in play. There's a very large chance that with a different CEO, you are going to have a change in the strategy, despite what the board says."
An AIG spokeswoman declined to comment.
UNEXPECTED LOSS
Hancock's resignation plans were announced shortly after AIG reported an unexpectedly deep loss on Feb. 14, after the company underestimated the value of claims it would have to pay for a variety of insurance products.
Wall Street analysts are forecasting brighter results when AIG reports this week. They expect $1.1 billion in quarterly profit, or $1.08 per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters data, a 37 percent increase from a year earlier.
"The bad fourth quarter sets them up for a better start to this year," said Andrew Kohl, a portfolio manager at Alpine Woods Capital, who owns about 4,000 AIG shares in the financial services fund he oversees.
Kohl, who sold some AIG stock in January as the insurer's financial difficulties mounted, started to wade back in following media reports that Brian Duperreault, the current head of Hamilton Insurance Group Ltd, was among those being considered as AIG's new CEO.
An AIG spokesman said the company does not comment on speculation or rumor.
Several of AIG's largest investors, including Capital Research Global Investors, The Vanguard Group and State Street Global Advisors, would not comment for this story.
But some, including funds overseen by American Funds, T. Rowe Price, FFAmerican Beacon and Invesco, have been buying AIG shares in recent weeks, according to data provided by Lipper.
Even so, as of Monday's close, the stock was down 2.9 percent since Hancock announced his planned departure. In the year to date, AIG shares have dropped 5.7 percent compared with a 6.7 percent rise in the benchmark S&P 500 stock index.
YEARS OF TROUBLE
Hancock's troubles began in 2015, when billionaire activists Carl Icahn and John Paulson began building stakes and later acquired board seats.
Icahn, who is AIG's fourth-largest investor, wanted the insurer to split into three parts. Instead, Hancock embarked on a two-year turnaround plan that involved cutting costs and selling chunks of the company, with the aim of returning $25 billion to shareholders. (reut.rs/1kp8P4I)
Hancock achieved $14.3 billion of that goal from the start of 2016 through Feb. 14.
Experts have said it would be challenging to find someone capable who would want Hancock's job, given the company's recent performance, and its board and financial difficulties in the broader insurance sector.
Though rising interest rates have helped insurers' profits, extreme weather claims, lower premiums and weak sales could weigh on results in the near-term, analysts said.
Still, some investors were hopeful that AIG would improve its bottomline, quickly.
"You can't predict the weather," said Kohl, "but you can control other aspects of your business."

DUBLIN Ireland is set to increase its economic growth forecast for this year to between 4 and 4.25 percent but updated figures due next week will reflect increased uncertainties led by Brexit in later years, the head of the finance department said on Wednesday.
Ireland's economy was the best performing in the European Union for the third year in a row last year after gross domestic product grew by 5.2 percent, beating forecasts that were trimmed back following neighbouring Britain's vote leave the EU.
In its last update in October, the finance department saw GDP growing by 3.5 percent in 2017, but it said on Wednesday that it had yet to see a hit from Brexit and there was nothing to suggest that the economy had slowed in the first quarter.
"Quarter three and quarter four (GDP) returns showed that the second half of 2016 was much stronger than had been assumed," Finance Department Secretary General Derek Moran told a parliamentary committee.
"It would be reasonable to expect the figure next week to improve to between 4 and 4.25 percent for this year."
The department's last forecasts predicted that GDP growth would moderate to an average of 3 percent between 2018 and 2021. However, it has since estimated that a "hard Brexit" - in which Britain loses access to the EU's single market - could knock around 3.5 percent off GDP within a decade.
Moran said he anticipated therefore that "forecasts for the outer years will reflect increased levels of external uncertainty".
He also said figures on Tuesday that showed that income tax receipts came in 3.9 percent behind target in the first quarter despite continued sharp falls in unemployment were "puzzling rather than worrying" and that the department was unlikely to change its tax revenue forecast for 2017 next week.

BERLIN Lufthansa's (LHAG.DE) Eurowings is stepping up expansion at Munich airport in response to strong demand for low-cost flights, with plans to base two more planes there from 2018.
Eurowings started flying from Munich, a hub for Lufthansa's core brand, on Friday and the unit's CEO said demand had significantly exceeded expectations. The carrier will therefore base six A320 jets there in 2018, up from four this year.
"We're as good as sold out over Easter and anyone wanting to book for the summer should hurry," Karl Ulrich Garnadt said in a statement.
Low-cost carriers have been slow to gain a foothold in Germany and currently account for about 15 percent of the market, against 50 percent for Europe as a whole.
While Eurowings, which also includes the Germanwings brand, is the largest low-cost carrier in Germany, Ryanair (RYA.I) , easyJet (EZJ.L), and Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) have been growing strongly in the last couple of years.
Ryanair has stepped up the battle by starting flights from Frankfurt, Lufthansa's main hub, leading the German flagship carrier to demand concessions from airport operator Fraport (FRAG.DE).
Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said at an event on Thursday he was hopeful that a deal could be reached with Fraport on a reduction in fees, adding there was still no decision on whether to start Eurowings flights from Frankfurt.
He also said Eurowings would eventually need more than 7 long-haul planes amid a rush by traditional rivals to also expand budget long-haul routes to compete with newcomers such as Norwegian Air Shuttle (NWC.OL).
British Airways and Iberia owner IAG (ICAG.L) this month unveiled plans for a new low-cost long-haul business called Level that will fly out of Barcelona from June 2017 and Air France also wants to start a new low-cost division on long-haul leisure routes.
There are no plans to start long-haul flights from Munich, a spokesman for Eurowings said on Friday.

DORTMUND, Germany, April 12 Teenager Kylian Mbappe scored twice to give AS Monaco a 3-2 win at Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday in a Champions League quarter-final first-leg match that was postponed following an attack on the home team's bus.
Mbappe gave Monaco a 19th-minute lead shortly after Fabinho had missed a penalty for the visitors, and they went further ahead when Dortmund defender Sven Bender headed into his own net after 35 minutes.
Ousmane Dembele pulled one back for Dortmund in the 57th minute but another defensive mistake allowed Mbappe to break away and grab a third goal for the Ligue 1 side. Shinji Kagawa gave the German side hope with a neat finish six minutes from time.
German media had questioned whether the game should have gone ahead so soon after Tuesday's attack in which three explosions went off as the Dortmund team bus travelled to the stadium, injuring their Spanish defender Marc Bartra.

Federal Way, Wash. – A community is on the lookout after a teen girl is attacked and robbed in her own neighborhood. Wednesday night, Q13 News asked Federal Way Police about the case as investigators look for the suspect.
A casual game of Pokémon Go sends Verree out in her Federal Way neighborhood.
“I do stop and make sure that I'm aware of my surroundings,” said Federal Way resident Verree.
Having been robbed before, Verree says her neighbors are always on the lookout.
“We all do neighborhood watches and really all do try to look out for our neighbors,” said Verree.
Dozens of her neighbors showed up Wednesday night for a city-sponsored community meeting to hear about recent crime trends as many still remember what happened to a 17-year-old girl Thursday morning.
“He came from behind and he punched me in my head. And then when he flew forward he kind of stopped and we weren't really too far from each other, but he came forward and he started punching me in my head again,” said the teen victim who asked Q13 News to keep her identity hidden.
“Be aware of your surroundings, who's around you and not be so absorbed in what you're doing that it diverts your attention to the fact that somebody can attack you,” said Federal Way Police Deputy Chief Steve Neal.
Since the mugging, the victim's dad says more neighbors are coming forward with information, including one who gave him this surveillance video.
“My emotions went through the roof on how it appeared that someone followed her by the time she left our home and then you see a vehicle come into play,” said the victim's father Michael Walker.
“It's pretty obvious that this person has a good long stride and knows exactly what they're doing,” said Neal.
Federal Way Police say the suspect will likely do it again, which means more people could be mugged.
“They commit the same crimes over and over again until the time that they're caught,” said Neal.
The Decatur High School community meeting actually showed that crime is down in that neighborhood, but Police say that doesn't mean let your guard down. If you have any information about the suspect, call Federal Way Police.

Germany's Merkel says EU ready to negotiate Brexit, no change seen

'Di bale. Uuwi na lang ako sa amin,' says President Rodrigo Duterte, as he lightheartedly speaks of the quo warranto petition against him during the anniversary of the Office of the Solicitor General
Published 10:01 PM, July 04, 2018
MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte appeared nonchalant about the quo warranto petition filed against him by suspended lawyer Elly Pamatong.
In a speech on Tuesday, July 3, during the anniversary of the Office of the Solicitor General, Duterte's remarks about the petition were dripping with sarcasm.
"May problema ako kasi ang balita ko sa Supreme Court ready na daw 'yung decision sa quo warranto at I'm also due for ouster kagaya ni [Sereno]," he said.
(I have a problem because I heard the Supreme Court is ready with the decision on the quo warranto petition and I'm also due for ouster just like Sereno.)
"Yung finile Pamatong. Ah 'di bale. Uuwi na lang ako sa amin. (The one filed by Pamatong. Never mind. I will just go home.) I would be happy to step down," he added.
Ironically, he was addressing an audience that included Solicitor General Jose Calida who had filed the quo warranto petition against former Supreme Court Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno. The petition led to her ouster.
Pamatong based his petition, filed on June 6, on the clerical mistake in the PDP-Laban certificate of candidacy (COC) of its presidential candidate for the May 2016 presidential elections.
PDP-Laban member Martin Diño filed a COC for president as a placeholder for Duterte. While the first page of Diño's COC said he was running for president, the second page said he was running for mayor of Pasay City.
In February 2016, the Commission on Elections (Comelec) First Division dismissed the disqualification cases against Duterte, which allowed him to run and eventually win.
Pamatong's petition, however, may not go far in the High Court because procedurally, he is not qualified to file the petition.
Rule 66 of the Rules of Court states that only the solicitor general, a public prosecutor, and an individual with a claim to the position supposedly “usurped” by the subject of the petition can file.
Pamatong's 7-page petition does not address the question of his qualification to file the quo warranto against Duterte.
The Comelec had declared Pamatong a nuisance candidate in the 2016 elections. In 2016, the SC suspended him from practicing law for two years. – With a report from Lian Buan/Rappler.com

TORONTO—A public opinion survey used to bolster claims of widespread support for a proposed nuclear waste bunker near Lake Huron was misleading and actually found little backing for the project, critics say.
While Ontario Power Generation (OPG) stands by the poll of just 805 people, critics insist an analysis shows the utility distorted its findings in submissions to the federal government.
Among other things, poll questions provided false or misleading assumptions designed to skew the response in favour of the deep geologic repository, they said.
Far from showing that a majority of people in Ontario support the repository, the poll actually shows most people oppose it, said Rod McLeod, with the group SOS Great Lakes.
“It is clear that OPG misrepresented the findings to the government, to the media and the public,” said McLeod, a retired lawyer and former deputy minister of the environment. “They excel at alternative facts.”
McLeod called it astounding how far OPG appeared willing to go to misrepresent data to the federal government, which has yet to decide if the project should proceed over the objections of hundreds of communities on both sides of the Canada-U.S. border.
Kevin Powers, a spokesman for OPG, stood by a survey he said was done by one of the top polling firms in the country. Its methodology was scientifically sound and the questions were ordered to prevent bias, he said.
Powers also said reference to its results amounted to just a “single paragraph” in a 700-page report to the government which was among 15,000 pages of evidence showing the project has been proven scientifically safe.
“The survey was intended to give us a clear understanding of what people thought about the (repository) not give us results that we wanted to hear,” Powers said.
“We feel that geology, physics, geoscience and engineering—not opinion research—should guide decision making on this project.”
In a recent submission to the federal minister of the environment, OPG cites the Gandalf Group survey as showing barely more than half of people in Ontario were even aware of the project. The utility then states that 60 per cent of those who had heard about it—based on “their initial understanding” of the project—were supportive.
Robin Palin, a public-relations consultant in Montreal who analyzed the survey, said the upshot of the poll is that it found 33 per cent support among respondents for a repository somewhere in the province.
“There are no other numbers in the entire poll that can be considered statistically-valid representations of Ontario public opinion,” Palin said.
In addition, he said, survey participants were fed unsupportable statements favouring the project. One example was a statement that “experts from around the world, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, agree that this deep geologic repository will protect the environment from nuclear waste.”
At best, the critics say, some international experts support the project but others believe such it would be unsafe, and that the American environmental agency has not actually expressed an opinion.
The Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency is currently examining the latest OPG submissions on whether there are better alternatives to digging the bunker in bedrock about 1.2 kilometres from Lake Huron.
The project, currently estimated to cost $2.4 billion, would see a bunker built at the Bruce nuclear power plant near Kincardine, Ont. Hundreds of thousands of cubic metres of low and intermediate radioactive waste—now stored at the site above ground—would be buried 680 metres in rock under Lake Huron.

SPARTANBURG, S.C. – A South Carolina woman says her new hair dryer turned into a “blowtorch” after flames shot out when she turned it on.
Erika Shoolbred, of Spartanburg, posted about the “hair frier” on Facebook Monday, saying she had received the item through Amazon.
The post read, “Talk about a bad hair day! My new hair dryer (more like hair frier) from OraCorp on Amazon.com became a blow torch on its first use this morning.”
The dryer left a small burn on her hand and produced a bad smell in her bathroom.
Shoolbred wrote that Amazon has refunded her money, but said she's still “a bit shaken”:
“The dryer would not turn off. The off on the switch only made it more torchy. I knew I would have to get it submerged in water but first I had to pull the cord from the wall. That's when I burned my hand. I then was shocked after pulling it from the wall that it still flamed up. I then ran it under the sink. I was fearful my smoke alarm would engage so I opened windows. My bathroom was like a fog and still smells.”
Amazon has since pulled the item from its website, but neither OraCorp nor Amazon returned requests for comment, according to Newsweek.

BEIJING China's insurance regulator said it will resolutely investigate and deal with illegal activities in the market, a day after the organization's head was put under investigation for suspected disciplinary violations.
Beijing's top anti-graft body said on Sunday that Xiang Junbo, head of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) and a member of the central bank's monetary policy committee, was suspected of committing "serious disciplinary violations" - a phrase that usually refers to graft.
The regulator said in a statement late on Monday that it would tackle disorder in the insurance market and maintain high vigilance and fend off financial risk.

NEW YORK, March 31 The last thing the ride-sharing company Uber wanted, as the company tries to defend itself against Waymo's accusations that it obtained trade secrets when it hired a former Waymo engineer, was a headline revealing that the engineer plans to assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if he's called to testify in Waymo's case.
At a closed-door hearing Wednesday in U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco's chambers, Uber lawyer Arturo Gonzalez of Morrison & Foerster told the judge Uber counsel had asked for a secret session “because of the adverse impact that we think it would have on our client if there's a headline tomorrow.”
That turned out to be exactly the wrong thing to say to Judge Alsup, who informed Gonzalez, as well as Waymo lawyers from Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, that he would make the entire transcript of the closed-door hearing public. (My Reuters colleague, Dan Levine, obtained an early version of it.) Alsup also warned Uber and Waymo that he's not going to put up with requests for secrecy just to save them from headlines they'd rather not see.
"PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO SEE"
“There's going to be a lot of adverse headlines in this case on both sides,” Judge Alsup said. That's what happens, he said, when companies go to court. “The public has a right to see what we do. And I feel that so strongly,” Alsup said. “The U.S. District Court is not a wholly owned subsidiary of Quinn Emanuel or Morrison & Foerster or these two big companies. We belong to the public.”
The headlines today did indeed reveal what happened at Thursday's hearing. Reuters reported that Judge Alsup said he may grant Waymo's motion for a preliminary injunction if the Uber engineer refuses to testify about why, according to Waymo, he took 14,000 confidential files with him when he left Waymo. The New York Times offered the very headline Uber's lawyers said they feared: “Uber Executive Invokes Fifth Amendment, Seeking to Avoid Potential Charges.”
As a result, if you are investor in Uber or in Waymo's parent, Alphabet, or if you're a local government official thinking about whether to allow Uber service in your town or if you're a customer of Uber or Google or even if you're just someone who's interested in this case, you now know that Uber is facing a serious strategic problem in its defense against Waymo's claims. You know Waymo has a decent shot at blocking Uber from using any purportedly stolen technology while the case is being litigated. You know that the engineer accused of bringing Waymo files to Uber, Anthony Levandowski, has hired his own lawyers and may not provide Uber the testimony it wants from him.
All of that is important information. And all of it, as Judge Alsup said, deserves to be public. Levandowski's prospective invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights is not secret technology or proprietary data. It's just something Uber didn't want you to know. For too many federal judges, that's reason enough to deprive you of access. But not for Judge Alsup, a true believer in the public's right to know what's happening in the courts their tax dollars pay for.
A TOUCHY ISSUE
Uber took the brunt of the judge's criticism Thursday because it had requested the closed hearing. The judge was not at all happy that Uber and Levandowski chose to present a touchy issue - how to produce documents in response to a previous order from Judge Alsup without compromising Levandowski's Fifth Amendment rights – in a last-minute meeting in chambers, rather than through formal briefing.
“Trying to get special pleading because you represent somebody big and get an under-seal hearing so the public can't hear it - that's not going to work,” the judge said. “If you want to make a formal motion, you can make it.”
But Judge Alsup also called out Waymo, which, according to Uber, demanded broad redactions in an Uber motion to compel arbitration of Waymo's trade secrets and California unfair business practices claims. Uber has since filed an unredacted version of its arbitration brief, which disclosed that Waymo has been engaged since October in arbitration with Levandowski over the thousands of documents the engineer supposedly stole from Waymo.
Judge Alsup said that Waymo should have told him it was arbitrating with Levandowski. He also said the company should not have insisted its employment agreements with Levandowski be kept secret. “If we're going to be in a public proceeding, 99 percent of (it) - 90 percent anyway - has got to be public,” he said. “This employment agreement by Google, it's laughable that you want to keep that under wraps. Just laughable.” (Waymo lawyer Charles Verhoeven of Quinn Emanuel told the judge his firm had not asked for redaction of the agreement.)
The judge said at the hearing that he expects to decide next month whether to grant Uber's motion to compel arbitration of Waymo's trade secrets claims against the company, in advance of a May 4 hearing on Waymo's preliminary injunction motion.
If he agrees with Uber that arbitration provisions in Levandowski's old employment contracts with Google require arbitration of most of Waymo's case against Uber, all of Judge Alsup's exhortations about the public's right to know will be for naught. As the judge himself said at Thursday's hearing, arbitration is confidential.
I, for one, am I hoping Judge Alsup keeps that in mind when he decides where this case should be heard. (Reporting by Alison Frankel. Editing by Alessandra Rafferty.)

LONDON If Donald Trump's election in the United States and Britain's decision to quit the European Union stirred the global economic waters, then there is the potential for a tsunami on the near horizon.
The coming week is the last before the first round of France's presidential election on April 23. It has already been a barrel of surprises -- an incumbent not running, the far right in ascendance, an independent seen as likely winner, a scandal hampering the early favorite.
But the latest twist -- one with arguably the most potential global economic impact -- could conceivably see a far-left candidate, one-time communist Jean-Luc Mélenchon, make it through to the May 7 run-off against a far-right nationalist, Marine Le Pen.
The potential economic shock stems from the fact that both are against the euro and the European Union, threatening the stability and even existence of both. The word Frexit -- the Gallic version of Brexit -- has been doing the rounds.
Boosted by a strong performance in televised debates, Mélenchon has gathered momentum in the past week. One poll on Tuesday showed his support as high as 19 percent, within four points of centrist Emmanuel Macron and within five of Le Pen; the latest survey on Thursday put him on 17 percent.
"For France, Europe and markets, a run-off between Mélenchon and ultra-right Marine Le Pen on May 7 would be a choice between bad and ugly," Berenberg bank said in a note on Thursday.
The odds are still strongly against it happening: the polls show former economy minister Macron winning the big prize. But the fact is that perennial outsider Mélenchon and Le Pen are in the frame.
France's economy offers a mixed bag. Unemployment is at 10 percent and has been around that mark for five years. Projected economic growth of just 1.4 percent for this year puts France down at 25th equal (with Belgium) out of 28 EU countries.
Other data shows the strain too. A study by World Economics of the relative value of euros within the euro zone, shows a yawning gap between Germany and France, making the latter far less competitive.
But although growth is weak, France performs much better than other economies such as the United States and Britain in terms of income equality.
One recent study, for example, found that the median French income in 2012 was about 17 percent higher than in 1996, while the median U.S. income was just 2 percent above its 1996 level.
How all this plays with the French equivalent of the angry, left-out voters who went for Trump and Brexit remains to be seen.
BRIGHT SPOT
One recent bright spot for France has been the Purchasing Managers' Index, which has shown a degree of rising optimism among businesses as the euro zone also improves.
On Friday in the coming week -- just before the first round vote -- flash PMIs for April are released. Last time around all three of France's readings -- manufacturing, services and composite -- were well in the expansion range, particularly services.
Early Reuters polling suggests the services and manufacturing reports will essentially be unchanged, possibly as a result of election uncertainty.
The euro zone and Germany will also report. The former is expected to improve slightly on a composite basis, which would add to the overall view of a steadily recovering economy. German manufacturing could show a tiny dip.
Outside the euro zone, British retail sales data for March, released on Friday April 21, should provide another glimpse of how consumer sentiment is holding up as Brexit negotiations loom.
Economists and others were surprised by the tenacity of British consumers after last year's vote to leave the EU, but there have been recent signs of a tailing off.
The British Retail Consortium said in the past week that its gauge of first-quarter consumer shopping showed the slowest growth since 2008.
It was put down to inflation rising as a result of the post-Brexit vote fall in the pound. There were also some seasonal impacts relating to when Easter fell last year.
Snapshots of the state of the U.S. economy, meanwhile, will come from New York and Philadelphia Federal Reserve reports and from March industrial output data.
The latter is expected to climb, reflecting an economy that has recovered well enough for the U.S. Federal Reserve to begin a tentative rate-tightening cycle.

TARRED by a fixing scandal that struck at the height of the financial crisis, bankers and investors for years have been grappling with finding a replacement for the Libor benchmark used to set borrowing rates on trillions of loans and derivatives.
Now the Bank of England is finally ready to unveil a key part. From Tuesday, the BoE will publish a revamped version of the Sterling Overnight Index Average, known as Sonia. In an attempt to stop bankers manipulating the new rate for their own profit, the updated Sonia will be based on actual transactions, rather than estimates of how much it costs lenders to borrow.
“Reforming Sonia is an important step in moving away from the market's dependency on Libor,” said Deepak Sitlani, a partner at London-based law firm Linklaters. “No one is very comfortable with the risks that stem from Libor being based on subjective expert judgment, rather than real transactions.”
Yet problems remain. Sonia is an overnight rate only, whereas Libor has longer-term rates — everything from one week, through three months and even 50 years. The authorities are leaving it to the market to work out how to get from the new overnight rate to these so-called term rates, creating uncertainty for the industry.
“This is a key need for those in the market who need to have certainty of their interest-rate exposure at the start of an interest-rate period, rather than at the end,” Sitlani said.
For decades, Libor was a seemingly reliable benchmark set daily by banks to determine interest rates on everything from student loans and mortgages to derivatives and credit cards. That all changed when European and US banks were found to have manipulated rates to benefit their own portfolios, tainting the benchmark's reputation.
Banks plumped for Sonia as Libor's replacement almost exactly a year ago. The Sterling Working Group — the industry organization that's pondering how to move from one benchmark to another — may use the swaps market as the basis for adding a term element to Sonia, according to Sitlani.
Swaps traders already transact using the current version of Sonia, giving some insight into expectations of future borrowing costs. In such a swap, the two sides agree to exchange a fixed- for floating-rate payment, based on an overnight rate. For example, a 10-year interest-rate swap at the current level of about 1.3% tells you investors' expectations for the average overnight Sonia rate for the next 10 years.
CurveGlobal, a platform for interest-rate derivatives that's a unit of London Stock Exchange Group Plc, plans to offer a three-month Sonia futures contract at the end of April.
Still, some say term structures may not be as important for the new Sonia.
“There are some scenarios in fixed-income markets where a term structure is required,” said Andy Ross, chief executive officer of CurveGlobal. “However, in the majority of those, you don't need that structure.” The premium for bank credit risk that's in Libor isn't needed either, he said.
WEEKLY CALCULATION?
Another possibility is to compound Sonia in arrears, for example by doing the calculation at the end of each week, Ross said. While that might work as a hedge, it might not suit everyone because it would mean the borrower's liability is only apparent at the end of a period, he said.
To be sure, Libor is still the interest rate used as the baseline for many bonds, business loans and mortgages. The UK Financial Conduct Authority said last year that banks are no longer obliged to help set Libor rates, though Chief Executive Officer Andrew Bailey has since said banks may need to rely on a version of Libor for years to come, simply because of its importance. — Bloomberg

Is American Horror Story too scary? For Holland Taylor, that might actually be the case.
Opening up to PEOPLE Now about her relationship with AHS star Sarah Paulson, the Mr. Mercedes star said it isn't easy watching her partner on FX's hit horror drama.
“She's had two seasons in a row where she was running and screaming and fleeing and being in jeopardy,” said Taylor of Paulson's latest characters in the anthology. “I don't like watching her in jeopardy. It's hard.”
But it's not just hard for Taylor, as the actress observed, Paulson, too, has her own challenges with AHS. “I just admire her ability to do it, because they have very long hours on American Horror Story,” Taylor added.
“And I really don't know how she does it! I really don't. I mean it's relentless,” Taylor said. “But she's a great actress and she can really go there. She can go wherever she has to go for a scene.”

Taylor also opened up her first date with Paulson, which happened as a result of a direct message conversation on Twitter. “She [saw] me in a tweet and thought I was blue about something and she said, ‘How are you? What's happening?' We got together shortly after that.”
Like watching American Horror Story, Twitter and Instagram come much more naturally to Paulson, said Taylor: “She's very responsive to that very modern thing. I'm a different generation so I'm just sort of getting the hang of it.”
But Taylor doesn't let Paulson have all the fun on social media, “It's sometimes fun and funny to have some sort of public conversation back and forth. People enjoy it.”
American Horror Story returns Sept. 5 on FX, and Mr. Mercedes airs Wednesdays (8 p.m. ET) on Audience Network.

WELLINGTON Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) sold its stake in a New Zealand gas field while taking over the field's operating company as part of a plan to possibly divest its holdings in the country later on, the company said Thursday.
Shell has sold its 50 percent stake in the Kapuni Gas Field, New Zealand's second-largest, for an undisclosed price and has increased its holding to 100 percent in the joint venture that operates the field, Shell Todd Oil Services (STOS), it said in a statement.
The announcement was the first concrete action taken by Shell following its announcement in 2015 that it was reviewing its New Zealand business interests.
"This 100 per cent ownership of STOS will simplify Shell's operational structure in preparation for any possible portfolio changes to the remaining assets," Rob Jager, Country Chair of Shell New Zealand, told Fairfax Media.
Shell, which has operated in New Zealand for more than a century, said in December 2015 it was reviewing its business interests in the Pacific nation as the company seeks to streamline its global portfolio amid a slump in energy prices.

MILAN Pescara midfielder Sulley Muntari has been banned for one game after he walked off the pitch at Cagliari on Sunday, having been booked for complaining to the referee about racist abuse in the crowd.
Serie A's disciplinary committee also said that no action would be taken against Cagliari because only around 10 supporters were involved in abusing Muntari.
Meanwhile, Lazio and Inter Milan were found guilty of racist behaviour by their fans during other games and warned they would face partial stadium closures if there was a repeat.
The committee said that Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly was the target of racist chanting by Inter fans while Lazio supporters targeted AS Roma defender Antonio Ruediger.
Ghanaian midfielder Muntari said he suffered abuse throughout his side's 1-0 defeat at Cagliari but was booked for dissent when he asked the match official to stop the game.
The 32-year-old walked off the pitch in protest shortly afterwards and was then given a second yellow card and sent off.
The committee confirmed an automatic one-match ban, saying Muntari's second yellow was for "abandoning the pitch without the referee's permission".
The committee described the chanting as deplorable but said it came from a part of the stadium occupied by 2,000 fans and that only around 10 were involved, not enough to warrant a punishment against the club under Serie A rules.
It said that around 80 percent of the 7,000 Inter fans in one of the upper tier sections of the San Siro aimed insults at Senegal defender Koulibaly and a similar number of fans in one section of Lazio's Curva Nord aimed insults at Germany's Ruediger.
In both cases, the tribunal ordered the sectors to be closed for one game if there was a repeat incident within the next year.
Earlier, the world players' union FIFPro had called on Serie A to rescind Muntari's first yellow card.
"We urge Italian authorities to hear Muntari's version of events, investigate why the situation was mismanaged, and take firm action to ensure this never happens again," said FIFPro in a statement.
"Muntari was well within his rights to approach referee Daniele Minelli, as the first point of reference, to make his grievances known and seek a solution...
"Professional footballers should expect to be adequately protected by the relevant authorities."

Back in September, PEOPLE shared an article about the tough fate of dogs living in and around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine. After the disastrous explosion at the plant in 1986, most residents of the danger zone were forced to flee, leaving their pets behind.
Today, some of the ancestors of those pets still live in the region, with 250 dogs living at the plant itself, according to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals International (SPCAI). Although most think of Chernobyl as a wasteland, the nuclear power plant is still up and running with more than 3,000 employees. The SPCAI says the workers do what they can for the 250 dogs living at the plant itself, but until now, they were prohibited from removing any animals from the area.
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals International (SPCAI)
All in all, the area is home to more than 1,000 dogs, mainly descendants of the pets of the 120,000 people forced to abandon their homes in the wake of the emergency evacuation following the disaster. Since that day, Chernobyl's dogs have died or suffered, without food, water or veterinary care. The majority of these strays are homeless, and up until recently people were warned against even petting them due to fear of radioactivity. This means that if they hadn't been saved, the majority of the dogs would've died or been killed.
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals International (SPCAI)
But those days are now over. For the first time ever, the stray pups living near the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant are being rescued and will soon be legally released for adoption. SPCAI is bringing 13 of the dogs, all less than 1 year old, to the U.S. in the coming weeks. Adoption applications are now open for the 13 puppies, who are reportedly up to date on their vaccines and all will be spayed or neutered. They will also go through a 45-day quarantine period, receiving temporary shelter in the nearby town of Slavutych, and will then be “transported to carefully selected homes in Ukraine and North America.”
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals International (SPCAI)
According to the SPCAI, which partnered with the Clean Futures Fund (CFF) on this initiative, all the puppies are playful and well socialized with children, dogs, cats and farm animals. They are in the midst of training and are “quickly learning their first four basic commands.” The agency says the pups — currently named Uki, Yuri, Yaniv, Polly, Minsk, Leliv, Kopachi, Kimovo, Desa, Atom, Cherni, Bela and Chappa — will be delivered to their new forever homes in early July.
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals International (SPCAI)
“We have rescued the first puppies, they are now in our adoption shelter going through the quarantine and decontamination process,” Lucas Hixson, co-founder of the U.S.-based CFF, told Gizmodo earlier this month. “The goal is 200 dogs, but will likely be more in the long run. My hope is to get 200 dogs rescued and adopted in the next 18 months and then go from there.”

A joint release from CFF and SPCAI says, “This unprecedented event marks an important partnership with the Ukrainian government, which has been reluctant in the past 32 years to allow anything to be removed from the nuclear exclusion zone.”
“In 2017, thanks to a partnership between Clean Futures Fund and SPCA International, more than 450 animals were tested for radiation exposure, received medical care, vaccinations and were spayed or neutered. The radiation testing revealed that the dogs living in the zone were not harmfully contaminated. Those results paved the way for their rescue and adoption by proving that it is safe to place them in homes.”

ARVADA, Colo. - A Colorado woman is paying the price for forgetting an apple in her bag when flying internationally.
Crystal Tadlock recently was returning to Arvada from Paris when flight attendants on the international flight handed out apples in sealed plastic bags, KDVR reported.
She said she didn't want it at the time, so she tossed it in her bag, intending to eat it on her second flight to Denver, KDVR reported.
When she landed in Minneapolis, she went through U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Minneapolis, where she was supposed to declare fruits, vegetables, plants, flowers, meat, animal products or live animals, the Washington Post reported.

That free apple ended up costing Tadlock $500, a fine for not declaring the fruit and bringing it into the U.S., KDVR reported.
Tadlock says she shouldn't have been fined for a mistake. She's also saying that Delta Air Lines should have told passengers not to take the fruit with them.
She also told KDVR that she asked the agent if she could throw the apple away or eat it. She said the agent said no before handing her the ticket.
Delta officials told The Washington Post that food given during a flight “is given with the intention you consume it on board.”
She told KDVR that she's upset that she got the ticket when the fruit came from Delta and was marked with the Delta logo.
She says she plans to fight the citation in court, KDVR reported.

OTTAWA — A group representing survivors of the so-called '60s Scoop says the federal government's proposed $800-million settlement does not go far enough.
The government failed to adequately consult those who experienced forced adoptions before it announced the compensation package in October, said Duane Morrisseau-Beck of the National Indigenous Survivors of Child Welfare Network.
Thousands of Indigenous children were taken from their homes by child-welfare agents and placed with non-Indigenous families starting in the 1960s, a practice that stripped them of their culture, language and traditions.
Morrisseau, who is a survivor, said the network will campaign against the proposed settlement and plans to hold rallies in cities across the country on March 16 to demand fair and inclusive compensation.
"We deserve to be heard," he said Friday. "We feel that this agreement is unfair, unreasonable and not in the best interest of '60s Scoop survivors."
The network also took issue with the settlement's exclusion of Métis survivors and those without legal Indian status or who are unable to prove it.
Sabrina Williams, a spokesperson for Carolyn Bennett, minister of Crown-Indigenous relations, described the settlement as a first step and said the government is committed to addressing the harm suffered by others involved in the '60s Scoop, including Métis and non-status people.
"The Sixties Scoop is a dark and painful chapter in Canada's history," she said in an email.
"The government is interested in working with all parties — provinces, territories, Métis leadership, plaintiffs and their counsel — to work towards resolving the litigation outside of the courts."
Survivor Lesley Parlane said it is irresponsible and dismissive of the government not to take an accurate survey of how many people were affected by the '60s Scoop.
Nine consecutive wins for Team Nova Scotia in Penticton at the South Okanagan Events Centre

Special to the Penticton Western News
Mary-Anne Arsenault and her Nova Scotia rink just keep on winning at the Scotties Tournament of Hearts in Penticton.
The Dartmouth-based rink brought down Tracy Fleury and Team Northern Ontario by a 6-2 score, winning their staggering ninth match in a row, earning a berth in Sunday's semifinal.
“It was so nice to put a really good game together,” said Arsenault, who has played in the Scotties 13 times. “I'm so proud of my girls. They played awesome and anytime we were in a little bit of trouble, (they) would make a double and we were back.”
Arsenault blanked the first three ends keeping the hammer for the fourth where she opened the scoring. She managed to expertly draw around the high-sitting guards with her final two stones to lay two, giving her Nova Scotia rink a 2-0 lead going into the fifth end.
Fleury earned one back in the fifth by picking and rolling across the inner blue rings to lay one, cutting Arsenault's lead to 2-1.
Arsenault fired right back making a pair of tight draws into the inner rings through a cluttered upper house to lay three in the sixth end — extending her lead to 5-1.
Fleury blanked the seventh, then drew to the button in the eighth to cut into Arsenault's lead. However, her Nova Scotia rink still found themselves down 5-2 heading into the ninth end.
The ninth end featured a jam-up heading into skips' final shots. Fleury cleared the jam-up with her last stone of the end, but Arsenault hit and stuck her hammer shot to further pad her lead at 6-2.
The teams decided to play the 10th end, even though Arsenault had a sizeable lead, but did not play the entire length. They shook hands with four rocks remaining after Northern Ontario couldn't keep enough stones in the house to justify finishing the end.
“We would have liked to have played better,” said Fleury, whose rink went 8-3 in tournament play. “But Nova Scotia played amazing and we just had some key misses. They played well and put a lot of pressure on us.”
Arsenault is now two wins away from giving Team Nova Scotia its first Scotties Tournament of Hearts national title in 14 years. Nova Scotia will play the loser of Saturday night's Page Playoff, between Manitoba and Team Wild Card, in the semifinal at 9 a.m. at the South Okanagan Events Centre to determine who will move on to the final. The winner of the Saturday night 7 p.m. draw will move directly to the final, which takes place at 4 p.m. on Sunday.
The HeartStop Lounge, located at the Penticton Trade and Convention Centre, will feature the final on one of their giant-screen TV's on Sunday, the other will be playing the Super Bowl. Tickets are not required to take in the action at the HeartStop Lounge.

Spanish stocks - Factors to watch on Thursday
The following Spanish stocks may be affected by newspaper reports and other factors on Thursday. Reuters has not verified the newspaper reports, and cannot vouch for their accuracy:
The aftermath of a motorcycle crash in Vancouver on Monday morning. (Canadian Press photo)
A female stunt driver working on the movie “Deadpool 2” has died after witnesses say she appeared to lose control of a motorcycle before crashing into a window of a building in downtown Vancouver.
A crumpled motorcycle was seen laying on its side surrounded by broken glass a few metres from the smashed window of the Shaw Tower near the city's waterfront. Crew members appeared distraught and one was in tears.
“She lost control really quickly. It happened in a split second,” said Nathan Kramchynski, who works inside the Shaw building and watched the accident from the seventh floor on Monday morning.
He said he had been watching rehearsals of the stunt across the street outside the Vancouver Convention Centre. The stuntwoman had been riding slowly down a set of stairs and stopping when she reached the road, he said.
When it looked like the crew was ready to film the scene, Kramchynski and his coworkers rushed over to the window to watch. But that time, the driver suddenly picked up speed and crossed the street, he said.
“She kind of weaved through, almost hit a pedestrian,” he said. “She was going full throttle and then there's a building there.”
Sharmina Kermalli was in a Starbucks on the ground floor of the tower when she heard a loud crash. She ran toward the noise and saw a woman lying inside the building, across where the glass panel had been.
Shards were still falling on the woman, and people were running over and picking glass off her face, Kermalli said.
Kermalli said just moments earlier she had walked by the spot where the crash happened.
“I was thinking, what if I was just five seconds (later),” she said.
Deadpool, a Marvel Comics superhero, is played by Vancouver-born actor Ryan Reynolds. He posted a message to Twitter on Monday.
“Today, we tragically lost a member of our crew while filming Deadpool. We're heartbroken, shocked and devastated … but recognize nothing can come close to the grief and inexplicable pain her family and loved ones must feel in this moment,” he said.
“My heart pours out to them — along with each and every person she touched in this world.”
A spokesman for 20th Century Fox issued a statement Monday that said, “We are deeply saddened by the accident that occurred on the set of Deadpool 2 this morning. Our hearts and prayers are with the family, friends and colleagues of our crew member during this difficult time.”
Vancouver police officers were at the scene and investigators with WorkSafeBC, the provincial workplace safety agency, were also looking into the crash.
Kramchynski, the witness who watched from the seventh floor, said a fire truck and police cars arrived “instantly” after the crash happened.
“The response was actually incredible,” he said.
He said he watched as the stunt woman was carried on a stretcher into the ambulance, which remained at the scene for about 15 or 20 minutes before leaving.
Later on Monday, the motorcycle was removed from the area and the broken glass was swept up.
The crash happened just half a block from the scene of an accident on Sunday where a bus hit several pedestrians, killing one man and injuring two others.
Turkish court sentences pro-Kurdish HDP deputy Çelik to 6 years in prison
Pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) deputy Burcu Çelik has been sentenced to 6 years in prison on charge of aiding and abating a terror organization.
Being kept in Sincan Closed Women's Prison, Çelik made her statement of defense via Audio and Visual Information System (SEGBİS) in the hearing at Muş 1st High Criminal Court. She was jailed on April 19 in the scope of a lawsuit in which she stood trial for “membership to and spreading propaganda for a terrorist organisation” due to her remarks in a rally.
The third hearing in the case was held at Muş High Criminal Court on Friday. Çelik has stated that she has fought for peace all her life, and will continue her struggle to this end.
The court acquitted Burcu Çelik on charges of “membership to and spreading propaganda for a terrorist organisation” but ruled continuation of detention and sentenced her to six years in jail, defining her political works as “aiding and abetting a terrorist organisation.”
Çelik's lawyers will appeal against the court verdict. Turkey has already jailed HDP's co-leader Selahattin Demirtas and 9 other deputies, along with 80 mayors and thousands of party members. The Turkish Parliament has ousted 5 of HDP deputies, bringing down the total number of party's deputies from 59 to 54 at the 550-seat assembly.

YEREVAN Armenia's ruling party goes into an election on Sunday neck-and-neck in the polls with a former coalition partner, making it hard to predict the winner of a vote that will usher in a new parliamentary system of government.
Under constitutional changes critics say were designed to prolong the political life of President Serzh Sarksyan, parliament, not voters, will elect the president for the first time and the office of prime minister will become more powerful, with the presidency becoming a largely ceremonial role.
Sarksyan, the 62-year-old leader of the ruling Republican Party of Armenia (RPA), has repeatedly denied that the changes, which were approved by the electorate in a December 2015 referendum, were made for his benefit.
He has been president since 2008, but his current presidential term, his second, expires next year, and critics say the new system gives him some attractive options: to keep wielding executive power by becoming prime minister; to do so by simply remaining leader of the RPA; or to quit but keep exercising influence via a handpicked successor.
To be assured of having those options, Sarksyan will need his party to win Sunday's vote, which comes as the ex-Soviet state of 3.2 million is in the grip of an economic slowdown that has sparked rising discontent.
"This election stands as a crossroads for Armenia, as either a decisive turning point or as a possibly divisive tipping point, with the country's stability and security in the balance," said Richard Giragosian, director of the Regional Studies Centre in the capital Yerevan.
The outcome is uncertain.
The ruling RPA is neck-and-neck in opinion polls with an opposition alliance led by a wealthy businessman, Gagik Tsarukyan. The alliance has ruled in coalition with the RPA before, but it's unclear if it will agree to do so again if, as expected, it fails to win enough support to rule alone.
Another smaller party, which currently rules with the RPA, has said it will do a deal however, if it gets into parliament, offering the RPA a potential political lifeline.
Armenia depends heavily for aid and investment on Russia, which has been hard hit in the past three years by an economic downturn. Armenia has felt the impact, with growth falling to 0.2 percent last year from 3 percent in 2015.
Analysts say the election may be better organised than previous polls, which have been marred by irregularities, but that there is still a risk of post-election unrest.

Washington Redskins coach Jay Gruden plans to address players saying they are not being prepared to compete as he tries to move past consecutive blowout loss and get ready for the Arizona Cardinals.
After a 30-13 loss Sunday at the Los Angeles Chargers dropped the Redskins to 5-8, safety D.J. Swearinger repeated a theme from an earlier defeat that practices were too lackadaisical and the team wasn't prepared and was going to fail. Gruden says he'll talk to Swearinger about his concerns.
Gruden fielded several questions on his conference call Monday about preparation, answering that it's on him, his staff and players to make sure everyone's "fully ready to play." The coach says injuries and a revolving roster have presented a challenge for Washington this season.
The Redskins have already placed 13 players on injured reserve and could have more. Linebacker Chris Carter is set for surgery on his broken right fibula, and starting inside linebacker Zach Brown will have an MRI on his right foot.

Gunmen stormed an upscale cafe overnight in Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou, strafing the building with bullets and barricading themselves inside for hours. By the time security forces reclaimed the restaurant around dawn Monday, at least 18 people had been killed and eight others wounded, according to local authorities.
The West African nation's communications minister, Remis Dandjinou, told reporters Monday that by daybreak, two of the attackers had been killed and several foreign nationals were among the dead. In separate statements, officials in Paris and Ankara confirmed the victims include a French citizen and Turkish citizen, while another Turk was injured in the violence.
While Burkinabe officials blamed Islamist militants for the attack on the Turkish cafe, no one group immediately claimed responsibility.
"I salute the bravery of our security and defense forces whose engagement allowed us to neutralize the terrorists," Burkinabe President Roch Marc Christian Kabore said in a statement, as translated by CNN.
"The struggle against terrorism is a lengthy fight," he added. "That is why I am calling for vigilance, solidarity and unity of the whole nation to face up to the cowardice of our enemies."
In a news conference Monday, Dandjinou detailed the night's bloody events, which opened when he says about three to four militants rolled up to the cafe on motorcycles around 9 p.m. local time. They opened fire on an outside seating area outside then moved indoors, where The New York Times notes a family had been celebrating a 9-year-old boy's birthday.
The newspaper reports the boy was hospitalized with injuries from the attack.
For Burkinabes, the attack on Aziz Istanbul cafe, which is popular with foreigners, prompts bitter memories of another bloody episode just over 18 months ago. In January last year, militants conducted an hours-long raid on a luxury hotel and a cafe just blocks away from Aziz Istanbul, ultimately killing some 30 people before being dislodged by security forces.
Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, a militant group based in the region, claimed responsibility for that attack — as well as another deadly assault just months before in neighboring Mali.
Islamist groups have been active for years in the Sahel region, which includes Mali and Burkina Faso. As groups linked to al-Qaida have carried out attacks in the area, the Times points out that the United Nations peacekeeping mission to Mali "has become one of the most dangerous in the world."
The French government — which controlled Burkina Faso, then called Upper Volta, as a colony until 1960 — says President Emmanuel Macron met with Kabore on Monday to discuss the circumstances of the latest attack.
The pair of leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to the formation of an international security force in the Sahel region to "continue the fight against terrorist groups."
President Rodrigo Duterte urges Filipinos to help in the fight against corruption by being assertive of their rights
MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte promised change was coming when he won the presidency last year, and one of his campaign promises was to rid the government of corruption.
Corruption has a very real impact on Filipinos: various studies have shown that poverty exists partly because of corruption, and billions of pesos that could've gone to much-needed social services end up in the pockets of corrupt officials engaged in illicit activities. (IN NUMBERS: Impact of corruption on the Philippines)
The tough-talking former mayor of Davao City has vowed to impose his iron-fisted way of ruling to wage a war against corruption – but, he acknowledges, it's a fight he can't win alone.
"One of the promises I made to the people is I will stop corruption in government. I cannot do it alone. You have to be aware of what I'm doing and you have to help me," he said.
Ordinary Filipinos can do their share in the fight against corruption by standing up to incidents of bribery and asserting their rights, Duterte said.
Duterte's advice: If a police officer attempts to extort you, raise a howl, create a scene, let him know he's committing a crime, and warn him that the President will not go easy on him.
Duterte called on Filipinos to be assertive and stand their ground, because corruption will stay pervasive if Filipinos are not vigilant or brave enough to fight back.
"Unless people really realize that they have rights, and that you have every right to your money, every centavo of it, unless you begin to be brave: 'Ayaw ko 'yan. Wag mo akong hingan,'" he said.
"Mas makatulong kayo sa bayan, sa sarili mo mismo, 'pag wag kayong bumigay. Do not let go. Wag talaga kayong bumigay na giving. (You will help the country more if you don't resort to bribery). Because that makes it really worse," he added.

By Tanya Agrawal
Feb 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell at the open on Friday due to disappointing earnings reports from blue-chip companies and as a robust U.S. jobs report boosted bond yields and bolstered expectations that the pace of interest rates hikes could pick up.
All 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average were lower and ten of the 11 major S&P sectors fell, led by the energy index's 1.83 percent decline.
A Labor Department report showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 200,000 jobs in January, above the 180,000 rises expected by economists surveyed by Reuters. The unemployment rate stayed unchanged at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent.
Average hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent, building on December's solid 0.4 percent gain. That boosted the year-on-year increase in average hourly earnings to 2.9 percent, the largest rise since June 2009.
After the payrolls data, traders boosted bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates three times this year, with a hike next month seen as a near certainty. But fast-rising wages could prompt more aggressive action to keep a lid on inflation pressure.
“The market had coalesced around expectations for three rate hikes this year,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director at institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird.
“Slightly hawkish comments and wage hikes will make it four. What is good for the average American worker ends up being negative for stocks because it increases the odds of further rate hikes.”
At 9:37 a.m. ET (1437 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 218.19 points, or 0.83 percent, at 25,968.52.
The S&P 500 was down 17.47 points, or 0.61 percent, at 2,804.51 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 27.19 points, or 0.37 percent, at 7,358.68.
The CBOE Volatility Index, the most widely followed gauge for investors' fear of stock market volatility, rose to 14.39, after having fallen in the previous two sessions.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields extended their rise after the payrolls data and jumped to more than 2.818 percent, its highest level since early 2014.
Adding to the pressure were disappointing earnings reports from major companies.
Shares of oil majors Exxon and Chevron were down 4.1 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively, after they both posted lower-than-expected quarterly profits.
Google-parent Alphabet fell 4.5 percent after the company's quarterly profit missed analysts' estimates.
Apple shares initially struggled for direction before falling 1.4 percent as investors gave more credence to the company's muted forecast than strong iPhone prices and cash plans.
One bright spot was Amazon.com, which rose 6 percent after the online retailer reported a record profit of near $2 billion, helped by a rise in sales and tax law changes.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,404 to 298. On the Nasdaq, 1,939 issues fell and 481 advanced.
The S&P 500 index showed 12 new 52-week highs and 16 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 20 new highs and 32 new lows. (Reporting by Tanya Agrawal in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D‘Souza)

A slide in the technology sector weighed on the Nasdaq and S&P 500 as investors worried about the pace of economic growth after the rate increase and weaker-than-expected inflation data. Crude oil prices fell nearly 4 percent, hit by an unexpec
DeGale vacates IBF super middleweight title
LONDON (AP) — James DeGale announced Wednesday that he has vacated his IBF super middleweight title.
"I have relinquished my IBF title as I look to secure big fights in the final chapter of my career," the 32-year-old DeGale wrote on Twitter.
"This is the final phase of my career where I want to be involved in the biggest fights possible. My team have been working very hard behind the scenes and we've got some exciting news to announce soon."
DeGale became the first British Olympic gold medalist to win a professional world title when in 2015 he outpointed Andre Dirrell in Boston.
He has since defended it largely on American soil, including drawing a unification fight with Badou Jack and reclaiming his title following an unexpected defeat by Caleb Truax in London, but is expected to conclude his career in Britain.
(Updates with closing prices) By Jan Harvey LONDON, March 31 Copper fell more than 1 percent on Friday as the end of a strike at Peru's biggest copper mine dampened fears of reduced supply that had driven the metal higher this quarter, though upbeat economic data from China lent support. Workers at Freeport-McMoRan Inc's Cerro Verde facility will resume work on Friday after voting to end a near three-week strike that had halved output, the union said late on Thursday. The re-start of the mine coincides with the Escondida mine in Chile resuming operations, ING said in a note, while there were signs that restrictions on supply from Freeport-McMoRan's Grasberg facility in Indonesia were also set to ease. "Supply issues are evaporating," Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann said. "Overnight the latest news out of Peru is that the strike at the Cerro Verde mine has come to the end. Two days ago we had news that there might be a solution at Grasberg, and before that, Escondida resumed production. So I think the major (supply) issues are almost done." LME COPPER: London Metal Exchange copper closed down 2 percent at $5,837.50 a tonne, though prices still rose 5.6 percent in the first quarter, following a near 14 percent rise in the previous three months. CHINA MANUFACTURING: Activity in China's manufacturing sector unexpectedly grew at its fastest pace in nearly five years in March, adding to evidence that the world's second-largest economy has gained momentum early this year, an official report showed on Friday. FREEPORT INDONESIA: Freeport-McMoRan Inc's Indonesian unit is close to reaching a deal that would allow the world's biggest publicly listed copper producer to temporarily resume concentrate exports, Indonesia's mining minister said on Thursday. CODELCO: Chile's state copper company Codelco produced 1.83 million tonnes of copper in 2016, of which 1.71 million tonnes came from its wholly-owned mines, down 1.4 percent from a year ago, the company said. TECHNICALS: LME copper may fall to the next support at $5,774 after breaking the $5,855 a tonne level, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said, as its bounce from the March 9 low of $5,652 has completed. ALUMINIUM: LME aluminium closed down 0.5 percent at $1,962.50 a tonne, but still posted its biggest quarterly gain in 6-1/2 years, up nearly 16 percent. The metal hit its highest since December 2014 on Thursday ahead of the Chinese manufacturing data. FUNDS: Copper and zinc are the two standouts among a brightening outlook for base metals, with supply constraints and China-driven demand set to lift prices in coming months, U.S. commodity hedge fund Blenheim Capital Management said. STOCKS: Copper stocks held in LME warehouses MCU-STOCKS, which have been declining for almost two straight weeks, fell another 6,375 tonnes on Thursday to 291,175 tonnes, exchange data showed. However, they remain well above their March 2 low of 196,425 tonnes. DOLLAR: The dollar surrendered early gains to trade little changed on Friday as a Federal Reserve official's seemingly dovish remarks and uninspiring data on the U.S. economy doused the sanguine mood from earlier this week. OTHER METALS: LME nickel ended the day down 1 percent at $10,030, while tin closed 0.1 percent higher at $20,175 a tonne. Zinc finished the day down 3.1 percent at $2,770 and lead ended 0.5 percent lower at $2,340.

Trump uses a Spanish accent to say "Puerto Rico" twice during a Hispanic Heritage Month event pic.twitter.com/v5qFTiqSjM — BuzzFeed News (@BuzzFeedNews) October 6, 2017
At a White House event honoring Hispanic Heritage Month on Friday, President Trump appeared to mock Hispanic people by using an exaggerated Spanish accent to say, "We are also praying for the people of Puerto Rico." Trump repeated it three times, to cheers and laughs from the crowd.
Trump has been lambasted for the federal government's response to the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. During his visit there Wednesday, Trump attempted to downplay the chaos and suffering that was occurring in the territory by passing out paper towels and supplies, but San Juan's mayor has loudly called out Trump for failing to respond adequately.

EVERETT, Wash. – A jury on Wednesday afternoon convicted John Reed of murdering a Snohomish County couple over a property dispute in 2016.
Reed had been on trial for weeks, charged with the brutal murders of his former Oso neighbors Patrick Shunn and Shunn's wife, Monique Patenaude.
The jury took less than 24 hours to convict him after beginning deliberations.
Reed was found guilty of murder in the first degree for the death of Shunn but only second-degree murder for killing his wife, Monique. Prosecutors say jurors told them they had a hard time believing Reed went to his old property with a plan to kill her – but believe once he murdered Monique, Patrick had to be next and laid in wait for him to return home.
Reed entered court Wednesday without showing emotion. The Shunn and Patenaude families heard the verdict they've been waiting to hear for more than two years.
The jury concluded Reed did not pre-plan Patenaude's murder; instead, jurors believe she was shot and killed in a short moment of time.
“They got hung up on whether the amount of time those three shots probably took, whether that was enough time for was premeditation,” said prosecutor Craig Matheson. “They indicated that was the vast majority of their deliberation time was talking about that particular fact.”
But the jury did find Reed guilty of premeditated murder for killing Shunn after he arrived to his home hours after his wife's death.
“For the families, I mean this is finally put to bed to a certain extent,” said Matheson. “I mean their loved ones are still dead but there's still closure, if you want to use that term. As far as the community goes, there's an end to this story. The guy who shot these two people has been convicted by a jury of his peers. The proper punishment will be imposed and they can kind of get on with things. But for the families, this is never going to be over.”
The jury heard testimony for nearly three weeks -- from investigators, doctors, and even John Reed himself, who described the killings of Patrick and Monique as self-defense. But the jury didn't buy it.
“If you discount his version of events, it's a pretty clear case,” said Matheson. “And if you don't believe what he had to say, the evidence is pretty clear.”
The victims' families left court without making any public statements.
Reed's defense attorney says he still believes his client's version of what happened in April 2016 and his claim that he killed the couple in self-defense.
“I've had a chance to know John for a year, I was hired last May,” said Phil Sayles. “I've had a chance to know his family. Thinking about it, I know him as a man, I know his family and it makes it really tough. I got to go back and tell his folks in a couple minutes and break the news to them. That's the tough part.”
The victims' families could speak out during Reed's sentencing, which is scheduled for early July.
It's expected Reed could spend the rest of his life behind bars without the possibility of parole.
A fixture of the London landscape and soundscape, Big Ben, is falling silent for four years. The bell will cease its regular tolling while extensive repairs are made to the famous clock tower that looms over the Palace of Westminster, the home of the British Parliament.
The massive bell will mark the hour for the last time at noon on Aug. 21 and then pause for four years while the Elizabeth Tower, which houses the Great Clock and the Great Bell, aka Big Ben, is restored. A larger restoration of the Parliament buildings is likely to begin in the early 2020s, according to a Parliament website.
Quieting Big Ben's mighty bongs will help preserve the hearing of workers involved in the project.
The keeper of the Great Clock, Steve Jaggs, said in a statement that the pause "is a significant milestone in this crucial conservation project." If you're in London next Monday you may want to accept Jaggs' invitation to gather in Parliament Square "to hear Big Ben's final bongs until they return in 2021." However, Big Ben will still bong for important national events such as New Year's Eve and Remembrance Sunday.
The Great Bell has chimed nearly every hour for the past 157 years. It has had previous breaks in service for maintenance and conservation in 2007, in 1983-1985 and in 1976. The 13.7-ton bell, which was forged in the 1850s, is accompanied by smaller chimes that ring out each quarter hour.
The Great Clock has a Victorian-era clockwork mechanism that triggers the bell and chimes. That mechanism and the clock's four faces will also get refurbished, which will require the faces to be covered.
To make sure Londoners don't get completely disoriented and lose track of the correct time, Jaggs says at least one clock face will remain visible. It will keep time with the aid of a modern electric motor, while the Victorian mechanism is being repaired.
UPDATE 3-Nestle takes food price rises in its stride
ZURICH, Aug 9 Nestle expects pressure from the rising price of ingredients for its products such as chocolate bars, coffee and soup to ease, helping it meet its target for increasing sales despite tough markets.
This is the fourth story in a five-part series on the issues surrounding Kinder Morgan's proposed expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, investigating the history, science, Indigenous reaction, politics and economics of the controversial project. Read part one, part two, part three and part four.
There's a lot riding on the federal government's decision to take over the Trans Mountain pipeline twinning project from Edmonton to its terminal in Burnaby.
Kinder Morgan agreed to carry on with its construction plan as part of Ottawa's offer to buy its Canadian assets, primarily the pipeline and its terminal, for $4.5 billion.
The federal purchase does not include the $7.4 billion construction budget, which is to be financed by Ottawa and Alberta. Kinder Morgan estimates that the first 20 years of construction and operation would generate $46.7 billion, including federal and provincial taxes paid. Over the same period, the company calculates that municipal tax payments over 20 years would total $922 million in B.C. and another $124 million in Alberta.
The Conference Board of Canada estimates the project would create the equivalent of 15,000 person-years of employment in construction and 37,000 direct, indirect and induced jobs each year it operates.
Benefits agreements have been signed with 19 communities, representing $8.6 million in infrastructure, education and training projects. Examples include $500,000 for improvements to Hope Community Park, $290,000 for trails and trades training in Barriere, $845,000 for community infrastructure and training in the Thompson Nicola Regional District, $390,000 for projects and training in Clearwater, $1.3 million to revitalize an Abbotsford golf course and $1.2 million for a new Vedder Greenway trail pedestrian bridge in Chilliwack.
There are another 43 “mutual benefit agreements” with Indigenous communities, 33 in B.C. and the rest in Alberta. Kinder Morgan says those agreements will see $400 million go to the communities, and agreements may be extended as the project proceeds.
Trans Mountain requires its contractors to have Indigenous monitors on its environmental inspection teams at all construction areas, advising on traditional land use and cultural values.
Beyond the direct jobs and community benefits agreements along the route, the project is a key step toward increased spill response capability on the B.C. coast. It also affects the supply of crude oil to southern B.C.'s last oil refinery and bigger refineries in Washington.
And then there are pending oil pipelines to the U.S., and another proposal to build a pipeline similar to the cancelled Northern Gateway pipeline across northern B.C.
Here's a closer look at the implications.
What happens if there's a spill
Spill response on the B.C. coast is the responsibility of Western Canada Marine Response Corp. (WCMRC), an industry-funded network of facilities and vessels that works with the Coast Guard to respond contain and clean up incidents.
As part of its Trans Mountain expansion, Kinder Morgan Canada committed $150 million to increased response equipment and bases, conditional on completion of the Trans Mountain pipeline twinning project.
That funding was suspended in April, along with all non-essential spending on the pipeline, with Kinder Morgan seeking assurances by the end of May that further delays and demands won't be imposed on a project that has already received federal and provincial approval.
WCMRC plans include response bases at Burrard Inlet, on the Lower Fraser River, Nanaimo, Port Alberni, Sidney, Beecher Bay in the Juan de Fuca Strait, as well as an offshore supply vessel to be based at Ogden Point in Victoria. Kinder Morgan's conditions laid down by the National Energy Board require that those facilities be up and running nine months before the Trans Mountain expansion begins operation.
Ogden Point is Victoria's cruise ship terminal, and may also be the location of a new spill response vessel financed by Kinder Morgan Canada if the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion proceeds. (Western Canada Marine Response Corp.)
The project suspension puts all that work on hold, said Michael Lowry, communications manager for WCMRC.
“We were close to signing leases in a lot of these spots,” Lowry said.
“We had construction vendors all lined up, tender packages ready to go to start construction this summer.”
The goal of the response bases is to reduce the maximum response time for Vancouver Harbour from six hours to two. The six-hour maximum would then be applied to the entire southern B.C. shipping lane, where in remote places the response time can be up to 72 hours.
In November 2016, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced an upgrade to marine spill response for the West Coast. It included two new large vessels capable of towing large freighters or other ships in distress, such as the U.S. tugboat and fuel barge that had run aground near Bella Bella on the remote B.C. coast.
“Canada has the longest coastline in the world, and it's a poorly kept secret that we haven't done enough to protect it,” Trudeau said after touring Vancouver harbour aboard a Coast Guard vessel.

About 224 cubic metres of heavy synthetic crude was spilled, affecting a residential area, a creek and the inlet shore after some of the oil ran down a storm drain outfall. Approximately 95 per cent of the released oil was recovered. (Western Canada Marine Response Corp.)(Western Canada Marine Response Corp.)
That national project was not a direct response to the potential for increased tanker traffic. The B.C. government calculates that while all eyes are on the potential seven-fold increase in oil tankers, the Trans Mountain expansion represents only a six per cent increase in total shipping.
There has never been a spill of crude oil tanker cargo in B.C., after 64 years of Trans Mountain delivering crude to the Westridge tanker terminal at Burnaby, and daily Alaska tanker traffic past B.C. for nearly 50 years. Recent spills included a fuel system rupture of the freighter MV Marathassa in Vancouver harbour in 2015, spilling bunker fuel, a semi-refined product carried in large quantities by many ocean-going vessels.
Oil price and investment
Alberta oil is “landlocked,” as a U.S. protest network's strategy first described it in 2008. Pipeline backers point to the discount on Western Canada Select, as Alberta heavy oil is called by traders, and West Texas Intermediate, the similar grade of U.S. crude.
Between 2012 and 2017, the price difference averaged $16.54 a barrel. As the Fraser Institute pointed out in a May report, The Cost of Pipeline Constraints in Canada, the 2018 price spread is $26.30 a barrel, which works out to an annual loss of $15.8 billion on Canadian oil.
Calculating the investment impact of cancelling third major pipeline project is less certain. The Justin Trudeau government effectively killed the Northern Gateway pipeline by banning crude tankers docking on B.C.'s North Coast, then added downstream greenhouse gas requirements to the Energy East pipeline from Alberta to the Atlantic coast that caused Trans Canada Corp. to abandon the project.
Energy East would have converted existing gas pipelines, moving Alberta oil to refineries that currently depend on imported oil from Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and other sources.
Oil refineries
With Imperial Oil's refinery at Port Moody long dismantled, the last remaining source of refined fuels in southern B.C. is near the Trans Mountain Burnaby terminal. The Burnaby refinery was acquired from Chevron in April 2017 by Parkland Fuel Corp,, a Red Deer-based company that also owns Columbia Fuels on Vancouver Island.
The $1.5 billion purchase includes more than 100 Chevron-branded filling stations in B.C., marine fuelling stations and an aviation fuels business supplying Vancouver International Airport.
Trans Mountain, one of few pipelines in North America used for shipping refined fuels and crude oil in batches, also supplies the Parkland refinery. News of the Trans Mountain expansion prompted Parkland CEO Bob Espey to express his concerns to the B.C. and Alberta governments.
“Our company's view is that any measure that restricts the supply of oil to British Columbia would be negative for both the economies and B.C. and Alberta,” Espey said in a statement. “We are committed to doing what we can to serve our customers and will continue to monitor the issue closely.”
The Cherry Point refinery in Washington State(BP)
Washington state's five refineries, at Cherry Point, Anacortes and Ferndale, receive crude from the Trans Mountain pipeline as well as by tankers from Alaska. With Trans Mountain now over-subscribed, Alberta oil is moving by rail in greater volumes, winding down the Fraser Canyon to enter the U.S. at Bellingham.
A 2017 Washington state ecology department report says the volume of Alberta oil shipped by train to the state has more than doubled, from 7,000 barrels a day in 2012 to 15,000. That translates to 80 to 90 rail cars per week carrying Alberta heavy crude through B.C.
Other pipelines
Alberta's oilsands crude is in demand in California and the U.S. Gulf Coast, where refineries are built to handle heavy oil such as Venezuela's oilsands product. Some critics say much of Trans Mountain's additional capacity would go south, rather than by Aframax-sized tankers across the Pacific to Asia.
Enbridge is working on its Line 3 replacement, from Hardisty, Alberta across Saskatchewan and into the U.S. Construction of the Saskatchewan and Manitoba sections is scheduled to start in the fall of 2018.
U.S. President Donald Trump carried out his campaign promise to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which faced similar international opposition as Trans Mountain does today. Keystone would run from Hardisty to Nebraska, strengthening Alberta's historic ties to the U.S. petroleum industry.
Another project that could benefit from Trans Mountain's expansion being cancelled is Eagle Spirit Energy, an Indigenous-led effort to build a pipeline across northern B.C. similar to Northern Gateway.
Eagle Spirit founder Calvin Helin has backing from the Aquilini Group, real estate developers and owners of the Vancouver Canucks. A lawyer from Lax Kw'alaams on the northwest coast, Helin has worked to secure Indigenous consent for a pipeline route that terminates at Grassy Point, in Lax Kw'alaams territory.
Where the Trans Mountain expansion is opposed by the Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh, Eagle Spirit may have consent for the Grassy Point terminal, which could accommodate larger crude carriers for Asian ports.
Another coastal option is a refinery proposal backed by Black Press chairman David Black, that was originally to be supplied by the Northern Gateway pipeline to a site near Kitimat.
The Trudeau government's decision to ban crude oil tankers from the North Coast is being challenged in court by Eagle Spirit, but Black has since focused on an innovation that would see Alberta bitumen dried to a solid and shipped by rail hopper cars for processing.
In the event of a land spill, the product could be picked up without significant impact, Black said.

Dozens of ideas were offered up by residents at Monday night's meeting. New Denver has until April to find new doctors or face losing round-the-clock health emergency health service.
Two weeks after nearly losing their round-the-clock emergency ward, residents of New Denver are rolling up their sleeves to try to find a permanent solution to their doctor crisis.
And bribery isn't necessarily off the table.
“Do we want to give them a car to move here?,” asked one participant at an ideas workshop, held Monday night at a school gym in the community.
There were other financial carrots floated at the meeting: free housing, free trips for fishing and hunting, or have the community pay for a doctor's medical training or exams.
No ideas were beyond the pale as the community wrestles with ways of trying to ease its doctor shortage, which prompted Interior Health to announce last month it was cutting the hours of the community's emergency department. An instant and angry reaction to the idea prompted provincial health officials to back down for now, but the cut will go ahead in April if more doctors can't be found to staff the facility.
Monday's meeting brought about 50 people to brainstorm ideas from what incentives the community can offer, to how to lobby for policy change, how to recruit new doctors, and how the community can ‘Love Our Locums'- how to welcome visiting doctors and possibly entice them to stay.
“Basically we are collecting ideas from the community that we haven't thought of yet as a committee,” says Danica Hammond, a member of the Chamber of Commerce's health committee, which is spearheading the recruitment effort. “We want to find out what direction the community wants to go in, and get a sense of what ideas are popular.”
Among the ideas presented were lobbying Ottawa to pressure the province to ensure health care is being provided; community fundraising to offer doctors cash to stay; sharing doctors with nearby communities; sending out more feelers to recruitment agencies; and pushing for change to health policies to make it easier to recruit foreign doctors to the area, or for nurse-practitioners to do the work doctors now do. At another table, participants built up a case for continuing the 24-hour service, including what could happen if the service is lost.
“It impacts our businesses and schools,” said one participant. “People don't want to live here without health care.”
“It's death by 1,000 cuts,” said another. “This is non-negotiable.”
Hammond says she was impressed by much of what she heard.
“There was some legal advice that was new, and somebody came forward who wants to help us with fundraising,” she said after the meeting. “That's exciting because there've been a of of recruitment ideas we don't have the funds for.”
Dozens of ideas were floated during the 90-minute session. Hammond says the Chamber committee will now collect and collate the suggestions, and begin to implement what they can.
With only three months to solve a years-old problem, however, the community is feeling the pressure to get moving on the issue.
New Denver Mayor Ann Bunka said she was impressed with the turnout and ideas being presented.
“The community is completely involved in this,” she said. “I know there's going to be fabulous ideas we haven't thought of, so it's great.”
SAN FRANCISCO Autonomous car start-up Zoox said on Monday that former top U.S. safety regulator Mark Rosekind was joining the Silicon Valley company as its chief safety innovation officer, underscoring the key role regulation will play in the nascent autonomous driving sector.
The hiring of Rosekind, the former head of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), is a major play for Zoox, which has remained secretive about its plans and strategy, and a hire that shows the importance of regulation in how self-driving technology rolls out.
Zoox said Rosekind would lead the company's efforts to "safely develop, test and deploy autonomous vehicles."
In a statement, Rosekind said that Zoox had "an integrated, full-system approach to transforming mobility that is unique across the autonomous vehicle landscape."
Zoox envisions fleets of autonomous vehicles in urban centers, and has developed a full-stack system comprising both hardware and software.
NHTSA under Rosekind issued voluntary guidelines for carmakers and others in the self-driving space last September for the technology behind self-driving cars.
In January, General Motors Co hired NHTSA's chief counsel, Paul Hemmersbaugh, to serve as policy director at GM with a focus on "transportation as a service." Hemmersbaugh's resume describes him as the principal author of the NHTSA federal automated vehicles policy.
Alphabet Inc has also hired several former top NHTSA officials as consultants, or to work at its Waymo self-driving car unit.
Another former NHTSA executive, Kevin Vincent, who was Hemmersbaugh's predecessor in 2015, was named director of Regulatory and Safety Affairs at Faraday Future, a China-backed electric vehicle start-up.

Ben Levitt has held on to the Tory nomination for Hamilton West-Ancaster-Dundas.
The young worker for MP David Sweet won the provincial nomination for a second time after it was organized again due to a dispute from last year's nomination meeting.
He defeated Vincent Samuel, a former 2015 Conservative federal candidate and organizer for Doug Ford's leadership campaign in Hamilton, in a meeting at the Ancaster Fairgrounds Tuesday night.
Party president Jag Badwal made the announcement at about 9:30 p.m. The results were not known but CBC Hamilton reported that "it was a resounding victory for Levitt. Margin of victory was 4 to 1."
* Coach hits 9-month high after results best estimates
* Apple hits record ahead of quarterly results
* Pfizer down after revenue misses estimates
* Fed kicks off two-day meeting; statement due Wednesday
* Indexes up: Dow 0.21 pct, S&P up 0.14 pct, Nasdaq 0.11 pct (Updates to early afternoon)

May 2 U.S. stocks were modestly higher in early afternoon trading on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq Composite eking out another record high, helped by an Apple-led rise in technology stocks.
However, investors held off from making big bets as the two-day Federal Reserve meeting kicked off.
The Fed is widely expected to stand pat on interest rates, but investors are awaiting the central bank's statement on Wednesday for hints on the possibility of a rate hike in June.
The markets' gains were capped by a decline in auto stocks after automakers reported a fall in new vehicle sales for April. Ford dropped 3.8 percent, while General Motors fell 2.8 percent.
"I think the auto sales numbers have caused the market to take a step back," said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
"I think people are reading too much into that. There's a fear that is building on last quarter's GDP numbers that the consumer is pulling back, which we don't think is the case."
Data last week showed the U.S. economy grew at its slowest pace in three years in the first quarter. But, Schutte said strong corporate earnings have helped hold the market up.
"With earnings rising, that is backdrop for positive stock returns moving forward."
Overall, profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.9 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
At 12:41 a.m. ET (1641 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 43.41 points, or 0.21 percent, at 20,956.87.
The S&P 500 was up 3.36 points, or 0.14 percent, at 2,391.69 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 6.94 points, or 0.11 percent, at 6,098.54.
Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, with the technology index's 0.39 percent rise leading the advancers.
Apple hit a record high for the second straight day. The iPhone maker is due to report results after the close of market.
A 0.3 percent fall in consumer staples led the laggard.
CVS Health was down 2.8 percent at $79.70, while Archer Daniels Midland fell 8.2 percent to $41.98, both after reporting results.
Dow component Pfizer was down 1 percent at $33.43 after the drugmaker's quarterly revenue missed estimates.
Advanced Micro Devices tumbled 18.9 percent to $11.04 after the chipmaker's second-quarter gross margins forecast raised some concerns.
Coach rose as much as 12.2 percent to a nine-month high of $43.47 after the handbag maker reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,477 to 1,311. On the Nasdaq, 1,542 issues fell and 1,232 advanced.
The S&P 500 index showed 43 new 52-week highs and nine new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 129 new highs and 36 new lows. (Reporting by Tanya Agrawal in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza)

Learn what the new Taylor Academy Series brings to the mid-range acoustic market.
Taylor Guitars are known for making well-designed, and well-built instruments with premium materials. All of this usually comes with a premium price tag. With Taylor's Academy Series, all of that acoustic goodness is now available in a reasonable price range.
We received the Academy 10e and 12e models, with the 10e following the shape of a traditional Dreadnought, and the 12e a Grand Concert. The basic materials, features, and costs are the same though; Sitka spruce top, layered sapele sides and back, ebony fingerboards with a 24.87” scale and Taylor's EB-Pickup and tuner electronics package. A great feature that's here in the design is the lower bout, where a player's picking arm usually rests on the edge of the guitar body, a nicely beveled edge is introduced to reduce stress on the picking hand's forearm. This really helps relieve any undue stress, especially during long sessions, regardless of standing or sitting positions. As with their higher-end guitars, the overall fit, finish, and feel is amazingly consistent. Both guitars are also presented in a nice satin finish.
A lot of players who'd normally prefer a cutaway guitar for higher fret access might skip over these, thinking it's not meant for soloing or lead parts, and perhaps would be better suited for songwriter/strummer/non-lead players. However, the neck joint is quite smooth, and access to most of the upper-register frets is quite easy with little adjustment required. After using these for a live gig, re-working some lead/solo parts to accommodate the non-cutaway design wasn't that difficult, and playing more in the lower registers brought an added fullness to the arrangements. The byproduct is not sounding like an electric guitarist taking the same approach to an acoustic. The neck has a modern feel, like a lot of Taylors, with a slim profile and matching satin finish.
Both have plenty of depth in their own individual ways. There is excellent top end and punch as well. Each one does it in their own style – so, the big differences? The Dreadnought is a bit deeper, and more traditional sounding, while the Grand Concert is a bit tighter and has a bit more projection. There's plenty of crossovers between the two in a sense, but it will come down to individual tastes, sound-wise. That said, the consistent feel and nice blend of warmth and projection will make this a tough decision to make. It might come down to which feels more comfortable against your body and in your hands, because acoustically, both are beautiful-sounding.
The electronics are Taylor's own system, which also sports an on-board tuner, with the endpin doubling as a 1⁄4” input jack. While only having a volume and tone control, it's still quite flexible, and simple enough to keep things from getting boomy or brittle through a PA system.
The only downside, and it's quite small, is the battery situation; it uses two small watch batteries to power the pickup and tuner. It makes for a small and neat package, but imagining a touring situation, and having to find a pair of these batteries at a local 7-11 in an unfamiliar town might be more problematic, than say finding a more common battery like a 9-volt. Thankfully both guitars come with Taylor gig bags, and stocking up on a few of these small, disk-like batteries won't take up too much space in the front pocket.
PROS:
well built, well designed, excellent price, sound and feel.
CONS:
slightly uncommon battery situation for the electronics.
PRICE:
$599 (10e) and $649 (12e)

Australia shares poised to fall after Fed rate hike, oil prices dip, NZ flat
June 15 Australian shares are expected to open lower on Thursday, mirroring a dip in Wall Street after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates and crude oil prices slumped to their lowest close in seven months.

Crude oil prices fell nearly 4 percent, hit by an unexpec
U.S Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has blasted a new U.N. report that attacks Israeli actions in the Middle East, in what she says is the latest sign of the U.N.'s “unfair bias” in how it handles the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The report, from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, was submitted in response to a resolution by the Human Rights Council — a body which Haley has repeatedly criticized for its own anti-Israel bias and the questionable human rights record of some of its members.
The report, titled, “Ensuring accountability and justice for all violations of international law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem,” evaluates Israel's compliance with a number of U.N. resolutions and reports, including demands to deconstruct its security barrier on the West Bank, which has been credited with massively reducing terrorist attacks.
The report adds:
The High Commissioner notes the repeated failure to comply with the calls for accountability made by the entire human rights system and urges Israel to conduct prompt, impartial and independent investigations of all alleged violations of international human rights law and all allegations of international crimes. Furthermore, the High Commissioner calls upon Israel to ensure that all victims have access to remedies and reparation.
The report also notes previous recommendations, including an anti-Israel boycott call for “investigations of the activities of companies and financial institutions profiting from Israeli settlements, and for such practices to be ended and for reparation to be provided to Palestinians affected.”
Haley took issue with the report's focus on Israel, noting that it “brushed over” terror attacks by Hamas and other terrorist groups attacking Israel, and ignored the human rights abuses of other countries.
“This report is just the latest example of the Human Rights Council singling out Israel rather than focusing on the world's actual human rights abusers,” she said in a statement.
“Not only does it undermine the credibility of the Human Rights Council on human rights issues, but it once again highlights the unfair bias of the UN when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” she said.
Haley also took issue with the recommendation that the U.N. General Assembly ask the International Court of Justice to issue an advisory opinion on Israel, something her office says is out of the purview of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.
Israel's Ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon also condemned the report, saying, “This obsession with Israel has crossed all lines.” Danon accused the office of offering to “advise and support” efforts to create what he called a “blacklist” database of companies working in the region so that the international community could threaten a boycott.
The latest report comes a week after Haley visited the Human Rights Council's headquarters in Geneva and warned that the U.S. could leave the council if it didn't reform its voting and bias against America's ally in the Middle East.
The same week, Breitbart News reported on an upcoming report by the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia and submitted in the name of Secretary General Antonio Guterres, blaming Israeli settlements for a host of Palestinian grievances for everything from excessive use of force to building parks in the West Bank so as to “entrench” Israel's presence.

PALMDALE, Calif. (AP) — A couple and their two baby girls were killed Tuesday when their car veered into oncoming traffic and was smashed by a van on a Mojave Desert highway, authorities said.
The couple, who were in their 20s, and a girl about a year old died when their green Kia sedan veered out of control at about 10:30 a.m. on the Sierra Highway in Palmdale, north of Los Angeles, investigators said.
Another girl, also believed to be about a year old, died at a hospital.
The adults were wearing seatbelts and the children were in car seats, authorities said. Their names were not immediately released.
The car was T-boned by a vanpool from the Antelope Valley Transit Authority. It wasn't carrying passengers but the driver was taken to a hospital for treatment of non-life threatening injuries, authorities said.
Television news footage showed a passenger van with its front end crushed and a completely demolished car.
"We believe speed may be an issue" and investigators would use skid marks to help determine how fast the car was going when it crossed into oncoming traffic, Los Angeles County sheriff's Detective Rowell Quemuel told KABC-TV.
KNOXVILLE (WATE) – At Salon Absinthe in Knoxville, pricing for men's and women's haircuts is no longer based on gender, but instead, the time and complexity of the cut.
“Gender has been so stereotyped in our minds that this is what a woman are, and this is what a man is. A woman is supposed to have long hair. A man is supposed to have short hair.” said Lillith Vaughn, a beautician at Salon Absinthe.
The salon's owner, Scarlet Strange, was inspired to keep pricing fair. Vaughn says it didn't make sense to charge women with pixie-cuts the same price as women with long hair.
Before every appointment, stylists will consult with the client about what they want done. Based on that conversation, pricing varies.
“It's 2017. It's not really like that anymore. You can have whatever hair your want, whatever gender you are or want to identify as.” said Vaughn.
Salon Absinthe is located at 7425 S. Northshore Drive.

Justin Bieber will reportedly not face charges for a February incident during which he allegedly head-butted a man at a West Hollywood restaurant, TMZ reported.
According to the outlet, Bieber's lawyers refused a sit-down between the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the singer. The victim – who, according to a previous statement from the department, did not wish to press charges – further allegedly stopped responding to inquiries from authorities, said TMZ.
The department said in their February statement about the incident that police responded to a “battery report call” around 2 a.m. at restaurant Serafina Sunset. There, authorities were told by a witness “that he saw Justin Bieber get into two separate altercations with two bartenders.”
Bieber was asked to leave by the witness but refused, according to the statement. The witness said that “a few minutes later he saw Mr. Bieber arguing with a patron, when Mr. Bieber suddenly head-butted the patron.”
The 23-year-old was no longer at the restaurant when police arrived, said the statement. Further, the victim had no “visible marks” and refused to file a police report, as well as receive medical attention.
The department said at the time that they were gathering information about the incident in the event that the victim decided to press charges at a later date.
Caroline McBride, a spokeswoman for the Serafina Restaurant Group, said in a statement to PEOPLE in February that they knew “very little” about the incident.

“We can assure you that nobody from our staff was involved, nor did we call the police,” the statement read. “We always have a pleasant experience with Mr. Bieber whenever he comes to Serafina.”

SEATTLE -- Thursday is the last day of May and, with the current forecast, May will end up with an average temperature of a little above 61 degrees. This will make May 2018 the warmest May on record for Seattle.
The average temperature of each day is calculated by adding the morning low and the afternoon high, then dividing by two.
This is an old record. So far, the warmest May ever was in 1940 when the average temperature was 60.5 degrees. This includes information from the Federal Building in Seattle which goes back to the 1890s.
Significantly, since 2014, we have had the warmest February, March, April, June, July, October, November and December on record. For you weather geeks, here are the records with their dates, and the previous records.
Notice how old the previous records were:
February 48.8 (2015) old record 48.7 (1977)
March 50.5 (2015) old record 50.3 (1992)
April 56.7 (2016) old record 53.6 (1977)
June 67.7 (2015) old record 64.9 (1992)
July 71.2 (2015) old record 69.5 (2009)
October 58.0 (2014) old record 56.4 (1965)
November 50.9 (2016) old record 49.4 (1965)
December 45.3 (2014) old record 45.2 (1969)
For the months not on the list above, we had the SECOND warmest August and September last year:
2nd warmest August 70.3 (2017) record 71.1 (1967)
2nd warmest September 64.7 (2017) record 65.7 (1967)
Only January has not been the warmest or second warmest during the last four years.
We are on track to tie the record for the driest May ever with 0.12” of rain. This would tie the rainfall for May of 1992.
So far, the “Long-Range Prognostics” from the Climate Prediction Center show that June will be starting out with normal temps (upper 60s) and below-normal rainfall for the first week, and then probably go above-normal temp-wise after that.

Wednesday on Fox News Channel's “Outnumbered,” former House Speaker Newt Gingrich attributed the shooting at a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, VA that had resulted in five people hospitalized, including House Majority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA), to what he described as an “increasing intensity of hostility on the left.”
“It certainly was a shock this morning,” Gingrich said. “I don't think any of us expected today to take this turn. But it's part of a pattern, as you saw the sign this guy was holding. You've had an increasing intensity of hostility on the left. Look, I talk to college students regularly who say to me if they are openly for Trump, they get threatened.”
“The intensity on the left is very real,” he added. “Whether it is somebody, as so-called comedian, holding up the president's head in blood or it's right here in New York City, a play that shows the president being assassinated, or it's Democratic leading national politicians who are so angry they have to use vulgarity because they can find any common language to talk. This intensity I think has been building since election night.”

B.C. Liberal leadership candidate Todd Stone's campaign has disclosed that it has cancelled membership applications from 1,349 people after being questioned by party officials about the lack of email addresses.
“Last Friday, our senior campaign team was contacted by the party about a situation involving missing email addresses on a group of pending membership applications submitted by our campaign – mainly from prospective members whose first language is not English,” Stone campaign chair Peter Fassbender said in a statement Friday.
With voting underway since Thursday and being completed at 5 p.m. on Saturday, the Stone campaign agreed not to let the applications be activated to vote.
“Upon being informed of the situation, Todd immediately requested a full investigation to determine exactly what had transpired,” Fassbender said. “Upon conclusion of that, Todd and our senior team presented those findings to the party rules committee including a recommendation that the membership applications in question – 1,349 in total – not be included in this voting process to ensure the integrity of the result.
“The party agreed with the recommendation and the individuals in question will not be able to cast a ballot because of their incomplete application.”
2. We have handled all issues with membership applications rapidly, strictly, and by the book. We informed each campaign of their number of forms not accepted, and the reasons for those decisions. #bclib18 #bcpoli — Emile Scheffel (@Emile_BC) February 2, 2018
B.C. Liberal Party executive director Emile Scheffel said the party's inspection of new memberships included checking email addresses. He issued a statement Friday that does not clarify if other campaigns had similar issues.
“In any case where the party was not satisfied that an email address was the applicant's own as required by the rules, those applications were not accepted,” Scheffel said. “Based on that process, we are confident that only those membership applications that have met all of the party's criteria for membership, including those applications submitted by the Todd Stone campaign, have been accepted.”

MOGADISHU, April 10 Somali security forces rescued a hijacked Indian cargo dhow on Monday, but pirates took the 11-strong crew with them when they fled to land, authorities said.
A local mayor initially said the pirates only abducted one crew member, but the state's vice-president later said all 11 crew had been taken away by the pirates. Two were later rescued and nine remain missing, said Mohamed Hashi Arabey, vice president of Galmudug state.

As we know from past football seasons, the most meaningful way significant others show their support for their NFL beaus is through their adorably sporty and chic outfits. And to cheer on her boyfriend, New England Patriots wide receiver Danny Amendola, at the 2018 Super Bowl, model Olivia Culpo packed enough pom pom beanies to supply the entire Boston team. Read on to see every single outfit she sported this weekend.
During her first stop in Minneapolis, she hit up the Justin Timberlake Man of the Woods listening party in an outfit made specifically for the KiraKira phone app. She was in a mesh top with an embellished high-shine silver skirt topped off with a matching silver puffer coat.

Prior to the big game, Culpo made a stop at Jenny McCarthy's SiriusXM show and got very candid about her and Amendola's love life. When asked if he takes a break from getting busy in the bedroom before games she replied: “Nope, that doesn't happen,” Culpo said. “I've never heard that one.”
McCarthy's husband Donnie Wahlberg chimed in, “That's only in Rocky.”
BRISBANE, Australia — Alexander Zverev has powered Germany through to the quarterfinals of the Davis Cup World Group, beating Australia's Nick Kyrgios 6-2, 7-6 (3), 6-2 in the first reverse singles Sunday.
Germany went into Sunday's play leading 2-1 after a double win Saturday. The final singles match between Australia's Alex de Minaur and Jan-Lennard Struff was not played, giving Germany a 3-1 win.
"It's an amazing feeling, hopefully this is just the beginning for us," the fifth-ranked Zverev said.
German captain Michael Kolhmann agreed.
"Against a really strong Australian team it makes us really confident," he said. "We showed we have a lot of good players, a lot of strong players. We showed that we are able to go further than this."
Germany will play either Britain or Spain in the quarterfinals from April 6-8.
No. 14-ranked Kyrgios looked frustrated from the start of the match on hard courts at Pat Rafter Arena, and required a second-set medical timeout to receive treatment on his right arm.
Kyrgios was clearly restricted ahead of the second-set tiebreak, earning a point penalty to trail 4-0 after slamming his racket into the ground following another unforced error — he made 34 in the match.
"My biggest weapon (serve) was not really there and that affects the rest of my game," he said.
Australia captain Lleyton Hewitt said the scoreline wasn't indicative of the closeness of the tie.

A blog post claiming poll fraud in Salvador Benedicto town has got the wrong vote counts. Then the Comelec and Namfrel officials deny ever making the statements attributed to them.
Published 10:05 PM, April 24, 2018
Claim: A blog post by philrepublicnews.com on December 26, 2017, claimed that Vice President Maria Leonor "Leni" Robredo got votes from "dead voters" in Salvador Benedicto, Negros Occidental. The post was referring to individuals who allegedly used the names of deceased people that were still on the voters' list.
As a result, Marcos supposedly received only 153 votes in the municipality, while Robredo got 7,879 votes.
The information reportedly came from the National Citizens' Movement for Free Elections (Namfrel) and from officials of the Commission on Elections (Comelec) in Bacolod City.
"Bacolod election officials have determined that more than 22,000 votes (that's 7,879 more than yesterday) so far in the the province of Negros Occidental are null and void because the voters don't appear to be living," said the post, supposedly quoting the news.
This blog post has resurfaced on social media amid the ongoing recount of votes from the 2016 vice presidential polls, in relation to the election protest filed by Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr against Robredo before the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET).
At least 3 other blog posts have carried the same story as of this posting.
Rating: FALSE
The facts: Based on election results from the Comelec Transparency Server, Robredo got only 5,293 votes, while Marcos received 628 votes in Salvador Benedicto, Negros Occidental, with 100% of votes transmitted.
VP Candidate Votes Robredo, Maria Leonor 5,293 Escudero, Francis Joseph 1,901 Cayetano, Alan Peter 836 Marcos, Ferdinand Jr 628 Trillanes, Antonio IV 410 Honasan, Gringo II 166
Rappler also verified the allegations with Namfrel and Comelec.
Namfrel secretary general Eric Alvia told Rappler on Monday, April 23, "No report from [our] Bacolod chapter issued such statement."
Comelec-Bacolod City Election Officer Mavil Majarucon Sia clarified that she could only speak for the city, and not Salvador Benedicto town. Nonetheless, she said their office had not received any reports of "dead people" voting in the city in 2016.
A Comelec-Negros Occidental official, who requested not to be named, also denied that such incidents happened in the province.
The official also questioned the claim that over half of the voters in Salvador Benedicto are supposedly "dead." The town has 14,277 registered voters, with 12,460 of them voting in the May 2016 polls.
The official explained to Rappler that, on election day, the voters' lists inside polling precincts contain photos of the voters. This allows election inspectors to identify the actual voter.
The official also argued that the media as well as watchdogs were very vigilant in the province, and they would have picked up on this claim if it were true.
The official then challenged those who have proof of such claims to submit it to them for verification, and even invited them to the province for fact-finding investigations.
Both Comelec officials also explained to Rappler that, before the polls, the voters' lists go through hearings by an election registration board (ERB), which has the local civil registrar as one of its members. In these hearings, the names of deceased persons are deleted from the voters' list. (READ: Why ghosts are still listed as voters)
The blog post did not provide a link to a news report containing the "dead voters" claim, nor mention the exact source of its quotes. One of the blog posts that ran the same story almost word-for-word linked to a page with the domain newstv1.altervista.org as its source. The said domain is now suspended.

SINCE President Emmerson Mnangagwa came into power through a military-driven process after the army forced out disgraced authoritarian ruler Robert Mugabe at gunpoint (yes it was and Muckraker partly has no problem with that if for a moment we refer to the Bible, Matthew, Chapter 26, verse 52 which says those who live by the sword die by the sword; but, of course, from a democratic perspective it is problematic), this pot stirrer has been careful not to rain on the new president's parade. It is not good to prevent someone from enjoying their moment of glory; spoil other people's parties no matter how they were done.
However, being the public watchdog Muckraker has been keeping an eagle's eye on Mnangagwa's moves. We cannot forget that he was Mugabe's enforcer, hence the need to monitor his moves and actions closely to see if he is willing to make a clean break with the past. Just like most members of the public, we are giving him the benefit of the doubt, but he must not squander the opportunity by learning and forgetting nothing from history.
Lawyers
Mnangagwa is a lawyer by training and that is good to have someone with that sort of knowledge and sophistication at the helm of the country.
Lawyers have existed since time immemorial, helping to develop constitutions and laws in an attempt to maintain peace and order in societies and communities. They have been useful in advancing human civilisation and development, ensuring constitutionalism, justice and the rule of law are always observed.
Hence, lawyers have profound analytical skills: A great lawyer must be analytical and logical, thus able to readily make sense of a large volume of information. They have or rather should have some rational thinking capacity; discerning minds; research skills; creativity; good interpersonal relations; perseverance, scholastic habits and good communication, reading and writing skills, among other things. That is what a good lawyer must have. Only poor or mediocre lawyers lack of these qualities.
Illegalities
While Mnangagwa may not be Eddison Zvobgo (he was brilliant) in terms of legal brain and thinking, he has demonstrated he is also a thinker in a way; well sometimes. That is why Muckraker is rather bothered and cannot understand why he is perpetrating so many illegalities in office over such a short period he has been president. Is it because of oversight, lack of attention to detail or impunity?
This government, which has a number of lawyers in its ranks, has been allowing unconstitutional and illegal things to happen under Mnangagwa's watch. These things may appear small at the beginning, but that is what eventually destroys the credibility of leaders and their governments.
Last week, for instance, Mnangagwa appointed a new cabinet full of deadwood — old wine in new bottles. The new ministers were sworn into office on Monday. Apart from the ministers being mostly lacklustre and hopeless, there was a problem of legality involved. Mnangagwa committed a schoolboy blunder by appointing more than five unelected ministers, which forced him into a quick retreat and reshuffle of his shoddy cabinet.
The president was sloppy. In terms of the Section 104 of the constitution, members of the cabinet must be drawn from parliament. However, he is only allowed to appoint up to five ministers from outside parliament “chosen for their professional skills and competence”. This is meant to accommodate technocrats and improve the quality of ministers in relation to skills and competency.
Obviously, there is always, of course, a major risk that a president may use this latitude to appoint his or her friends, relatives or cronies who might have not contested elections, lost or feared the polls.
Bungling
In a bid to appoint new faces into cabinet while rewarding factional loyalists and army commanders who helped him in, Mnangagwa made a serious blunder in the process by appointing more than the five ministers outside parliament as stipulated in the constitution and law.
This forced him to make a swift volte-face within 24 hours. Something had to be done; even an embarrassing intervention was ok. So Lazarus Dokora became the major casualty of the reshuffle, losing the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education. Chris Mutsvangwa and Professor Clever Nyathi were also affected.
Petronella Kagonye came in as Minister of Labour, boosting the gender equation which was grossly unbalanced with only three women in cabinet. So three non-MP ministers who had been appointed were removed and accommodated as special advisers to the president.
Some said the somersault showed Mnangagwa listened to the people on Dokora and other such useless ministers, but the truth is that the move was designed to correct a serious and embarrassing constitutional howler the president had committed. It had nothing to do with listening to the people as some ignoramuses and bootlickers would have us believe.
More gaffes
By the time Mnangagwa blundered on the cabinet appointment; his office had already made yet another legal blooper when it announced the dissolution of the previous Mugabe cabinet on last Monday. In that bungle, the president's office had cited section 108(1)(c.) of the constitution as the basis of that action.
As legal guru Alex Magaisa said, the move was wrong. The president could not have dissolved cabinet because it had already been dissolved anyway by operation of law the moment that he took the oath of office on November 24 2017.
Section 108(1)(c.) states that “the office of a Minister or Deputy Minister becomes vacant … upon the assumption of office by a new president”. So this means cabinet stood automatically dissolved when Mnangagwa became president and as such he could not dissolve a cabinet which no longer existed at law. The question is: Was this an honest mistake, negligence or ignorance? Well, or all of these combined? The same applies to the appointment of serving generals in cabinet. As Magaisa said, there is nothing wrong with former military personnel being appointed into civilian roles in government or even the private sector. It happens everywhere in the world.
However, there are rules to be followed. Thus, one must retire from the military first before assuming civilian duties. This much is evident in section 208(4) of the constitution which states that “serving members of the security services must not be employed or engaged in civilian institutions except in periods of public emergency”, Magaisa observes.
No public emergency has been declared in Zimbabwe. To prevent a legal mess, the appointment of Air Marshall Perrance Shiri and army Major-General Sibusiso Moyo, both serving generals, as cabinet ministers should only have been done after their retirement from office in the security structures. Surely, this must be obvious. You do not need to be a lawyer to understand this.
Further, the appointment of the vice-presidents, provided for in Section 14 of Schedule 6 to the constitution, must be done “without delay”. Mnangagwa has so far failed to do so. This is yet another violation of the constitution and the law. Yet the biggest violation of the constitution by Mnangagwa and his government so far has been how he came in. This is a big issue. In any reasonably democratic, civilised and progressive nation, Mnangagwa's ascendancy would have been successfully challenged in court.
Muckraker is not talking about the military coup here. That is obviously an easy one. A coup can never be a democratic way of gaining power, in Zimbabwe or anywhere else in the civilised world. People only accepted and tolerated it because they wanted Mugabe to go at all costs.
The real problem is how Mnangagwa came in after the coup. He did not follow the constitution, both the national and Zanu PF constitutions. This is common cause, but very problematic and even dangerous. That is why elections are needed to correct these grave aberrations.
See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil
Special advisor to President Emmerson Mnangagwa Chris Mutsvangwa is unsurprisingly miffed at the justified criticism of both his boss' choice of cabinet and the blunders made in doing so.
Hence, his retort: “Leave our president alone. Give him a chance. He means well for Zimbabwe and the people of Zimbabwe are solidly behind him. Please, do not try him before he has even started. Don't condemn him before he has even started.”
Mutsvangwa was speaking during an address at a Mashonaland West provincial coordinating committee meeting at the weekend.
“I am saying this because all the papers have started attacking the new president. He is being judged in 37 hours more than someone who has been in power for 37 years (Mugabe).”
Well, it is true Mnangagwa needs to be given a chance and time, but he cannot be left alone when he makes such schoolboy blunders.
Unless Mutsvangwa now wants us to go back to the Mugabe era only a few weeks after the dictator was removed.
The truth is the media has been lenient with Mnangagwa; Mutsvangwa knows or should know that. There are too many things which he is being allowed to get away with because we all want change and progress.
Even statements like claiming that “the voice of the people is the voice of God” are crass and very dangerous in a democracy.
However, for now we will not go into critical detail about that to give him a chance to take Zimbabwe forward. But we will remain vigilant as the public watchdogs.

McALLEN, Texas — Federal authorities arrested a former chief and current police sergeant for his role in allegedly helping Mexico's Gulf Cartel move cocaine and marijuana through his jurisdiction. The Texas cop claimed that he needed money to pay for his upcoming bid for county constable after a failed attempt for the Hidalgo County Sheriff position.
Current Progreso Police Sergeant Geovani Hernandez went before U.S. Magistrate Judge Peter Ormsby who formally charged him with one count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and one count of aiding and abetting the distribution of cocaine.

The case against Hernandez began earlier this year when agents with U.S. Homeland Security Investigations received information from a confidential informant indicating that Sgt. Geovani Hernandez was working for the Gulf Cartel, court records obtained by Breitbart Texas revealed. According to the documents, Hernandez bragged to an informant that he was a friend of former Gulf Cartel leader Juan Manuel “El Toro” Loza Salina and was able to travel to Reynosa without heat. The Texas cop told the informant that he needed money for his upcoming race for Hidalgo County Constable.
Federal agents used an informant and a cooperating defendant to capture Hernandez helping the group move various bricks of cocaine while also running license plates and to help determine the amount of law enforcement resources surrounding the alleged criminal activity.
Hernandez previously worked as the police chief in the border town of La Joya, Texas, and was in office in 2014 when a Gulf Cartel-linked gunman had a three-hour shootout with law enforcement in his city, Breitbart Texas reported during that encounter. The gunman barricaded himself in a house and shot two cops as more than 500 rounds of ammunition were exchanged. The gunman was identified as a member of the Texas Syndicate prison gang that was smuggling drugs for the Gulf Cartel and was wanted in connection with the execution of another man in Edinburg.
In 2012, Hernandez failed in his effort to unseat former Hidalgo County Sheriff Guadalupe “Lupe” Treviño. In 2014, Treviño was sentenced to five years in federal prison for taking bribes from another Mexican drug lord identified as Tomas “El Gallo” Gonzalez who operated out of Weslaco, Breitbart Texas reported. At the time of Treviño's conviction and sentencing, close to a dozen law enforcement officials tied to his department were being prosecuted for their alleged roles in stealing drug loads and selling them on the side. One of the conspiracies involved a drug interdiction force called the Panama Unit, while another conspiracy involved the Crime Stoppers tip line.

A new report from the think-tank Pew shows that global religious intolerance increased in 2015, the first time in three years.
The restrictions upon people's freedom to worship are calculated by two indexes: government hostilities and social violence.
According to the chart from Pew, Russia and Egypt are among the two biggest offenders of religious freedom, but European countries like France have also demonstrated a surprising degree of intolerance towards public religious practices.

DENVER | From loser's lament to winning formula, the Denver Broncos finally played the clean game rookie head coach Vance Joseph has been pining for ever since they started their eight-game spiral.
After every loss, seven of them by double digits, the Broncos (4-9) would agonize over their poor play and bad luck. They suggested if they could just manage to get an early lead and win the turnover battle, they'd be able to capitalize on their dominant defense, stick to a ground game and find their way again.
They did all that in a 23-0 win over the New York Jets on Sunday that snapped their longest losing streak in a half century.
“It's the formula we've been searching for,” pass rusher Shane Ray said. “Unfortunately it's happened kind of late. (But) it's something we can build off.”
The Broncos didn't turn the ball over and had two takeaways, one on a strip sack by Brandon Marshall and the other on an interception by Darian Stewart.
They jumped out to an early 10-0 lead and never let up in holding the Jets (5-8) to exactly 100 yards of offense.
“We knew if we played clean football it would look like that,” said Joseph, who found himself on the hot seat after just a dozen games. “We were plus-2 in turnovers. That's huge. The field position, our average start was 41 and theirs was 20. It's really a flip game of what we've seen in the last two months.”
That was thanks to finally finding a punt returner they could count on in Jordan Taylor, who gave the Broncos field position all afternoon, unlike rookie Isaiah McKenzie, who was benched last week for the remainder of the season after fumbling six times.
It also helped that they finally got away from their stubborn insistence on three-receiver sets, the formation they were in for 27 of their 30 sacks and 13 of their 14 interceptions over their previous 10 games.
“Our plan was to run the ball efficiently on first and second down and keep the third downs manageable. If not, punt the ball back,” Joseph said. “It's the formula we set out to accomplish and it worked. It worked perfectly.”
Other takeaways from Denver's first shutout in 12 years:
JETS JETTISONED: On a day the Bills and Colts combined for 546 yards in a blizzard at Buffalo, the Jets managed a mere 100 yards of offense on a sunny 60-degree day in Denver.
The Jets' 59 yards on the ground and 41 through the air didn't sit well with tight end Austin Seferian-Jenkins, either.
“I don't want to hear that playoff talk,” he said, channeling Jim Mora. “I don't want to see this (expletive) again.”
McCOWN HURT: Veteran QB Josh McCown's season might be over after breaking his left hand when he was clobbered by Ray in the second half.
“He kind of rolled over me and either a knee or a foot or something of his caught my hand and it bent funny,” McCown said. “I knew when it happened something wasn't right.”
McCown, who had left the game briefly earlier with a hip pointer, wasn't sure if he'll be back this season.
“We'll see. I'll do whatever I can to get ready to go and we'll see where that leaves me,” he said. “We still have some more tests and things that we can do and will look at, but my heart is with these guys. I want to finish with these guys and if I can be out there I would love to be out there.”
ROAD WOES: The Jets fell to 1-5 on the road.
“It seems like we don't come out with the same energy we have in home games,” cornerback Morris Claiborne said.
“When you're on the road, you have to pretty much bring your own energy. We come out flat. … It's embarrassing, man. Any way you look at it. It's embarrassing to get shut out.”
Especially by a team that hadn't won a game in 70 days.
TALIB RETURNS: Aqib Talib returned from a one-game suspension for his fight with Raiders receiver Michael Crabtree that cost him a $608,996 game check.
“I enjoyed my little time off,” Talib said. “It was an expensive vacation. I felt good, real fresh out there.”
The Jets really didn't test Talib, who had a single tackle.
MILLER TIME: Winning in the NFL is nothing to sneeze at, but Von Miller couldn't help himself as he sneezed four times on the way up to the podium after the game.
“Must be allergic to winning,” he cracked as he took out his handkerchief.
Turning serious, he said, “Getting back in the winning column is an amazing feeling. We just want hold on to this emotion and remember how it feels to win, and just carry it on through the rest of the season.”
NO DOUBTING THOMAS: WR Demaryius Thomas surpassed Hall of Fame tight end Shannon Sharpe to move into second place in two categories: most TD catches (56 to 55) and most receiving yards (8,475 to 8,439)
“Man, it means the world,” said Thomas, who led all receivers with eight catches for 93 yards and a TD. “It just shows the hard work I've put in paying off.”

It has become a kind of July tradition: Counting the ways in which California's fire season is now more dangerous.
Every summer around this time, the red flags grow redder: the dry air, the triple-digit heat, the dying trees in the wilderness, the chaparral rattling in the foothills. Every summer around this time, some fiery apocalypse erupts somewhere in the state as if to drive home the message.
And yet every summer around this time, Californians respond the same way: Surrounded by fire hazards, we set off a bunch of fireworks.
Not to dampen patriotic enthusiasm as Independence Day approaches, but isn't it time this state brought its July 4 observances into the climate-changed 21st century?
Yes, fireworks are fun. Yes, some nonprofits benefit from their sale. Yes, fireworks companies are a lobbying force. And yes, we have come to associate the rocket's red glare with Independence Day.
But there are lots of ways to have fun and donate to nonprofits and make a living in the state Capitol. And fireworks make less and less sense as California grows more and more fire prone.
Even with this state's many fireworks regulations, each summer reminds anew that it makes no sense to celebrate with explosives in a place known for its outsized fire risk.
Napa and Sonoma counties, for example, just spent most of the weekend under a National Weather Service red flag warning. In Lake County, the Pawnee Fire has been burning for a week now. More than 40,000 acres of Yolo County are blazing. Survivors of the October wine country fires are asking themselves this week whether fireworks are worth the traumatic flashbacks.
Last week, Cal Fire Director Ken Pimott issued a statement reminding that about half the July 4 fires nationally are started by fireworks, and that the "safe and sane" fireworks sold legally in California can still be a hazard if they aren't used correctly.
Even the organized public fireworks displays put on by professionals aren't foolproof. Remember the 2015 Cal Expo mishap, when the Sacramento region's largest fireworks show ended with a misfired mortar, a shower of sparks and two brush fires?
How much money do American teachers make? If your answer to that question is "not enough," you are definitely not wrong! But as recent teacher strikes have highlighted, some states are doing a much worse job of keeping teachers housed and fed than others. The folks at personal finance site HowMuch put together some maps of the average teacher salary in all 50 states using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and there is way too much variation here for our liking.
<img src="http://static.digg.com/images/bb761c52094e4c108fd9034f5ad12fd1_4ce580c8075545019653869096eb41f2_1_post.jpeg" alt="" />
The maps showing middle and high school teachers' average earnings, which you can see over at HowMuch, show a similar pattern. HowMuch averaged out the median elementary, middle and high school teacher salary to calculate the top 10 states for teacher pay overall:
1. New York: $81,613
2. Alaska: $80,627
3. Connecticut: $78,567
4. California: $76,523
5. Massachusetts: $75,720
6. New Jersey: $72,460
7. Oregon: $69,643
8. Virginia: $68,707
9. Maryland: $67,173
10. Rhode Island: $67,050
[HowMuch]
Not on the top ten list? West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Colorado and Arizona, where teachers have walked out to protest low wages and insufficient benefits in recent months. If the wave of strikes continues, maybe teachers can turn all the light blue states on the above map regular blue. Or even — dare we hope? — dark blue.
A 6-year-old is taking over YouTube and is making millions of dollars in the process.
Forbes recently released their list of highest-paid YouTubers, which features a collection of channels that have impressively pulled in over $127 million from June 2016 through June 2017. While the top earner, gamer Daniel Middleton, brought in more than $16 million during that time span, Ryan of Ryan ToysReview wasn't far behind. In the crowd full of 20-somethings, 6-year-old Ryan managed to generate some $11 million from YouTube ad-revenue by reviewing toys and food on his channel.
The adorable YouTuber has amassed over 10 million subscribers, and his dozens of videos—which feature him playing games with his family and being surprised with toys—have been viewed more than 16 billion times.
“He loves cars, trains, Thomas and friends, Lego, superheroes, Disney toys… family fun adventure and so much more!” reads the description of his channel. “Ryan will also love doing fun and easy science experiments for kids!”
Ryan's family started the channel back in March 2015, and it started to go viral just four months in when they released a video of Ryan opening a “giant egg” packed with toys from Disney's Cars. The juggernaut of a video has more than 800 million views as of December 2017. Yet, another video, posted in April 2016, has earned more than a billion views. It shows Ryan running through an inflatable Cars water slide.
It's an impressive feat, but what's even more impressive? According to The Verge, the family is prepared to shut it all down the second Ryan says he is done.
But just in case that happens, the family started a second channel called Ryan's Family Review that focuses on the family's daily adventures and Ryan's two twin sisters, Emma and Kate.

Here's something to sign about! Tony-winning actress Laura Benanti and husband Patrick Brown have welcomed their first child, a daughter.
“Laura gave birth to a healthy and beautiful baby girl at 3:33 p.m. this afternoon,” a rep for the actress tells PEOPLE. “Baby and mom are doing great!”
The newborn's name is Ella Rose, her rep confirms to PEOPLE exclusively.

The 37-year-old soprano and her businessman husband Brown married in November 2015 in a ceremony at Harlem's Riverside Church.
They first shared the news of Benanti's pregnancy in August, in a tweeted photo that showed them each reading copies of What to Expect When You're Expecting.
“Doing a little research with @impbrown,” the Supergirl alum wrote. “Coming this winter… #BabyGirlBrown.”
Benanti was busier than ever in her first trimester — leading the Broadway revival of She Loves Me alongside Zachary Levi and Jane Krakowski, for which she earned her fifth Tony nomination. She also released a single “I Like Musicals,” with all of the proceeds going to Save the Music, which is committed to keeping music education in schools.
Then there was her headline-making Melania Trump impression on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.
She didn't calm down much from there on — working hard on a string of concert engagements across the country, including dates during her third trimester at the D.C.'s Kennedy Center in December, and writing her first book of essays: I Stole Your Boyfriend, and Other Monster Acts on My Way to Becoming a Human Woman, out sometime next year.
It's the final countdown (@impbrown) A post shared by Laura Benanti (@laurabenanti) on Jan 18, 2017 at 10:32am PST
In the past few weeks, there was a surprise baby shower at Feinstein's/54 Below and a variety of chores to take part in — including setting up her newborn's nursery, which she showed off on Instagram.
Now that her daughter is here, Benanti can focus on being a mom — though she won't have much time off!
She'll unite with her own mother, Linda Benanti, for a concert at Feinstein's/54 Below in May — billed as “a musical journey through the special relationship between a mother and daughter.”
Linda is an accomplished actor and singer, with credits on Broadway, Off-Broadway, and regionally. She's also been a voice teacher with a studio in Kinnelon, New Jersey, for the past 35 years. The Story Goes On will mark her return to the stage.
E! News was first to report the birth.

A young American man trying an underhanded serve while cramping during a five-setter at the French Open. Hmmmm. Seen that before, haven't we? Except, unlike for 1989 champion Michael Chang, the unusual strategy didn't help result in a victory for Jared Donaldson against Grigor Dimitrov.
The fourth-seeded Dimitrov came back to beat the 21-year-old Donaldson 6-7 (2), 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 10-8 in a second-round marathon that lasted 4 hours, 19 minutes on Court 18 at Roland Garros.
When it ended, Dimitrov leaned forward while raising each knee to give it a kiss — perhaps thanking his legs for carrying him to the win while Donaldson's gave way.
Donaldson, who is ranked 57th, was actually two points from winning when he led 6-5 in the fifth and got to love-30 on Dimitrov's serve. But Dimitrov took the next four points to hold for 6-all.
Dimitrov broke to lead 8-7 and served for the victory, but Donaldson broke right back.
In the next game, though, Donaldson could barely stand, let alone move well.
He double-faulted. Then he tried an underhand serve — not his first of the match, either — and lost the point.
Dimitrov hit a winner to break for a 9-8 edge, Donaldson slowly limped to the sideline for the changeover, and soon enough, it was over.
Chang famously used an underhand service motion while cramping during a fourth-round win against Ivan Lendl on the way to the French Open title 29 years ago.

6:30 p.m.
Kei Nishikori has rallied past local favourite Benoit Paire to reach the third round of the French Open for the fourth consecutive year.
The 19th-seeded Japanese player needed nearly three hours on Court Philippe Chatrier to win 6-3, 2-6, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 against the Frenchman.
"He was attacking every shot," Nishikori said. "He has one of the best touches on the Tour, it was fun to play him and also a difficult match today."
___
6:15 p.m.
Second-seeded Alexander Zverev trailed by a set and a break — and was down a broken racket, too — before eventually collecting himself and coming back to beat 60th-ranked Dusan Lajovic of Serbia 2-6, 7-5, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 in the French Open's second round.
Zverev equaled his best showing at Roland Garros; he also reached the third round two years ago.
If the 21-year-old German is going to get to the round of 16 he'll need to do something he never has at a Grand Slam tournament: defeat a player ranked in the top 50. Zverev's next match comes against 26th-seeded Damir Dzumhur.
Lajovic lost his eighth consecutive match that stretched to five sets.

5:10 p.m.
Serena and Venus Williams have won their first Grand Slam doubles match in nearly two years.
The sisters moved into the second round of the French Open by coming back for a 4-6, 6-4, 6-1 victory over the 14th-seeded Japanese pairing of Shuko Aoyama and Miyu Kato in front of a Court 3 crowd that raucously supported the Americans.
The Williams-Williams duo last competed at a major tournament together at Wimbledon in 2016. They won their 14th Grand Slam title in women's doubles at the England Club.
This return to doubles came a day after Serena Williams participated in Grand Slam singles for the first time in 16 months, winning her first-round match at Roland Garros. Venus Williams lost in the first round of singles on Sunday.

3:50 p.m.
Jeremy Chardy first wasted a two-set lead and then bounced back to beat 17th-seeded Tomas Berdych to reach the second round of the French Open.
Chardy led by two sets when their match was stopped by darkness on Tuesday, but Berdych mounted a comeback when they returned. Chardy played well in the decider and broke Berdych twice to advance with a 7-6 (5), 7-6 (8), 1-6, 5-7, 6-2 win.
"At two sets all, it was difficult in my head, and physically, too," said Chardy, who had never beaten Berdych in five previous matches. "I fought hard, all my body was shaking."
___
3:25 p.m.
Former French Open champion Novak Djokovic posted another straight-set win to reach the third round of the clay-court tournament.
Facing Spanish qualifier Jaume Munar, the Serb delivered a solid display to prevail 7-6 (1), 6-4, 6-4 and move into the third round for the 13th time.
Djokovic, who underwent right elbow surgery earlier this year, is the 20th-seeded player in Paris, his lowest Grand Slam seeding since the 2006 U.S. Open.

3:10 p.m.
The Williams sisters are back in Grand Slam doubles action for the first time in nearly two years.
A day after Serena Williams made her return to singles play at a major following a 16-month absence, winning her first-round match at the French Open, she is out on Court 3 at Roland Garros alongside her older sister, Venus.
They are facing the 14th-seeded pairing of Shuko Aoyama and Miyu Kato of Japan.
The American siblings, owners of 14 Grand Slam doubles titles, received a wild-card entry. They haven't played doubles together at a major since winning Wimbledon in 2016.
Serena Williams hadn't competed at any Grand Slam tournament since the Australian Open in January 2017. She gave birth to a daughter last September.

1:20 p.m.
Marco Trungelliti's long, strange trip as a French Open "lucky loser" has come to an end with a second-round exit.
Trungelliti is the 190th-ranked Argentine who headed home to Barcelona after losing in qualifying at Roland Garros, then drew headlines for making the 10-hour, 650-mile (1,000-kilometre) drive back to Paris in a rental car with his 88-year-old grandmother, mother and brother once he found out he could get into the main draw.
He then won his first-round match.
But Trungelliti was beaten Wednesday by 72nd-ranked Marco Cecchinato of Italy 6-1, 7-6 (1), 6-1 in a match that lasted just under 2 hours.
Still, Trungelliti leaves with 79,000 euros (about $90,000) in prize money — and a great story to tell.

12:50 p.m.
Top-ranked Simona Halep put aside a terrible start and came back to claim 12 of the last 14 games, beating 83rd-ranked Alison Riske of the United States 2-6, 6-1, 6-1 to reach the second round of the French Open.
It was the last match of the tournament's opening round.
Halep, the runner-up at Roland Garros in 2014 and a year ago, played poorly in the first set, with only four winners and 16 unforced errors. But she had 16 winners and 12 unforced errors the rest of the way, while Riske made more and more mistakes.
___
12:30 p.m.
Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova is through to the third round of the French Open, making light work of 91st-ranked Lara Arruabarrena of Spain in a 6-0, 6-4 win on Court 1.
The eighth-seeded Kvitova lost in the second round last year when she was coming back to the tour after a knife attack in her home in 2016 that left her needing surgery on her left hand, her playing hand.
The Czech player made the semifinals at Roland Garros in 2012.
___
12:20 p.m.
Simona Halep has turned things around in her first-round match at the French Open and is headed to a third set against 83rd-ranked Alison Riske of the United States.
After dropping the first set 6-2 at Court Philippe Chatrier, Halep grabbed 19 of the first 22 points en route to a 5-0 lead in the second, which she eventually took 6-1.
Halep, the runner-up at Roland Garros in 2014 and a year ago, cleaned up her game in the second set, with only five unforced errors after making 16 in the opener. Riske, meanwhile, had only two winners and 12 unforced errors in the second set.
___
12 p.m.
Top-seeded Simona Halep is in trouble in her weather-delayed first-round match at the French Open, losing the first set 6-2 to 83rd-ranked Alison Riske of the United States.
Riske raced to a 5-0 lead and then broke Halep again in the eighth game to take the set.
In their only previous meeting on clay, in Rome in 2015, Halep dropped only three games in a 6-3, 6-0 victory. But Riske is giving the Romanian a far tougher test this time.
___
11:20 a.m.
Play is underway on Day 4 of the French Open, with top-seeded Simona Halep facing 83rd-ranked Alison Riske of the United States in the last remaining match of the women's first round.
The encounter on Court Philippe-Chatrier was postponed from Tuesday amid gathering evening storms.
Halep, a two-time finalist at Roland Garros, needs to reach the semifinals or better this year to have a chance of holding onto her No. 1 ranking. She won both of her previous matches against Riske.
On the men's side, 2016 champion Novak Djokovic will face qualifier Jaume Munar of Spain in the second round.
The second-seeded players in both the men's and women's draws, Alexander Zverev and Caroline Wozniacki, will also be in action.

São Paulo Qatar Investment Authority's sold about 2.5 percent of Banco Santander Brasil SA for 2.3 billion reais ($737 million) in a restricted offering after banks exercised an option to buy extra units, the bank said on Thursday.
Investors paid 25 reais each for the 80 million units initially offered - a blend of Santander Brasil's (SANB11.SA) common and preferred shares - as well as for the extra allotment of 12 million units, the bank said in a statement to the Brazilian market regulator.
QIA and banks underwriting the deal had suggested a price of 27 reais per unit, three people with direct knowledge of the deal said, but investors baulked at the price and pushed for a lower level.
The units shed as much as 5.2 percent on Wednesday on news of the investor pushback, falling to 26.13 reais, the lowest since late December. The stock has shed 15 percent since March 27, the day before the offering was announced.
Investors placed bids worth 2.5 times to three times the amount of units in Brazil's fourth biggest bank on offer, the sources said.
The deal was the latest equity follow-on offering in Brazil this year, underscoring how government efforts to cut spending and pull the economy out of a three-year recession have rekindled investor confidence. Companies have raised more than 10.5 billion reais through share offerings this year, a two-year high.
QIA took advantage of an 18-month rally that doubled the price of Santander Brasil's units to cash out after seven years as the second biggest shareholder in the Brazilian unit of Spain's Banco Santander SA (SAN.MC).
Investors were puzzled by that market rally, which made Santander Brasil Latin America's most expensive bank and spurred increased short-selling bets against the stock.
The transaction, known as a public offering with restricted efforts, differs from standard equity offerings in that QIA did not have to request registration of the plan with securities watchdog CVM. Only qualified investors could participate, and the deal could not be marketed through road shows or the media.

WASHINGTON | Former FBI Director James Comey has scorned the memo that was released by House Republicans after being declassified by President Donald Trump, saying it doesn't add up to much.
His assessment on Twitter was: “That's it?”
FILE - In this June 8, 2017 file photo, former FBI director James Comey speaks during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, in Washington. Comey defended the agency Thursday, Feb. 1, 2018, on Twitter, writing, "All should appreciate the FBI speaking up. I wish more of our leaders would. " President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have been attacking the FBI for its investigation of potential ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)
Comey called the memo “dishonest and misleading” and not worth the damage it's done to public trust in U.S. intelligence agencies.
After being declassified by Trump, the memo was released Friday by House Republicans. It claims the FBI abused its surveillance powers in the Russia investigation.
The FBI, Justice Department and Democrats furiously lobbied Trump to stop the release, saying it could harm national security and mislead the public.
Since his firing last May, Comey has made his personal feelings about Trump known, testifying in detail about personal interactions he says troubled him.

A husband-to-be who claims he was unfairly kicked off of a United Airlines flight on Saturday says he and his bride aren't letting the incident put a damper on their wedding celebrations.
“It's not gonna slow us down,” Michael Hohl tells PEOPLE of himself and his fiancée Amber Maxwell. “It's just a bump in the road.”
He adds: “We're in Costa Rica now, we got here. We're trying our best to find a different airline to fly home.”
Hohl tells PEOPLE that he and Maxwell, both of Park City, Utah, were boarding a plane out of Houston on Saturday, heading to the country for their wedding when they saw a man lying in their seats.
“We didn't wanna bother the guy because there were so many empty seats. That's when we sat in an empty row that was a few rows ahead of ours,” Hohl says, noting that the aircraft was “60 percent full at best.”
“They came and asked us to move, we kindly, politely moved. We moved back to our seats, we sat down, got our seatbelt on and we were taken off the plane.”
United Airlines acknowledged the incident in a statement to PEOPLE, with a spokesperson saying that the company is “disappointed anytime a customer has an experience that doesn't measure up to their expectations.”
“These passengers repeatedly attempted to sit in upgraded seating which they did not purchase and they would not follow crew instructions to return to their assigned seats,” the statement read. “They were asked to leave the plane by our staff and complied.”
Hohl says that he was told to leave the plane and although Maxwell was not ordered to do so, she went with him because “she wasn't gonna fly to Costa Rica for a wedding by herself.” The couple was not allowed back on the plane and their flight was rescheduled for the following morning, he says.
The airline's statement noted that Hohl and Maxwell were ticketed in Economy but attempted to move up to Economy Plus and declined to pay the difference in fare.
Hohl tells PEOPLE that he and his fiancée told flight attendants that they didn't know the seats were upgraded. He says that when he asked how to pay for the seats, he and Maxwell were told they couldn't do so because they had already boarded the plane.
Daughter of Dr. David Daughter Says Family Was “Sickened” By United Airlines Incident
“We did exactly as told. When they asked us to move, we moved without a flight,” he says, calling the situation “strange.” “We apologized that we were in another row of seats, but it was a nearly empty plane.”
Hohl says he and Maxwell are schedule to wed on Thursday.
The incident came less than a week after footage of David Dao being violently dragged from a United Airlines flight sparked national outrage and landed the company in very hot water.
Dao's lawyer said the man suffered a “significant concussion,” a “serious broken nose,” two broken teeth and an “injury to sinuses.” Dao, through his attorneys, has since been granted a “bill of discovery” to preserve all surveillance videos, cockpit voice recordings, a full passenger list and any incident reports from the altercation.
In the wake of the controversy, United has changed is policy, stating that crew members will not be able to bump a passenger who is already seated in one of the airline's planes, the company told PEOPLE in the statement.
Delta Air Lines and American Airlines have followed suit altering policies, with Delta confirming to PEOPLE that gate supervisors could offer passengers up to $9,950 to give up their seats on a flight.
Meanwhile, American Airlines has announced that officials “will not involuntarily remove a revenue passenger, who has already boarded, in order to give a seat to another passenger.”
California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom is worried that Democrats may be taking the so-called “big blue wave” in November for granted.
In fact, the California gubernatorial frontrunner reportedly said on Tuesday that he does not see any evidence of a monster November blue wave, even in the bluest of blue states.
When reporters asked him about the potential for a “big blue wave” in November, Newsom, according to Politico, replied: “I don't see evidence of that. … In California, we kind of feel like we've got this. It's a big blue state and in some respects, I think we kind of take things for granted at times.”
Democrats are looking to pick up key House seats in the Golden State to take back the House, but the party has become increasingly concerned that Democrats may not even get a candidate on the November ballot in three key Orange County Congressional Districts (39th, 48th, 49th) because of California's top-two “jungle primary” system.
Left-wing groups have reportedly spent millions in the last weeks in Orange County to try to prevent what could be a “catastrophe” for Democrats.
Though Democrats may have some momentum in some local races, the party's huge lead on the generic ballot has all but disappeared in recent months. A CNN poll this month found that Democrats only had a three-point advantage on the generic ballot. And for one week in May (the week ending May 20), Republicans actually had a six-point advantage over Democrats on the generic ballot in Reuters' tracking poll.

'We cannot have a war on the Korean peninsula ever again,' says South Korean President Moon Jae-In
Published 5:06 PM, August 14, 2017
SEOUL, South Korea – South Korean President Moon Jae-In called Monday, August 14, for calm in the standoff with North Korea, saying there should never be another war on the peninsula.
Tensions have flared since US President Donald Trump, responding to the North's latest missile tests, warned it of "fire and fury like the world has never seen".
The North in turn threatened to test-fire its missiles towards the US Pacific island of Guam.
The war of words has sparked global alarm, with world leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping urging calm on both sides.
Moon, a left-leaning leader who has previously advocated dialogue with the North, urged it to "stop all provocations and hostile rhetoric immediately, instead of worsening the situation any further".
He also indirectly urged the US – the South's key ally and security guarantor – to resolve the crisis peacefully.
"Our top priority is the national interest of the Republic of Korea (South Korea) and our national interest lies in peace," Moon told advisers in a meeting.
"We cannot have a war on the Korean peninsula ever again," he said. The 1950-53 conflict cost more than a million lives, left cities in ruins and perpetuated the division of the peninsula.
"I am confident that the US will respond to the current situation in a calm and responsible manner in line with our policy direction," Moon said.
Moon Monday also met General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, who is visiting Seoul as part of a trip which will also include China and Japan.
The latest US and North Korean sabre-rattling has sparked concern that a miscalculation by either side could trigger a catastrophic conflict, although many analysts voice doubts over such a prospect.
Any conflict between the North and the US could have devastating consequences for Asia's fourth-largest economy, with Seoul within range of Pyongyang's vast conventional artillery forces.
Also within range are many of the 28,500 US troops stationed in the South.
The latest bout of tension was sparked by the North's two intercontinental ballistic missile tests last month, which appeared to bring much of the US within range.
The tests are seen as a milestone in the North's quest to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the US mainland.
Since then the North and Trump have locked horns in fiery exchanges, with Trump saying on Friday that US troops were "locked and loaded" in case a military solution became necessary. – Rappler.com
CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — Notre Dame has leaned on its running game to spark a turnaround from a four-win season. Now the 21st-ranked Fighting Irish bring one of the nation's best ground attacks to face a North Carolina run defence that has struggled for stops.
Notre Dame (4-1) enters Saturday's game at UNC ranked second nationally with 20 rushing touchdowns, third in yards per carry (7.14) and seventh in rushing yards per game (301.4). Those numbers are all up significantly from last season, and coach Brian Kelly points to that success as a reason why the Irish has been one of the nation's best red-zone offences, too.
"I think it has a lot to do with the running of the football and then what we're setting up off of the run, more so than trying to take shots on first down in the end zone," Kelly said. "We're staying ahead of the chains there."
Junior running back Josh Adams has led that attack, ranking third nationally by averaging 131.6 yards per game. Quarterback Brandon Wimbush — whose role is in question Saturday due to a foot injury — is second at better than 80 yards per game.
Compare that production to 2016, when Notre Dame averaged just 163.6 yards rushing and had 18 touchdowns on the ground for all last season. The Irish averaged about 31 points per game, roughly 10 points fewer than this season.
"I think as an offence, I think we know we can do more," Adams said. "I think we have guys that want to do more. We're never just satisfied with where we're at. We always want to do better. We always want to improve. I don't think we're even close to being at the level we know we can be at."
Notre Dame could be set for a big afternoon against North Carolina (1-4), which ranks 112th nationally by allowing nearly 222 yards rushing per game. The Tar Heels surrendered 403 yards rushing to Georgia Tech's triple-option attack last week.
"You're going to have to do the best job we can," UNC coach Larry Fedora said. "We're going to have to be very disciplined in our gaps. Our guys are going to have to get off the blocks and our guys are going to have to get multiple hats to the ball. We need to create turnovers and limit their possessions."

Here are some other things to know about Saturday's Notre Dame-UNC game:
Minka Kelly‘s pooch Chewy has passed away.
“My sweet angel baby girl. My Chewy…I still can't quite catch my breath,” the Friday Night Lights alum wrote alongside a series of photos of her pet Cockapoo, whose name is short for Chewbacca.
Continuing, Kelly, 37, wrote, “My heart is broken into a million pieces. Thank you for 13 years of true and unconditional love.”
“We've lived all over the place and what a trooper you were. You made everywhere new and foreign feel like home,” she continued. “You've seen me through it all… You were my rock during the hard times and taught me humility during the good. What a divine gift and love you were.”
“I hope you're out there somewhere running through a forest chewing on sticks and chasing squirrels. I hope you're with my momma. Give her all the kisses for me and make sure she knows how much we've missed her,” she added.
Concluding her heartfelt message, Kelly wrote, “I'd suffer this heartache a million times over to do it all again. I love you forever, my puppy.”
Kelly also has a dog named Fred. Before Chewy's passing, the actress would frequently share videos of the two canines playing together on social media.

In a separate post memorializing her beloved pet, the actress wrote, “What an honor and a true and abiding gift it was to have her precious spirit in my life for as long as I did.”
“I don't remember who I was before Chewy was in my life, but I do know I'm a better person because of her,” she added.
SEATTLE (AP) — Protesters decrying hatred and racism converged around the country, saying they felt compelled to counteract the white supremacist rally that spiraled into deadly violence in Virginia.
The gatherings Sunday spanned from anti-fascist protests in San Francisco to a march to President Donald Trump's home in New York.
Some focused on showing support for the people whom white supremacists condemn. Other demonstrations were pushing for the removal of Confederate monuments, the issue that initially prompted white nationalists to gather in anger this weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia. Still other gatherings aimed to denounce fascism and a presidential administration that organizers feel has empowered white supremacists.
“People need to wake up, recognize that and resist it as fearlessly as it needs to be done,” said Carl Dix, a leader of the Refuse Fascism group organizing demonstrations in New York, San Francisco and other cities. “This can't be allowed to fester and to grow because we've seen what happened in the past when that was allowed.”
“It has to be confronted,” said Dix, a New Yorker who spoke by phone from Charlottesville on Sunday afternoon. He had gone there to witness and deplore the white nationalist rally on Saturday that spiraled into bloodshed.
In Seattle, a rally previously planned for Sunday by the conservative pro-Trump group known as Patriot Prayer drew hundreds of counterprotesters. Police arrested three men and confiscated weapons as Trump supporters and counter-protesters converged downtown.
A barricade separated the two groups as police officers stood by dressed in riot gear. Police said they used pepper spray and blast balls to disperse crowds after fireworks were thrown at officers. In a statement, police said they observed some people in the counterprotest carrying axe handles and two-by fours as they infiltrated the hundreds of peaceful demonstrators.
In Denver, several hundred demonstrators gathered beneath a statue of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in City Park and marched about 2 miles (3.22 kilometers) to the state Capitol. In Fort Collins, Colorado, marchers chanted “Everyone is welcome here. No hate, no fear.” One demonstrator's sign said, “Make racists ashamed again.”
In New York, protesters marched from several locations in Manhattan to Trump Tower, demanding the president denounce white nationalist groups involved in the violent confrontations in Charlottesville. One sign read: “Call out evil.”
Helen Rubenstein, 62, was among hundreds of people who marched through downtown Los Angeles. She said her parents were Holocaust survivors, and she's worried that extremist views were becoming normal under Trump's presidency.
“I blame Donald Trump 100 percent because he emboldened all these people to incite hate, and they are now promoting violence and killing,” Rubenstein said.
Charlottesville descended into violence Saturday after neo-Nazis, skinheads, Ku Klux Klan members and other white nationalists gathered to “take America back” and oppose plans to remove a Confederate statue in the Virginia college town, and hundreds of other people came to protest the rally. The groups clashed in street brawls, with hundreds of people throwing punches, hurling water bottles and beating each other with sticks and shields.
Eventually, a car rammed into a peaceful crowd of anti-white-nationalist protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer. A Virginia State Police helicopter deployed in a large-scale response to the violence then crashed into the woods outside of town. Both troopers on board died.
A crowd gathered on the street where the crash happened for a vigil Sunday evening. They sang “Amazing Grace” and prayed around piles of flowers that mark the spot where Heyer was killed.
Prominent white nationalist Richard Spencer, who attended the rally, denied all responsibility for the violence. He blamed the counter-protesters and police.
Trump condemned what he called an “egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides,” a statement that Democrats and some of the president's fellow Republicans saw as equivocating about who was to blame. The White House later added that the condemnation “includes white Supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi and all extremist groups.”
Some of the white nationalists at Saturday's rally cited Trump's victory, after a campaign of racially charged rhetoric, as validation for their beliefs. Some of the people protesting Sunday also point to the president and his campaign, saying they gave license to racist hatred that built into what happened in Charlottesville.
“For those who questioned whether ‘oh, don't call it fascism' … this should resolve those issues,” Reiko Redmonde, an organizer of a Refuse Fascism protest planned in San Francisco, said by phone. “People need to get out in the streets to protest, in a determined way.”

Cell phone radiation and a potential link to cancer risks have left consumers and scientists alike scratching their heads since mobile phones became widely used in the 1990s.
Some studies have failed to show a link between radiofrequency from cell phones and certain health problems, such as increased risks of tumors, while others suggest the opposite.
Now, two much-anticipated reports released Friday by the US Department of Health and Human Services' National Toxicology Program add to the cell phone conundrum.
The comprehensive research reports detail findings from two large animal studies — one in rats and one in mice — that link high levels of cell phone radiation to some evidence of carcinogenic activity in male rats, including a rare type of tumor called a schwannoma in their hearts. There were no such significant findings in the female rats.
Similarly, no significant findings emerged in the mouse study, according to the reports.
The studies were a part of the National Toxicology Program's 10-year, $25 million assessment of radiation exposure and potential health effects.
“One of the things that we found most interesting about our findings was that the malignant schwannomas — even though they occurred in the heart and not in the head of these animals — were in fact schwannomas,” said John Bucher, a senior scientist at the National Toxicology Program and one of the authors of the reports.
“These experimental animal studies are but one approach to understanding whether exposures to radio frequency radiation pose a risk to human health,” he said, adding that studies are continuing at the National Toxicology Program to examine changes on the molecular level in tissue samples from the rodents.
He added, “I have not changed the way I use a cell phone.”
Although tumors and biological changes were found among rodents in labs, it remains unclear whether similar findings would emerge in humans, and more research is needed, Bucher said.
The US Food and Drug Administration notes that cell phones emit low levels of radiofrequency energy that are non-ionizing and thus not considered strong enough to permanently damage biological tissue including DNA.
Cell phone safety confusion and controversy
The National Toxicology Program studies involved about 3,000 rodents in all, Bucher said.
The animals were exposed to radiofrequency radiation levels equal to and higher than the highest level currently allowed for mobile phone emissions. The researchers tracked the health of the animals from in utero to two years after their birth.
A 2-year-old rat would be somewhat comparable to a 70-year-old human, Bucher said.
The researchers divided the rodents into two groups based on radiofrequency radiation levels, low or high, and exposed their entire bodies to radiofrequency radiation for 10-minute increments totaling to about nine hours a day over the two-year period.
“It's important to consider the magnitude of the exposures to the animals in these studies in relation to what one might typically receive from using a cell phone,” Bucher said. “The lowest energy level of the radio frequency radiation we studied was similar to the highest level currently permitted for cell phone emissions.”
Among the male rats, the researchers found tumors in about 6% of those in the highest radiation exposure group, Bucher said. That percentage “exceeded the mean historical incidence (0.8%), and exceed the highest rate observed in a single historical control group (2%) of completed peer reviewed studies,” the researchers wrote.
The researchers also found that the male rats in the high-exposure group appeared to live longer than the other rats, but more research is needed to determine why and how that may be relevant to the study results.
Overall, the findings “don't go much further than what we have reported earlier,” he said.
In 2016, the National Toxicology Program released preliminary data indicating that high levels of cell phone radiation increased brain tumor growth in male rats.
Yet “after reviewing all of the data from these studies, the evidence for increased malignant schwannomas in the hearts of male rats is the strongest cancer finding in our study,” Bucher said.
“In our complete evaluation, we again had a lower level of certainty that small increases in the numbers of male rats with tumors in the brains were associated with exposures to cell phone radiofrequency radiation,” he said. “These findings are termed ‘equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity,' meaning it was unclear if the tumors were related to the exposures.”
In 1999, the FDA nominated cell phone radiofrequency emissions for toxicology and carcinogenity testing.
“It's important to understand that — as is commonly done in these types of risk assessment studies — the study was designed to test levels of radiofrequency energy exposures considerably above the current safety limits for cell phones to help contribute to what we already understand about the effects of radiofrequency energy on animal tissue,” Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in astatement after the release of the reports.
“The current safety limits are set to include a 50-fold safety margin from observed effects of radiofrequency energy exposure. From the FDA's understanding of the NTP results, male rats that showed carcinogenic activity were exposed to a radiofrequency energy exposure rate that is much higher than the current safety standard,” he said.
“Looking at the results in animals, the conclusions still require careful discussion, as our preliminary understanding of the NTP results is that the study found mostly equivocal, or ambiguous, evidence that whole body radiofrequency energy exposures given to rats or mice in the study actually caused cancer in these animals.”
In March, the National Toxicology Program will hold an external expert review of the complete findings from the rodent studies and is accepting public comments.
‘It's incumbent on all consumers to pay attention'
Jerry Phillips, a biochemist and director of the Excel Science Center at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs, devoted about a decade to examining cell phone radiation during his career and conducted some of the earliest studies on the potential health impacts of cell phones, he said.
Regarding the new National Toxicology Program reports, “this keeps adding to the body of evidence that says you really have to be a little careful when we start talking about human safety and exposure to radiofrequency fields,” said Phillips, who was not involved in the reports.
The early research Phillips conducted, as a scientist previously with the US Department of Veterans Affairs' Pettis VA Medical Center in California, was funded by the telecommunications company Motorola, he said.
“They funded us to do some whole animal studies, similar to what NTP did but with a different premise, and they also funded us to do some other studies with cells, just isolated cells, and that included a study to look at DNA damage in response to exposure to two of their cell telephone signals,” Phillips said. “The study was based on the presumption that this type of radiation, this low-energy non-ionizing radiation, was not itself going to be carcinogenic.”
Those study results suggested that cell phone radiation possibly could be a co-carcinogen, “that is if you have another cancer-producing agent, the radiation would help promote the formation of tumors,” he said.
The new National Toxicology Program study suggests otherwise, that it could be carcinogenic, he said.
As scientists continue to seek answers to the many questions that remain concerning cell phone radiation safety, Phillips said, he thinks all consumers should monitor the research findings to come.
“I think it's incumbent on all consumers to pay attention to any potential adverse effects of any of the products that we rely on until more research is done,” he said.
In 2010, CTIA, a trade association representing the US wireless communications industry, released a statement about the Interphone project, an international set of studies on cell phone radiation coordinated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
“CTIA and the wireless industry support continuing efforts of public health specialists and expert scientists in this area,” the statement said.
“All cell phones sold in the U.S. must comply with the FCC's radiofrequency exposure standards, which are designed to include a substantial margin of safety for consumers. Numerous experts and government health and safety organizations around the world have reviewed the existing database of studies and ongoing research and concluded that RF products meeting established safety guidelines pose no known health risk.”
CNN has contacted the association for a response to the latest study but has not heard back at time of publication.
Trey Songz was arrested on Monday and charged with felony domestic violence.
A spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department tells PEOPLE that Songz, whose real name is Tremaine Neverson, was arrested “today around 6:30 a.m…for 273.5 of the penal code, which is domestic violence.”
“The arrest stems from an incident on Feb. 18 around 2:40 a.m. at a party…the suspect was involved in an altercation with the victim in which he struck the victim,” the spokesperson adds.
TMZ, who first broke the news, reported that the arrest was in relation to Andrea Buera's claim that Songz beat her and gave her a concussion at a Hollywood Hills party for NBA All-Star Weekend.
Songz's lawyer did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.

According to online records, the 32-year-old singer was released hours after his arrest on Monday morning and his next court date is scheduled for April 9.
The Los Angeles Police Department tells PEOPLE his bail was set for $50,000.
After the singer was released on Monday morning, he appeared to address the incident in a series of social media messages.
“For weeks my lawyers & Mgmt have asked me not to comment on this and I initially agreed but this morning I feel that my fam, the women that raised me, my friends & fans especially the youth need to hear from me. I am being lied on and falsely accused for someone's personal gain,” he wrote.
Continuing, he added, “I won't be speaking too much more on this but would like to thank you for all the prayers and support.”

This isn't the first time the singer has faced legal trouble.
Songz was arrested in December 2016 for throwing music equipment and punches from the stage after he was told to end his set, injuring two people — including a police sergeant.
A Detroit Police Department spokeswoman told PEOPLE at the time that Songz was arrested and charged with felonious assault on another person and resisting and obstructing an officer.
According to Billboard, Songz reached a plea deal with prosecutors in August of last year regarding the incident.
Songz pled guilty to two counts of disturbing the peace and was sentenced to serve 17 months of probation, according to the outlet.

The Hornets went to the playoffs twice in Clifford's five seasons, never winning a playoff series.
"The NBA isn't about winning — the NBA is about winning in the playoffs," Clifford said at the end of Charlotte's season.
Clifford is coming to a franchise that has lost more games than any other NBA club over the past six years — 335. That's four more than Philadelphia, a franchise that was openly tanking for years before turning things around this season.
The Magic weren't tanking. They've just been bad.
Orlando hasn't had longer than a five-game winning streak at any time over the last six seasons. But over that same span, the Magic have had 23 losing streaks of at least five games. On their way to a 25-57 record that left them 18 games out of a playoff spot, the Magic had two seven-game slides and two other nine-game skids.
Since Van Gundy left, the Magic have gone through a series of resets.
There have been 62 players in uniform over the last six seasons — none of them an All-Star while in Orlando — and now five different coaches. Van Gundy was replaced by Jacque Vaughn, who was let go after 2 1/2 seasons and replaced on an interim basis by James Borrego. Scott Skiles then took over for one year, and Vogel ran things the last two seasons.
Clifford now gets his chance.

You can spot them everywhere, but you have to know what you're hunting.
Spring Valley resident Julie Brostrom-Pope has formed Mayer AZ Rocks, a group that paints rocks, hides them, and asks only that the finder take a picture and put it on the Mayer AZ Rocks Facebook page.
Leaving painted rocks for others to find and either keep or re-hide is an international movement, Brostrom-Pope said. In fact, Autumn Moore, a 10-year-old Cordes Lakes resident, painted a rock and hid it in Cleator.
“That rock went to Canada and Costa Rica. The people kept traveling around the world with it,” Brostrom-Pope said. “Last week, it wound up in Buenos Aires, Argentina.”
She started the Mayer AZ Rocks Facebook group, presently with 707 members, about a year and a half ago after she was inspired by Bullhead City Rocks, currently with 10,920 members. Bullhead City Rocks Facebook group administrator was inspired by Whidbey Island Rocks, Washington.
Group founders acknowledge whatever group inspired them after finding one of their rocks. “Now, if someone finds mine and they want to start a page, they give credit to Mayer AZ Rocks,” she said.
On Brostrom-Pope's Facebook page, she writes, “Painting rocks is good for the soul. It gives you an opportunity to be creative, and being artistic has been proven to reduce stress and anxiety. Getting outside in our beautiful area and hiding or finding rocks has a multitude of positive benefits.”
Recently she taught rock painting as part of the Dewey-Humboldt Town Library's summer reading program. The children (and adults) painted their rocks, dried them outside in the sun, and Bostrom-Pope sprayed several layers of a clear sealant on them.
On the bottom of the rocks, she writes, “Post pic to Mayer AZ Rocks on Facebook and keep or rehide.”
Sometimes rock painters give clues where to look. A June 24 Facebook post stated, “We hid rocks today. Hints most in PV. Costco, Walmart, car wash, Harkins and post office in Mayer.”
Sometimes the rocks end up in other states or people exchange them with fellow rock painter friends.
“One librarian in Cordes took a bunch of students' rocks and they hid them in Nashville. Unfortunately, people keep them and don't take pictures. We don't want them back, we just want to know where they go,” she said.
A local long-distance truck driver found a Mayer AZ rock, named it Dwayne and traveled with it from coast to coast. Wherever he stopped, he took a picture of Dwayne, Brostrom-Pope said.
USA Painted Rocks, with 12,782 members, posted instructions on proper behavior on its Facebook closed group page that include no posting of addresses or phone numbers, and a request not to use the words “rock hoarder.”
Other sites advise not to hide rocks in grassy areas where there are lawn mowers; don't hide inside stores; and if hiding in cemeteries, don't mess with the graves. If people keep every rock they find, they're missing the point — it's about the joy of giving and about providing a fun affordable outdoor activity.
Brostrom-Pope said she started the Mayer group as a reason to get the community together.
“We had nothing going on out here, so I thought this is something we need to do. And it works. I get a lot of thank-you's. In cooler weather, grandparents or parents will go rock hinting,” she said.
Prescott Valley and Prescott have started their own groups, she added, so the Mayer group has moved back to hiding their rocks closer to home.
Brostrom-Pope often teaches six-week classes in rock painting for children and adults through community centers and libraries. Some people gather for exchange parties and family paint parties. “We use rocks as prizes,” she said. “I've found that a lot of rock painters are also rock collectors.”

Man tries to run over police sergeant
By Brandon Davis
Published in News on February 15, 2017 9:02 AM
Full Size Edwin Luis Ortiz Jr.
A man allegedly drove a stolen truck toward a Goldsboro Police sergeant in a parking lot Tuesday night.
According to a police report, Edwin Luis Ortiz Jr., 30, of 1203 Ben Brewington Court, hit two police cars with a stolen Ford F-150 before heading in the direction of Sgt. Doug Bethea.
Ortiz was charged with assault with a deadly weapon on a government official, possession of a stolen vehicle, resisting arrest and careless and reckless driving.
The report said officers attempted to serve outstanding warrants on Ortiz in a parking lot, located at 2922 U.S. 70 West. The report said Ortiz had warrants for breaking and entering, larceny, probation violation and possession of stolen property out of Duplin County.
Ortiz refused to exit the truck and sped off when officers tried to get him out of the vehicle. He hit one police car and then another as he drove toward Bethea, but the report said Ortiz stopped the truck.
Maj. Anthony Carmon said no officers were injured during the incident.
Ortiz was placed under a $180,000 secured bond.
"I don't know if he is currently in jail," Carmon said. "But I'm going to imagine he is with that high of a bond."
NEW YORK (AP) — Just days before the Super Bowl, John Mellencamp sank to his knees in support of the Black Lives Matter movement after performing a political ballad on the “Late Show With Stephen Colbert.”
The singer-songwriter sang the violin-and-piano dirge “Easy Target,” with the lyrics “In the street and the gutters/ The cotton fields in this land/ Here's an easy target.” At the end, he knelt and lifted his right fist into the air.
The song comes from Mellencamp's album “Sad Clowns & Hillbillies,” which came out late last year.
Former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started the kneeling movement at the national anthem to protest racial inequality and police mistreatment of black males. The protests prompted President Donald Trump to say players should be fired for not standing during the anthem.
“Taking the knee started purely and simply as a protest of racial and social injustice,” Mellencamp told The Associated Press. “Sadly it was politicized by the current administration. The song is simple and the protest is pure.”
DURHAM, N.C. — Raashean Davis matched his career-high with 23 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to lead North Carolina Central to a 72-61 Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference victory over Delaware State Saturday, keeping the Hornets winless in conference play.
Raekwon Harney scored at the basket in the final minute of the first half to give NC Central a 40-34 lead, but Artem Tavakalyan hit a 3 with :38 left to send Delaware State into intermission trailing by just three, 40-37.
Zacarry Douglas' layup with 15:56 left in the game sparked an 8-0 run by the Eagles to go up by double digits, 54-44.
Reginald Gardner Jr. and Pablo Rivas scored 13 and 12 points, respectively, for NC Central (11-10, 5-2) and Jordan Perkins added 10 points, seven boards and six assists.

SARAJEVO British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on Thursday a United Nations resolution should be passed before any unilateral action was taken in Syria.
"It is very important to try first to get out a U.N. resolution," Johnson told reporters in Sarajevo.
"I cannot understand how anybody on U.N. security council could fail to sign up to a motion condemning the actions of the regime that is almost certainly responsible for that crime," Johnson told reporters.

Even if the government's plans for new customs arrangements with the EU were agreed to by the EU, these proposals will only delay the economic pain caused by leaving the customs union.
The only way to ensure ‘free and frictionless' trade with the EU is to remain a full member of the Customs Union and Single Market.
We still face the prospect of more red tape for businesses, longer queues at our borders and higher prices for consumers once the transition comes to an end.
In addition, Liam Fox's plans to lower UK standards and drop the ban on chlorinated chicken would inevitably lead to customs checks by the EU. You can't have it both ways.

New data reveals thousands of people are attending A&E in the West Midlands and leaving without being treated.
In September, 1,063 attendances the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust were recorded as having left A&E before being seen for treatment, 6.7% of all attendances, the highest proportion in England.
The number leaving before treatment is more than triple the 305 attendances recorded as having left A&E before being seen for treatment in September 2015, when 2.8% of attendances were recorded as leaving.
At University Hospital Birmingham, 466 attendances were recorded as having left A&E before being seen for treatment, 4.9%, up 79% from 260 in September 2015.
Across England, 3.2% of attendances at A&E departments were recorded as having left A&E before being seen for treatment, a total of 53,000 attendances.
This was a quarter higher than the 42,461 recorded in September 2015, when 2.7% of attendances left before treatment, and 49% higher than in 2013, when the number was 35,604, 2.5% of attendances.
Commenting on figures, Dr Mark Porter, BMA council chair, said: “It is clear from these figures that patients are being let down by an overstretched system. The delays that patients are facing, for the care they need, have almost become the norm and this is unacceptable.
“Demand is now so great that hospitals are experiencing a year round crisis. Front-line staff are under serious pressure and are working flat-out, but the system can't cope with the number of patients needing to move through acute care, as the entire system is congested.
Have your say in the comments
“The entire health and social care system needs more capacity, including in accident and emergency departments, general practice and social and community care.
“The government must resolve the long-term funding, capacity and recruitment issues facing the system as a whole if we are to get to grips with the pressures hospitals face year in, year out, and which, as we're currently seeing, are compounded during the winter months.”
The median average time to initial assessment for attendances brought to A&E by ambulance was 6 minutes in September, with 95 per cent of patients being assessed within 2 hours 25 minutes.
For all patients receiving treatment, the median average time to treatment was 59 minutes with 95 per cent of patients receiving treatment within 3 hours 19 minutes, according to the figures from NHS Digital.
The median average total time in A&E for all patients was 2 hours 25 minutes, with 95 per cent of patients departing A&E within 6 hours 30 minutes of arrival.
MELBOURNE Singapore's Viant Commodities PTE Ltd said on Wednesday it has launched a joint venture with European copper products maker KME in Switzerland.
The venture, Tekvalia AG, will be based in Zug and will focus on trading and distribution of copper products and services through the supply chain in Europe, Viant Commodities Managing Director Rene van der Kam told Reuters.
"Viant in Singapore is very well capitalized, and it is enjoying very strong support from its banks, and we will leverage that to our European entities," van der Kam said.
"Tekvalia is not a sourcer to, or off-taker from KME," he said. "If that happens at all, it will be at arms' length. This is really to facilitate third-party business."
Tekvalia will be owned 51 percent by Viant and 49 percent. KME.
KME is one of the world's biggest copper product makers, with 15 production plants including in Germany, France, Italy Spain, China and the US, and is unit of Italy's diversified Intek Group SpA (IKG.MI).
Van der Kam set up Viant Commodities in June last year with offices in Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai and 15 staff, after Gunvor dismantled its metals trading business.
The trading house will offer structuring and some financing along the value chain including for scrap, semi-refined and finished products. It will retain its own Viant Commodities AG entity, launched in March, run by Vadim Linchevsky.

LONDON Foreign holidays remain a top priority for Europeans despite economic and security worries, tour operator Thomas Cook (TCG.L) said on Tuesday, reporting a 40 percent jump in bookings to Greece and signs of a recovery in travel to Turkey and Egypt.
"Customers' appetite to go abroad on holiday this summer is good across all our markets," CEO Peter Fankhauser said.
"After a slow start to the season and a tough year in 2016, we're seeing early signs that customers are beginning to go back to Turkey and Egypt," he added.
Thomas Cook, which unnerved investors in February with a cautious outlook, said that while it was seeing some pressure on profit margins due to more competition, strong demand for summer holidays meant it was on track to profit forecasts.
Analysts expect the group, which arranges holidays for around 20 million people a year, to report full-year operating profit of around 327 million pounds.
It said summer bookings for the group were up 10 percent compared to a weak period last year.
Tourists turned their backs on previously popular resorts in Turkey and elsewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean last summer because of concerns about security, leaving Thomas Cook scrambling to find more hotel rooms in Spain and Portugal.
It said it had expanded capacity in Greece this season, while smaller destinations such as Cyprus, Bulgaria and Croatia were also proving popular.
The Spanish market was more competitive however, it said, and it was focussing on selling higher-margin holidays rather than chasing volume growth.
Shares in the group were broadly flat at 89.30 pence at 0943 GMT.
Analysts at Jefferies, who have a "buy" rating on the stock, said they believed the margin pressure was manageable thanks to the group's cost savings strategy.

ESPN might want to send President Trump a check this month. Why should the four-letter network that allows their talent to call Trump a white supremacist with impunity, do such a thing? They should do it because their highly publicized feud with the president gave ESPN a nice little ratings bump.
Between President Trump's criticism of the NFL and Jemele Hill's tweeting, the cable sports network received a small, yet noticeable bump in the ratings, a new report shows.
advertisement
After ESPN host Jemele Hill began tweeting attacks on President Trump calling him a “white supremacist,” and the network's subsequently refused to punish her, the president and many others ratcheted up criticism of the network.
At one point after Hill attacked him, Trump tweeted a reminder that ESPN is losing fans and subscribers “in RECORD numbers.”
Not long after that, White House Press Spokesperson Sarah Sanders told the press that Hill's comments should be a “fireable offense.”
Hill's tweet was also subject of much criticism among conservatives, not to mention chatter from liberals praising Hill's attack on the president.
Apparently, all the controversy over Hill's comments and the subsequent refusal of the network to punish her in any way was enough to drive viewership up during the week the story was raging. However, the ratings bump was decidedly temporary as once the conflagration subsided, ESPN went right back to losing viewers.
A look at the ratings according to The Big Lead, shows that on September 25, 26, and 27, ESPN either gained a small positive ratings boost, or slowed its normal decline considerably.
For instance, between September 11 and 22, the 10 AM hour was down 14 percent and for Sept. 28 to October 4, it was down 21 percent. But during those three days of the Jemele Hill story the hour saw a five percent rise in ratings. Similarly, for the 6 PM broadcast of SportsCenter, the show was down 17 percent and 10 percent in the first and third set of dates, but up 11 percent during those three days encompassing the Hill controversy.
The Big Lead saw similar statistics in several other ESPN shows during the period, but all had one thing in common. As soon as the controversy cooled, they all went right back to losing an average of 14 percent of viewers each period.

NEW YORK — Dick Clark Productions is hitting back against Mariah Carey's claim it sabotaged her live performance on its “New Year's Rockin' Eve” special.
Carey's disaster during the annual New Year's Eve special in Times Square made international headlines: The superstar vocally stumbled through her short set, failing to sing for most of it despite a pre-recorded track of her songs playing in the background.
Carey was visibly upset during the performance and afterward tweeted “(expletive) happens.” Her representative Nicole Perna blamed technical difficulties, and in an interview with Billboard she said Dick Clark Productions hampered Carey's performance.
“She was not winging this moment and took it very seriously,” Perna told Billboard. “A shame that production set her up to fail.”
Perna said Carey's earpiece wasn't working and she flagged the issue to the production team but was told it would be OK when she got on stage.
“However, that was not the case, and they were again told that her earpiece was not working,” Perna said. “Instead of endeavoring to fix the issue so that Mariah could perform, they went live.”
In a statement released on Sunday, the production company called such claims “absurd.”
“As the premier producer of live television events for nearly 50 years, we pride ourselves on our reputation and long-standing relationships with artists,” it said. “To suggest that dcp (Dick Clark Productions), as producer of music shows including the American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, New Year's Rockin' Eve and Academy of Country Music Awards, would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd.”
It said that in “very rare instances” there are technical errors that can occur with live television. It said an initial investigation, however, indicated it had no involvement in the challenges associated with Carey's performance.
“We want to be clear that we have the utmost respect for Ms. Carey as an artist and acknowledge her tremendous accomplishments in the industry,” it said.
A person familiar with the production of the show who asked for anonymity to speak publicly about the incident said all of the other performers, including Gloria Estefan, rehearsed onsite for their performances and Carey was there but had a stand-in for her rehearsal, atypical for the show's performers. The person said all of the monitors were working and no technical problems were found.
Perna later disputed the claim that Carey did not rehearse.
“Mariah did in fact rehearse at 3:00 p.m., Perna said in an email to The Associated Press on Monday. “She went through vocals and her team ran through sound. All was well at rehearsal. She was prompt for rehearsal and her performance.”
Ironically, Carey was Dick Clark Productions' first live performer for the broadcast in 2005, when it went off without any such problems.

WICHITA, Kan. (AP) — The husband of a woman killed in a Dillons parking lot is suing the grocery store for negligence.
The Wichita Eagle reports 60-year-old Annette Hedke died in February 2015 after slipping in the parking lot and then struck by a vehicle driven by Dillons employee Christopher Schrader.
Schrader was charged with involuntary manslaughter, driving under the influence and other crimes. He was sentenced to nearly six years in prison.
Sean Brennan, Dennis Hedke's attorney, says it's unclear whether Schrader was working at the time of the accident.
The suit, asking for more than $75,000, says Dillons should have been aware of Schrader's alcohol problem that's shown from a previous felony DUI conviction.
Dillons spokewoman Sheila Lowrie said she could not comment on the suit, but that the company “remains deeply saddened by the tragic death of Mrs. Hedke.”

HARPURSVILLE, N.Y. (WATE) — Internet sensation, April the Giraffe, gave birth to a male calf over the weekend at Animal Adventure Park in Harpursville, New York.
The park has launched a campaign for the public to help name the calf. Fans can vote on any name they choose, including the spelling for the first part of the campaign. During the second part of the campaign, the top 10 names will be voted on.
Funds raised from the campaign will go toward giraffe conversation efforts, Ava's Little Heros and the park.
Votes can be submitted online.
Five things to know about April and her newborn.
INTERNET STAR:
More than 1.2 million viewers watched the birth in real time thanks to Animal Adventure's livestream. The zoo began streaming from April's enclosure in February. People around the world have been tuning in daily. Animal Adventure's owner, Jordan Patch, has described the global attention as “overwhelming” for him and his four-member staff, who also care for 200 other animals.
WORTH THE WAIT:
Giraffes have one of the longest gestation periods of any animal, about 15 months. Newborn giraffes generally weigh about 150 pounds (68.04 kilograms) and are about 6 feet (1.83 meters) tall at birth. Animal Adventure has not announced a height and weight for April's calf.
MAY-DECEMBER MATING:
The yet-to-be-named calf is the fourth calf for 15-year-old April. The calf's father, Oliver, who watched the birth from an adjacent pen, is a first-time father at the age of 5. Male giraffes don't help raise their young.
GOODBYE AFTER WEANING:
The zoo's owner says the newborn will stay with April until he is weaned, which can take six months or longer. The calf will then move on to another zoo. Animal Adventure says it can't keep the offspring because that could lead to incestuous mating.
NO VISITORS YET:
Animal Adventure is in rural Harpursville, New York. It is currently closed and will open to the public in mid-May. The nearest city is Binghamton, about 15 minutes away.

5G is going to be a really big deal.
The lightning quick “next generation” wireless technology is expected to power self-driving cars, virtual reality, smart cities and networked robots.
But what else can it do?
Ericsson (ERIC) has joined up with researchers from King's College London to dream up futuristic applications for 5G. They're looking at everything from music to medicine.
The team is focused on using the technology to transfer physical skills across networks, creating something they call the “Internet of Skills.”
One example: A surgeon with virtual reality equipment and haptic gloves, which sense motion and pressure, could operate on a patient on the other side of the world via a robot.
Remote surgery has been possible for a while, but 5G speeds should eliminate all delays and lag. That means the surgeon could get instant feedback via the gloves.
“With 5G and the new networking architecture we're building, we're hoping to get this delay down to just the speed of light,” said Mischa Dohler, a professor of wireless communications at King's College.
Dohler, who moonlights as a composer and pianist, also plans to digitize his piano skills and teach people remotely to master the instrument.
Haptic gloves can be used to track and record the movement of Dohler's fingers, and the position of his hands. The data would be stored on the skills database, ready to be downloaded by an aspiring pianist.
“They would download that in real time on to an exoskeleton, which would start to move their fingers until the muscle memory is trained,” said Dohler.
“They could actually practice their muscle memory anywhere they want,” he added.
Dohler also imagines a surgeon could upload their skills to a database to train students around the world.
But he said it might take another decade for this “Internet of Skills” to be fully functional.
“We need to get security rights and the best practice of this technology right, because the moment you start moving things on the other side of the planet, you can do a lot of harm,” he said.

MERRIAM, Kan. -- Police say a parent playing with children in a Kansas park found a quart-sized mason jar of marijuana, a loaded gun and a scale while looking for a lost ball.
"I called it the marijuana dealer's starter kit," Merriam Police Capt. Troy Duvanel said. "Because you've got everything. You've got your scale here for weighing out the product, cellphone for communicating with your clients, obviously your product, and your protection."
Police say the adult found the weapon and contraband on Memorial Day at Campbell Park in Merriam, according to investigators. The gun was a loaded 9 mm Beretta, caked with dirt.
"It could have ended badly if a kid or someone had found it," Duvanel said.
He said, judging by the all dirt on the loaded gun, it could have been in the park for weeks. He warned the public not to touch any found weapons.
"Just call the police and let us deal with it because you don't know the condition of it," he said.
The findings worry Sandy Paida, who lives next to Campbell Park. She had a picnic there with her 9-year-old granddaughter Tuesday.
"That's very scary," Paida said. "I don't let the kids come down here by themselves. I'm always with them, but still, they're down here and they're walking around. Anybody could have found it."
Paida said everything about the abandoned "starter pack" was strange.
"My concern is why was it left here? If somebody pulled up and scared them and they just threw it and ran? Which way did they run?" Paida said.
Those are all questions Merriam police don't have the answers to yet.
"If somebody had to leave it for an emergency, if somebody consumed too much of their own product and forgot where they placed it, it's difficult to say," Duvanel said.
Merriam police said once they send everything to forensics for prints and DNA testing, there's a good chance they'll find who it belonged to. They haven't turned the phone on yet, but when they find the person who left behind the drugs, scale, phone and gun, he or she will likely be arrested for possession with intent to distribute.

The U.S. wind industry installed 2,000 megawatts of capacity in the first quarter, nearly four times the amount installed in the same period last year, as developers race to capture a lucrative federal tax credit that is gradually being phased out.
It was the industry's biggest first quarter since 2009, the American Wind Energy Association said in its first-quarter market report released on Tuesday.
Project construction and development activity is also robust, as the federal production tax credit for wind projects does not expire until 2020. Starting this year, however, the credit's value will drop by 20 percent each year for projects that start construction from 2017 through 2019.
There are 9,025 MW of wind projects under construction and an additional 11,952 MW in advanced development, AWEA said.
About a quarter of the megawatts installed in the first quarter are contracted to buyers outside the utility industry, including the U.S. Army, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google. Home Depot Inc and Intuit Inc also signed contracts for new wind projects for the first time in the first quarter.
Just a handful of companies represent nearly all the utility wind capacity additions since the beginning of 2016. They include Xcel Energy Inc, Berkshire Hathaway Inc's MidAmerican Energy, Alliant Energy Corp and DTE Energy Co.
Texas, the country's top state for wind power capacity, was the top location for wind installations in the first quarter, followed by Kansas, New Mexico, North Carolina and Michigan.

Ohio Governor John Kasich says federal immigration officials following federal laws by deporting illegal aliens is “not my country.”
In an interview with open borders activist and journalist Jorge Ramos, Kasich said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were “dead wrong” for enforcing federal immigration laws by deporting illegal aliens back to their native countries.
Ramos asked Kasich if he believed the current 12 to 30 million illegal aliens currently residing in the United States should be allowed to stay in the country permanently. Kasich responded:
I don't think they should be citizens, but I think they should be able to be here, yes, and live in our country. But the idea that we would try to just go round them up… and look, these stories where these ICE agents are going into people's homes, to me, that's not my country. That's not the way that I think we should handle these things. I think it's dead wrong. [Emphasis added]
My podcast: John Kasich speaks to a different side of the Republican Party https://t.co/RxeRDwMvoQ via @Audioboom — JORGE RAMOS (@jorgeramosnews) February 2, 2018
Earlier in the interview, Kasich said he opposed President Trump's popular, pro-American views on immigration, favoring a multicultural society.
“I happen to believe that a society that allows people to come in with kind of different views, different attitudes, different beliefs, strengthens your country, it doesn't weaken your country,” Kasich said.
Kasich's open borders views remain out-of-tune with the majority of Americans who, when polled this week, said they want to see the construction of Trump's planned wall for the U.S.-Mexico border, as Breitbart News reported.
Likewise, a plurality of Americans said they want to see legal immigration levels reduced to one to 250,000 legal immigrants admitted to the U.S. a year – a plan that would raise the wages of American workers while increasing the quality of life and decreasing the immigration burden for America's working and middle-class communities.
When asked, “In your opinion, about how many legal immigrants should be admitted to the U.S. each year,” 48 percent of black Americans in the latest Harvard-Harris poll said they would like to see between one and 250,000 legal immigrants brought to the U.S. a year.
Every year the U.S. admits more than 1.5 million foreign nationals, with the vast majority deriving from family-based chain migration, whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S. In 2016, the legal and illegal immigrant population reached a record high of 44 million. By 2023, the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that the legal and illegal immigrant population of the U.S. will make up nearly 15 percent of the entire U.S. population.
Mass legal immigration to the U.S. has come at the expense of America's working and middle class, which has suffered from poor job growth, stagnant wages, and increased public costs to offset the importation of millions of low-skilled foreign nationals.

Eary Murray says Charlot's was found laying on his back in the woods. (Photo source: WLOX News)
The discovery of a body Friday turned a missing person's report into a homicide investigation.
Friday night police removed crime scene tape around Kenneth Charlot's Seal Avenue home in Pass Christian.
The 60-year-old was reported missing Thursday by family members. The next day his body was found abandoned in a wooded area off 30th Avenue in Gulfport. Two men found his body around 11 a.m.
"Hey! Hey! Buddy, while I was going into the woods…," said Eary Murray as he walked up to a body he saw in the woods.
Murray never got a response.
Murray said he was just showing his friend around the area when he saw the gruesome scene.
"I saw what I thought were mannequin legs parts, and then at second look I realized it was a body," Murray recalled.
He said that Charlot was partially clothed.
"As soon as I got close to him, I knew he had gotten beaten and rolled into the woods," he said.
Pass Christian police said after visiting Charlot's home there was information observed that required further investigation.
Pass Christian Chief Timothy Hendricks was not able to say much about what they saw, but he did say they have no person of interest yet.
"Whoever did it, man, I hope you get what you deserve. I really do. Nobody deserves anything like that. I don't care what it was for drugs, money, whatever. It doesn't matter. Nobody deserves anything like that," said Murray.
Murray, who lives nearby, said cops told him Charlot wasn't killed where his body was found.
"That was a little bit of a relief. If I had heard someone out here… I'd a done something. My heart goes out to his family. I pray for him."
Investigators are creating a timeline on what Charlot was doing before he went missing.
If you saw or talked to Charlot recently or know anything that might help bring his killer or killers to justice call Pass Christian Police or Mississippi Coast Crimestoppers.

NEW YORK, March 29 You know a case is momentous when a seemingly routine proposed briefing schedule turns into a hot dispute. Waymo's patent and trade secrets suit accusing Uber of hijacking its technology for driverless cars is only five weeks old, but lawyers for both sides are already deep in litigation chess games.
On Monday, Uber's lawyers at Morrison & Foerster and Boies Schiller & Flexner filed a motion to compel arbitration of Waymo's trade secrets and California unfair competition claims. The motion claimed Waymo's lawyers at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan are trying to get away with a bit of litigation trickery.
According to Uber, the crux of Waymo's case, filed in federal court in San Francisco, is that engineer Anthony Levandowski, who led Waymo's self-driving tech team for years, downloaded more than 14,000 sensitive files before he left the company to start up his own self-driving venture, which was later acquired by Uber.
Levandowski, Uber said, signed two different employment contracts during his nine-year stint at Google and Waymo, both of which are subsidiaries of Alphabet. The agreements contained provisions requiring the engineer to arbitrate disputes with the company.
Uber's lawyers argued that because Waymo is accusing Uber of benefiting from Levandowski's supposed violation of his employment contract, Levandowski's arbitration clause applies.
Uber's brief cited cases to back its argument, which is based on the legal principle of equitable estoppel.
In the closest parallel to the Waymo case, a federal judge in San Jose ordered the tech company Torbit to arbitrate its case against a fired software developer who allegedly misused Torbit trade secrets when he started his own company, Datanyze.
Datanyze wasn't subject to the employment agreement between Torbit and the developer, but the judge ruled the claims against the company were intertwined with allegations against the former employee.
But Waymo, unlike Torbit in the Datanyze case, did not name its former employee as a defendant. It sued only Uber, not Levandowski, the former Waymo engineer who supposedly misappropriated Waymo data and brought it to his new employers at Uber.
"DELIBERATE ATTEMPT" TO BYPASS PRECEDENT
Uber's motion called that elision a deliberate attempt to get around precedent requiring Waymo to go to arbitration. “Despite the myriad allegations about Levandowski's serious misconduct while a Waymo employee, Waymo omits him as a named defendant,” Uber's motion said. “Waymo's purpose for proceeding in this curious manner seems clear: through artful pleading, it hopes to avoid arbitrating the misappropriation … claims at all costs.”
Waymo, meanwhile, contends there is something fishy about the timing of Uber's motion to compel arbitration. Uber first suggested at a hearing on March 16 that it would try to force Waymo into arbitration instead of litigating in federal court.
On March 22, according to Waymo, Uber lawyer Arturo Gonzalez of MoFo said in an email to a Waymo lawyer that the motion would be filed the following day. Instead, Uber waited until three days later to file its motion.
The timing is significant because the judge overseeing the litigation, U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco, has scheduled a May 4 hearing on Waymo's motion for a preliminary injunction to block Uber from using supposedly misappropriated information.
The judge told both sides at the March 16 hearing that he didn't want to go to the trouble of a preliminary injunction hearing if the case is going to end up in arbitration.
Uber has proposed an expedited schedule to get its motion before Judge Alsup on April 13, three weeks before the May 4 injunction hearing. The proposed schedule would only give Waymo until April 3 to file its opposition to Uber's arbitration motion.
That's not long enough, Waymo said in a filing Tuesday - and Waymo should not be disadvantaged by Uber's delay. If Uber had filed its motion on March 23, Waymo said, an ordinary briefing schedule would have given Waymo a full allotment of 14 days to oppose arbitration and still allowed Judge Alsup to hold a hearing before the May 4 injunction session.
“Rather than accept the consequences of their own delay, defendants have asked Waymo to sacrifice half of its 14 days to respond to defendants' motion so that their motion could be heard before May 4,” Waymo said. “It is unreasonable for defendants to seek to have Waymo's response time cut in half simply because defendants delayed filing their motion.”
HIDING ARGUMENTS UNDER SEAL
Judge Alsup, who is all too familiar with the relentless litigation tactics of big tech companies from previously presiding over a hard-fought case between Google and Oracle, said in an order Tuesday that he intends to grant “a measure” of Uber's proposed hurry-up schedule.
He also said he's not happy about the extent of redaction in Uber's motion to compel arbitration. “Our federal courts belong to the public, and the public and the press have a legitimate interest in looking over our shoulders to see the work in progress,” he wrote. “Parties should not hide those arguments under seal out of a desire to shroud business dealings in secrecy.”
That part of Judge Alsup's order prompted Uber on Tuesday to blame Waymo for the redactions – even as Uber requested a secret meeting in the judge's chambers “to protect legitimate privacy concerns” unrelated to the redactions.
Uber said it only blacked out portions of its arbitration motion because Waymo's former parent, Google, insisted “that the existence of an arbitration (provision) and every word in its employment agreements must be kept in the strictest confidence.”
I emailed lawyers for both Uber and Waymo to ask about the litigation gamesmanship. None got back to me.

The regional organization, which aims to promote peace and security in Southeast Asia and promote economic cooperation among member-nations, celebrates its 50th anniversary this year
MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines will be playing host to members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) this 2017, hosting conferences and the leaders' summit this year.
The Philippines' chairmanship of ASEAN coincides with the 50th anniversary of the regional bloc, of which the Philippines was one of the founding members. The government has promised an "extraordinary and amazing" hosting of the ASEAN Summit and other related events, with P15 billion allocated in the 2017 budget for the yearlong event.
As the bloc gears up for its commemoration of its 50th year, we take a look back at key facts and events behind its formation.
Founding
ASEAN was established on August 8, 1967 in Bangkok, Thailand, with the signing of what became known as the ASEAN Declaration or the Bangkok Declaration, signed by the 5 founding fathers of the regional organization: Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.
ASEAN replaced the Association of South East Asia (ASA), which was formed in 1961 by the Philippines, Thailand, and Malaysia.
From the original 5 members, ASEAN eventually expanded membership to include Brunei, which joined in 1984; Vietnam in 1995; Laos and Myanmar in 1997; and Cambodia in 1999.
The organization, which aimed to promote peace and security in Southeast Asia and foster economic development and cooperation among member nations, was formed with the ongoing Vietnam War in its backdrop, and the fall of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia to communist regimes.
Aims and principles
ASEAN was born with the signing of the ASEAN declaration by the 5 foreign ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, who spent 4 days negotiating over the document at a beach resort in Bang Saen, southeast of Bangkok.
The ASEAN declaration contained only 5 articles, which described the aims and purposes of ASEAN and how these were to be carried out and implemented. ASEAN, they said, aims to achieve the following:
accelerate the economic growth, social progress and cultural development in the region
promote regional peace and stability
promote active collaboration and mutual assistance on matters of common interest
provide assistance to each other in the form of training and research facilities
collaborate more effectively for the greater utilization of agriculture and industries, expansion of their trade, improvement of transportation and communications facilities, and raising the living standards of their peoples
promote Southeast Asian studies
maintain close cooperation with existing international and regional organizations with similar aims and purposes, and explore all avenues for even closer cooperation
It also stated the the association is open for participation to all states in the Southeast Asian region subscribing to the same principles and purposes. The declaration also said that ASEAN represents “the collective will of the nations of Southeast Asia to bind themselves together in friendship and cooperation and, through joint efforts and sacrifices, secure for their peoples and for posterity the blessings of peace, freedom and prosperity.”
The signatories were Adam Malik of Indonesia, Narciso R. Ramos of the Philippines, Tun Abdul Razak of Malaysia, S. Rajaratnam of Singapore, and Thanat Khoman of Thailand.
Challenges for ASEAN
In their speeches following the signing of the declaration, the foreign ministers recognized the need for the countries of Southeast Asia to work together as the region faces challenges in uncertain times.
Then-Philippine foreign affairs secretary Narciso Ramos – father of former Philippine president Fidel Ramos – said that by regional cooperation, ASEAN "could marshal the still untapped potentials of this rich region through more substantial united action."
For his part, Adam Malik of Indonesia shared his vision for Southeast Asia as a region that can "stand on its own feet, strong enough to defend itself against any negative influence from outside the region."
For S. Rajaratnam of Singapore, it is imperative for ASEAN members to combine national thinking with regional thinking.
He said: "We must think not only of our national interests but posit them against regional interests: that is a new way of thinking about our problems. And these are two different things and sometimes they can conflict. Secondly, we must also accept the fact, if we are really serious about it, that regional existence means painful adjustments to those practices and thinking in our respective countries. We must make these painful and difficult adjustments. If we are not going to do that, then regionalism remains a utopia."
Third time for PH
Since its founding, ASEAN has held semiannual meetings hosted by its member-countries. This year, the Philippines will be hosting the 30th and 31st summit in April and in November.
This will be the third time that the Philippines will host the ASEAN Summit. The first was in December 1987, which saw the approval of the Manila Declaration 1987 that promoted the principle of sustainable development and its integration in all aspects of development, among other things.
In January 2007, the 12th ASEAN Summit was held in Cebu. The leaders committed to establish an ASEAN charter that would serve as a "firm foundation in achieving one ASEAN Community by providing an enhanced institutional framework as well as conferring a legal personality to ASEAN."
The 30th ASEAN summit will be held this month in Manila, while the 31st will be held in November in Clark, Pampanga.
Tensions, problems
While the regional bloc aims to foster cooperation and goodwill among the ASEAN member-nations, the organization has faced problems and disagreement in the past. The hotly-contested South China Sea has been a constant source of tension among ASEAN members, with the bloc failing to release the customary joint communique for the first time in 2012 because of it.
The Philippines was caught in a word war with then-ASEAN host Cambodia, which supposedly opposed the mention in the joint statement of Scarborough Shoal, over which the Philippines and China are in a heated dispute.
But Cambodia, a Beijing ally, resisted, and said that it cannot accept "that the joint statement has become hostage of the bilateral issue (between the Philippines and China)."
In 2016, the ASEAN chairman's statement noted serious concerns in the South China Sea, but did not mention the historic ruling by an arbitral tribunal in The Hague that favored the Philippines.
ASEAN has also faced dilemmas with the actions of its members. In 2007, Myanmar's prime minister Thein Sein forced ASEAN summit host Singapore to disinvite UN envoy Ibrahim Gambari, who was supposed to brief regional leaders. This happened as Myanmar faced international backlash over its crackdown on street protests.
Then Philippine president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo had also warned that the Philippines was unlikely to ratify a new ASEAN charter unless Myanmar's opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was released. – Rappler.com
UPDATE 3-Nestle takes food price rises in its stride
ZURICH, Aug 9 Nestle expects pressure from the rising price of ingredients for its products such as chocolate bars, coffee and soup to ease, helping it meet its target for increasing sales despite tough markets.
LONDON, April 10 Arsenal's despondent manager Arsene Wenger was left to assess the consequences of a "damaging" and "worrying defeat" after a toothless 3-0 reverse at relegation-threatened Crystal Palace on Monday left their top-four aspirations in jeopardy.
After a run of five defeats in eight Premier League games, Arsenal have fallen from second to sixth -- seven points behind fourth-placed Manchester City who have played a game more.
In late January, Wenger's side were the nearest challengers to leaders Chelsea but they now find themselves level on points with seventh-placed Everton, who have played two matches more.
During Arsenal's plummet out of title contention only West Ham United and the bottom two, Middlesbrough and Sunderland, have collected fewer points.
"It's damaging, of course" Wenger, who has led Arsenal to 20 successive top-four finishes, told Sky Sports. "It's very worrying and disappointing the way we lost the game.
"On that front, that is the most difficult for us. It has consequences on our chances to be in the top four.
"Every defeat is a big worry. I've managed over 1,100 games for Arsenal and we're not used to that. It's a big worry.
"Unfortunately, it is like that and we have to respond very quickly and not accept it. I'm disappointed and determined to put things right."
DIFFICULT DEFEAT
The manner of the defeat at a buoyant Selhurst Park was of particular concern for a side who were outmuscled and outplayed in a performance that reflected a dire few months for the Gunners.
Andros Townsend, Yohan Cabaye and Luka Milivojevic scored for Palace, who were dominated the match and could have scored more goals. Arsenal, meanwhile, did not have a single shot on target in the second half.
Amid widespread concern about the team's recent performances under Wenger from disgruntled supporters, the Frenchman has had to deal with almost incessant questioning about his future.
"I face it in every press conference at the moment but tonight I'm not in the mood to speak about it," he told the BBC.
"Tonight the worry is not me, it's the fact we lost a big game and that's a big worry. We are in a difficult position.
"What counts are how we perform on the pitch, the players and myself and I feel everyone is focused in the club to do it."

If there was ever a chance for Vicki Gunvalson to mend her friendship with Shannon Beador, that was pretty much thrown out of the window on Monday's Real Housewives of Orange County.
The former BFFs have been on the outs in recent seasons, driven by fights over Gunvalson's part in ex-boyfriend Brooks Ayers' cancer scam and Gunvalson's shocking claim that Shannon's husband David has “beat the s— out of [Shannon]” during their marriage.
Those allegations have had particularly damaging effects on Shannon. Though she has vehemently denied their truth at every chance she could — beginning with the moment they were first raised on camera during a group trip to Ireland and then more clearly at the RHOC season 11 reunion — the stress of the false rumors led her to emotionally eat and gain 40 lbs. between seasons.
“I am angry with myself that I let what she put out there affect me,” Shannon said on Monday. “It affected me physically because I just ate more, I didn't care. I was just a mess. David does a lot of things but he doesn't beat me.”
But Gunvalson, as it turns out, hasn't backed down.
While chatting with fellow Housewife Kelly Dodd in a scene that aired Monday, the 55-year-old Coto Insurance owner balked at Shannon's anger — claiming that she wasn't lying when she brought up the abuse allegations. “I have text messages and pictures!” Gunvalson said.
It was unclear exactly what text message and photos Gunavlson was referring to, but it could have been the same photos Shannon showed Andy Cohen during the RHOC season 11 reunion.
“That was the darkest place for me,” Shannon said at the reunion through tears as she looked through pictures of bruising she had received on her right shoulder and her right hip when she attempted to break open a door during a fight she had with David in the wake of his cheating scandal. “My husband did not beat me. He had had an affair on me and I was doing my best to bring my family back together.”
She also explained on the reunion a 2003 call she made to police while she and David were having an argument. “It was nothing physical,” Shannon said. “We had a verbal argument — I wanted the argument to end. … I would never stay in a marriage if I were beat up. I would never teach that to my children.”
Though her words were passionate, Gunvalson didn't apologize to Shannon for making the claims — saying that she herself had been hurt by things that had gone on. And since then, the O.G. of the O.C. has found herself estranged from Shannon and their RHOC costar Tamra Judge (who had her own set of problems with Gunvalson).
RELATED VIDEO: Vicki Gunvalson on Why ‘The Gloves Are Coming Off' with Shanon Beador and Tamra Judge
On Monday they all came face-to-face at a “sip and see” for Meghan King Edmonds' new daughter, Aspen, where Shannon and Judge did their best to avoid speaking to Gunvalson.
The isolation hurt Gunvalson, who told new Housewife Peggy Sulahian,”When my life was bad, they stocked out.”
“They knew they were hurting me. And that's kind of unforgivable,” Gunvalson explained. “We're all very scarred. We're very scarred, we're very damaged. And it'll never be as it was before but we have to be classy ladies and able to be in the same place together and try our very best to move on.”
Her perspective didn't seem to sit well with Judge when it got back to her.
“You know, what I have zero respect for that woman and I don't ever care to be in the same room with her,” she told King Edmonds. “You've got to understand, I have 10 years of this girl. I've had so much fun with her and I've done so much with her and given so much of my life to her and my family and my kids and all that. So somebody is talking rumors about your family? It's just sick. It shows character. Because she's an extremely insecure, f—ing bitch. … she's trash. She's like the f—ing s— on the bottom of my shoe.”
Shannon wasn't phased much either: “Vicki is so set on her delusional view of the world, that nothing that anyone can say or do is ever going to change her mind,” she said.

But saying nothing was worse in Gunvalson's eyes. By party's end, she appeared more annoyed than ever — and told viewers she was ready to “punish” Shannon and Judge.
“I was wanting so bad to be their friend. Fighting for it,” Gunvalson said. “What did I ever see in either one of them?”
“I'm so over the bulls— with myself Tamra and Shannon. … I'm done trying to pussyfoot around this,” Gunvalson continued. “Tamra knows I'm a great friend — I had a lot of fun with her. Shannon too. And I want them to know that they can't do this to people. They cannot be bullies and try to come conquer and divide. I want to punish them for not being my friend.”
The Real Housewives of Orange County airs Mondays (9 p.m. ET) on Bravo.

* SSEC +0.1 pct, CSI300 flat, HSI -0.6 pct
* Most Fed policymakers see bond policy change this year -minutes
* China March services expand at weakest pace in 6 months
* China construction plays extend gains on economic zone plan
SHANGHAI, April 6 Hong Kong stocks fell on Thursday morning, as investors fretted about a possible investment change by the Federal Reserve and anxiously awaited the meeting between the U.S. and Chinese presidents later in the day.
Many China shares held onto the previous day's solid gains. Construction stocks remained popular after China launched a new economic zone, offsetting any negative impact from a survey finding eased activity in China's service sector in March.
In Hong Kong, whose market is more exposed to global volatility, the benchmark Hang Seng index dropped 0.6 percent at midday, to 24,255.26 points, while the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index lost 1.0 percent, to 10,265.58 points.
Analysts say risk appetites shrank on news that most Fed policymakers think the central bank should take steps to begin trimming its king-sized balance sheet later this year as long as U.S. economic data holds up.
Investors were looking into President Donald Trump's first face-to-face meeting with China President Xi Jinping, with trade and security issues set to figure prominently.
"As long as they don't have huge conflict, the meeting won't have much impact," said Alex Wong, Hong Kong-based director of Ample Finance Group.
Wong also brushed aside the latest economic indicators about China. Activity in the service sector expanded at its weakest pace in six months in March, hurt by slower growth in new orders and intensifying cost pressures, a private survey showed.
"Investors are generally optimistic towards mainland's consumption and real estate sector," he said, adding that the Hong Kong and China markets were expected to outperform global peers.
A flurry of data in coming weeks is expected to show solid economic growth in China in March.
Nearly all sectors in Hong Kong retreated by the lunch break.
Shares of index heavyweight China Unicom rose more than 3 percent, hitting their highest level in nearly 18 months after the telecom operator released new restructuring plans. But then they tumbled, and were down 2.2 percent at midday.
In China, the blue-chip CSI300 index was roughly flat at 3,502.10 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.1 percent, to 3,273.76 points.
Sector performance in the mainland markets was mixed.
An index tracking infrastructure plays was up 2 percent at midday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's TSB Bank expects to pay more in fees to Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) for using its former owner's banking platform, as it posted a profit fall in 2017 as a result of the payments.
Since it was taken over by Spain's Banco Sabadell (SABE.MC) in 2015, TSB has been using Lloyds' IT infrastructure, at a cost of hundreds of millions of pounds each year.
TSB said on Friday its operating costs rose by 16.7 percent to 821 million pounds in 2017 while its profit before tax fell to 162.7 million pounds, primarily due to a 122 million pound increase in the fees payable to Lloyds.
The fall in the bank's profit was also as a result of a non-recurring gain from the sale of its interest in Visa Europe, worth 32.5 million pounds, in the previous year.
TSB said it will finally migrate off the Lloyds platform and onto a newly-built one this year, but until the roll-out is complete, it remains tied into fee increases.
The bank also named a new chairman, with former Standard Chartered banker Richard Meddings, a non-executive director at TSB, succeeding Will Samuel with immediate effect.
TEL AVIV- A new children's program on official Palestinian Authority TV showcases arch-terrorist Abu Jihad, credited by the PA for the murders of at least 125 Israelis, as “a role model to be followed.”
Called From My Country, the show, which has aired twice so far, opens with a cube featuring notable Palestinians. One of them is Khalil al-Wazir, also known as Abu Jihad, a co-founder of the Fatah party and an architect of the first Intifada.
As the head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's (PLO) military wing, Abu Jihad planned multiple terror attacks, including the infamous Coastal Road massacre in which a bus was hijacked and 38 Israelis, including 13 children, were killed.
“Hello my dear friends and welcome to the program From My Country. You certainly know how beautiful our country is,” the show's host, a girl who looks to be around 10 years old, says.
“The most beautiful thing is that all of this beauty of our country is reflected by great personalities who have given and are giving much to the homeland, whether in the political, literary, artistic or scientific struggle,” she continues, according to a translation by watchdog Palestinian Media Watch, which first published the report.
The show's young viewers are instructed to “follow the example of these symbols.”
“The prominent personalities struggled by way of pens, paintbrushes, words, weapons and knowledge,” the host says.
The six personalities showcased include late PLO leader Yasser Arafat and Ghassan Kanafani, a writer and leader of the terror group the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).
In May of last year, Breitbart Jerusalem reported on the launch of a soccer tournament named after Abu Jihad under the auspices of the Palestinian Football Association.
FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) — A self-driving Uber vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian in a Phoenix suburb in the first fatality involving a fully autonomous test vehicle, prompting the ride-hailing company Monday to suspend all road-testing of such autos in the U.S. and Canada.
Depending on who is found to be at fault, the accident could have far-reaching consequences for the development of self-driving vehicles, which have been billed as potentially safer than human drivers.
The Volvo was in self-driving mode with a human operator behind the wheel when a woman walking outside a crosswalk in Tempe on Sunday night was hit, police said. The woman, identified as Elaine Herzberg, 49, died at a hospital.
Uber suspended all of its self-driving vehicle testing in the Phoenix area, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.
The testing has been going on for months as automakers and technology companies compete to be the first with the technology.
Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi expressed condolences on his Twitter account and said the company is working with local law enforcement on the investigation.
The federal government has voluntary guidelines for companies that want to test autonomous vehicles, leaving much of the regulation up to states.
But Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao also has said technology and automobile companies need to allay public fears of self-driving vehicles, citing a poll showing that 78 percent of people fear riding in autonomous vehicles
The number of states considering legislation related to autonomous vehicles gradually has increased each year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In 2017 alone, 33 states introduced legislation.
California is among those that require manufacturers to report any incidents to the motor vehicle department during the testing phase. As of early March, the agency received 59 such reports.
Israel irrigation firm Netafim draws interest from 6 bidders -report

Fox News and Wall Street Journal boss Rupert Murdoch has reportedly “repeatedly urged” President Donald Trump to kick White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon to the curb.
New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman reported on Monday that Murdoch's latest demand to get rid of Bannon came at a recent dinner with White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner before Trump headed off to Bedminster, New Jersey. Kushner, who has tried multiple times to shiv Bannon and remove him from the White House, “has been in open warfare” with Bannon since the spring, according to Haberman, and has clearly sided with his fellow Democrats and globalists in the West Wing and outside the White House.

As the Times noted, Bannon “embodies the defiant populism at the core of” Trump's agenda, and Trump forged a “foxhole friendship” with Bannon during the 2016 campaign when Bannon stood by Trump when nearly everyone else ran as far away from Trump as possible, especially after the release of the Access Hollywood tapes.
Bannon's nationalism may be why Murdoch has been urging Trump to dump Bannon in private and using his media properties like the Wall Street Journal to criticize him. Murdoch and his Journal, as Breitbart News noted, just last week used national security adviser H.R. McMaster as their “latest weapon in their continuing battle against Trump's America-first agenda and movement that enabled Trump to shock the world on election night.”
Murdoch has always been at odds with Bannon on key issues like illegal immigration and increases in foreign guest-worker visas.
As Breitbart News has pointed out, Murdoch's Journal rooted for former Florida Governor Jeb Bush to win the GOP nomination while not backing down from his “act of love” remarks about illegal immigrants and support for open borders. Murdoch's Journal cheered for Sens. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and John McCain's (R-AZ) Gang of Eight “amnesty bill,” preventing conservative icons like Rush Limbaugh and Sarah Palin from even presenting counterarguments on the air in what Limbaugh said was “quite telling” about the direction Fox News was going.
In March, Murdoch's Journal also said Bannon's support for economic nationalism and border security were unacceptable positions that caused “polarization” even though, as Breitbart News noted, “those issues united working-class Democrats and Republicans in the Rust Belt to deliver Trump his election-night win.” In addition, as Breitbart News pointed out, “the day after Murdoch reportedly requested to sit next [former President Barack Obama's confidante and top adviser Valerie] Jarrett at a dinner in 2014, he penned an op-ed in his Wall Street Journal in which Murdoch declared that amnesty for illegal immigrants and an unlimited number of high-tech guest-worker visas for Silicon Valley just ‘can't wait.'”
Murdoch, though, as Joshua Green noted in his book Devil's Bargain: Steve Bannon, Donald Trump and the Storming of the Presidency, initially mocked Trump and his movement. He thought the idea of Trump presidency was so absurd that he dissed Trump and his daughter Ivanka right to their faces at a lunch:
Soon after the three of them were seated and the waiter brought their soup, Ivanka spoke up: “My father has something to tell you.”
“What's that?” Murdoch said.
“He's going to run for president.”
“He's not running for president,” Murdoch replied without looking up from his soup.
“No, he is!” she insisted.
Murdoch changed the subject.
Trump nursed the slight for months. “He didn't even look up from his soup!” he'd complain.
Murdoch now apparently sees an opportunity to align with Democrat Kushner and the White House's Democrats and globalists and take over the White House in a way he could not do with Bush or Rubio.
Haberman reports that Rep. Steve King (R-IA) has said conservatives would be “crushed” if Trump dumped Bannon while Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), the House Freedom Caucus chair, is worried that removing Bannon from the White House may embolden the Democrats and globalists to push Trump away from his voters.
Here's the bottom line, though. Nobody is bigger than Trump. Certainly not Bannon.
But, as Trump himself has admitted numerous times, his movement is bigger than Trump. And getting rid of Bannon would be the strongest signal to his voters that Trump has sold them out, proving that Rubio was right when he mocked Trump as a con man during the 2016 campaign.
In West Virginia last month, Trump said his enemies were using the Russia scandals to take his historic election away from his movement.
“They can't beat us at the voting booths so they're trying to cheat you out of the future and the future that you won,” Trump said. “They're trying to cheat you out of the leadership you won, with a fake story that is demeaning to all of us.”
Murdoch, along with his globalist White House allies like Gary Cohn, is trying to “cheat” Trump's movement and voters like Trump's Deep State and media enemies are trying to do with the Russia “scandals.”
And if Trump allows the Democrats and globalists to steal the White House from his movement by ousting Bannon, he will no longer have the moral high ground to complain about Russia because he will have effectively flipped double middle fingers to his voters and movement by siding with his movement's opponents who have mocked and loathed Trump and his voters from the beginning.
In politics, as in life, it's important to dance with the one that brung ya.

Did You Know? • Camping spots at Battle Ground Lake State Park require reservations for visits between May 15 and Sept. 15, and those reservations can be made up to nine months in advance. For more information, visit http://parks.state.wa.us/472/Battle-Ground-Lake
BATTLE GROUND LAKE — There are many ways to begin the new year: a Champagne toast, fireworks or maybe just going to bed early. For many who love the outdoors, however, the start of 2017 was marked with a hike.
“The idea is starting your year off right (by) getting outdoors,” Washington State Parks Ranger Tom Riggs told a group of about 25 people who had gathered Sunday afternoon under a covered area at Battle Ground Lake State Park. They were about to head out on a First Day Hike, which has become an annual tradition for some.
There were perks to going hiking at a Washington state park on New Year's Day. The vehicle fee was waived, and at some locations a ranger was on hand to lead the adventure.
That meant wildlife interpretation from an expert. As Riggs guided the group, he told them about the available camping and hiking amenities at the 280-acre park, including rental cabins with electricity, 10 miles of trails and a camping area for equestrians. He also touched on the geological features of the lake and the park's vegetation.
The edge of the lake is also the rim of an old volcano. The eruption occurred roughly 100,000 years ago underneath a lake, which “super heated” the water and caused an explosion of steam and rock, Riggs said. Some of those rocks are visible today around the perimeter of the lake.
Douglas fir trees towered above the hikers on the tour, and snow fell softly, giving the clear, blue lake a winter-wonderland look. Near the lake's edge, a couple of small birds, possibly ruby-crowned kinglets, hopped along the ground.
The park's habitat is Western Washington lowland forest, with an English twist. Riggs said park officials are waging a war against English ivy, an invasive plant that covered some of the ground along the trail and had worked its way up numerous trees.
“That is non-native,” Riggs said. “We maintain a constant battle against it.”
Although temperatures were in the low 30s and it was snowing, the hikers didn't seem to mind.
It was Vancouver couple Mike Koon and Sue Vanlaanen's third year in a row on a New Year's hike. The previous two years, they went to state parks in Oregon, which have a similar program. One of the hikes, through the Mosier twin tunnels in the Columbia River Gorge, was so good that they later went back, bringing their family along.
First Day Hikes are “a great way to start out the year, get out and move, and digest the overeating from the night before,” Vanlaanen said. Koon added that he learns much more about a park on a First Day Hike than he would without a guided tour.
Participating in a First Day Hike usually comes with a free button. Vanlaanen displays her buttons on a jacket she wears hiking; it's a good way to spread the word about the program, she said.
As Junelle Lawry of Vancouver hiked down to the lake, she explained that she only recently developed an interest in hiking, but it was an intense one. Last year, ahead of a visit from an outdoorsy cousin who lives in New Hampshire, the Connecticut native began scouting trails that he might enjoy while he was in town.
That curiosity led her to take what's known as the 52 Hike Challenge last year. She ended up doing 64 hikes in 2016, all within about 150 miles of Vancouver. As she bought more hiking guides, the list of trails she wanted to explore only grew.
She's doing the same challenge this year. Battle Ground Lake was hike No. 1.
The cousin back in New Hampshire is a bit envious, Lawry said. “He can't quite do the year-round hiking we can do here.”
BERLIN, March 31 The European Union should consider filing a complaint at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) against the United States over planned duties on imports of steel plate from five EU member states, the German foreign minister said on Friday.
Sigmar Gabriel said the U.S. government seemed prepared to give U.S. firms "unfair competitive advantage" over European producers even though this violated international trade law.
"We Europeans cannot accept this. The EU must now examine whether it also files a complaint at the WTO. I strongly support this," Gabriel said.
The U.S. Department of Commerce made a final finding that seven foreign producers dumped certain carbon and alloy steel cut-to-length plate in the U.S. market, allowing it to impose duties ranging from 3.62 percent to 148 percent, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday.
In Germany, duties were set at 5.38 percent for AG der Dillinger Hüttenwerke, 22.90 percent for the Salzgitter group and 21.03 percent for all other exporters and producers. (Reporting by Michael Nienaber)
NEW YORK The U.S. Federal Reserve, which has amassed some $4.5 trillion in bonds since the recession, could begin trimming that portfolio after this year's raft of interest-rate hikes and will aim to keep cutting it for "a number of years," a Fed official said on Wednesday.
Some $2.5 trillion of that record total offsets excess reserves in the banking system.
However the U.S. central bank ultimately decides to shed the bonds, it will take place "in the background" yet still influence the pace with which the Fed continues to raise rates, said San Francisco Fed President John Williams. He added only that the portfolio will shrink to a level "significantly below" the current portion of excess reserves.

The Pittsburgh Steelers clinched the AFC North Sunday night with an exciting last-minute over the Baltimore Ravens. And better yet they did with without any serious injury issues. This team is already so banged up the last thing they needed was more guys getting hurt.
Tight end Vance McDonald was the only in-game injury of note. He had his best game of the season before leaving with a shoulder injury. This is unfortunate as he had finally returned from an ankle injury that cost him the last three games.
In terms of scares, the big injury that wasn't was when running back Le'Veon Bell took a hit on the knee and his knee appeared to be hyperextended. He went off the field briefly and it looked like it could have been bad. Luckily he returned to the game and played well.
With this week being Patriots week it is as much about the guys who were already hurt. Guys like linebacker Tyler Matakevich and cornerback Joe Haden should get a long look this week to see if they can return and help give the defense a shot in the arm.
The veteran spiker hopes to close her UAAP career by snapping the Tigresses' 4-year Final Four drought
MANILA, Philippines – After the Tigresses' impressive offseason stint at the 13th V-League Reinforced Conference, Pam Lastimosa now clings to hope of a more positive outcome for UST in the upcoming UAAP Season 79 Women's Volleyball.
The returning veteran, who was sidelined last season after suffering an ACL injury, made no concrete promise but assured the UST community that the team will put in the work to achieve the ultimate goal.
“Siguro we're more of a fighter [this season] and that we will really work hard to be on the Final Four, which is iyon ‘yung first goal namin since last year ‘di namin naabot yung goal namin,” Lastimosa told Rappler.
(We're more of a fighter [this season] and that we will really work hard to be on the Final Four, which is our first goal since last year we weren't able to achieve it.)
The Espana squad will fly off to Thailand this month for an intensive 9-day training camp, which will include a series of tune up games against Thai club teams. The comebacking captain wishes that the training abroad will do wonders for the Tigresses' chemistry before the tournament finally opens next month.
“Siguro sa Thailand, since maraming tune-up games, makakuha kami ng confidence and pag-gel sa team. We can also improve yung mga areas na medyo weak kami as a team.”
(Hopefully in Thailand, since there would be a lot of tune up games, we would gain confidence and gel as a team. We can also improve on our weak areas as a team.)
Season 79 will mark the spiker's comeback year in the UAAP, as Lastimosa is expected to lead a core lineup of Ria Meneses, Chloe Cortez, EJ Laure, and Cherry Rondina among others.
Aside from propeling UST back to the semis, the Cagayan de Oro native likewise hopes to leave a mark of her own as she gears up for her final year in the league.
“I would like to be remembered as a player who will not give up, and [who] will always be there for the team.” – Rappler.com
CAMDEN, Ark. – Family members say thousands of people watched as Keiana Herndon took her last breath.
Richard Herndon says his 25-year-old daughter was live streaming to Facebook from a friend's home in Arkansas on Wednesday.
According to KARK, the video began with Keiana singing and putting her two youngest children in the spotlight.
A few minutes later, she fell and the phone dropped out of her hand.
Keiana's uncle, Jeffrey Herndon, watched the video after her death.
“It was really hard,” he told KARK.
He says he could hear Keiana struggle to breathe and her son screaming in the background.
A friend showed up at the home nearly 30 minutes after she collapsed.
“It's amazing for someone to sit there and see somebody or hear them take their last breath and nobody did anything,” Richard Herndon said. “So, I want to take my hat off to everybody that actually did something.”
Family members say she recently learned an issue with her thyroid could be life-threatening, but the medical examiner will determine her exact cause of death.
Unless you believe in Santa Claus, the chances of Senate Republicans unveiling anything desirable, or even new, in the realm of American health care and insurance legislation are nil.
Sorry, Virginia, there is no better plan than Obamacare, and as most Americans will tell you, it stinks.
Despite that, Republicans have dangerously forgotten or refuse to admit that the Affordable Care Act was created because the system before it stunk even worse. Before 2008, when the ACA was created, America suffered from a quagmire of state and federal laws created to benefit hospitals, insurance companies, doctors and drug manufacturers. The ACA created a new quagmire of laws that tried to benefit patients, but to appease important campaign contributors from both sides of the aisle, Obamacare accommodated hospitals, insurance companies, doctors and drug manufacturers.
A marginal system was made worse by Republicans, who were determined to see it fail. They have either refused to fix obvious problems or actively worked to make it fail.
The reboot of Trumpcare, about to be released from a secret Senate cabal culturing this newest strain of health care, won't be any better than Obamacare because it can't. It is, however, likely going to be far worse, based on what the House tried to do.
It can't be an improvement because, like all these plans, it doesn't address the problem. Like Obamacare, Trumpcare 2.0 will be a shell game, shifting costs from one unlucky American to another, with everybody paying more for less every single year, and middle-income and older Americans taking the biggest hit.
Obamcare poured more money into the health care system to allow more people to see doctors and treat illnesses. That created a surge in the market, driving up prices with increased demand. Clearly, the only way to reduce the overall cost of healthcare is to take those people out of the market, creating competition for fewer patients, and driving down costs. In reality, prices won't go down, they'll just stop mushrooming.
The lucky fewer who can afford health insurance will see some immediate benefit, but unless we're willing to let people die in hospital parking lots because they're refused treatment for not being able to pay, that's not going to happen either. Instead, those thrown off of insurance will get health care for free, and those now larger costs will be passed onto paying customers, just like before.
There are no good answers, but there are cruel and stupid ones, and this one even President Donald Trump has branded as “mean.”
The least-worst thing Congress could do is fix Obamacare, creating a public option for those who don't have health insurance plans available or who just want government insurance, reducing the Medicaid load and using that money to create this Medicare Part All. Republicans and Democrats both must work to improve the system to keep it working as long as it takes to face reality: none of these systems is sustainable.
This untenable, critical problem will only get worse. We already spend more than $10,000 per American on health care, a whopping $3.5 trillion each year. Increasingly older, sicker Americans and increasingly expensive ways to keep them alive longer are a looming disaster in the making.
The best answer is to prop up Obamacare and simultaneously look at some type of universal care, and there are many options. Whether you like or dislike the notion of a system like that in Canada, Germany, Australia or Norway doesn't matter. It's the only sustainable system unless we agree we will no longer provide health care to those who cannot pay for it.
So America can either get real, and move toward a universal care system, or we can all get deathly sick, whether we're in the system or outside of it.

WCC adds career coach program
By Phyllis Moore
Published in News on February 15, 2017 9:55 AM
Full Size News-Argus/PHYLLIS MOORE Elvira Johnson, right, career counselor at Wayne Community College, talks with Johanna Torres, a senior at Smithfield-Selma High School, about the college's dental program. WCC recently introduced an online program, Career Coach, that includes an assessment test, resume builder and other tools for students and job-seekers to access information about potential careers that line up with their aptitudes and interests.
Elvira Johnson, career counselor at Wayne Community College, knows what she's talking about -- after all, she's had three diverse careers herself.
She has worked in engineering, culinary arts and since receiving her master's degree in education, advises job seekers.
"My motto is life is too short to work at a job that you don't absolutely love," she said.
The college recently added a new online tool to help students and the public find their best job match, an information resource called Career Coach.
"There are so many facets to career planning that you need something to bring it all together," she said. "And it's got something for everyone -- for people who don't even know what they want to do, people who know what they want to do but they don't know how to do it, people who are in their field or in school but now they're going to have to get a job, and then other people who are in a job and they're like, 'This is not it' or 'I'm ready to move on to something else.'"
Career Coach is for potential students, current students or non-students, she says. It is even a viable resource for earlier career exploration.
"The people that use Career Coach more than the college are middle school and high school parents and counselors because students start thinking about what they want to do," Ms. Johnson said.
Sometimes the tool can provide a "reality check" before they hit a brick wall, before they invest unnecessary time going in the wrong direction, she said.
The software program provides a lot of useful data -- including wages, job postings and associated education and training.
"The best thing about it, it gives local and regional data. We just expanded to a 100-mile radius because we have so many students who don't mind going to work in Johnston County or in Raleigh," she said, pointing out that the information is accurate since it's provided by actual employers.
"It tells the number working in that field in the area, a description of what they're doing, the hourly wage."
From the typical starting pay to the future demand -- including the number of retirees anticipated in the next 10 years, leaving vacancies for potential hires -- it even scales down to current job postings.
Career Coach is also used by Wayne Community College in determining programs and courses to prepare students for the job market.
"It's a planning tool for division directors and academic vice presidents because if we're thinking, should we expand this program? Should we start a program? Should we do away with a program that we have? We can look and see whether or not this field is increasing or decreasing," she said. "It's a holistic tool, something that students could use, that faculty and staff and administrators could use, something that employers could use and something that reaches out into the community as well."
To get started, there is a simple career assessment which helps determine a good career path based a lot on personality.
"This is a short six-question assessment that you can take and it asks you about things that you like to do or don't like to do," Ms. Johnson said. "It takes less than a minute. Based on what level of education that you plan to do, then it will give you a match for your personality and then a field of interest."
Even those ensconced in a career may benefit from the assessment, she said.
"I'm encouraging all of our top administrators to take this assessment to see if they're in the right place," she said with a laugh.
Those with a military background can also translate their skills, simply by putting in the military occupation code to discover similar civilian jobs, she said.
The service costs nothing except time, she said.
But what it provides -- clarification of the best job match -- is priceless.
"When someone comes in here and says, 'I don't know what I want to do,' they know what they want to do," Ms. Johnson said. "They just don't see how it's possible, they don't know how long it's going to take and they don't know what the outcome is going to be, whether they can get a job and there will be a living wage and they don't know where to get started.
"This program gives you all that, answers all those questions."

BEIJING A Chinese court on Thursday jailed a former deputy head of the country's Taiwan Affairs Office for 15 years, for taking bribes and abusing his position, the state broadcaster said.
Gong Qinggai used his position to amass 5.3 million yuan ($770,000) in illegal assets during the nine years to 2015, the court in the central province of Henan said, according to a brief post on China Central Television's social media account.
Chinese President Xi Jinping launched a war on graft shortly after coming to power in 2013, vowing to eliminate deep-rooted corruption in the ruling Communist Party by going after powerful "tigers" as well as lowly "flies".
Gong, initially accused of the crimes by the state prosecutor in December 2016, could not be reached for comment.
An investigation found Gong dishonestly reported stock and real estate assets, spent public money and took gifts, China's top anti-graft watchdog said in April 2016.
He also played golf, a game the party frowns upon as being associated with the striking of shady deals, and engaged in "superstitious activities", a charge often levied at fallen officials, the watchdog said at the time.
Gong joined the Taiwan Affairs Office, which is in charge of China's policy on the self-ruled island, in 2013, having spent his prior career with the government of the southeastern province of Fujian, his official biography says.
China considers democratic Taiwan a wayward province to be brought under Beijing's control by force, if necessary. Taiwan, to which defeated Nationalist forces fled at the end of a civil war in 1949, has shown no interest in being ruled by China.

An advocacy group wants a state court to order prison officials to reveal the drug regimen and plans for the scheduled lethal injection next week of the first inmate to be executed in Nevada since 2006. A prisons official responded Tuesday, July 3, 2018, that an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit will be moot, because the execution protocol is due to be made public by the end of the day. less FILE - In this Aug. 17, 2017 file photo, Nevada death row inmate Scott Raymond Dozier confers with Lori Teicher, a federal public defender involved in his case, during an appearance in Clark County District ... more Photo: Ken Ritter, AP Nevada switches drug to be used in 1st execution since 2006 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
LAS VEGAS (AP) — One sedative will be substituted for another, and prison officials said Tuesday they plan to use two other drugs never before used in executions in any state for Nevada's first lethal injection in 12 years. The drugs include a powerful synthetic opioid that has been blamed for overdoses nationwide.
A revised and redacted death penalty protocol for the scheduled July 11 execution of Scott Raymond Dozier calls for injecting midazolam to sedate him, then the opioid fentanyl to slow and perhaps stop his breathing followed by a muscle paralyzing drug called cisatracurium.
Dozier, 47, is a twice-convicted murderer who has been on death row since 2007.
The third drug became the focus of a court challenge that postponed Dozier's execution last November, after a state court judge in Las Vegas told prison officials that they could not use it.
Clark County District Judge Jennifer Togliatti ruled after federal public defenders challenging the constitutionality of the execution protocol enlisted a medical expert witness who said the drug could render a person immobile while suffocating, and "mask" signs of struggle or pain.
The state Supreme Court rejected Togliatti's ruling in May on procedural grounds. However, justices did not rule on the constitutionality of a lethal injection method that critics characterize as experimental and risky.
Seizures are a possibility at high doses of fentanyl, said Dr. Jonathan Groner, a Columbus, Ohio, surgeon and lethal injection expert who said the combination of drugs could produce unexpected results.
"In anesthesia, more is not always better," Groner told The Associated Press. "Side effects can happen. Extreme doses may cause seizure or other problems. But if a person has enough paralyzing agent in their system, you won't be able to tell if they're suffering."
The American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada filed a protest in state court in Carson City on Tuesday, complaining that the protocol hadn't been made public sooner and that there isn't more time to review the safety and legality of the execution plan. The organization earlier characterized the plan as less humane than the process used to put down a pet.
The court filing did not seek to delay the execution, but ACLU lawyer Amy Rose said the public deserves to know how the state plans to kill a death row inmate.
The new execution protocol appears to be an updated version of a procedural plan submitted to Togliatti last September.
The new one, dated June 11, blacks out some details, including times that family members, witnesses and media may arrive at Ely State Prison, 250 miles (402 kilometers) north of Las Vegas.
It substitutes midazolam for expired prison stocks of diazepam, a sedative commonly known as Valium. The plan doubles the number of possible injections of the sedative from four for diazepam to 10 for midazolam.
The scheduled doses and delivery of fentanyl and cisatracurium were not changed.
Attorneys for the state and the former chief state medical officer who helped draw up the protocol last year said the paralytic is to ensure that Dozier's breathing muscles stop.
Dozier has repeatedly said he wants to die and he doesn't really care if he suffers.
He suspended an appeal of his conviction and death sentence, but officials said he could change his mind up to the last minute, or even after the injections start.
Dozier's defense attorney, Thomas Ericsson, said he knows of no such desire on his client's part. But the lawyer said he would file a request to stay the execution if Dozier asks for it.
That possibility prompted Togliatti to hold a telephonic meeting with attorneys for all sides last Thursday, Ericsson said.
The judge is the only official who could stop the execution.
The last execution in Nevada was in 2006, when Daryl Linnie Mack volunteered for lethal injection for his conviction in a 1988 rape and murder in Reno.

NEW YORK The dollar fell broadly on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump said the dollar was "getting too strong" and that he would prefer that the Federal Reserve keep interest rates low.
Trump also said, during an interview with the Wall Street Journal, that his administration would not label China a currency manipulator, reversing a campaign trail pledge to do so. He also left open the possibility of renominating Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen when her term expires next year.
The dollar index .DXY, which tracks the U.S. currency against six major rivals, fell to its lowest since March 30 after the news.
"The market had a big reaction, but I think it was an overreaction," said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. "He may just be hedging his bets by making sure that the American public realizes he's not backing down on trade."
Lien also said she expected Trump's comments could weigh on the dollar in the long term. It has fallen every day this week as worries over geopolitical tensions have prompted investors into safe havens like the yen, U.S. Treasuries and gold.
"The dollar's already under pressure, so I think any excuse for further pressure is likely to bring the greenback even lower," Lien said.
The dollar fell by more than 1 percent against the yen on Tuesday, its biggest one-day fall in three months against the Japanese currency. The greenback fell below 110 yen for the first time since mid-November JPY=. On Wednesday, it furthered those losses and was last down 0.5 percent at 109.1 yen, its lowest since Nov. 17.
Against the traditionally safe-haven Swiss franc, the dollar dropped CHF= to 1.0024 franc, its lowest in a week.
The euro EUR= rose 0.6 percent against the dollar to a 6-day high of $1.0671.
The dollar also sank against the offshore Chinese yuan CNH= after Trump's comments. The typically little-moved Chinese currency fell 0.15 percent to a five-day low of 6.8847.

Serena Williams is ringing in the new year quite literally: By flashing the engagement ring given to her over the holidays by Alexis Ohanian. The tennis superstar and Reddit cofounder surprised many by announcing their engagement right before the New Year after keeping their relationship under the radar for months – and doubled the surprise by making it official via a poem and cartoon on the site.
Williams' poem documented a carriage ride, a Roman holiday and an on-one-knee proposal, and was unexpectedly public for a couple who has reportedly been dating since 2015 but only hinted at their relationship via a silly Instagram around Halloween. But she had to know that it would be hard to keep things under wraps once she was seen with that giant ring on her left hand – as she was for the first time this weekend in New Zealand.
RELATED PHOTOS: The most jaw-dropping star engagement rings!
The star, her new fiancé and her sister Venus touched down in Auckland ahead of the WTA's ASB Classic tennis tournament this week. And though she'll be down to business soon enough, the star was all smiles in her cutoffs, long coat and solitaire sparkler flashing from her left hand.

WASHINGTON - The chief executive director of The Humane Society of the United States resigned following sexual harassment allegations.
The New York Times reports that Wayne Pacelle resigned Friday after donors and employees of the animal protection group began calling for him to step down over the allegations.
In an email to staff, Pacelle said that because “our mission depends on unity,” he was stepping aside to allow a search for a successor to begin “and to put aside any distractions, in the best interests of all parties.”
In a news release announcing the resignation, Rick Bernthal, Chairman of the Board of The Humane Society, said the last few days have been hard for the group's family of staff and supporters.
Kitty Block has been named acting president and CEO for The Humane Society.

AMESBURY, England (AP) — British police declared a "major incident" Wednesday after two people were left in critical condition from exposure to an unknown substance a few miles from where a former Russian spy and his daughter were poisoned with a nerve agent.
The Wiltshire Police force said a man and a woman in their 40s were hospitalized after being found unconscious at a residential building in Amesbury, eight miles (13 kilometers) from Salisbury, where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were poisoned on March 4.
Police cordoned off the building and other places the two people visited before falling ill, but health officials said there was not believed to be a wider risk to the public.
The man and woman were hospitalized Saturday at Salisbury District Hospital, where Sergei and Yulia Skripal spent weeks in critical condition after being poisoned in March.
Police said they initially believed the latest victims might have taken a contaminated batch of heroin or crack cocaine.
"However, further testing is now ongoing to establish the substance which led to these patients becoming ill and we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances surrounding this incident," police said. "At this stage, it is not yet clear if a crime has been committed."
A major incident is a designation allowing British authorities to mobilize more than one emergency agency.
Residents in the area, a quiet neighborhood of newly built houses and apartments, said they had received little information from authorities.
"Amesbury's a lovely place — it's very quiet, uneventful," said Rosemary Northing, who lives a couple of hundred yards (meters) away from the cordoned-off building. "So for this to happen, and the media response and the uncertainty, it's unsettling."
Neighbors said police cars and fire engines descended on the home late Saturday. Student Chloe Edwards said she saw people in "green suits" — like those worn by forensics officers — and her family was told to stay in their home for several hours.
"We wanted to know what happened and with the Russian attack happening not long ago, and we just assumed the worst," said Edwards.
Britain accuses Russia of poisoning the Skripals with a nerve agent known as Novichok, a group of chemical weapons developed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Moscow denies the allegation. The poisoning sparked a Cold War-style diplomatic crisis between Russia and the West, including the expulsion of hundreds of diplomats from both sides.
Counter-terrorism teams from London's Metropolitan Police were called in to help local forces in Wiltshire at the time of the Skripal poisoning. On Wednesday, however, Scotland Yard referred media calls to Wiltshire police.
The statement from Wiltshire Police came only a month after police from 40 departments in England and Wales returned home after months of working on the Skripals' poisoning. Wiltshire Police spent about 7.5 million pounds ($10 million) dealing with the aftermath of the Skripals' poisoning and believe that his front door was contaminated with the nerve agent.
Sergei Skripal, 66, is a former Russian intelligence officer who was convicted of spying for Britain before coming to the U.K. as part of a 2010 prisoner swap. He had been living quietly in Salisbury, a cathedral city 90 miles (145 kilometers) southwest of London, when he was struck down along with his 33-year-old daughter Yulia.
After being found unconscious in the street, the two spent weeks in critical condition at the hospital. Doctors who treated them say they have made a remarkable recovery but they still don't know what the Skirpals' long-term prognosis is.
The Skripals have been taken to an undisclosed location for their protection.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California lawmakers on Tuesday revived a long-stalled proposal to set a goal of generating 100 percent of the state's energy from carbon-free sources.
With other controversial and high-stakes energy legislation also moving forward, California lawmakers face an array of decisions with vast implications for the Western energy grid, the future of renewable power and consumers' electric bills.
A state legislative committee sent the 100 percent clean energy bill to the full Assembly, setting up a vote later this year.
The bill's revival is a tentative victory for its author, Democratic Sen. Kevin de Leon, who is waging an uphill battle to unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein in the November election.
De Leon fought aggressively to push the bill forward in the final days of last year's legislative session but was unsuccessful.
The bill would bump up California's energy mandate, known as the renewable portfolio standard, from 50 percent to 60 percent by 2030. That energy would have to come from specific renewable resources including wind, solar, geothermal and small dams.
It would then set a goal of getting all remaining energy from resources that don't produce climate changing gases by 2045, leaving details of the plan to be hashed out later.
"This will put us on the pathway to clean renewable energy and economic growth for the future of California," de Leon said.
Critics include business interests and utilities, which warn that industrial power users, like factories and food processors, and consumers will be left paying higher prices. They worry that the bill would prematurely make fossil fuel plants obsolete, rendering them stranded assets that don't generate revenue but still must be paid off by ratepayers.
"Not now," said Assemblyman Jim Patterson, a Republican from Fresno. "This is a leap of faith and a gamble."
The action came as the Senate also considers legislation to turn California's energy grid manager, the Independent System Operator, into a regional entity open to utilities across the West, and as Gov. Jerry Brown and legislative leaders consider making it easier for utilities to reduce liability for wildfire damage. The issues could get linked in negotiations.
Soccer-De Biasi quits as Albania coach, says his cycle over
TIRANA, June 14 Albania coach Gianni De Biasi resigned on Wednesday after six years in charge during which he led them to Euro 2016, their first and only appearance at a major tournament.
The following is an excerpt from the foreword of the new book No Go Zones: How Sharia Law is Coming to a Neighborhood Near You, written by Breitbart London Editor-in-Chief Raheem Kassam. The book is released today and available now on Amazon.com (and Kindle), Books-a-Million, Barnes & Noble, iTunes, and Audible.
FOREWORD by Nigel Farage MEP:
advertisement
When Raheem told me he was writing this book on No Go Zones in the Western world, my first reaction was “Thank goodness someone is doing this job.”
My second thought was, “I hope he's careful.” The reason for my first response is probably self-explanatory. This is an issue that is so contentious mainly because no one has yet documented these areas as comprehensively as Raheem does in this book.
It's a topic that is marred by half-truths, full denials, slips of tongues, and an attempt to reject the notion of such areas in such a brazen and unfounded manner that much of the establishment media that spends its time in denial can truly wear the title “Fake News” proudly.
Now, I'm pleased to say, they have a very good starting point by which to judge the merits of the debates on integration, assimilation, and the scale and speed of migration into the West.
My second thought on the book was multifaceted.
Firstly, people who speak out against radical Islam, highlighting issues such as Sharia law, terrorism, and indeed things that shouldn't be contentious like integration are often targeted, abused, endure massive attempts at being discredited, or even find themselves on the receiving end of threats or violence.
As a personal friend, I am sincerely concerned that such brave truth-telling on the subject might find Raheem on the receiving end of some of this.
But as a professional colleague, I was also concerned at the scale of the task. How can you, I wondered, summarize so much, over so many decades, in so many places around the Western world in just one book?
I'm delighted to say after having read this book that Raheem has done an excellent job in balancing hard data and statistics, and using multiple areas from around Europe and the United States in his attempt to fairly portray the issues facing majority Muslim areas in the West.
And it's not just that, either.
From Molenbeek to Malmö, from Brooklyn to Hamtramck, each of these areas has its own, unique characteristics. Its own players. Its own resistance movements. The personal stories and interviews contained in this book shine a much-needed light on how actors, from residents to local officials, politicians, and pressure groups, all play into the massive discord taking place in areas across Europe and America.
Truly, the final product is one that bears reading, citing, and even corroborating by other journalists, who I implore to follow Raheem's lead in getting to the bottom of these issues.
Of course, with any book of this length, there is so much more to tell, and I hope Raheem can follow up with more information, more trips, more investigation, and more documentation of what is going on in our towns and cities.
I also want to take the opportunity to commend his fair mindedness on this issue. Raheem has been careful not to portray—as someone more alarmist might—these communities as marauding, out of control groups intent on the decline of the West.
In a lot of instances in fact, the people who find themselves ghettoized and demonized from all sides are victims themselves of their community leaders and actors who want to drive a wedge between migrant communities and native populations. The work concerning poverty and socioeconomic factors is pivotal. The work on Deobandism and the Tablighi Jamaat movement is seminal. And the work contained in this book on the aggravating factors—usually the establishment, the political Left—is a warning sign to America to stand up and assert its identity, enforce its laws, and demand integration before it is too late for many places in the United States.
There will of course be plenty of critics of this book. They'll ask questions like, “If these places are really ‘No Go', how come you were able to go there?”
The answer should of course be obvious if you read the text. Raheem timed his visits carefully, didn't seek to antagonize locals with video cameras, and in some cases—already reported by news organizations across the board—managed to luckily avoid mass incidents of violence and rioting by a matter of hours.
In short: it was due to the studiousness of his approach that he managed to fairly document his experiences and put together a piece of work that will stand the test of time both academically and from a philosophical perspective.
It should be required reading for conservatives, Republicans, liberals, teachers, students, reporters, editors, and activists alike. And I'm delighted he has managed to resist tabloid-style presentation, and painstakingly sought out reliable sources, high-level interviews, and even hard-to-come-by data on topics like crime, imprisonment, and more.
If you do one thing after picking up this book, I recommend this: buy it for, or recommend it to, someone else too, and do your part to help settle the debate we shouldn't even be having— whether or not these areas exist.
Only by leaping this hurdle can we get onto the real debate: what should we do about it, now that it is on our shores?
Buy your copy of No Go Zones now.

CARACAS Venezuela's murder rate rose to an average 60 per day last year, up from about 45 per day in 2015, the attorney general's office said on Friday, as a deep economic and political crisis exacerbated violence in the country.
Official data put the murder rate at 70.1 per 100,000 inhabitants last year, one of the highest in the world and up from 58 in 2015.
Violent crime is one of the most pervasive anxieties for Venezuelans, especially in poor slums dominated by gangs and rife with guns.
Numerous state security plans and disarmament drives in recent years have failed to curb violence given easy access to weapons, police participation in crime, and high levels of impunity in the nation of 30 million people.
A brutal economic recession that has millions skipping meals has pushed more Venezuelans towards crime, according to officials, rights groups and neighbourhood organizations.

Ladner believes warning residents about the jury scam will prevent many from falling victim. (Photo source: WLOX)
The Harrison County Circuit Court warns residents about a potential jury scam after several residents say they've already been targeted.
Harrison County Circuit Clerk Connie Ladner says the court received numerous phone calls from people who received an email telling them that they missed jury duty and will be receiving a follow-up phone call.
Ladner says in the email the recipient is instructed to click on a link; however, the link doesn't take the person anywhere. The county circuit clerk says 1 or 2 people have received calls but did not follow through.
There was no contact information reported within the emails.
The Harrison County Circuit Court advises anyone who receives an email that he or she has missed jury duty and will receive a follow-up call not to follow through with the scam.
Ladner says, “If someone has jury duty, then that person will receive a jury card in the mail.”
Ladner believes warning residents about the jury scam will prevent many from falling victim.
“It seems to have just started; so, we have limited information. And maybe by getting the message out early, it will prevent someone from losing any money as has happened with previous jury scams,” said Ladner.

Mali succeeded in restoring interim authorities to its northern cities of Timbuktu and Menaka on Thursday, ending a standoff with armed Tuareg factions that had prevented the transfer of power.
The return of state authority to the north is meant to fill a power vacuum that has turned northern Mali into a launch pad for jihadi attacks across a vast region on the Sahara Desert.
Most government posts have been unfilled since ethnic Tuareg separatists and desert jihadists took over northern Mali in 2012, before French forces intervened to push them back. A peace deal signed in 2015 was meant to enable authorities to return.
Pro and anti-government Tuareg-dominated factions had finally agreed in February on how this would happen, after months of arguments over how the authorities should be constituted.
They returned to Gao and Kidal two weeks later, but some armed groups prevented them from setting up in Timbuktu and Menaka at the beginning of March.
State TV announced on a news bulletin that the impasse was over. A spokesman for the anti-government Tuaregs, Iyad Ag Mohamed, confirmed by telephone that the authorities had been allowed in.
"Everyone feels that a big step has been made and thinks that peace will now come," Timbuktu resident Moulaye Haidara told Reuters by telephone.
Despite such encouraging moves towards peace, Mali mains plagued by banditry and deadly Islamist attacks.

Not all students are relaxing on their summer break. Some are working on an oven that could help fight world hunger.
Scroll for more content...
"We call it a hybrid-barrel-panel design because it's a cylinder but it also incorporates the panels to get the sun to go into the middle," said Metro Nashville high school student, Catherine Wright.
Wright is part of a program called "School For Science and Math at Vanderbilt" or SSMV.
Students spend one day a week, for all four years, learning about science and math.
"So we're all in high school. But on that one day a week we come and do a lot of interdisciplinary science. Our group was tasked with building this solar oven," she said.
Lesa Brown is one of their instructors.
"It's bigger than I thought it would be," Brown said. "I'm not sure we envisioned it will be taller than us when we finished it."
The project has real-world applications, like helping a school in Kenya that operates with with little to no electricity.
The students will continue to test the prototype. If the oven preforms well, the students say they will ship it overseas.
The Biloxi Shuckers had lost six of their last seven games before facing home standing Chattanooga in game one of a five-game road series. Starting pitcher Aaron Wilkerson gave up four hits with five strikeouts in five innings to post the win in a rain-shortened game that was called after 5 1/2 innings. Shuckers catcher Jacob Nottingham helped Wilkerson by throwing out two base runners trying to steal second base.
Mauricio Dubon provided the big stick for the Shuckers. He belted a three-run double in the top of the fourth inning off Lookouts starter Kohl Stewart. Dubon added another RBI with a single in the sixth and Javier Betancourt also singled home a run in the sixth against Chattanooga reliever Randy Rosario.
Nick Ramirez was ready to relieve starting pitcher Wilkerson, but the umpiring crew had the stadium crew pull out the tarp and later called the game.
Lookouts starting pitcher Kohl Stewart lost for the third time this season. In 2013 Stewart turned down a scholarship offer to play football (quarterback) and baseball at Texas A&M. He couldn't turn down a lucrative offer to sign with the Minnesota Twins. The fourth overall player selected in the 2013 Major League Baseball Draft out of St. Pius X High School in Houston, Texas signed a $4.6 million dollar contract.
The Shuckers and Lookouts meet in game two 6:15 p.m. Tuesday.

A briefing note from August shows Hajdu had already directed the department to come up with the new employer declaration to ensure funding went to groups with "mandates that are consistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and court decisions." Hajdu needed to approve the final wording before the fall, the note said.
Her department crafted several pages of legal advice, all of it blocked from release on the grounds of solicitor-client privilege.
The Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada, meanwhile, was getting only radio silence from Hajdu's office.
"We didn't know what was really going on," said Joyce Arthur, the coalition's executive director.
"Then, in December, they suddenly announced this attestation requirement. At the time we didn't really know why they chose that solution, but we thought, 'Whatever works'."
The new requirements appeared to come out of nowhere, said one government official, who described initial political trepidation about the eligibility rules.
Faith-based groups howled in protest, saying they violated religious and free-speech rights. Hajdu and Liberal MPs defended the wording of the declaration.
One Toronto-area Liberal MP wrote to a complainant, saying that while individuals could disagree with the declaration, "freedom of religion is an individual right and is not something which can be superimposed on an organization."
Religious leaders who met with Hajdu in late March left with the impression there might be some movement on the wording, but a government official said Hajdu only agreed to a review and gave no hint that the language dealing specifically with reproductive rights would be removed.
Hajdu said Thursday she is looking to clarify language in the application form and guide that clears up concerns from groups and lets the government meet its policy objectives.
In the meantime, Arthur's organization plans to pore over the full list of this year's employers to see if any of the hundreds of groups in their database have been approved for funding.
Hajdu also said the department is working with employers who are concerned that increases in provincial minimum wages in provinces like Ontario may force them to cut back on hours offered to summer students.

A Russian warplane was shot down Saturday in Syria, according to Russian state-run news agencies.
The Russian Ministry of Defense confirmed one of its Su-25 warplanes was downed in Idlib province in northwest Syria, state media outlet RIA Novosti reported.
Militants shot down the plane in an area controlled by al-Nusra Front fighters, according to the RIA Novosti report. Russia and Turkey, which is responsible for a de-escalation zone in Idlib, were taking measures to return the pilot's body, the defense ministry said.
The ministry said more than 30 militants in the area were killed in a retaliatory strike, according to RIA Novosti, citing “radio intercepts.”
The defense ministry said the pilot was able to eject from the aircraft before it crashed, according to state-run news agency TASS, but died while fighting al-Nusra fighters.
TASS reported that “according to preliminary information, the plane was shot down from a portable anti-aircraft missile system.”
But a witness who spoke to CNN via Skype on condition of anonymity said the jet was shot down by Free Syrian Army fighters with a group called Jaish al-Naser as two jets were “striking the village of Massaran on the southern side of Saraqib.”
The witness said that a pilot parachuted. A Free Syrian Army fighter in the area told the source that the pilot “engaged with FSA fighters with a pistol but they killed him eventually.”
The source left the area after the second jet fired more missiles.
Other witnesses said the pilot was taken from the crash site, according to Rami Abdel Rahman, director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group. It was unclear whether the pilot was alive or dead, he said
The Idlib Media Center, an anti-government activist group, posted images that purportedly show the plane's wreckage.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime recently resumed airstrikes on rebel-held areas such as Idlib province, prompting tens of thousands of civilians to flee their homes, according to UN officials.
Idlib has long been the region where civilians and fighters have gone as they fled rebel-friendly areas under siege by the Syrian regime.
With the help of Russian forces, the Syrian government has managed to take back much of the country held by rebels. The regime has launched an offensive to retake Idlib, the only province that has come under full rebel control in the nearly 7-year-old conflict.
PARIS | Woody Allen's French film distributor has defended the American director against sexual abuse claims, saying he has been unfairly caught up in the fallout surrounding the #MeToo movement.
Writing in the French weekly Le Point, Mars Films head Stephane Celerier dismissed the furor over renewed allegations by Allen's adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, that Allen molested her in an attic in 1992 when she was 7. Celerier describes the accusation as a family drama caught in the crosshairs of the #MeToo movement amid fallout from the allegations of rape and sexual harassment against Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein.
It is “shameless opportunism,” Celerier said of the fresh attacks against the director in the media that he said “taint the dignity of real victims.”

Celerier's company is behind the distribution of Allen's latest movie “Wonder Wheel,” starring Kate Winslet and Justin Timberlake, which opened in French cinemas this week to lukewarm ticket sales.
His defense of Allen is the latest chapter in an emerging narrative in France, particularly in its film industry, that the Hollywood anti-abuse campaign has gone too far.
Farrow in January gave her first on-camera interview to “CBS This Morning” about her longstanding abuse allegations against the 82-year-old filmmaker. Allen has long denied the allegations and was investigated but not charged.
Since the Weinstein allegations, France — the country synonymous with love — has been stumbling as it addresses the issue of sexual harassment and violence against women.
Last month, French actress Catherine Deneuve set the feminist world ablaze by co-signing a letter accusing the post-Weinstein groundswell of allegations of being puritanical.
In November, France's famed film institute La Cinematheque Francaise went ahead with a retrospective of works by director Roman Polanski despite opposition by feminist groups. The institute said its role was not to moralize. The Polish-born director in the 1970s pleaded guilty to having sex in the U.S. with a 13-year-old girl whom he plied with champagne and Quaaludes.
Polanski, who lives in France, and Allen continue to be highly revered by the French public. Polanski was honored last year as president of the Cesar awards, France's answer to the Oscars.

With no end to the heatwave in sight, we're all starting to get a bit crabby and secretly praying for a bit of rain to cool us down. From cold showers to sleeping with nothing but a top sheet to hide our modesty we're all pretty fed up at this stage.
However bad bed time is, it's nothing compared to the commute to work. Public transport during a heatwave is just a few degrees away from the fiery pits of Mount Doom. A giant sauna on wheels if you will. Any gust of wind is a welcome relief and if anyone dares close a window, silent judgement and outrage ensues.
Enter these two passengers on a bus in Russia. For 4 whole minutes they engaged in a tug of war with the window without saying a single word to each other. At one point, the man in favour of an open window even tries to block his opponent by leaving his hand in the way of the closing window, with little to no effect.
The video stops while their still fighting their battle, so we don't know how it ended. For all we know they're still at it!

ATHENS May 2 Greece has agreed to sell coal-fired plants and coal mines equal to about 40 percent of its dominant power utility Public Power Corp's coal-fired capacity, to help open up its electricity market, the energy ministry said on Tuesday.
The agreement is part of a reform deal Greece and its foreign creditors reached early on Tuesday, paving the way for the conclusion of a drawn-out reform review and the disbursement of further rescue funds under the country's third international bailout.
Under the rescue deal signed up in 2015, the third since 2010, Greece has agreed to cut the dominance of its state-owned Public Power Corp in the retail market to below 50 percent by 2019 from about 90 percent now.
Last year Greece launched power sales to smaller power producers to help cut Public Power Corp's share. But the lenders questioned the effectiveness of the measure and also wanted Athens to sell coal-fired plants after a European court ruled last year that Public Power Corp had abused its dominant position in the country's coal market.
Greece will hold a market test to sound out investors interested in buying coal-fired plants and mines owned by Public Power by November, aiming to wrap up the sale by June 2018, the ministry said in a statement.
Athens also agreed to sell a larger quantity of power capacity from December until 2019 but once the sale of the utility's plants is concluded the quantity will be reduced, the ministry added.
PPC, which is 51 percent-owned by the state and also earmarked for a partial sale, has been hurt by overdue bills which have reached 2.2 billion euros since the debt crisis broke out in 2010.
The company, a former power monopoly, has tried to recoup payments with phased repayment schemes, which has helped provisions for overdue debt decline, still the burden of unpaid bills had squeezed its cash reserves.
As prior action for the conclusion of the bailout review, Greece has promised its creditors to swiftly propose a plan to deal with the issue, the ministry said.
The lenders and Greece also agreed that Athens will relaunch the sale of a 66 percent stake in its natural gas grid operator DESFA and conclude it by the end of the year.
A 400 million euro deals to sell a 66 percent stake to Azerbaijan's SOCAR collapsed in November after Athens passed legislation raising DESFA's gas tariffs by a lower amount than SOCAR had expected and SOCAR asked for a lower price.
The potential buyer should be a European operator to safeguard energy supply security both for Greece and the European Union, the ministry added.
Privatisations have been a key plank of Greece's international bailouts but have reaped poor revenues so far due to political resistance and bureaucracy. (Reporting by Angeliki Koutantou, editing by Jeremy Gaunt and David Evans)
OTTAWA — The federal privacy watchdog says he's concerned about the possibility that the personal information of Facebook users was harvested for political purposes.
Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien says his office will contact Facebook to find out whether the personal information of Canadians was affected by a major data leak involving the global social media platform.
A Canadian data expert named Christopher Wylie has exposed the breach in media interviews, saying he helped found a data analytics company that helped the Trump campaign capitalize politically on private Facebook information.
In a statement today, Therrien says his office has also offered to assist an investigation into the matter already launched by the U.K. information commissioner's office.
A 10-year-old boy was found dead in a public swimming pool in south suburban Park Forest early Tuesday.
Scroll for more content...
Park Forest police said officers responded to a report of a missing child shortly before 4 a.m. Tuesday. The family told police the 10-year-old boy had been playing near Central Park, and as officers were searching the park, relatives told officers they spotted the boy in a pool at the nearby Park Forest Aqua Center.
A police officer climbed the fence, dove into the pool, pulled the boy out, and began performing CPR. Paramedics rushed the boy to Franciscan Health Olympia Fields, where he was pronounced dead, according to police.
"While any death is reason to grieve, the death of a child is particularly troubling, and the Park Forest Police Department offers its sincerest condolences to the loved ones and friends of the juvenile," Park Forest Police stated in a Facebook post.
It was not immediately clear how the boy got into the swimming pool while the facility was closed.
The Aqua Center has at least four pools, and is closed between 7 p.m. and noon.
Police said the Aqua Center, which is owned by the village, would be closed for the day on Tuesday.
The Illinois State Police Crime Scene Investigation Unit was helping process the scene.

Optimist club refurbishes used and donated computers for kids
By Staff Reports
Published in News on February 15, 2017 9:55 AM
The Optimist Club of Goldsboro is taking donations of computers that can be refurbished and distributed to students who can use them.
Since becoming affiliated with the Computers4Kids program in 2012, the club has actively worked to connect computers to low-income families with children in the local school system, said Needham Park, board member with the Optimist Club.
"We have given up to this point, we have sold or given out I think 247 computers," he said. "The total number of children has been 450."
At the outset, the club tried to get the word out about the need for computers.
"There are a lot of counties, like Johnston County, in certain schools they get a Chromebook," he said. "In this county that's not going on.
"We're trying to get as many kids as possible. They're not getting (computers) through the schools."
In the past, the Optimist Club held specific collection days at several area businesses, serving as drop-off sites for monitors and related computer items.
Then club members went to work to clean up the hard drive and revamp the computers so they could be put to use by students.
"We got a refurbishing license from Microsoft, we get Windows 10 and Office 2010," he said. "It has changed as we have gotten better donations, better quality computers. All we do now is clean them up, take the hard drive out.
"But we weren't having a lot of kids showing up, even for free computers."
So the club is trying to get the word out about the service.
Criteria to qualify for a computer is minimal, Park said.
"Basically they have got to be approved by the social worker at their school," he said. "One (stipulation) is going to be low income, and if the social worker signs off on it."
Students in all grades are eligible, including those who go on to Wayne Community College.
The club also still welcomes donations from the community, primarily laptops.
"We do not take the old-style monitors, only these classroom monitors," Park said. "Any kind of computer, any kind of electronic equipment. We take all of it -- the mouse, speakers, keyboards."
Instead of having designated days and varying locations, though, the Optimist Club office, 205 E. Walnut Street, will be open to accept donations on Saturdays from 10 a.m. until noon.
Build, Build, Build is currently financed by taxes, official development assistance, and commercial loans
Published 4:36 PM, July 04, 2018
TARLAC, Philippines – Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III on Wednesday, July 4 said that the government infrastructure program "Build Build Build" was "moving faster" than expected, thanks to the current financing method.
"Our method of using government financing is working, it's faster… We are pushing as quickly as we can. I think it's moving more quickly," Dominguez told reporters in a press briefing at the site development of Clark Green City.
Build, Build, Build is currently financed by taxes, official development assistance (ODA), and commercial loans.
Recently, the Department of Transportation inaugurated the new passenger terminals of Maasin Airport in Southern Leyte and Mactan-Cebu International Airport in Cebu.
The Department of Public Works and Highways also boasted on Wednesday the completion of Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway portion all the way to Pozorrubio in Pangasinan, among other road works that have been completed.
Dominguez earlier said that the administration was "veering away" from the public-private partnership (PPP) thrust which has caused delays in badly-needed projects.
He said that PPP takes a longer implementation time, but said that the government will still consider PPP proposals.
"The ODA plus a hybrid – that is generally what we are doing. There are proposals for PPP. We are entertaining those proposals," he said.
The Philippine government regularly meets with Chinese and Japanese counterparts, Dominguez said.
But the finance chief admitted there were some "delays" in terms of correspondences with their Chinese counterparts for projects they funded, mainly due to a reorganization within the Chinese government's ranks in March.
"The Chinese government went through their reorganization that has delayed our meeting a bit. It is completely understandable. We will meet third week of August," he said.
Senate inquiry?
In mid-June, Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto and Senator Sherwin Gatchalian expressed concerns on the mostly China-funded Build, Build, Build program.
Gatchalian had sought to probe the P8.4-trillion infrastructure program through Senate Resolution No. 759 filed on June 17.
Meanwhile, Recto was wary of ODA financing, saying that it could lead into a debt trap. (READ: Diokno not alarmed over funding for Build, Build, Build)
Forty out of 75 approved infrastructure projects as of July 2017 are funded through ODA, amounting to P1 trillion.
The budget department said P8 trillion to P9 trillion will be spent on the infrastructure program, raising infrastructure spending from 5.4% of the gross domestic product in 2017 to as high as 7.3% of the GDP in 2022.
The government targets the Philippine economy to grow by 7% in 2018, riding on the continuous rollout of its infrastructure program. – Rappler.com

HALIFAX -- As a blizzard lashed Newfoundland with wind-driven snow Tuesday, Maritimers were still digging out from under a heavy snowfall that lasted more than 24 hours, only to be warned that another storm was on its way.
By late Tuesday afternoon, blizzard and blowing snow warnings remained in effect for Cape Breton and the east and south coasts of Newfoundland as the enormous, slow-moving storm continued its blustery trek east. Environment Canada then issued a series of new alerts, including winter storm warnings for southern New Brunswick, and winter storm watches for much of western Nova Scotia.
"(Newfoundland) will have less of a break than the Maritimes before the next storm," said meteorologist Linda Libby.
About 15 centimetres of blowing snow is in forecast for southern New Brunswick, an area that saw up to 80 centimetres of snowfall Monday.
In eastern Newfoundland, schools were closed, public transit was shut down and virtually all flights were cancelled at St. John's International Airport as the storm arrived in the morning and lingered throughout the day. The city of St. John's was expected to get up to 60 centimetres of snow by Wednesday afternoon.
"All you see is white outside," said Christina Hope, manager of the Tim Hortons on Torbay Road in St, John's. She said the fast-food outlet would be closing early despite a steady flow of snow-covered coffee seekers. "You can sort of see across the street, but not very well."
The winds over eastern Newfoundland were expected to peak at 80 and 100 kilometres per hour overnight and into Wednesday -- a virtual repeat of what happened in southern New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and P.E.I. on Monday and Tuesday.
In Prince Edward Island, Canada Post said it wasn't safe to deliver mail Tuesday. Mail service was also cancelled in eastern Newfoundland.
Marine Atlantic, the ferry service that links Nova Scotia with Newfoundland, cancelled crossings scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday.
Meanwhile, schools and government offices and many businesses were closed for a second day throughout Nova Scotia, P.E.I. and New Brunswick. Dozens of arrivals and departures at Halifax Stanfield International Airport were either cancelled or delayed -- again.
Libby said Monday's snowfall broke some decades-old daily records in the Maritimes. She said the Halifax area officially received 50 centimetres in total, breaking the previous record for Feb. 13 of about 37 centimetres from 1953.
Halifax resident Jody Clarke was among several neighbours on his street either wielding a shovel or pushing a snowblower.
"We're used to storms that hit with four or five hours of intense snow," said Clarke, his hood pulled over his red tuque with a Canadian flag on the front.
"(But) this was 24 hours straight of blizzard-like conditions. You couldn't move. The city was in lockdown. That's the way it should have been. And we're just digging out now," he said. "We got about 60 centimetres, but when you're shovelling, it feels like 100 centimetres."
In Cape Breton, police were asking motorists to stay off the roads until the blizzard moved out to sea.
Vast areas of the Maritimes were snowed under Monday. The blizzard -- dubbed the "Beast of the East" by one forecaster -- dumped almost 80 cm of snow at Canadian Forces Base Gagetown in central New Brunswick. Powerful gusts that reached 120 kilometres per hour along the coast near Halifax created huge drifts throughout the port city.
In the Halifax region, customers of Heritage Gas were being told to make sure their natural gas meters are kept free of snow and ice buildup, and to clear any natural gas appliance vents to prevent "hazardous situations."
By late Tuesday afternoon, Nova Scotia Power was reporting outages affecting about 2,700 customers, having reconnected more than 48,000 customers by Tuesday morning.

CHISINAU, April 13 Moldova's central bank on Thursday said it was finally in a position to get back some of the $1 billion looted from three local lenders in a scandal that plunged the eastern European country into turmoil.
Known locally as the "theft of the century", the scandal saw the equivalent of an eighth of the country's gross domestic product disappear from banks between 2012-2014.
A former prime minister has been jailed in connection with the scam, in which money were siphoned overseas over years through dodgy loans, asset swaps and shareholder deals.
Moldova has engaged the risk consultancy Kroll to investigate the theft, working to establish all its beneficiaries and where the money ended up it was stolen and laundered, mainly through Latvia's financial system.
"The ultimate objective of the engagement is to identify assets which have been acquired with fraud funds and to attempt to recover these assets through legal processes," the central bank said in a statement.
"The investigation has now progressed to a stage where sufficient information has been obtained to start to initiate the recovery phase of the investigation."
The investigation so far has pointed towards a local businessman, Ilan Shor. Shor denies any wrongdoing and, after a period of house arrest ended, ran successfully in a mayoral election in 2015.
In new findings, the investigation has identified around 40 people who either benefited from the fraud or facilitated it, the central bank said, without divulging their names.
The majority of the individuals received hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash payments. Companies with suspected links to those individuals received tens of millions of dollars, the statement said.
The funds have so far been traced to Cyprus, China, Hong Kong and Switzerland, and the central bank is preparing legal action to recover the assets from overseas.
"Due to the multi-jurisdictional nature of the proposed legal action, and the complexity of the processes involved, it is likely that the recovery phase will last a minimum of 18 months to two years," it said.
The banking scandal triggered street protests, the International Monetary Fund and the EU froze aid, the national currency, the leu, plunged to record lows and inflation climbed into double digits.
Former prime minister Vlad Filat was implicated, put in handcuffs live on TV in parliament and later jailed, but many Moldovans believe other members of the pro-EU elite were also involved, or at least complicit in, the scam. (Writing by Matthias Williams, editing by Larry King)
COLOMBO, April 28 The Sri Lankan rupee fell on Friday on importer dollar demand, while bond yields dropped for a second day with the market expecting the local currency to trade steady on expected dollar inflows, dealers said.
Sri Lanka expects to raise up to $1.5 billion via a sovereign bond issuance, while another $1 billion is expected from two separate syndicated loans.
Rupee forwards were active, with two-week forwards closing at 153.30/40 per dollar, compared with Thursday's close of 153.15/30.
"The rupee will stabilise with higher dollar liquidity after the inflows," a currency dealer said, asking not to be named.
"Bond yields fell around 20 basis points and foreign investors were buying bonds."
A government move to double the borrowing limit of development bonds to $3 billion in 2017 is also expected to increase liquidity.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake on Thursday blamed "technical difficulties" for a two-month delay in receiving an around $160 million loan tranche from the IMF and said the disbursement was expected after June 14.
Sri Lanka has seen a rise in foreign inflows into equities and government securities since early this month, with foreign investors buying shares worth a net 13.7 billion rupees in 26 consecutive sessions through Friday.
Foreign investors have also net bought government securities worth 4.17 billion rupees in the week ended April 19, although they have net sold 58 billion rupees worth of government bonds so far this year. (Reporting by Shihar Aneez; Editing by Biju Dwarakanath)
TORONTO — The Progressive Conservatives are asking the Ontario Provincial Police to investigate millions in ineligible expenses — including scuba gear and raccoon traps — filed by nine power generators in the province.
Auditor general Bonnie Lysyk reported last week that the generators claimed up to $260 million in ineligible costs between 2006 and 2015, though the Independent Electricity System Operator says it's closer to $200 million.
The expenses were claimed under a program designed to pay power generators for fuel, maintenance and operating costs when the IESO puts them on standby to supply energy.
The IESO has recovered $168 million of those billings that were deemed inappropriate.
A man in his 70s has died in a single vehicle crash in Co. Monaghan. It's believed his car left the road and struck a wall.
Gardai and the emergency services were called to the scene at Lakeview, Castleblayney, at about 1.45 this afternoon.
The driver and sole occupant of the car was pronounced dead at the scene a short time later.
His body was taken to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda where a post mortem will be carried out.
A forensic examination of the crash site is taking place and diversions are in place.
Gardai are appealing for witnesses to the crash to come forward.
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles said on Friday that Brazil's economy is well on the road to recovery and that he will decide in April whether to run for president in the October general election.
Speaking at a business conference in Rio, Meirelles said the need to overhaul Brazil's costly pension system will become a big campaign issue if Congress does not approve the government's pension reform bill, which is due to face a first vote in the lower house in the week of February 19. He said he sees signs of growing support for the bill that has failed to muster the needed two-thirds majority so far.

UFC President Dana White recently shed some light on Ronda Rousey's future with the UFC.
Rousey, one of the most popular and highest-grossing fighters in UFC history, has pretty much remained quiet since her devastating loss to Amanda Nunes at UFC 207.
However, according to White, Rousey has spoken to him quite frequently since the Nunes fight. Yet, the subject of her return to the octagon is one that doesn't come up.
“Ronda and I talk maybe once a week, once every two weeks,” White told the press, in comments transcribed by FOX Sports. “She has not said anything to me about a comeback.
“If I had to guess, I would guess that she would not come back.”
Though, that's not to say Rousey doesn't have other prospects. The most famous women's fighter in the world has expressed interest in doing more television, and, according to WWE Chief Brand Officer Stephanie McMahon, seems to have an invite to join the WWE any time she wants.
After taking a vicious beating in her last two fights, which lasted 6 minutes and 47 seconds combined, scripted, fake fighting might not seem like such a bad idea.

Bunches of blue balloons were distributed to friends and family as they prepared to say a special goodbye to someone they adored.
“Words really can't explain, seriously, we were more than coworkers and friends. We were family,” said Terica Viverette.
Guy's fellow stylists and loved ones wore her favorite color and special shirts to honor her memory.
“She was the type of person that no matter your flaws, she accepted you always no matter what type of person you are,” said Tee Baker.
They released blue balloons into the sky, a symbolic gesture of letting her go. Emotions ran high and hearts were heavy.
“Every moment with her was so good. If there was tension she was always the one to break it,” said Taylor Lewis.

“I'm gonna just miss her walking in, and just looking at me like what you want, Terica,” said Viverette.
Those closest to her are having a hard time accepting her death. While Guy was shot and killed, no one has been charged in connection to her death.
Friends want answers and say she deserves to rest in peace.
“She just had a good heart, and she just loved everybody,” said Baker.
The night Guy was found shot dead, police say four girls were with her. They were all charged with conspiracy to commit aggravated assault. At this time, it's unclear who fired the shot that killed Guy.

× Arizona special election set to replace Rep. Trent Franks
By Caroline Kenny, CNN
(CNN) — A special election to fill the seat vacated by Arizona Republican Rep. Trent Franks will be held next year, with a primary February 27 and the general election April 24.
Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey announced the election dates Monday morning in an official state proclamation.
Franks said in a statement Thursday night he would resign from Congress after the House Ethics Committee said it would investigate allegations of sexual harrassment against him.
The House Ethics Committee announced earlier Thursday that it will investigate Franks to determine if he engaged in “conduct that constitutes sexual harassment and/or retaliation for opposing sexual harassment.”
In his statement, Franks acknowledged he made staffers “uncomfortable” and that he discussed fertility issues and surrogacy with two female staffers, but denied having ever “physically intimidated, coerced, or had, or attempted to have, any sexual contact with any member of my congressional staff.”
Franks originally said he would resign on Jan. 31, 2018, but on Friday, after additional alleged details of his behavior became public, said his resignation would take effect immediately.
The seat is now vacant and will remain so until the special election in April.
Franks' initial announcement came hours after Sen. Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, announced he would step down in the wake of allegations about inappropriately touching women and two days after Michigan Democratic Rep. John Conyers announced he was resigning as allegations about his past sexual misconduct increased.

Through holes knocked in walls, troops have a clear view of the al Nuri mosque's crooked, brown minaret and Islamic State's black flag on its white tip -- a hugely symbolic target in the battle to recapture Mosul now in its sixth month.
Al Nuri maybe tantalising close, but risky close-quarters fighting in the narrow alleys of Mosul's Old City near the mosque and reports of huge casualties after an air strike are forcing Iraqi and coalition commanders to change tactics.
Eyewitness from Western Mosul's al-Jadida district and Iraqi officials this week said a coalition air strike a week ago on IS targets may have collapsed homes where rescue officials say as many as 200 people were buried in the rubble.
Conflicting accounts are emerging. But if confirmed, it would be one of the worst massacres since the 2003 U.S. invasion as Iraq's Shi'ite-led government tries to avoid alienating Mosul's mostly Sunni population.
Already the battle around the Old City had slowed, forcing Iraqi forces and coalition allies to rethink how to push through tight, densely populated streets, where fleeing residents say they are used by militants as cover.
"We know that once the mosque falls this is the end of the Caliphate," said Staff Sgt Hassan, a Federal police sniper watching the maze of houses below. "But first we're trying to protect families coming out."
Recapturing Mosul will deliver a major blow to Islamic State as preparations increase to retake its main base in Raqqa, Syria. Iraqi special forces, federal police, Kurdish forces and Shi'ite militias surround militants in Mosul, cutting off routes to Syria.
Backed by U.S.-led coalition air strikes and advisors, counterterrorism troops (CTS) captured eastern Mosul by January. Since then, CTS, federal police and rapid response brigades have pushed through about half of the west.
In Islamic State-held areas, residents describe well-prepared militants who stayed behind. Some are foreign, some Iraqi. They force residents to leave their homes, breaking down walls to make tunnels. They make families retreat with them or herd them into buildings from which fighters fire on troops.
"They drive around on motorbikes looking for high positions on buildings, and they have tunnels between the homes," said Walid, a resident who fled from near the Old City. "I saw one Russian, by his accent, he spoke only some Arabic."
Even in retreat, militants are still dangerous. Two suicide bombers in an armoured bulldozer ploughed through military barricades two weeks ago, detonating the huge explosive-laden vehicle to destroy Humvees and Abrams tanks at one post.
But the U.S.-led coalition say it has degraded Islamic State weaponry, jamming small drones they use to drop munitions, cratering roads where commanders suspect suicide bombers will speed into army positions, and targeting mortar crews.
ANCIENT ALLEYS
In recent battles around the Old City, troops describe tough, street-by-street fighting in wrecked buildings, where narrow alleys are often cleared by grenades. Streets are blocked by earth barricades manned by tank crews and troops with shoulder-fired rockets to stop suicide attackers.
Next comes Mosul's Old City, whose origins date back to the Assyrian empire and whose alleys, streets and ancient fortress walls reflect Roman, Ottoman and Persian conquests. Even people born there say they sometimes get lost.
"We sometimes don't see the enemy face to face," said Abu Taib, a federal police officer draped in ammunition. "In the smaller alleys, we don't even go in, it's too dangerous. Sometimes we surprise them, sometimes they surprise us."
That kind of terrain, and the risk of more civilian casualties prompted a rethink of tactics as Iraqi forces push to finish the Mosul campaign.
U.S. Army Brigadier General John Richardson, a commander from the U.S.-led coalition, said Iraqi forces were considering isolating the Old City rather than fighting through it while opening up a second front to split militant ranks and clear the rest of Mosul.
"They know the old city is the centre of gravity and they know they are going to have to eventually go in clear it. The mosque is symbolic," he said. "They have run into some tougher resistance, but it's the terrain rather than the enemy."
Federal police and Iraqi army sources also say initial plans are for the military to seal off the Old City and to evacuate civilians to allow U.S.-trained CTS special forces to take a larger role in carrying out incursions inside.
Bringing the 9th Army division in from the north would also force Islamic State to fight on two fronts and draw fighters away from the Old City, where commanders fear civilian casualties may undermine security and fan the sectarian tensions that helped Islamic State thrive.
HALT AIR STRIKES
The Jadida incident is already complicating the campaign. Rescue workers are still searching the site of the March 17 explosion, where one health official said 160 bodies had been recovered. Iraq's military says 61 bodies have been pulled out so far.
Eyewitnesses describe a massive explosion that collapsed buildings and buried residents inside. But what caused the blast is unclear. The U.S.-led coalition said it carried out a strike on IS targets in the area but is still investigating.
The Pentagon said later it was not loosening its rules of engagement in the fight against Islamic State but that resources to investigate claims were limited.
Iraq's military said Islamic State boobytrapped a building packed with civilians and fired from it to draw an air strike. But it said there was no sign an air strike hit the collapsed building. Other eyewitnesses say an air strike may have hit a truck bomb, which exploded and destroyed nearby buildings.
Already Sunni lawmakers are questioning the campaign. Iraqi Parliament speaker Salim al-Jabouri told al-Arabiya television that more civilian casualties could result in a halt to operations until a way to protect residents is found.
"The international community should step in and save Mosul from blind air strikes," Mosul lawmaker Faris al-Sanjari told Reuters. "You can't kill dozens of civilians just to kill one Islamic State sniper."

PARIS The first indications from polling booths are "not good" for conservative challenger Francois Fillon, French senator and key Fillon supporter Roger Karoutchi told reporters on Sunday.
"If I had a good feeling about it I would not be drinking Coca-Cola but that is what I am drinking now," he said.
"The first indications are not good," he said.
He added that he did not expect Fillon would support either centrist Emmanuel Macron or far-right Marine Le Pen in the second round in two weeks.

There were gasps and tears in the courtroom. Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis turned to the gallery and told families to "use your words," not violence.
"This is letting him have this power over us," she said. "We cannot behave like this."
During a return to court, Margraves told the judge that he just snapped. He said he had not known what exactly his daughters were going to say about their abuse.
"I look over here and Larry Nassar's shaking his head, no, like it didn't happen. ... I'm embarrassed," Margraves said of his conduct. "I'm not here to upstage my daughters. I'm here to help them heal."
About 30 more people spoke in person, by video or had statements read after the incident. The case will end Monday with final remarks from the prosecutor, defence and Nassar, followed by the judge's sentence. Nassar faces a minimum of 25 to 40 years in prison in this case.
Outside court, Melissa Alexander Vigogne, who travelled from France to speak, said she was surprised that an attack had not been attempted earlier.
"It's not that that's how we should respond. But it's truly understandable — the amount of pain that we've all gone through," Vigogne said of Margraves' actions.
Sheriff Tom Reich said his officers will investigate what happened in court and send a report to the local prosecutor.
The judge started the day by addressing comments made by a Nassar lawyer who said she had doubts about the large number of women and girls who say they were assaulted by Nassar. Cunningham called Shannon Smith's remarks "unfortunate" and said Nassar did not authorize them.
Smith told Detroit radio station WWJ that it is "really unfortunate" if some people stepped forward only because of all the recent attention. Nassar released a statement saying Smith's comments were a distraction and that his accusers' remarks "have pierced my soul."
Many of Nassar's accusers have blamed Michigan State, USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee for not doing earlier to stop him. The USOC announced Friday that it hired a law firm to conduct an independent investigation. And the co-ordinator of the women's national team for USA Gymnastics, Valeri Liukin, said he was stepping down.
Nassar soon will be under three prison sentences. His first, 60 years in a federal prison, was ordered in December for child pornography crimes.

CHARLIZE THERON
During an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Theron revealed that her friend Chelsea Handler had introduced her to the wild world of online dating. "She was on her phone and she showed it to me and she was explaining it to me in that Chelsea Handler way, which is just like, 'Yeah, everybody's doing this. What's wrong with you? Where have you been, under a rock?'" Theron joked. "So then I took real interest, and I was like, okay, well tell me, how does it work?"
Even with the intro lesson, Theron isn't convinced that dating apps are for her. "And then you have to text them and then the flirting starts and it's kind of awkward because you don't know the person and they're trying to be cute and they say weird things like, 'What's up, sexy?' And it's just awkward," she complained. "This is why I'm still single. I just like a good old friend hooking you up, or, I don't know, introducing you. I'm so old school."

PRINCE GEORGE COUNTY, Va. -- Circuit Court Judge Nathan Curtis Lee, of Hopewell, was found dead in his office at the Prince George County Courthouse Sunday night, according to Prince George County Police.
Foul play was not suspected in the 60-year-old judge's New Year's Day death, according to investigators.
"During the evening hours of January 1st, police and fire/EMS were called to the Prince George County Courthouse regarding an unresponsive male," a news release from Prince George County Police Chief W. Keith Early stated. "Upon arrival, they found the deceased judge in his office."

Liverpool have been given a two-year ban from signing academy players and fined 100,000 pounds for breaching rules governing the transfer of youth players, the Premier League said on Wednesday.
The second year of the ban, which prevents the club from signing any academy players who have been registered with other Premier League or English Football League clubs in the previous 18 months, is suspended for three years.
A league investigation found Liverpool guilty of offering prohibited inducements in an attempt to recruit a schoolboy from Stoke City.
"The League found evidence demonstrating regular communications between representatives of the club and members of the player's family," the league said in a statement on its website. (www.premierleague.com)
"This included hosting them at Anfield for a match with expenses paid and other efforts to encourage the player, via his family, to sign for Liverpool. League rules strictly prohibit the offer of any inducements to encourage a move."
Liverpool attempted to register the player last September, but the application was turned down by the Premier League board because the Merseyside club had offered to pay the boy's private school fees.
This was a breach of newly-introduced rules which say a benefit can only be offered if it is applicable to all youth players across the club's academy and this was not the case.

There was a time when Chenai Mathabire read Vogue, watched beauty pageants on TV and fantasized about being a supermodel. Today she helps the sick and injured as a nurse and epidemiologist.
Last month, the 35-year-old Zimbabwean received an International AIDS Society prize for showing that a faster tuberculosis test could be implemented at health centers in southeast Africa. Her work will help save the lives of HIV-positive patients who contract TB.
"Nursing is often looked down upon and people just think you are there to be the maid of the doctor or do the dirty work. But teachers made me realize that nurses have a big role to play," says Mathabire.
In Zimbabwe's bustling capital, Harare, Mathabire earned high enough points in her studies to pursue a degree in physiotherapy, occupational therapy or nursing at university. She chose to become a nurse — the first nurse in her family. In 2008, she was between jobs and Zimbabwe was facing economic problems. Mathabire decided to apply for a job at Doctors Without Borders.
The work took her into some of Africa's grimmest situations. She helped diagnose malnourished children with HIV, tuberculosis, pneumonia and malaria in Zimbabwe. Then she supervised workers who were teaching HIV-positive pregnant women how to protect their children from the virus. After that, she worked in a mobile hospital in South Sudan, treating gunshot wounds during a tribal war.
In 2015, she was recruited for her first research assignment at Doctors Without Borders, work that would eventually earn her an International AIDS Society prize. She knew that TB was the No. 1 killer of HIV-positive patients from her previous work, but she didn't know about the rapid tuberculosis test until she read the study's protocol. She was eager to get started on the project.
For two years, Mathabire and a team explored how easily health clinics and hospitals in the Chiradzulu District of Malawi and the Chamanculo District of Mozambique could implement the tuberculosis test for HIV patients, who are more susceptible to the infection.
In Malawi and Mozambique, HIV is the leading cause of death. It is often spread through unprotected sex, and it has wiped out 27 percent of Malawi's and 24 percent of Mozambique's populations according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Finding out whether an HIV-positive person has tuberculosis is a matter of life and death. Mathabire remembers a Malawi man in his early 30s who left a clinic untreated. The rapid test, which analyzes a molecule in the patient's urine with a paper strip, had shown that he had TB. A coughing test didn't. But doctors weren't referring patients for the rapid test in their assessment of the man. It hadn't yet been approved by the Ministry of Health which was awaiting the World Health Organization's policy guidance. The man died before he could go back to get help.
His story wasn't unique, Mathabire says. "It's very sad but then you realize why you are doing the study — to prevent this from happening," she says. "You start to realize the urgency of what you are doing."
Under normal circumstances, patients are given cough tests or chest X-rays to test for TB. Mathabire's team found that it takes an average of two to four days for results, but the wait could drag on for months.
Though the government of Malawi pays for certain medical care, including tuberculosis treatment, patients might not have the money to pay for a bus ride to the hospital or clinic for follow-up visits. And more remote clinics don't always have the resources to transport samples to hospitals.
With the rapid TB test, sick patients could begin treatment the same day. Mathabire's data showed that the test provided results in less than an hour. Staff in Malawi and Mozambique could be trained to administer the test in just a few hours. And doctors, nurses and clinical officers said it was easy to interpret the bands on the test strips.
Mathabire also found that patients weren't skeptical of a new method. They really wanted to take the high-tech test. Mainly peasant farmers, they took the words of the health workers seriously. "Everybody basically knew somebody that had died of HIV [and opportunistic infections] in a terrible way," she says. It was like that in Zimbabwe too.
The team's findings, published by Doctors Without Borders this year, has led some of the health centers where the aid group works to embrace rapid TB testing. It could pave the way for more facilities to incorporate the test it into their health systems, meaning faster care for the sickest of HIV patients.
In a statement, International AIDS Society president Linda-Gail Bekker said that Mathabire's research will "support the next generation of investigators whose work can help to change the course of this epidemic."
Mathabire still works for Doctors Without Borders and is considering conducting more research on HIV and tuberculosis. But her award-winning research isn't the only major event of her summer.
She moved to Falun, central Sweden, to marry an infectious disease specialist whom she worked with in Zimbabwe. True to her early love of fashion, she's sewing her own wedding dress, with glass beads, silk and lace.
