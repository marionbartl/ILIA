The Ablist is the second album by the turntablist Rob Swift, released in 1999 via Asphodel Records.
Production
The album was produced by Rob Swift and Dan The Automator. The rapper Pharoahe Monch makes an appearance.
Critical reception
AllMusic wrote that the album "redefines the turntable as a musical instrument that can bring new dimensions to both structured and improvised music, and it shows that Swift is capable of some incisive music that works outside the normal confines of turntablist music." The Riverfront Times thought that "it never really breaks away from standard hip-hop and therefore never fulfills its promise as something totally new." Vibe opined that "the only time the album lags is when Swift steps to the mike on 'I'm Leaving'."

The India cricket team toured Australia from November 2018 to January 2019 to play four Tests, three One Day Internationals (ODIs) and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. Initially, the Test match at the Adelaide Oval was planned to be a day/night fixture, but the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) declined the offer from Cricket Australia to play the match under lights. In April 2018, the Western Australian Cricket Association confirmed that the Perth Stadium would host its first ever Test match. During the second Test, it became the tenth venue in Australia to host a Test match.
India's regular wicket-keeper for limited overs matches, MS Dhoni, was not named in the side's squad for the T20I fixtures for this series and the ones against the West Indies. Instead, India's Test wicket-keeper, Rishabh Pant, was selected in Dhoni's place. The T20I series was drawn 1–1, after the second match finished in a no result. India won the Test series 2–1, after the fourth match of the series finished as a draw. India became the first Asian team to win a Test series in Australia.
In the ODI series that followed, Australia won the first match by 34 runs, recording their 1,000th win in international cricket. However, India went on to win the next two games, and consequently the series 2–1; in the process recording their first bilateral ODI series victory in Australia.
Squads
Mitchell Starc was added to Australia's T20I squad for the third match, replacing Billy Stanlake, who was injured. Prithvi Shaw was ruled out of India's Test squad due to injury and was replaced by Mayank Agarwal. Hardik Pandya was also added to India's squad for the last two Test matches. Marnus Labuschagne was added to Australia's squad for the fourth Test. Jasprit Bumrah was rested for the ODI series and was replaced by Mohammed Siraj in India's squad. Mitchell Marsh was ruled out of Australia's squad for the first ODI due to illness and was replaced by Ashton Turner.
On 11 January 2019, Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul were suspended by the BCCI following controversial comments they made on the Indian talk show Koffee with Karan earlier in the month. They were ruled out of the ODI series of this tour, and all of the fixtures of India's tour to New Zealand. Vijay Shankar was added to India's ODI squad as a replacement.

Little Smalltalk is a non-standard dialect and runtime system, a virtual machine referred to as "system", of the Smalltalk-80 programming language implemented by Timothy Budd at University of Arizona in 1984 along with a group of his students. It was originally described in a book "A Little Smalltalk" (1987), and was created as result of lack of cheap access to Smalltalk-80 runtime at the time; it was initially intended to run on Unix on a VAX-780.
The Little Smalltalk system was the first Smalltalk interpreter produced outside of Xerox PARC. Although it lacked many of the features of the original Smalltalk-80 system, it helped popularize the ideas of object-oriented programming, virtual machines, and bytecode interpreters.
In 1994, Timothy Budd rewrote Little Smalltalk in Java, and distributes it as the SmallWorld system. Little Smalltalk source code wasn't touched since then.
The original releases are under a variety of licenses. They are now maintained by Danny Reinhold via the Little Smalltalk project. Recently work on a new major version has begun. This differs from earlier releases by providing support for graphical applications, a foreign function interface, and many integrated tools.
Goals
Little Smalltalk is intended to:
Closely resemble Smalltalk-80 description
Run on Unix accessed by conventional terminals
Run on 16-bit machines with separate instruction and data memory, on a small memory size
Be written in C language

Sebald Bopp (died 1502) was a German painter active around Bamberg. Little is known about him; his name is first recorded in Würzburg, where he was listed as a journeyman in 1474, but his earliest known work remains in his native town. This is a depiction of the Sermon of John of Capistrano, painted around 1480 and now in the Neue Residenze in Bamberg. The style of this painting, filled with representations of bourgeois figures, appears to have been derived from the work of the Master of the Bamberg Altar. After 1480 his activity is recorded in Nuremberg, judging from a Crucifixion memorial plaque, dating to 1483, honoring Peter and Apollonia Volckamer. Bopp returned to Bamberg at some point before his death; he died there in 1502.

The temple is governed by Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board (SMVDSB). The board was established under the Jammu and Kashmir state government Act No. XVI/1988, also known as Shri Mata Vaishno devi Shrine Act. The board is chaired by the Lieutenant Governor of Jammu & Kashmir who also appoints 9 board members for governing the Shrine.
History
The temple, at a height of 1,584.96 m (5,200 ft), is 12 km from Katra on Trikuta hill. It is about 61 km from Jammu city. A geological study of the Holy Cave has indicated its age to be nearly a million years. There is also a mention of the Trikuta hill in Rigveda, the place where the temple is located.
The Mahabharata, which gives the account of the Pandavas and the Kurukshetra War, does mention the worship of goddess Vaishno Devi. Before the Kurukshetra War Arjuna is said to have worshipped Devi by the advice of Lord Krishna for the blessings. Pleased by his devotion, Mother Goddess appeared in front of him in the form of Vaishno Devi. When goddess appeared, Arjuna started praising her with a stotra, in which a Shloka goes by saying ‘ Jambookatak Chityaishu Nityam Sannihitalaye ', which means ‘you who always dwell in the temple on the slope of the mountain in Jambhu' probably referring to the present day Jammu. Former Governor of Jammu and Kashmir Jagmohan says, "the Mata Vaishno Devi shrine is an ancient one whose antiquity is pre-Mahabharathan, Lord Krishna is believed to have advised Arjuna to go up in the hills of 'Jambhu' and seek the blessings of Vaishno Devi before taking up arms in the battlefield. 'Jambhu' is identified with present-day Jammu. Arjuna while worshipping Vaishno Devi, calls Her, the highest Yogin who is free from decrepitude and decay, who is the Mother of the Vedas and the Science of Vedanta and who is giver of Victory and personification of victory itself". It is also generally believed that the Pandavas were the first to build the temples at Kol Kandoli and Bhawan in reverence and gratitude for the Mother Goddess. On a mountain, just adjacent to the Trikuta Mountain and overlooking the Holy Cave are five stone structures, which are believed to be the rock symbols of the five Pandavas.
The Appearance of Vaishno Devi to Shridhar and the story of Bhairon Nath
Vaishno Devi was an ardent devotee of Lord Vishnu and she used to meditate in a cave. It is said that Bhairon Nath, a famous Hindu Tantric, saw the young Vaishno Devi at an agricultural fair and fell madly in love with her. Vaishno Devi fled into Trikuta hills to escape his amorous advances, later she assumed the form of Durga and cut off his head with her sword in a cave.
According to author Manohar Sajnani, Hindu mythology holds that the original abode of Vaishno Devi was Ardh Kunwari, a place about halfway between Katra town and the cave. The Vaishno Devi is said to have been a Virgin since the creation of the universe.
On 1 January 2022, 12 people were killed and 16 others injured during a stampede near to Gate No. 3 at the shrine.
Deities
The three idols Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati, all images of Vaishno Devi are worshipped at the temple. The feet of the idols are washed by the water brought from the perennial flowing river Banganga.
Worship
Author Abha Chauhan identifies Vaishno Devi with the power of Durga as well as the incarnation of Lakshmi, Saraswati and Kali. Pintchman writes that Vaishno Devi possesses all the same powers as the supreme divinity Adi Shakti or simply Durga. Pintchman also states that some pilgrims identify Vaishno Devi as Durga (a form of Parvati), who is also called Sheranwali, "the Lion-rider".
Festivals
The most prominent festivals held at Vaishno Devi Temple are Navaratri, a nine nights festival celebrating Devi's victory over evil demons and Diwali, a festival of lights symbolizing the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance.
The Navaratri festival is a festival celebrated during the month of Ashvin, which typically falls in the Gregorian months of September and October. The festival lasts for nine nights (ten days); artists from all over the country perform during the function at Vaishno Devi darbar. Due to COVID-19 pandemic Shrine Board also started delivering Prasāda for the devotees who are unable to come to the temple by collaborating with Postal Department of India.
Devotees of all faiths and all schools of thought of Hinduism visit the Vaishno Devi Temple.
Administration and visit
The Vaishno Devi Temple was included in the Jammu and Kashmir Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Act No. XVI/1988 and also part of Article 26 of the Constitution of India. The board name is Shri Mata Vaishno devi Shrine Board. There are nine members in the board; all are nominated by the Government of Jammu and Kashmir, particularly by Governor of Jammu and Kashmir. The Governor of Jammu and Kashmir is the ex-officio chairman of the board. In 1991, Shri Mata Vaishno devi Shrine Board management also took the control of Shiv Khori, a famous Shiva temple.
Shrine Board have also constructed guest houses such as Vaishnavi Dham, Saraswati Dham, Kalika Dham, Niharika Yatri Niwas, Shakti Bhawan and Ashirwad Bhawan near the Railway station and Bus stand at Katra.
During the winter season from the month of December to January the Vaishno Devi Temple will be covered with snow. Even though temple will not be closed during these days, people visiting the temple are recommended to bring heavy woollens, wind-cheaters, caps and gloves, although the temple management provides free blankets during the climb.

Fremont County is a county located in the U.S. state of Idaho. As of the 2020 census the county had a population of 13,388. The county seat and largest city is St. Anthony. The county was established in 1893, and was named for the explorer John C. Frémont. Fremont County is part of the Rexburg, Idaho micropolitan area, which is also included in the Idaho Falls metropolitan area.
History
Fremont County was established in 1893 when Bingham County was partitioned. It is named for John C. Frémont.
The county initially contained all of the northern portion of eastern Idaho north of Bonneville County. The counties of Jefferson and Madison were created from Fremont in 1913. Teton County was later created from Madison in 1915 and a portion of Butte was created from Jefferson in 1917. Clark County was also created from Fremont in 1919.
The first fur trapping operation by a United States fur company west of the Rocky Mountains occurred in 1810 when Andrew Henry established a fort in the fall of 1810 on Conant Creek in southern Fremont County. Henry later moved the fort to the south bank of the Henry's Fork of the Snake River between present-day settlements of Salem and Parker. The fort was abandoned some time after 1811.
At the time of early settlement, Fremont County was located on the northern edge of Oneida County. Mining, timber, and ranching operations commenced in the Island Park area prior to 1870. The establishment of Yellowstone National Park in 1872 also contributed to the eventual development of the Island Park area as a popular recreation area. Construction of the Egin Canal commenced in 1879 and farming settlement of the Egin area followed. In 1883, Parker was established and settlement commenced at Teton. These settlements became part of Bingham County when it was created in 1885. Settlement at St. Anthony started in 1888 while the Ashton area settlement of Marysville commenced settlement in 1889. At the 1890 Census, Bingham County enumerated 301 residents in the precincts of Teton and Henry's Lake.
Additional settlement occurred at Warm River in 1896, the Drummond area in 1900, and Newdale in 1914.
The Fremont County Courthouse in St. Anthony is on the National Register of Historic Places.

V598 Puppis is the name given to a nova in the Milky Way Galaxy. USNO-A2.0 0450-03360039, the catalog number for the star, was discovered to be much brighter than normal in X-ray emissions on October 9, 2007, by the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton telescope. Ultimately, the star was confirmed to 600 times brighter than normal by the Magellan-Clay telescope Magellan-Clay telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile.
The nova has been officially named V598 Puppis and is "one of the brightest for almost a decade". Despite its brightness, the nova was apparently missed by amateur and professional astronomers alike until XMM-Newton spotted the unusual X-ray source while turning from one target to another. The Sky Automated Survey determined that that nova had occurred on June 5, 2007.
The orbital period of the two stars in V598 Puppis is 0.1628714 days, or 3 hours, 54 minutes, and 32 seconds.

The first series of Love Island began on 7 June 2015 with a live special of the show hosted by Caroline Flack on ITV2, and ended on 15 July 2015. It is the first from the revived series, but third overall. The series was narrated by Iain Stirling. The series aired every night of the week except Friday, however the Saturday episode was used as a weekly catch-up entitled Love Island: The Weekly Hot List rather than a nightly highlights episode. The average viewers for this series was 570,000.
On 15 July 2015 the series was won by Jess Hayes and Max Morley, with Hannah Elizabeth and Jon Clark as runners-up.
Islander Jon Clark later went onto appear as a cast member in The Only Way Is Essex, whilst both Josh Ritchie and Max Morley made appearances in Ex on the Beach. After finishing in fourth place, Cally and Luis became the first couple to have a baby as they welcomed their first child in May 2017.
Production
The first one-minute trailer for the series aired on 12 May 2015, confirming that the series would begin in June. Pictures of the villa were unveiled on 5 June 2015. The villa is located in Mallorca with 69 cameras watching the Islander's every move. It only includes double beds forcing them to share with each other, but has a special Hideaway bedroom for couples to spend the night away from the others.
Islanders
The Islanders for the first series were revealed on 2 June 2015, just days before the launch. However, throughout the series, more Islanders entered the villa to find love. Some Islanders were dumped from the island for either failing to couple up, some were voted off by their fellow Islanders, and others for receiving the fewest votes in public eliminations. The series was won by Jess and Max on 15 July 2015 after receiving 42% of the final vote, beating Hannah and Jon who received 36%, Lauren and Josh with 12%, and finally Cally and Luis who just received 10%.
Coupling
The couples were chosen shortly after the Islanders entered the villa. After all of the boys entered, the girls were asked to choose a boy to pair up with. Jon was paired with Hannah, Chris was paired with Danielle, Omar and Rachel paired up, Josh and Lauren coupled up, whilst Jess paired herself with Jordan and Luis got with Zoe. They were competing in their pairs for £50,000. However, throughout the series the couples swapped and changed as the islanders re-coupled.
Notes
: On Day 2, after Jess and Jordan won a challenge they were given the opportunity to swap two couples. Jess decided to couple up with Josh, leaving Jordan in a new couple with Lauren.
: On Day 8, the Islanders were told that they were all single, but new girls Daisy and Naomi would get the chance to couple up with a boy of their choice after going on three dates. Daisy chose Jordan, and Naomi chose Josh respectively.
: On Day 15, the Islanders were told that once again they were all single, unless they wanted to announce that they are officially boyfriend and girlfriend. The only couples to do this were Hannah and Jon, and Naomi and Josh.
Guests
During the series a number of guests entered the villa.
On 25 June 2015 it was announced that Calum Best would be returning to the series. On Day 24, he briefly entered to take the boys on a night out in Magaluf. This was Calum's third appearance on the show having previously appeared on the original series in 2005 where he finished in third place. He later returned for 2006 series where he was voted the winner alongside Bianca Gascoigne.
On 12 July 2015, it was announced that Mark Wright would be briefly entering the villa. He entered on Day 38 to become the DJ for Lauren's birthday party, he departed shortly after the party.

A Woman's Face is a 1941 American drama film directed by George Cukor and starring Joan Crawford, Melvyn Douglas and Conrad Veidt. It tells the story of Anna Holm, a facially disfigured blackmailer, who because of her appearance, despises everyone she encounters. When a plastic surgeon corrects this disfigurement, Anna becomes torn between the hope of starting a new life and a return to her dark past. Most of the film is told in flashbacks as witnesses in a courtroom give their testimonies. The screenplay was written by Donald Ogden Stewart and Elliot Paul, based on the play Il était une fois... by Francis de Croisset. Another version of the story, a Swedish production, was filmed in 1938 as En kvinnas ansikte, starring Ingrid Bergman.
Advertising for the film appears in a photograph by Robert Frank. One of the images of Crawford used in the advertising later was included in the album artwork for The Rolling Stones album Exile on Main St. (1972).
Plot
Anna Holm is on trial in Stockholm for murdering an unnamed victim. Her hat conceals her face.
The first witness, Herman Rundvik, a waiter, recalls a dinner at a secluded tavern, hosted by the charismatic and profligate Torsten Barring. Guests include Vera, the unfaithful wife of plastic surgeon Gustaf Segert, and Eric, Vera's latest conquest.
The manager, Bernard Dalvik, refuses credit, and Torsten meets the proprietress, Anna. The right side of her face is mutilated, but Torsten ignores her scars and compliments her beautiful eyes. Anna forgives the bill and hints that she might be useful to him. After the party leaves, Eric returns to ask Rundvik if something dropped from his overcoat pocket. Back in the courtroom, Rundvik identifies Anna as boss of their blackmail ring.
Next up is Bernard Dalvik. On the advice of her masseuse—Dalvik's wife, Christina—Vera comes to them for help: someone has her letters to Eric. Torsten calls on Anna while Dalvik is making the arrangements with Vera. Anna brings Torsten into their gang and falls deeply in love.
Vera testifies: Anna comes to sell the letters. Gustaf returns home unexpectedly; Anna trips, injuring her ankle. He wants to call the police, but Vera dissuades him. Intrigued by Anna's scars, Gustaf offers to heal her. Vera protests, and her testimony ends.
Anna is called to testify and remembers that, when she was five years old, her drunken father set her room on fire; he saved her, but not himself. When she was 16, hating the world that shunned her, she chose a life of crime. She describes a meeting with Torsten at his apartment in which she reveals much about herself. “We are both proud, both wretched,” he says. They toast their partnership.
Anna endures twelve painful operations. Gustaf wonders: Is she Galatea? Or is she Frankenstein's monster—a beautiful face with no heart? Dissolve to the courtroom: Anna removes her hat, revealing a perfect face.
Torsten is amazed by her new beauty. She reassures him: She has not joined “the saints”. He tells her that his very old, very rich uncle, Consul Magnus Barring, has bequeathed everything to his four-year-old grandson. If the boy dies, Torsten will inherit. Anna is horrified, but Torsten compels her. In the courtroom, she admits that she agreed to kill the child.
She becomes the boy's governess and goes to Barring Hall as Ingrid Paulsen. The house is in the mountains, across the river from the metal works that produces the Barring fortune. Anna becomes fond of the kindly Consul and the sweet-natured little Lars-Erik. Torsten arrives on the eve of the Consul's birthday. He dances with Anna; she is mesmerized. The house guests include Gustaf, who tells Anna that he believes in her reform and will keep her secret. The next day, Anna accidentally leaves Lars-Erik under a sun lamp too long. Her genuine distress makes Torsten doubt her, and he gives her an ultimatum: Lars-Erik must die before the next night. In the courtroom she says, “because... it was what he wanted.”
Gustaf picks up the story. The next day, Anna takes the child for a cablecar ride to the mill. Gustaf climbs aboard an ore bucket on a neighboring cable. He sees her start to pull the bolt on the gate, but she shoves it back and hugs the oblivious child. To Lars-Erik's delight, Gustaf passes them. Gustaf questions a furious Anna. The screen pans to the courtroom. He believes she was angry because he doubted her. The prosecutor accuses Gustaf of loving her; he does not deny it.
Emma Kristiansdotter, the jealous housekeeper, is next. In the attic getting robes for the birthday sleigh ride, she overhears Anna and Torsten, who scorns the ”dove” she has become and reveals his ambitions to do in Sweden “what has been done in other countries.” Downstairs, Anna gives the Consul a pocket chess set, which he hands to Emma, who stops, abruptly.
The Consul recalls the sleigh ride. Torsten speeds by with Lars-Erik, lashing the horses, Anna and Gustaf in pursuit. Torsten won't stop, so Anna shoots him. He slips into the river and over the falls. The Consul believes Anna is innocent, but the judges are not satisfied. Anna protests that she left a message inside the chess set. Emma admits to keeping the letter, but she is above reading other people's mail. It is a full confession—and a suicide note. While the judges deliberate, Gustaf coaxes Anna into admitting that she loves him. He proposes. The clerk tells them that the judges are ready and adds that Gustaf should come, too.

Reception
Box office
According to MGM records the film earned $1,077,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $830,000 elsewhere.
Critical response
Variety wrote "Miss Crawford takes a radical step as a screen glamour girl to allow the makeup necessary for facial disfiguration in the first half ... [Crawford] has a strongly dramatic and sympathetic role ... which she handles in top-notch fashion."
More recently, film critic Dennis Schwartz discussed the importance of the role to Joan Crawford: "Joan Crawford jumped at the chance to star in this juicy role despite having to play a facially disfigured woman (at least for half the film), which she was advised by even Louis B. Mayer (MGM head) that it could be costly for the glamor actress in the future. Instead it turned out to be one of her more acclaimed roles and did nothing but promote her career further as a serious dramatic actress (she won an Oscar for Mildred Pierce in 1945, which she claims this film had a cumulative effect in helping her win that award). Crawford's scar makeup was credited to Jack Dawn, who created makeup for such films as The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941)."

The broad stingray (Bathytoshia lata), also known as the brown stingray or Hawaiian stingray, is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae. The predominant species of stingray in the inshore waters of the Hawaiian Islands, this benthic fish typically inhabits sandy or muddy flats at depths greater than . Usually growing to across, the broad stingray has a wide, diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc with a protruding snout tip and a long tail with a ventral fin fold. At night, this species actively forages for bottom-dwelling invertebrates and bony fishes, often near the boundaries of reefs. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous. As substantial threats to its population do not seem to exist, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed this species as least concern.
Taxonomy and phylogeny
American zoologist Samuel Garman described the broad stingray in an 1880 issue of the scientific journal Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, giving it the name Trygon lata from the Latin word for "broad". Subsequent authors synonymized Trygon with Dasyatis. The type specimen was collected from what were then called the "Sandwich Islands", and measures across.
Lisa Rosenberger's 2001 phylogenetic analysis of 14 Dasyatis species, based on morphological characters, found that the sister species of the broad stingray is the roughtail stingray (D. centroura), and that they form a clade with the southern stingray (D. americana) and the longtail stingray (D. longa). As D. centroura is found in the Atlantic, this suggests that it and D. lata evolutionarily diverged before or with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama (about 3 million years ago).
Distribution and habitat
The broad stingray has only been confirmed to occur around the Hawaiian Islands, where it is the most abundant stingray. A record of this species from off Taiwan has yet to be verified. Broad stingrays are common in coastal bays with mud or silt bottoms, including Ma'alaea Bay off the island of Maui and Kaneohe Bay off the island of Oahu, but may also be encountered in sandy areas or near coral reefs. It has been reported from depths of , though most are found deeper than .
Description
The broad stingray has a diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc a fourth wider than long, with nearly straight leading margins that converge at an obtuse angle, and curved trailing margins. The tip of the snout is rounded and protrudes past the disc. The mouth is arched and contains five or six papillae on the floor, two of which are in front of the others. The pelvic fins are short and rounded. The whip-like tail is twice or more the length of the disc, and bears a serrated stinging spine on the upper surface near the tail base. A long, narrow fin fold occurs beneath the tail, which eventually becomes a keel that runs all the way to the tail tip.
Larger rays have three large, elongated tubercles in the middle of the back; the tail is roughened by small dermal denticles, along with an irregular row of conical tubercles on each side and several large, flattened tubercles in front of the spine. This species is plain olive to brown above and white below. Though rarely found so far west, the similar-looking diamond stingray (D. dipterura) is the only other nearshore stingray that occurs off Hawaii; it can be distinguished from this species by its tail, which is shorter and has both upper and lower fin folds. The broad stingray can reach across and in weight, though few exceed across.
Biology and ecology
During the day, the broad stingray is relatively inactive and spends much time lying half-buried on the bottom. A tracking study in Kaneohe Bay found that individuals rays roamed over an average area of at night, compared to an average diurnal activity space of , and did not rest consistently in any particular spot. Rays were most active 2 hours after sunset and before sunrise, and were more active in the higher water temperatures of summer than winter. The behavior of this species was not significantly influenced by tides, likely because they inhabit deeper water.
The broad stingray feeds mainly on bottom-dwelling crustaceans, while also taking polychaete worms and small bony fishes. It excavates large pits to uncover buried prey, and is often followed by opportunists such as jacks. Foraging rays favor areas close to reef boundaries, where many parrotfish, wrasses, gobies, and other reef fishes shelter at night. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium chengi, Rhinebothrium hawaiiensis, Pterobothrium hawaiiensis, Prochristianella micracantha, and Parachristianella monomegacantha. Like other stingrays, the broad stingray is aplacental viviparous. Kaneohe Bay appears to be a nursery area for this species, where juvenile scalloped hammerheads (Sphyrna lewini) and it is the dominant predators.
Human interactions
The International Union for the Conservation of Nature has assessed the broad stingray as of the least concern, as it faces no obvious threats from human activity and its range overlaps with several marine protected areas. This species has become a popular subject for display at public aquariums and resorts.

He was 17 years old when he joined his brother in London and, driven by an early interest in the cinema, began training at the YMCA. He made his first film appearance in 1955 as a boxer called Jamaica in Carol Reed's A Kid for Two Farthings. A year later, he appeared in the play Kismet at the Stoll Theatre in London, and had a role in Jean Genet's The Blacks in 1961 at the Royal Court Theatre.
Baird subsequently appeared mostly in film and television, though other stage work included A Wreath for Udomo (Lyric Hammersmith, 1961) and Ogodiveleftthegason (Royal Court, 1967).
His first lead role was as Atimbu, in the TV series White Hunter, in 1958. A series of stereotyped roles followed, in low-budget films featuring generic African or "jungle" themes. Baird's most high-profile role, however, came in Michael Relph and Basil Dearden's racial drama film Sapphire (1959). Prominent roles for black actors in Britain remained scarce, although he appeared in supporting roles in the TV series Danger Man and UFO (1970; as Lieutenant Bradley, a role that he left halfway through the series' run).
Baird's only true lead film role was in the 1968 Melvin Van Peebles drama The Story of a Three-Day Pass, in which he played an American soldier who falls in love with a white Parisian woman. Other roles included The Whisperers (1967), The Touchables (1968) (as a gay wrestler named Lillywhite), the horror film The Oblong Box (1969), and The Italian Job (1969) alongside his friend Michael Caine, whose wife, fellow Guyanese actor Shakira Baksh, Baird had appeared alongside in UFO.
His last appearance on screen was in Four of the Apocalypse (I quattro dell'apocalisse) in 1975.
In the 1970s, Baird was diagnosed with glaucoma, a condition that ultimately left him blind. He died of cancer in London in 2005.

Holiday for Lovers is a 1959 DeLuxe in CinemaScope comedy film directed by Henry Levin. Based on a 1957 play of the same title by Ronald Alexander, the film stars Clifton Webb, Jane Wyman, Jill St. John and Carol Lynley.
Plot
Robert Dean is an old-fashioned psychologist who reluctantly allows his oldest daughter Meg to join a four-week tour in South America before returning to college. When he learns that she is planning on six more weeks in São Paulo, he travels to Brazil, accompanied by his wife Mary and younger daughter Betsy. Upon arriving, Robert is displeased with the changes to Meg's character, as she has begun habits that are shocking to Robert, such as smoking. He mistakenly believes that Meg is interested in her older mentor Eduardo Barroso, but she is engaged to be married to Barroso's son Carlos.
Meanwhile, Betsy is enjoying the attention that she is receiving from members of the U.S. Air Force and falls in love with Sgt. Paul Gattling. Back at the hotel, Carlos is reluctant to meet Meg's parents, fearing that they will disapprove of his bohemian lifestyle. Carlos makes a horrible impression on Robert, who tries to prohibit Meg from seeing him by booking a flight for the family to Rio de Janeiro and then on to Lima.
Feeling betrayed by her father, Meg calls Carlos to tell him goodbye, but he responds by accusing her of leading her father's life. Carlos and Eduardo follow her to Lima, where Carlos and Meg are reunited at a bullfight. Paul, who has also come to Lima as well, proposes to Betsy, but she rejects him, explaining she is not ready to marry. Later that night, Eduardo and Carlos announce that they are returning to São Paulo the following day. Robert reluctantly allows his daughter to accompany Carlos.
After bidding Meg farewell, Robert visits a bar, gets drunk and falls unconscious on the street, where he is mistaken for a member of a Spanish tour group. When he awakes, Robert finds himself on a plane bound for Madrid, and he is eventually dropped off in Trinidad. There, he phones Meg to offer his sincere blessing to marry Carlos, but she announces that she no longer loves Carlos.
Betsy asks Robert for permission to wed Paul, but her father declares that she is old enough to make her own decisions. She then becomes officially engaged to Paul.

Production
In March 1957, 20th Century Fox bought the rights to the play, which had premiered a month earlier. Gene Tierney was initially set to star as Mrs. Mary Dean, but she withdrew at the last minute because of illness. In February 1959, the studio negotiated with Joan Fontaine to replace her, but Fontaine collapsed and Jane Wyman was finally assigned the role.
In August 1957, Suzy Parker was cast in a role, but she eventually withdrew. The role of Meg was originally offered in January 1959 to Diane Varsi, but she refused it and abandoned her contract with 20th Century Fox only months later. Diane Baker was announced as her replacement, but the role eventually went to Jill St. John.
Background shots were filmed on location in early 1959. Most of the filming took place in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Los Angeles International Airport, Lockheed Airport and Clover Field.
Reception
In a contemporary review for The New York Times, critic Bosley Crowther called the character of Robert Dean a "disgustingly old-fashioned creature" and panned the film: "It is a thoroughly silly story, which is not in the least improved by the wishy-washy acting of everyone involved. ... [Y]ou have to endure a lot of nonsense from this synthetic family and the people they meet. Obviously, it would have been better if these Yanks had stayed at home."
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette offered lukewarm praise for the film as being "light, frothy and splendidly photographed" but singled out Carol Lynley's performance: "[P]ert little Miss Carol Lynley easily steals the show. Her bright-eyed view of the world around her is utterly infectious. She walks, talks and otherwise behaves like the teenager she is, with a most refreshing lack of artificiality. What is even more remarkable, Miss Lynley manages all this despite the almost incredible obstacle presented by having to play opposite the hopelessly untalented Mr. Gary Crosby impersonating a sergeant."

Butere Girls High School is a girls only public boarding secondary school in Butere, Kenya.
History
Butere Girls High School grew out of a primary school founded by the Irish missionary Jane Elizabeth Chadwick, who arrived in Butere in 1916 and taught there until 1925, when she returned to Ireland. Some of Chadwick's manuscript memories of her early students have been anthologized. The school became a full day school in 1931 and then a boarding school in 1937. The future archbishop Festo Olang' taught at Butere in the early 1940s.
In 1957 it became a secondary school. At that time the school was regarded as a leading Protestant girls' high school, ranked second in Kenya after Alliance Girls High School. In 1970 it admitted its first A level class. After facing infrastructure, management and discipline problems in the 1980s its academic performance deteriorated. However, its performance recovered and in 2012 the school was promoted to national school category.
In 2013 the school presented a controversial play, Shackles of Doom, by the playwright and future senator Cleophas Malala. The play, which addressed the issues of ethnicity, tribalism and inequality in Kenya, was banned by the Ministry of Education, though the ban was later lifted by the High Court. In 2018 the school's performance of another play by Mabala, It is Well, earned them first place at Western Region Drama Festival.
In 2016 the principal, Dorah Okalo, was removed from office after pressure from the Bishop of Butere.
In February 2019 a Form Three student committed suicide at the school.

Nariman is a 2001 Indian Malayalam-language investigative film directed by K. Madhu and written by S. N. Swamy. It stars Suresh Gopi in the title role, with Samyuktha Varma, Siddique, Jagadish, Sadiq, Vijayakumar, Janardhanan, Jagathy Sreekumar, Spadikam George, N. F. Varghese and Rajan P. Dev in supporting roles. The plot follows Ashok Nariman, a Crime Branch DySP who is assigned to re-investigate the "couple murder case" and then to investigate the "Ammini missing case". The film was dubbed in Hindi as Farz Ki Pukaar and in Telugu as Senathipathi.
Plot
Manu (Vijayakumar), the accused in the notorious couple murder case, attempts an escape during his prison transfer but end up being shot. Although severely wounded, he survives despite being showered with bullets by the police. Dr. Giri (N. F. Varghese), a senior surgeon take pity on the escaped criminal who is to be hanged for his crime. Manu is accused to having murdered his elder brother (Ashokan) and sister-in-law out of lust for the latter, in an attempted rape. For various reasons Dr. Giri believes Manu to be innocent. He convinces his friend Shekharan (Janardhanan), the Chief Minister of Kerala , to re-open the case and assign the case to a sincere and brilliant, yet aggressive police officer Ashok Nariman (Suresh Gopi).
Initially termed "hopeless" by the legal advisors — due to the excellent way the case was framed — Nariman find loopholes . He learns that the crime was committed by the intelligent Adv. Padhmanabhan Thampi (Siddique) and his friends Kochunarayanan (Jagathy Sreekumar), Superintendent of Police (SP) Philippose (Spadikam George) and their allies including Musthafa Kamal (a.k.a. Karate Kamal) (Bheeman Raghu) — who executed the crime. Nariman submit his report and the case comes to the Sessions Court. To everyone's dismay, the Judge refuses to have a second hearing of the case — as earlier the case had gone up to Supreme Court awarding capital punishment and even the President of India did not have any pity on the "perpetrator" Manu so as to pardon his sentence. The Judge believes the case to be a publicity stunt as the result of the change in Government and the Court cannot be deceived by any.
Disappointed at the happenings, Nariman takes over a new case — Ammini missing case. Ammini (Anju) was an ally, a prostitute, a pimp and an outlet for the illegal liquor dealings of Kochunarayanan. Lately she had a change of mind, to retreat from her wrong way of life, to be with her daughter who hated Ammini's activities. This provoked Adv. Thampi, as she knew many of their secrets, even to an extent more than they know of each other. He even had suspicion of her being the reason for the police storming the secret hide-out of Kamal. Nariman reports the four guilty of murder and the case reaches the same Sessions Court. The four were found to be guilty by Court, even with an experienced senior lawyer (Adv. Vaikuntam (Rajan P. Dev)) appearing for them against the inexperienced public prosecutor Adv. Sethulekshmi (Samyuktha Varma), the love interest of Nariman.
While the Judge (Kozhikode Narayanan Nair) reads his judgement, Nariman — to everyone's surprise — interrupt the Judge to say the four are innocent. He presents Ammini, the very same Ammini that the Court declared dead. He confesses his act on how the four became 'culprits' and how the case was framed using strong, but fake evidences (as in the couple murder case) that not even an experienced lawyer could expose. If an average police officer could easily deceive the Court, he exclaims what will happen if an evil genius with a group of powerful allies sets out on a rampage. If the Court, where common people seek justice, fails to stop them then there would be a state of anarchy where people won't hesitate to act worse. Through his drama, he pleads justice for Manu.
Although initially furious with his actions, the Judge realizes that the Court can be deceived at times and allows for a second hearing in Manu's case. Through the proceedings months after, Manu is found innocent by the Court and the guilty quadruplet — Adv. Thampi, Kochunarayanan, Philipose and Kamal — get their punishment.

The curl-crested araçari or curly-crested aracari (Pteroglossus beauharnaisii) is a species of bird in the family Ramphastidae, the toucans. The species was first described by Johann Georg Wagler in 1831.
Description
It measures long and weighs . On account of its relatively long tail and curly crest (the latter only visible up close), it was formerly placed in the monotypic genus Beauharnaisius.
Distribution and habitat
The curl-crested aracari is found in the south-western section of the Amazon Basin, with the Amazon River being its northern range limit. Near the Amazon River, its range extends east to about the Madeira River, while in the southern half of its range it extends east to the Xingu River. It is generally rare to uncommon, but regularly seen at several localities, including the Tambopata National Reserve in Peru, the Noel Kempff Mercado National Park in Bolivia, and the Cristalino State Park near Alta Floresta in Brazil. Its natural habitat is tropical moist lowland forests.
Behaviour
It is primarily a frugivore, but will also take nestlings of birds such as the yellow-rumped cacique.
Status and conservation
Due to its extensive range, it is considered to be of the least concern by BirdLife International and consequently the IUCN.
Gallery
Aviculture
The curl-crested aracari is a popular pet toucan and the most frequently kept 'small toucan' after the green aracari. It requires a large cage for its size, as well as several perches and toys due to its active nature. Curl crested aracaris like all toucans, need a high-fruit diet which without they are susceptible to a disease of excessive iron storage.

Kayak Bay () is a bay, wide, on the inner (west) side of Pampa Passage, indenting the east coast of Brabant Island in the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica north of Momino Point and south of Bov Point. Malpighi Glacier and Mackenzie Glacier flow into the bay.
The feature was roughly mapped in 1898 by the Belgian Antarctic Expedition. It was mapped in greater detail by Argentine expeditions from 1947–48 onward and included as part of "Bahia Pampa" (now Pampa Passage). This bay was so named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1986 in reference to the sea canoes of the British Joint Services Expedition that passed through the bay on a circumnavigation of Brabant Island in February 1985.

Keith Webber (5 January 1943 – 26 September 1983) was a Welsh footballer.
Playing career
Webber began his playing days with Barry Town before signing for Everton as a 17-year-old in 1960. He scored on his first-team debut for the Goodison Park club in a Football League Cup tie against Walsall, but he was to make just four appearances in The Football League for them before moving to Brighton & Hove Albion in April 1963 in a £9,000 deal.
After a year at Brighton and then a two-year stint at Wrexham, Webber moved to Doncaster Rovers in June 1966 before joining Chester in June 1969. In his two-year spell at Sealand Road, Webber helped Chester reach the 1970 Welsh Cup final before losing to Cardiff City, a fate he had also suffered when playing for Wrexham five years earlier.
Webber ended his professional career with Stockport County in 1971–72 before going on to play in Non-League football for Morecambe, Northwich Victoria, Oswestry Town and Rhyl.
Work and Death
After finishing his professional playing career, Webber became an insurance salesman and then the licensee of the Grosvenor Arms pub in Handbridge, Chester and later the White Lion in Buckley. Unfortunately, ill health left to him leaving the licensed trade and he took up a position with a finance company.
Webber died aged just 40 from a heart attack at his home in Marford, Wrexham while watching television on 26 September 1983.

My Science Project is a 1985 American teen science fiction comedy film directed by Jonathan R. Betuel. It followed on heels of other teen sci-fi/comedy films released the same year, such as Back to the Future, Real Genius, and Weird Science, though it did not perform as well as those films.
Plot
In 1957, the United States military secures a crashed UFO in a hangar bay. President Dwight D. Eisenhower (Robert Beer) enters to see the craft and simply orders his men to "get rid of it".
In 1985, a high school senior named Michael Harlan (John Stockwell), whose only interest is muscle cars, reluctantly searches for something to turn in for his science class project final. While on what his bookworm friend Ellie Sawyer (Danielle von Zerneck) thinks is a date, Michael breaks into a government aircraft boneyard and stumbles upon a hidden fallout shelter. There, he finds a glowing, plasma globe-like piece of scientific equipment and grabs it just as a military guard approaches and chases him away.
The next day, Michael cleans up the device in auto shop class and unwittingly activates it, causing it to leech power from a nearby boombox. His friend, Vince Latello (Fisher Stevens), tries to talk him out of attaching the device to an automotive battery, whereupon the device emits a swirl of colorful energy that manifests into an Ancient Greek vase as the battery melts. The two leave the auto shop for their next class, but soon realize they inexplicably lost two hours of time and missed their final science exam.
After more strange occurrences with the machine, Michael takes the device, referred to as "the gizmo", to his ex-hippie science teacher Dr. Roberts (Dennis Hopper). Believing it is a portal to another dimension, he plugs it into an electrical outlet. While bathing in the cosmic energy of the gizmo and contemplating the wonders of the universe, Roberts suddenly disappears, leaving behind his peace symbol medallion. Michael is unable to disconnect the machine from the outlet and decides his only solution is to destroy the power lines leading to town.
Michael and Vince obtain dynamite from the backroom of a hardware store owned by Michael's father (Barry Corbin), and race to outrun a wave of energy traveling along the lines before it reaches the local power plant. They blow up a tower, stopping the wave and causing a blackout, but upon returning to town are arrested for Dr. Roberts' disappearance. Michael calls Ellie and asks her to go to the school to retrieve the gizmo, hoping to prove his innocence by showing it to the police. At the school, she runs into Sherman (Raphael Sbarge), an obnoxious nerd, who hooks the gizmo up to the outlet again, creating a massive time warp over the school and causing a blackout in town, allowing Vince and Michael to escape the police. Returning to the school, they find the whole building consumed in a vortex of space/time as objects and people from the past and future manifest around them and a crazed Sherman, who fears the world is ending and tells them that Ellie is in danger.
Dragging Sherman along, Mike and Vince grab weapons from a platoon of fallen Vietnam War soldiers and make their way to the science lab, battling a T. rex in the gymnasium and a mob of post-apocalypse mutants along the way. They reach Ellie and successfully deactivate the gizmo, causing time to return to normal just as emergency crews and police show up. Moments later, Dr. Roberts reappears, rejoicing in an unexpected trip to Woodstock, and proudly gives Michael an "A" grade on his science project under the condition that he gets rid of the machine, saying it's not something mankind is ready for. Roberts is then arrested by the local sheriff (Richard Masur), who thinks he blew up the power lines - as Michael had accidentally left Robert's peace medallion at the hardware store.
As promised, Michael returns the gizmo back to the junkyard where he found it. On the way back, the car runs out of gas and he and Ellie leave it by the side of the road; in contrast to his previous devotion to it, he says "It's just a car."
International release
The distributors of the movie in Sweden thought it should be marketed as a mix of Ghostbusters and Back to the Future. It was subsequently renamed TimeBusters.
Reception
The film holds a rating of 11% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 9 reviews.
New York Times critic Stephen Holden wrote on August 10, 1985; "My Science Project is a cheerful teen-age adventure film that in its snappier moments resembles a far less clever and less expensive Back to the Future. Despite a plot that has few interesting twists and a shoestring budget, the film glimmers with moments of drollery."
Box office
The film was not a success. On its first weekend, it only peaked at #14 with $1,504,118, averaging $1,499 per theater. It ended grossing $4,122,748 in domestic box-office in its two-week run.

Elam Ives Jr. (1802–1864) was a New England-based music teacher whose work with William Channing Woodbridge helped introduce the ideas of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi into music education in the United States. His work also influenced Lowell Mason, whose work with Woodbridge eventually led to music education being introduced into the public schools of Boston.
Early life and career
Little is known of Ives' early life. He was born to Elam Ives Sr., and Sarah Hitchcock Ives in Hamden, Connecticut, on 7 January 1802. He married Louisa Todd of Hamden on 15 April 1822, at which time he was already working as a singing teacher and choir director. He later moved to New Haven and then to Hartford sometime before 19 October 1827, when he was hired by the Christ Church there to teach music.
Ives worked with a friend and fellow musician, Deodatus Dutton, on a collection of hymn tunes called American Psalmody which also contained singing instructions by Ives.
Work with William Channing Woodbridge
In 1829, a fellow citizen of Hartford, William Channing Woodbridge, returned from Europe, where he had been studying methods of education, and where he had spent time with Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, Philipp Emanuel von Fellenberg, Michael Traugott Pfeiffer, and Hans Georg Nägeli. Upon returning to the United States, he wanted to use the methods he had seen in Europe to improve music teaching. He was friends with Dutton, who placed him in contact with Ives. Woodbridge provided Ives with books and materials by Nägeli, Pfeiffer, and Georg Friedrich Kübler, who then translated them with the help of Dutton and a Mr. Taylor from Andover.
Woodbridge by this time had become associated with Lowell Mason, a music teacher in Boston. He sent Mason to Hartford to work with Ives on the method. According to Ives, both had concerns about the method, but chose to proceed. After studying the Swiss works, and incorporating them into his teaching method, Ives put together an experimental choir of about 70 children during the summer of 1830. The choir evidently sang very well and word of its success was spread by Woodbridge to Boston and elsewhere.
Work with Lowell Mason
During this same summer, Ives was working on a revision of the instruction portion of American Psalmody that would reflect the Pestalozzian-based ideas promoted by Woodbridge. He also began work on The American Elementary Singing Book that same year. Additionally, he began working with Mason on Juvenile Lyre, a collection of three-part children's songs, published in 1831. This collection consisted primarily of arrangements of songs by Nägeli and Pfeiffer, with some original compositions. There has been some debate over who wrote what in Juvenile Lyre; it appears that the Preface and final song, "Suffer Little Children to Come unto Me", are definitely by Mason, while many of the arrangements were done by Ives with versification of the German texts by Dutton. Other songs were originals by one of the composers, several with texts by Sarah Josepha Hale.
Philadelphia and New York
Ives left Hartford for Philadelphia late in 1830, where he established the Philadelphia Musical Seminary. There, he taught violin, pianoforte, and singing. He also continued writing singing manuals and collections music, including materials for the American Sunday School Union. He also made a major revision of American Psalmody, removing most of the Pestalozzian elements introduced in the second edition.
Ives moved from Philadelphia to New York in 1836, where he started another musical academy. He continued publishing music collections with appended instruction manuals and an entire series intended specifically to help students learn to read music and sing. While in New York, Ives spent some time writing essays and periodical articles. He edited The Musical Review during its one year run in 1838-39. He also wrote four articles for The Harbinger, a transcendentalist journal, beginning in 1847. Most of this writing concerned musical events, music educators, and music education materials.
In both Philadelphia and New York, Ives wrote parlor songs, though he was not a remarkable composer. Their difficulty and complexity do seem to indicate the quality of singers and pianists he was producing in his academies, though.
Late career and death
Ives moved to Trenton, New Jersey, sometime before 1857. He lived there with his second wife, Lucy, and daughter, Ella. As in Philadelphia and New York, Ives established an academy of music.
At some point, Ives returned to his hometown of Hamden, Connecticut. He died there of apoplexy on 10 February 1864.

Jo Mapes (July 20, 1931 - February 2, 2018) was an American folk singer, songwriter, critic and writer. She was prominent in the folk music revival of the 1950s and 1960s and later became an advertising copywriter and nightclub critic for the Sun-Times in Chicago.
Life
She was born Joanne Claire Coombs in Chicago, and moved to Los Angeles with her mother when in her teens. At Thomas Starr King Junior High School she was friendly with Odetta Felious, and developed a love of folk songs. In the early 1950s she began singing and playing guitar in folk clubs, and in 1955 she appeared on the TV talent show Chance of a Lifetime. She moved to San Francisco in 1957, and later to New York City, and performed in clubs and concert venues around the country.
Mapes was described by Shel Silverstein as "the best female folk singer and guitar player around, with unique singing style and stage presence." She was featured in the pilot episode of the ABC TV series Hootenanny in 1962, and later appeared in several episodes of the show. She recorded albums for Kapp Records, including The Hootenanny Star (1962), as well as appearing on several Hootenanny compilations. She also wrote songs including "Come On In", recorded by The Association, The Monkees, and others; and "Come and Open Your Eyes", recorded by Spanky and Our Gang. In 1964 she released And You Were On My Mind on the short-lived FM label set up by Pete Kameron and Monte Kay, but the company went bankrupt before the album could be distributed.
In 1964 she married banjoist Fleming Brown. She retired from performing after a farewell concert at Carnegie Hall, and settled in Chicago to raise a family. She taught at the Old Town School of Folk Music, and then worked as an award-winning copywriter, producer and jingle writer in the advertising industry, her clients including Kodak, United Airlines and Kellogg's; she provided the song for a Raisin Bran commercial. From 1968 to 1978 she worked as entertainment critic, columnist, and feature writer at the Chicago Sun-Times, and in 1986 she helped set up Artists In Evidence, a club associated with the Artists In Residence apartment building. More recently she has occasionally performed at clubs in Chicago.

Brigadier Ian MacAlister Stewart, 13th Laird of Achnacone, (17 October 1895 – 14 March 1987) was a Scottish military officer who served in the British Army during both the First and Second World Wars. Known for his eccentric training methods, he commanded the 2nd Battalion of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, which participated in the Malayan campaign and the Battle of Singapore during the Second World War.
Early life
Stewart was born on 17 October 1895, part of the Stewart family of Appin in Argyllshire. His place of birth, in Surore, Poona, India, was where his father, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Kenneth Stewart, 12th of Achnacone, was a medical officer in the Poona Horse before his parents returned to Scotland. Stewart attended Cheltenham College before going to Sandhurst on a prize cadetship. He passed through Sandhurst in 1913 as the top student of his year, and the youngest.
First World War
Stewart was commissioned into the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in February 1914 and on 11 August of that year became the first British soldier to land on French soil and the first to be mentioned in a despatch. He served throughout the First World War and was highly decorated, earning the Military Cross and Bar, and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. At the end of the war, Stewart was a temporary captain. He became heir to Achnacone after his older brother, Captain Alexander D.L. Stewart, died in a motorcycle accident in Dublin in 1919.
As with many army officers between the wars, Stewart was placed on half pay, but was restored to full pay as a captain on 3 June 1925. On 8 September 1931, Stewart was promoted to major. Stewart's military career was dominated by his service with the Argylls, a regiment to which he was so wedded that when he was given command of the 2nd Battalion in the 1930s some of his brother officers did not even realise that he was married with a daughter. Stewart had married Ursula Morely-Fletcher in 1937 when he was 42 years old. He even refused a position at the Staff College, Camberley to remain with his battalion, thereby losing the only way to senior command.
Second World War
At the outbreak of the Second World War Stewart was still in command of the 2nd Battalion of the Argylls. Stewart was one of the few British officers to realise the need for training in jungle warfare that would be necessary in order to defeat the Japanese in a war in Malaya. Due to this obsession with jungle training Stewart earned himself a reputation as a crank amongst the more traditional minded officers of Malaya Command. In early 1941, after his battalion had been transferred from India to Malaya, Stewart began rigorously training his men and developing new tactics to fight in all of the extreme and hostile natural terrain of Malaya. When the 2nd Argylls were thrown into the battle in early December 1941, the battalion was one of the few effective units the Japanese would face in their rapid advance down the peninsula, inflicting heavy casualties in every engagement. The Argylls' effectiveness meant that the battalion was continuously used as the buffer and suffered heavy casualties as a result.
Stewart was temporarily given command of the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade after Brigadier Archibald Paris took over the 11th Indian Infantry Division in late December 1941. He was in command of this brigade during the disastrous Battle of Slim River, where the Argylls suffered their worst casualties. When the Battle of Malaya finally ended and the surviving Allied soldiers retreated across the causeway onto Singapore Island, Stewart and his batman, Drummer Hardy, were the last to cross.
Plymouth Argylls
Stewart was soon returned to his beloved Argylls in Singapore after they had been decimated in the fighting on the mainland. The 250 surviving Argylls were reformed with 210 Royal Marines, survivors from the sinking of and , becoming known as the Plymouth Argylls. Stewart had six days to train the new composite battalion before it was put into action on Singapore Island itself. The Plymouth Argylls suffered heavy casualties during the brief Battle of Singapore. Stewart was evacuated unwillingly from Singapore before its surrender due to the need for experienced officers and men who had proven ability to fight the Japanese Army, an ability rare in the British Army at this time. By the time of the surrender on 15 February, the Plymouth Argylls were reduced to 40 officers and men.
What was left of the Plymouth Argyll Battalion, under the command of three captains, were marched into captivity behind their piper. According to some witnesses hundreds of other British Empire soldiers stood to attention as they marched past. Only 52 Argylls managed to escape before Singapore surrendered and make it to Ceylon. Many others were killed or captured when the ships they were escaping on were sunk by Japanese surface and air attack.
Later commands
On 23 January 1942, Stewart was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his services in the South West Pacific area. He was initially employed as a General Staff Officer Grade 1 in India, lecturing on his experiences in Malaya. Officers with jungle warfare experience who had actually fought the Japanese and seen their tactics in action were in high demand by the army command in India. Of the officers to have escaped from Singapore, Stewart was one of the most experienced. He became the Chief Instructor at the School of Infantry as a colonel, and later Brigadier General Staff (Training) with 11th Army Group in India. Of Stewart, Field Marshal Archibald Wavell wrote:
Stewart's report, written after his arrival in India, and his knowledge along with that of the other officers and men who escaped from Singapore, had a direct effect on the training and tactics that would be used by the British and Commonwealth Armies in fighting the Japanese throughout the rest of the war. Stewart returned to the United Kingdom in early 1945, being given command of the 144th Infantry Brigade on 19 March. He spent a period of time as the District Commander for Stirling, the home of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders.
Retirement
Stewart retired from the army on 13 April 1947 at the age of 52, a short time after the death of his father. Stewart was a substantive colonel on retirement but was awarded the honorary rank of brigadier. Stewart wrote the book The Thin Red Line, 2nd Argylls in Malaya (Thomas Nelson, 1947), which was reprinted by the Argyll and Sutherland Regimental Museum. He became well known in the Scottish farming community, and became President of the National Farmers Union of Scotland.
Stewart died on 14 March 1987 at the age of 91. His funeral was well attended, with Major Eric Moss as the piper (Moss was Pipe Major of Stewart's 2nd Argylls in Malaya). The address was given by Lord Maclean of Duart.

Area codes 937 and 326 are telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) assigned to a numbering plan area (NPA) that encompasses much of the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Ohio, including Dayton and Springfield. Area code 937 was established in September 1996, after a split of area code 513. Area code 326 was added to area code 937 in an overlay plan in March 2020.
History
Area code 937 was created in a split of Ohio's original NPA for the southwestern part of the state (area code 513) on September 28, 1996. At the time, literature promoting the new area code took advantage of the fact that the digits of 937 spells out "YES" on a standard telephone keypad.
As of April 2018, projections by the North American Numbering Plan Administrator expected that telephone exchanges ("central office codes") would be exhausted for area code 937 by the third quarter of 2020, so on July 3, 2018, area code 326 (which spells out "DAO" as in "DAyton, Ohio") was planned to overlay the 937 area. Beginning August 10, 2019, subscribers were encouraged to dial ten digits for local calls within the area code. On February 8, 2020, traditional seven-digit dialing ended. Customers attempting such calls receive an intercept message. On March 8, 2020, area code 326 was activated.
Communities
Area codes 937 and 326 serve Dayton, its metropolitan area, Springfield, public (non-Defense Switched Network) communications at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, a few outer eastern suburbs of Cincinnati, and most southwest Ohio north and east of the Cincinnati metropolitan area.
Communities served with a 2019 population greater than 10,000, and those that are county seats, include Beavercreek, Bellefontaine, Centerville, Clayton, Dayton, Eaton, Englewood, Fairborn, Franklin, Georgetown, Greenville, Hillsboro, Huber Heights, Kettering, Marysville, Miamisburg, Piqua, Riverside, Sidney, Springboro, Springfield, Tipp City, Trotwood, Troy, Urbana, Vandalia, West Carrollton, West Union, Wilmington and Xenia.
Counties covered include all or parts of Adams, Brown, Champaign, Clark, Clermont, Clinton, Darke, Greene, Hardin, Highland, Logan, Madison, Miami, Montgomery, Preble, Ross, Scioto, Shelby, Union and Warren.

Production
Development
In October 2020, it was reported that Phineas & Ferb and Milo Murphy's Law co-creator Dan Povenmire was developing a new animated series with a 20-episode order for Disney Channel, titled Hamster & Gretel, with Disney Television Animation producing. Povenmire first pitched the show as an animatic in 2019, with him providing all the voices. The character of Hamster originated from a drawing he did on his sketchboard during development on the Disney+ film Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Candace Against the Universe (2020). It was later refined whilst Povenmire was on a vacation with his family in Aruba. The series marks Povenmire's first project as showrunner without Jeff "Swampy" Marsh, due to the latter developing projects of his own after creating his own studio. However, Marsh will still have a recurring voice role as various characters on the series. In September 2021, Joanna Hausmann joined the series as its head writer, co-producer, and story editor. Povenmire approached her after listening to Haunsman talking about her experiences as a Venezuelan, as he felt she could bring authenticity to the series' Venezuelan representation. In June 2022, it was announced that ten additional episodes had been ordered, bringing the total episode number to 30.
Writing
Writing for Hamster & Gretel began by October 2020. It was done remotely due to Disney TVA's closure during the COVID-19 pandemic. The series was based on Povenmire's dynamic with his much younger sister, which he felt had never been portrayed on TV before; director Amber T. Hollinger described the relationship between Kevin and Gretel as the series' main focus, with the Kevin's arc centering on his role as an older brother after Gretel receives her powers. Povenmire also drew inspiration from his family for the characters Kevin and Gretel. The series features Venezuelan lead characters; this was inspired by both Hausmann and Povenmire's wife being Venezuelan. The series also incorporated several Venezuelan Easter eggs.
The series is set in the same universe as Phineas and Ferb and Milo Murphy's Law, with characters from both shows making cameos throughout Hamster and Gretel. However, Povenmire noted there were no plans for a formal crossover in the series, unlike Milo Murphy's Law.
Animation
Snipple Animation and Synergy Animation both provide animation services for the series; work on the first episodes finished by May 2022. Episodes are produced simultaneously at different stages, with some in pre-production and others in post-production. The series will feature action sequences that have more cinematic quality than Phineas and Ferb and Milo Murphy's Law.
Music
Similar to his previous work, Povenmire wrote songs for the series. The soundtrack was released the day of the series' premiere.
Episodes
Shorts
Theme Song Takeover
As part of a promotional campaign, Disney Channel began airing the Disney Theme Song Takeover wherein supporting characters from different shows performed the theme song to the series they were in.
Chibi Tiny Tales
Chibi Tiny Tales is a series of shorts that depict characters from various Disney Channel properties in chibi-style animation. In September 2022, the series began releasing shorts based around Hamster & Gretel.
Release
Hamster & Gretel premiered on Disney Channel on August 12, 2022. The first five episodes of the series were added to Disney+ on August 17, resulting in episodes 3-5 being released ahead of their televised premieres.

Leslie Wayne (born 1953, Landstuhl, Germany) is a visual artist who lives and works in New York. Wayne is best known for her "highly dimensional paintings".
Early life and education
Leslie Wayne was born in Landstühl, Germany, to American parents and grew up in Los Angeles and Newport Beach. At the age of 7, she was taking private art lessons and attended classes on the weekends throughout high school. Her first two years of undergraduate work at the University of California, Santa Barbara's College of Creative Studies focused on the figure, plein-air landscapes, and printmaking. She created a suite of etchings and aquatints based on the photographs of Jacques Henri Lartigue, with whom she had begun a correspondence.
Wayne moved to Paris and lived there from 1974 to 1975, where she attended French classes at the Alliance Française, and continued to paint on her own and in various small ateliers. At the Alliance Française, Wayne met an Israeli man, with whom she developed a relationship. After having returned to California, she moved to Israel in 1975 to live with him and stayed there until 1980. In Israel, she continued to paint and explore other creative outlets, including ceramics and children's book illustration. Wayne returned to Southern California in 1980 and two years later moved to New York City, where she enrolled in Parsons School of Design. At Parsons, Wayne became a sculpture major and studied with Ronald Bladen and Don Porcaro, whom she later married in 1987. She graduated with honors, with a BFA in sculpture in 1984.
Work
Early work
Wayne's early work was driven by a focus on technique and observation. Her inspiration came from French Impressionism, particularly the paintings of Van Gogh, Lautrec and Manet, and the photographs of Jacques Henri Lartigue. Only after her classes at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière, did she first venture into abstraction.
Wayne had her first solo show at the Jerusalem Theatre Gallery in 1979 of works that were inspired by Georgia O'Keeffe's desert landscape paintings. Returning to California, she continued to paint plein-air landscapes. With the hills of Laguna Beach as her source, Wayne developed a deep love for and identification with the landscape and geology of the Western United States.
New York
Wayne moved to New York City in 1982 and transferred to Parsons School of Design. While a student there, she focused on sculpture, and was inspired by the work of David Smith. After graduation, Wayne returned to painting, developing a minimalist abstract style inspired by the many trips she and her husband, sculptor Don Porcaro made to the Southwest. She exhibited these works in her first New York solo show at 55 Mercer Street Gallery. Although this show resulted in the attention of the New York art scene, Wayne longed for the creative excitement she felt when she was making sculpture. Experimenting in her studio, Wayne began challenging the physical limitations of paint, resulting in a style that became the central focus of her career. In 1992 she received a fellowship to the renown artist's colony, Yaddo where she worked on refining her new approach, and showed these paintings at 55 Mercer Gallery later that year. Based on the success of that show, she was invited to join Jack Shainman Gallery, where she continues to be represented.
Wayne's works, hybrids of sculpture and painting, range from small scale to larger multi-paneled and shaped paintings. Wayne's themes explore the intersection of abstraction and figuration and forms in nature, as well as perception and the relationship between object and image by engaging and challenging the conventional notions of the painting medium.
Career
Wayne had her first two New York solo shows at 55 Mercer Street Gallery in 1990 and 1992. In 1993 she joined Jack Shainman Gallery and had her first solo show that year.
Throughout the late 1990s and into the 2000s Wayne exhibited with L.A. Louver in Los Angeles, Solomon Projects in Atlanta, GA, Byron Cohen Gallery for Contemporary Art in Kansas City, MO and Galerie Bugdahn und Kaimer in Düsseldorf, Germany.
Her work was featured in the 44th Biennial Exhibition of Contemporary American Painting: Painting Outside Painting, curated by Terrie Sultan for the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in 1995.
In 2002, an installation of sixty of Wayne's paintings inaugurated the new Samuel Dorsky Museum of Art in New Paltz, NY as part of an installation with 60 of Porcaro's small scale sculptures. The show was expanded in 2004, becoming a survey of her and Porcaro's work from the previous decade. Titled "The Object of Time: Charting A Decade", the exhibition traveled to the University Gallery at the University of Florida in Gainesville, the Crossley Gallery at the Ringling School of Art and Design, and the Red Gallery at the Savannah College of Art and Design.
In 2011, the Halsey Institute of Contemporary Art at the College of Charleston mounted a five-year survey of Wayne's recent work. A catalogue and video interview accompanied the exhibition. The show traveled to the Visual Arts Center of Richmond, the Joseloff Gallery at the University of Hartford and the Foosaner Art Museum. In 2014, the Abroms Engel Institute of Contemporary Art at the University of Alabama inaugurated their newly opened museum with a survey of Wayne's paintings entitled "Mind The Gap."
Wayne's work is in many public collections throughout the United States and abroad, including the Birmingham Museum of Art, Birmingham, AL; The Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, NYC; The Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; Collezione Maramotti, Reggio Emilia, Italy; the Davis Museum, Wellesley, MA; Fondation Cartier pour l'Art Contemporain, Paris, France; Harvard University Business School Schwartz Art Collection, Cambridge, MA; Colección Jumex, Mexico City, Mexico; Neuberger Museum of Art, Purchase, NY; The Parrish Art Museum, Watermill, NY; Portland Museum of Art, Portland, OR; The Miami Museum of Contemporary Art, Miami, FL; and Reed College Special Collections Library, Portland, OR, among others.
Her exhibitions have been reviewed and featured in The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, Artforum, ARTnews, Art in America, Art & Antiques, The New Yorker, New York Newsday, The Philadelphia Inquirer, Art Papers, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the San Francisco Chronicle, The Kansas City Star, The Wichita Eagle, The Guardian, the New Art Examiner, The Washington Times, The Washington Post, and the Chicago Tribune, as well as journals and publications abroad.
Wayne is also an occasional writer. Her interviews of fellow artists include Sharon Butler, Lisa Corinne Davis, Lesley Dill, Beverly Fishman, Beatrice Pediconi, Elise Siegel, Elena Sisto, Monica Majoli, Medrie MacPhee and Barbara Takenaga, and have been published in the online art magazines, Artcritical, BOMB and Two Coats of Paint.
Wayne has had 12 solo exhibitions with Jack Shainman Gallery since 1993, including her most recent 2021 exhibition entitled "The Universe is on the Inside."
Awards
Wayne is a member of the National Academy of Design (class of 2016) and currently serves as Vice Chair of their Board of Governors. Other honors and awards include the New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship in Painting (2018, 2006), a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Award in Fine Arts (2017), Joan Mitchell Foundation Artist's Grant (2012), Buhl Foundation Award for Abstract Photography (2004), Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation Artist's Grant (1994), Hillwood Art Museum/New York State Council on the Arts Projects Residency Grant (1993), Yaddo Artist's Residency Fellowship (1992), Change Inc.

Ernest John Austin (31 December 1874 – 24 July 1947) was an English composer, music arranger and editor. Although little-remembered today (he does not even have an entry in the comprehensive New Grove dictionary), Austin's orchestral music enjoyed some success in its own time, including performances at the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts and on BBC Radio during the 1920s. He was a prolific composer of songs, covering a wide spectrum of mood, from serious Shakespearean settings to ballads of both sentimental and robust natures. He found some success writing piano pieces and unison songs for children. He also made piano transcriptions of the work of other composers, a particularly common practice of the time.
Life and works
He was born Ernest John Austin in Poplar, London (now in the borough of Tower Hamlets), the son of Elizabeth and William Austin, a shirt tailor. Ernest Austin was the younger brother of baritone and composer Frederic Austin (1872–1951).
He first worked for the Board of Trade and then pursued a career in business. Largely self-taught, by 1902 he had composed a piano sextet (first performed in 1910) and by the age of about 30 he had turned to music as a career. He worked as a copy-editor and reviser for the London music publisher Robert Elkin (Elkin & Co.), where he edited some of Cyril Scott's piano works for publication. According to Austin, Scott's manuscripts were not always legible, and "the published result was occasionally his personal 'best guess' as to the intentions of the composer."
He gave a concert of his own works in November 1908 in Wallington, London, including two Piano Trios (No. 2, Op.15, and No. 4), his brother Frederic Austin singing some songs along with Miss Grainger-Kerr (also a proponent of Cyril Scott's vocal works); a Piano Trio was also performed in November 1909. Austin was described as being "well known as an apostle of modernism" in a review of his Songs From The Highway, also published in 1909: "In his case the tendency manifests itself in the form of indefinite tonality and rhythm. 'Love's Tragedy', for instance, [...] is practically unbarred, and the accentuation is left to the discrimination of the singer, with whom it is to be hoped the accompanist will be in sympathy."
He had a passable baritone voice, and performed Norman O'Neill's setting of Keat's La Belle Sans Merci for baritone and orchestra at the Queen's Hall on 27 January 1910.
Another concert devoted to his own piano works and songs was given at St. James's Hall, London in November 1910; the solo pianist was Ernest Lees, the singers were Cecily Gleeson-White, Miss Grainger-Kerr, William Higley (who sang the title role in The Flying Dutchman at the Proms in 1905) and Frederic Austin, accompanied by Harold Brooke (professional pianist and editor at Novello & Co. who worked with Elgar on the publication of his Piano Quintet).
A considerable proportion of his output consisted of short piano pieces and unison songs suitable for children, and in an advertisement for his music in 1916 it was thought that "more than doubtful whether he has a rival among modern British composers who specialise in educational music."
The orchestral suite Stella-Mary Dances was written in memory of his oldest daughter who died in 1917, aged 12. They were played (along with his Vicar of Bray variations) on BBC Radio on 15 November 1929; the broadcast was followed by a concert of music from The Beggar's Opera by his brother Frederic, who also conducted.
One of his best-known works is The Pilgrim's Progress, a 12-section narrative tone poem setting for a solo organ of the work by John Bunyan; it takes about 2¾ hours to perform. There is a text which explains what is happening at each stage of the music which can be read by a narrator, and in the 12th movement, there are optional parts for choir (SSATTB), bells, and a solo violin. It was revived in November 1988 at St. Michael's, Cornhill, London, by organist Kevin Bowyer, who continues to perform it on occasion.
The song Farewell by Havergal Brian from his Op. 6 (Three Songs for contralto or baritone) - his first surviving work, from 1902 - was dedicated to Austin, as was Battle Song, from 6 Characteristic Songs, Op. 22, by Joseph Holbrooke.
Thoughts on music for children
From a letter by Austin to The Musical Times in 1918 about the music for the Associated Board exams:
"I close with an appeal to teachers. The future of English music rests with your pupils. These children are being trained for the ultimate purposes of deriving personal delight from the art and giving it to others. If the music they study gives them no pleasure, if they miss intimacy with the composer's idea—then it is so much wasted time. If you demand, as you have a right to demand, the right kind of music for them, you will get it. Publishers are in business to supply what you most need, but your needs must be known to them. Children have a good deal of latent romance and poetic insight, and music can bring this out and develop it with magical swiftness. By feeding every poetic tendency, often very personal and original, you will be building up, in each of them, a love for beauty which will never leave them. That would be great work, for what else is this life-quest in which we are all engaged? Do we get a fraction of the delight in living that we feel we are justly entitled to? Those of us who live on, bearing the inevitable blows of sorrow, can turn to music and other forms of Beauty and find in them the secret compensations of the Creator. Our children have the same road to travel, and they also must be prepared."
Family
He was married twice, firstly to Stella Reeve Muskett (b. 1874—d. Wallington, April or May 1925), with whom he had two daughters, Stella Mary (died 30 May 1917, aged 12; his orchestral suite Stella-Mary Dances, Op.58, was composed in her memory): and Margaret (1912-?). He married secondly Nell (maiden name unknown), died 12 April 1934.

Lara Porzak (born April 14, 1967, in Rome, Italy) is an American fine art photographer, daughter of Pulitzer-prize nominated novelist, Marianne Wiggins.
About
Lara Porzak works predominantly with black & white film and is acclaimed for using labour-intensive, non-digital photographic methods, often utilizing vintage cameras and lenses from the late 1800s to create her photographs. According to The Los Angeles Times, "Her photojournalistic style combines with the romantic influences of European photographers from the 1930s and ‘40s to give her work a timeless quality with a strong sense of narrative."
Porzak is "a real-deal fine art photographer" who has produced over 20 fine art photography shows and her work is part of the Getty museum's California Artist's Collection. The quality of her handmade photographs, using the gelatin silver process and tintypes has attracted many collectors throughout the world, as C Magazine so eloquently writes "If a picture is worth a thousand words, no doubt a Lara Porzak image is worth a great deal more." Her photographs have also appeared on many television shows & movies.
Porzak started her own photography business in the late 1990s as a fine art wedding photographer with a photojournalistic style, and her talent for disappearing into her subjects soon elevated her to the top of her field; travelling the globe, capturing weddings with her artistic aesthetic. Porzak has photographed the weddings of (to only name a few, in alphabetical order): Jennifer Aniston, Drew Barrymore, Kevin Costner, Ellen DeGeneres, Mariska Hargitay, Heidi Klum, Adam Sandler, Brooke Shields, Channing Tatum and Reese Witherspoon. When asked about her wedding photography in a magazine interview Porzak is quoted as saying, “my interest in photography isn't just so people can remember what happened, but so they can remember how they felt.”
Lured by the perfect light in which to make tintypes, she now lives in sunny Venice Beach, California.
Porzak is often quoted as saying 'the soul is not digital' and says with conviction "there is no separation between my work and my life."
Her favorite color is whiskey.
Education
Lara Porzak attended Martha's Vineyard Regional High School and received her degree from Dartmouth College. A self-proclaimed photography workshop junkie, Porzak has studied with Mary Ellen Mark, Graciela Iturbide and Christopher James amongst others.

The Maisy Battery is a group of World War II artillery batteries constructed in secret by the German Wehrmacht near the French village of Grandcamp-Maisy in Normandy.
It formed a part of Germany's Atlantic Wall coastal fortifications and was the principal position of defence for that area. It was responsible for the defence of the sector between the Longues-sur-Mer and the St Marcouf (Crisbecq) batteries. It could target the sectors around both Omaha Beach and Utah Beach, two of the five landing sites for the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944.
Pre-invasion planning
Anticipating an Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe from the United Kingdom during World War II, the Germans built an extensive system of defenses. The Maisy Battery was built in particular secrecy, under strict security, using forced labour brought in from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Poland. This avoided any local involvement that might reveal the existence of the site to the French Resistance and, through them, to the Allies.
By the time of preparations for D-Day, the Wehrmacht-run battery was marked on the Allied D-Day maps as a Rangers D-Day target - confirmed in records found in the early 21st century. Prior to D-Day, the Nazis had drawn significant attention to the gun battery at nearby Pointe du Hoc, a cliff top site overlooking the beaches, as compared to the slightly inland site of the Maisy battery. By the time of the invasion, Pointe du Hoc was manned by a token force of Wehrmacht troops, and the artillery pieces had been moved to other sites, replaced by dummy guns.
The Maisy site actually consisted of three batteries, Les Perruques, La Martiniere and Foucher Farm, labeled as Allied targets 5, 16 and 16A respectively. The battery at Les Perrugues, which was designated by the Germans as WN83, Widerstandsnest 83 (Resistance Nest 83), included six 155 mm First World War French field howitzers. The battery at La Martiniere, designated WN84, included four 105 mm pieces. Four 150 mm pieces were located at Foucher Farm.
Normandy landings
The battery is located from Pointe du Hoc, a key objective for the US Rangers during D-Day. The battery was garrisoned by elements of the 352nd and 716th Infantry and Artillery Divisions, plus Flak Regiment No. 1 consisting of twelve 88-mm anti-aircraft artillery pieces sent to protect the battery shortly before D-Day on 5 June 1944.
Fouchers' Farm was destroyed by naval shelling from the on 7 June 1944. The other two sites remained operational until they were assaulted by the US 2nd Rangers and the US 5th Rangers on 9 June.
The batteries at Maisy were D-Day mission objective Number 6 as given to Colonel James Rudder in his Operation Neptune intelligence and US 1st Infantry Division orders. However, he did not brief his men to carry out the mission to Maisy. Historian Gary Sterne, in a book published in 2014, suggests that Rudder disobeyed orders calling on him to continue to Maisy after taking Pointe du Hoc. The Rangers stayed at Pointe du Hoc for some days until relieved, which kept them from completing their D-day orders and away from the Maisy site - as well as the D-day Phase Line which was their main target for the evening of 6 June. This allowed the guns at Maisy to continue to shell troops in both the Omaha Beach and Utah Beach sectors for three days after the landings. Rudder always claimed that his orders called on him to hold the highway against a possible counterattack against Pointe du Hoc, but Sterne and subsequent historians could not find any such order in the US National Archives.
Rediscovery
British military historian Gary Sterne rediscovered Maisy Battery in January 2004, based on a hand-drawn map in the pocket of a US Army veteran's uniform he had bought. The battery was about inland from the sea near Grandcamp-Maisy, marked on the map as an "Area of high resistance".
Prior to D-Day, the battery had been recorded as the second highest D-Day target in the Omaha Sector group of fortifications, but the exact location had been lost from later records. Using the old map, Sterne was able to locate a bunker entrance amongst the undergrowth. Sterne then investigated further and found additional fortified buildings, gun platforms, and a hospital. Over 3 kilometres of trenches were uncovered.
In June 2006, the site was opened for the first time to visitors, with the battery site at Les Perruques an ongoing tourist attraction.

Fernando Melciades Zevallos González, also known as Fernando Melciades Zevallos Gonzáles, is the founder and owner of what was Peru's largest airline, Aero Continente. The airline operated from 1992 until 2004, but was forced to close that year after Mr Zevallos was added to America's list of drug kingpins, with the airline being placed on a blacklist of companies with links to drug traffickers. The moves prevented American companies from doing business with the airline. This meant that Aero Continente could neither buy spare parts for its US-built planes nor insure them. It quickly collapsed.
Zevallos was born on July 8, 1957, in Mariscal Cáceres Province, San Martín Region, Perú. He graduated from the Peruvian Air Force Academy, becoming a pilot. In 1976 and following his father's death, he retired from the Air Force to look after his father's estate. He had inherited a considerable amount of money.
In 1978, the Peruvian government began a campaign of tax incentives for companies that invested in the Peruvian jungle. The Zevallos family decided to incorporate an air taxi company called TAUSA, with the aim of offering aerial services to the villages of the Peruvian jungle which were not served by suitable terrestrial transport. The company was not successful and Zevallos emigrated to the United States.
During this period, he founded a new company, Aero Continente. At the end of 1994, he settled in the USA permanently, prompting him to give up his shares of the company. He quit the board of Aero Continente in January 1995, later becoming an adviser.
Aero Continente grew to become one of Peru's leading airlines. But on the eve of 2004's Copa America in Peru, Aero Continente was grounded. Persistent allegations of money-laundering and drug-trafficking had dogged the company for years. At this point, the US authorities added Zavallos to their list of drug kingpins. Unable to secure insurance for its fleet, Aero Continente was grounded.
Accusations and charges
Fernando Zevallos has been the subject of more than 30 investigations according to the US Drug Enforcement Administration, although none of these have led to any criminal charges. On 2004 he was put on the US's list of drug kingpins under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, labeling him one of the top drug-traffickers in the world. Terry Parham, director of the US Drug Enforcement Administration's Lima office, went on record as describing Zevallos as the "Al Capone of Perú".
The founder of Aero Continente has denied any connection with drug trafficking and has demanded that the United States government show proof of such accusations. Neither Aero Continente nor its founder Zevallos were ever tried or found guilty of these accusations prior to their addition to the list. Zevallos has been a Permanent legal resident of the United States for over 15 years and was quoted as calling his inclusion to The Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act "unconstitutional" since he was denied his right to due process.
In his home country, Zevallos had faced charges of contract murder, cocaine trafficking and money laundering, but had never been convicted of any such allegation. In November 2005, a Peruvian court found him guilty of drugs-trafficking offenses. He was sentenced to 20 years in jail and barred from holding public office. This was his only conviction, and he was convicted over a year following his inclusion to the controversial Kingpin Act. Zevallos's attorney claims that due to the tremendous pressure of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Bush administration, a conviction in Peru was just a matter of time. Zevallos' defense appeal is still pending, due to be heard by Peru's Supreme Court. Zevallos has also filed a complaint to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.
In November 2006, accusations emerged to suggest Zevallos had deep links with Peru's disgraced former spy-chief, Vladimiro Montesinos. The accusations were made by convicted drug dealer Jorge Polaco Chavez Montoya. Both Zevallos and Montesinos have denied any links.
In July 2007 he was indicted for allegedly conspiring to violate the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act.
In September 2007 a request, on behalf of Fernando Zevallos, was made to the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, requesting that he be extradited to the United States of America to face charges. Peru and the United States have an extradition treaty that allows the extradition of individuals for a specific short period, while facing trial or even after conviction. The request was denied, but Zevallos' defense has requested his extradition to the United States again in January 2009.

"Arkansas", written by Eva Ware Barnett in 1916, is one of the official state songs of Arkansas. It was first adopted as the state song in the early 20th century but was removed in 1949 due to a copyright dispute. After the state settled the dispute by buying all claims to its copyright, it was restored as state song in 1963.
In 1987, the General Assembly elevated the song to "state anthem" in order to designate "Arkansas (You Run Deep In Me)" and "Oh, Arkansas", both written for the state's 150th birthday in 1986, as state songs; it also designated "The Arkansas Traveler", the state song from 1949 to 1963, as "state historical song".
Another 1987 law requires the Secretary of State to respond to all requests for copies of the "state song" with this song. However, this was done only to preserve the historical status of this song; all four songs are either copyrighted by the state itself or in the public domain. Today, the Secretary of State posts the lyrics to all four songs on its website.

The Manc is a British social media publisher and news and entertainment company with a focus on the region of Greater Manchester after which the brand is named (the idea of Manc or having a Manchester dialect); and where it is located. The Manc was founded by Sam Ridgway who also acts as the publisher's Editor-in-Chief.
History
In 2014 The Manc began by posting nostalgic pictures of Manchester on Facebook. The page rapidly grew in popularity but founder Ridgway was soon hired by UNILAD as their first employee. Ridgway kept his viral page alive during his tenure at UNILAD, but in October 2018 the firm went into administration and were acquired by LADbible – at which point Ridgway left the organisation to focus on The Manc's future.
Following a pivot towards news and away from a strategy of only photographs and pictures, in 2019, The Manc became the North West's largest social news platform online, beating Manchester's largest news outlet (the Manchester Evening News) and Wales Online with over nine million interactions on Facebook. It also made CrowdTangle's Top 10 National News Outlets in 2019.
In July 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown began to lift across the UK for the hospitality sector, Ridgway and his team put the backing of The Manc's large following forward for a social cause. Their aim was to “bring the buzz back” into Manchester's hospitality industry.

Territorial issues between Estonia and Russia have clouded Estonia–Russia relations. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Estonia had hoped for the return of more than of territory annexed by Russia after World War II in 1945. The annexed land with Russian majority had been within the borders Estonia and Russia agreed on in the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty. However, the Boris Yeltsin government disavowed any responsibility for acts committed by the Soviet Union.
History
After the collapse of the Russian Empire due to the October Revolution, territorial delineation between Soviet Russia and the newly independent Estonia was determined by the 1920 Tartu peace treaty. On the onset of World War II, Estonia was annexed by the Soviet Union in the form of the Estonian SSR, as part of the overall occupation of the Baltic States. Soon it was overtaken by Nazi Germany and re-occupied by the Soviet Union for the period of 1944–1991.
Post-Soviet times
After Estonia regained its independence from the Soviet Union following the Singing Revolution, Estonian and Russian negotiators reached a technical agreement on the Estonia–Russia border in December 1996, with the border remaining substantially the same as the one drawn by Joseph Stalin, with some minor adjustments. The border treaty was initialed in 1999. On 18 May 2005 Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet and his Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov signed in Moscow the “Treaty between the Government of the Republic of Estonia and the Government of the Russian Federation on the Estonian-Russian border” and the “Treaty between the Government of the Republic of Estonia and the Government of the Russian Federation on the Delimitation of the Maritime Zones in the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Narva”.
The Riigikogu (Estonian Parliament) ratified the treaties on 20 June 2005, with a reference to the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty in the preamble of the ratification law, placing the new border treaty in context of internal Estonian law as amending the original 1920 border, objected by Russia. The President of Estonia, Arnold Rüütel proclaimed the treaties on 22 June 2005. As the preamble of the ratification act mentioned the 1920 Tartu peace treaty, Russia interpreted this as in theory giving Estonia a right to claim some territories of Pskov and Leningrad Oblast of Russia later.
As proposed by the Russian Government on 13 August 2005, on 31 August 2005 Russian President Vladimir Putin gave a written order to the Russian Foreign Ministry to notify the Estonian side of “Russia's intention not to participate in the border treaties between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Estonia”. On 6 September 2005, the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation sent Estonia a note, in which Russia informed that it did not intend to become a party to the border treaties between Estonia and Russia and did not consider itself bound by the circumstances concerning the object and the purposes of the treaties.
Negotiations were reopened in 2012 and the Treaty was signed in February 2014. Ratification is pending on both sides, with some Estonian MPs and officials opposing the ratification of the treaty. Their position is that this treaty contradicts the 1920 treaty and all decisions of the Estonian SSR were declared invalid in 1991.

In medicine and statistics, a gold standard test is usually the diagnostic test or benchmark that is the best available under reasonable conditions. In other words, a gold standard is the most accurate test possible without restrictions.
Both meanings are different because for example, in medicine, dealing with conditions that would require an autopsy to have a perfect diagnosis, the gold standard test would be the best one that keeps the patient alive instead of the autopsy.
In medicine
"Gold standard" can refer to the criteria by which scientific evidence is evaluated. For example, in resuscitation research, the "gold standard" test of a medication or procedure is whether or not it leads to an increase in the number of neurologically intact survivors that walk out of the hospital. Other types of medical research might regard a significant decrease in 30-day mortality as the gold standard.
The AMA Style Guide has preferred the phrase Criterion Standard instead of "gold standard." Other journals have also issued mandates in their instructions for contributors. For instance, Archives of biological Medicine and Rehabilitation specifies this usage. When the criterion is a whole clinical testing procedure it is usually referred to as clinical case definition.
In practice however, the uptake of this term by authors, as well as enforcement by editorial staff, is notably poor, at least for AMA journals.
A hypothetical ideal "gold standard" test has a sensitivity of 100% with respect to the presence of the disease (it identifies all individuals with a well defined disease process; it does not have any false-negative results) and a specificity of 100% (it does not falsely identify someone with a condition that does not have the condition; it does not have any false-positive results). In practice, there are sometimes no true gold standard tests.
As new diagnostic methods become available, the "gold standard" test may change over time. For instance, for the diagnosis of aortic dissection, the gold standard test used to be the aortogram, which had a sensitivity as low as 83% and a specificity as low as 87%. Since the advancements of magnetic resonance imaging, the magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) has become the new gold standard test for aortic dissection, with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 92%. Before widespread acceptance of any new test, the former test retains its status as the "gold standard".
Test calibration
Because tests can be incorrect (yielding a false-negative or a false-positive), results should be interpreted in the context of the history, physical findings, and other test results in the individual being tested. It is within this context that the sensitivity and specificity of the "gold standard" test is determined.
When the gold standard is not a perfect one, its sensitivity and specificity must be calibrated against more accurate tests or against the definition of the condition. This calibration is especially important when a perfect test is available only by autopsy.
It is important to emphasize that a test has to meet some interobserver agreement, to avoid some bias induced by the study itself.
Calibration errors can lead to misdiagnosis.
Ambiguity
Sometimes "gold standard test" refers to the best performing test available. In these cases, there is no other criterion against which it can be compared and it is equivalent to a definition. When referring to this meaning, gold standard tests are normally not performed at all. This is because the gold standard test may be difficult to perform or may be impossible to perform on a living person (i.e. the test is performed as part of an autopsy or may take too long for the results of the test to be available to be clinically useful).
Other times, "gold standard" does not refer to the best performing test available, but the best available under reasonable conditions. For example, in this sense, an MRI is the gold standard for brain tumour diagnosis, though it is not as good as a biopsy. In this case the sensitivity and specificity of the gold standard are not 100% and it is said to be an "imperfect gold standard" or "alloyed gold standard".
The term ground truth refers to the underlying absolute state of information; the gold standard strives to represent the ground truth as closely as possible. While the gold standard is the best effort to obtain the truth, ground truth is typically collected by direct observations.

Sergei Rachmaninoff composed his Symphony No. 3 in A minor, Op. 44 between 1935 and 1936. The Third Symphony is considered a transitional work in Rachmaninoff's output. In melodic outline and rhythm it is his most expressively Russian symphony, particularly in the dance rhythms of the finale. What was groundbreaking in this symphony was its greater economy of utterance compared to its two predecessors. This sparer style, first apparent in the Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, enhances the emotional power of the work.
The symphony was premiered on November 6, 1936, with Leopold Stokowski conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra. Critical opinion was divided and public opinion negative toward the work. Rachmaninoff remained convinced of the piece's worth, however, and conducted the Philadelphia Orchestra in the first recording of the work in 1939. Following the reevaluation of Rachmaninoff's work in the 1970s, the symphony has been viewed in a more favorable light and has been frequently played and recorded.
Form
The symphony contains only three movements but its central one fulfills the dual role of slow movement and scherzo — a structural innovation with marked similarities to the third symphony of Antonín Dvořák. The work employs cyclic form, with the subtle use of a motto theme combined, as usual with Rachmaninoff's works, with references to the plain-chant Dies irae. Also like Rachmaninoff's motto themes — and thus differing from Tchaikovsky's — it is short and, by tending to assume various shapes, is easily workable for further symphonic development. The piece is approximately 40 minutes long.
Composition
Rachmaninoff composed his Third Symphony after writing his Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini and Variations on a Theme of Corelli. He arrived at his newly built Villa Senar on Lake Lucerne in Switzerland in late April 1935 with the prospect of writing a symphony in mind. Satisfied with his new home and in good spirits, Rachmaninoff seemed definitely up to the task. On May 15 he informed his cousin Sofiya Satina that he had done "some work," and during the following weeks was seriously at work with the composition. However, a three-week cure at Baden-Baden in July, along with a two-week hiatus in August, put Rachmaninoff behind. Five days before leaving Senar at the end of his summer holiday, Rachmaninov wrote to Satina with some dissatisfaction, "I have finished two-thirds in clean form but the last third of the work in rough. If you take into account that the first two-thirds took seventy days of intense work, for the last third – thirty-five days – there is not enough time. Travels begin and I must get down to playing the piano. So it looks as though my work will be put aside until next year."
Near the end of the 1935–36 concert season, recitals in Switzerland enabled Rachmaninoff to pay a brief visit to Senar. He evidently took the score of the symphony with him when he left, since he had it with him in Paris in February 1936 for Julius Conus to mark bowings in the string parts. Work on the last movement had to wait until the composer arrived at Senar on April 16 for the summer holiday. On June 30, the composer reported to Satina, "Yesterday morning I finished my work, of which you are the first to be informed. It is a symphony. Its first performance is promised to Stokowski—probably in November. With all my thoughts I thank God that I was able to do it!" Rachmaninoff arrived in America just in time for final rehearsals of the work's premiere.
Instrumentation
The symphony is scored for full orchestra with 3 flutes (the 3rd doubling on piccolo), 3 oboes (the 3rd doubling on cor anglais), 2 clarinets in A and B, bass clarinet in A and B, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 2 trumpets in A and B, 1 contralto trumpet in F, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, cymbals, bass drum, snare drum, triangle, tambourine, tam-tam, xylophone, 2 harps (or harp and small upright piano), celesta, and strings.
Reactions
Critical
The day after the Third Symphony premiered, Edwin Schloss wrote for The Philadelphia Record that he found the work "a disappointment," with "echoes ... of the composer's lyric spaciousness of style" but largely sterile. Even Olin Downes, normally a champion of the composer's works, was not so sure about this piece:
The outward characteristics of Rachmaninoff's style are evident in the work heard on this occasion. It cannot be said, however, that in these pages Mr. Rachmaninoff says things which are new, even though his idiom is more his own than ever before, and free of the indebtedness it once had to Tchaikovsky. Nor is it easy to avoid the impression, at a first hearing of the work, of a certain diffuseness. There is a tendency to over-elaboration of detail, and to unnecessary extensions, so that the last movement, in particular, appears too long. Would not a pair of shears benefit the proportions of this work?
Samuel L. Laciar, reviewing the work for the Public Ledger, gave a more positive assessment. He called the symphony "a most excellent work in musical conception, composition and orchestration," adding that Rachmaninoff "has given us another example in this work that it is not necessary to write dissonant music in order to get the originality which is the greatest—and usually the single—demand of the ultra-moderns." W. J. Henderson of the Sun was perhaps most accurate in summing up both the work and the situation the critics faced in assessing it:
It is the creation of a genial mind laboring in a field well known and loved by it, but not seeking now to raise the fruit of heroic proportions.... The first movement is orthodox in its initial statement of two contrasting chief subjects. They are contrasted in the customary way, in temper and tonality. But the working out section pays only polite respect to tradition. The development of themes immediately follows their statement and this is Rachmaninoff's method. The cantabile theme of the first movement is especially attractive in its lyric and plaintive character and the leading subject has virility and possibilities which are not neglected later. In fact, we suspect, after this insufficient first hearing, that there is more organic unity in this symphony through consanguinity of themes than is instantly discernable.
Public
The public was as confused as the critics. Listeners who enjoyed the Second and Third Concertos, the Second Symphony, Isle of the Dead and, more recently, the Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, came expecting a quite different work than the one they heard. As Barrie Martyn phrases it, "The public had doubtless been misled by the old-style romanticism of the eighteenth Paganini variation and were perplexed to find that Rachmaninoff had after all advanced beyond the 1900s; the critics, on the other hand, condemned him just because they felt that he had not."
Composer
Rachmaninoff believed the Third Symphony was one of his best works, and its lukewarm reception disappointed and puzzled him. He summed up the situation in a 1937 letter to Vladimir Wilshaw: "It was played in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, etc. At the first two performances I was present. It was played wonderfully. Its reception by both the public and critics was sour. One review sticks painfully in my mind: that I didn't have a Third Symphony in me any more. Personally, I am firmly convinced that this is a good work. But—sometimes composers are mistaken too! Be that as it may, I am holding to my opinion so far."

DirectDraw (ddraw.dll) is an API that used to be a part of Microsoft's DirectX API. DirectDraw is used to accelerate rendering of 2D graphics in applications. DirectDraw also allows applications to run fullscreen or embedded in a window such as most other MS Windows applications. DirectDraw uses hardware acceleration if it is available on the client's computer. DirectDraw allows direct access to video memory, hardware overlays, hardware blitters, and page flipping. Its video memory manager can manipulate video memory with ease, taking full advantage of the blitting and color decompression capabilities of different types of display adapters.
DirectDraw is a 2D API. That is, it contains commands for 2D rendering and does not support 3D hardware acceleration. A programmer could use DirectDraw to draw 3D graphics, but the rendering would be slow compared to an API such as Direct3D which does support 3D hardware acceleration.
DirectDraw was introduced for Windows Mobile in Windows Mobile 5.0, replacing the graphics component of GAPI, which was then deprecated.
With the release of DirectX version 8.0, DirectDraw was merged into a new package called DirectX Graphics, which extended Direct3D with a few DirectDraw API additions. DirectDraw can still be used by programmers, but they must use older DirectX interfaces (DirectX 7 and below).
In June 2010, DirectDraw was removed from the DirectX SDK package, but in 2012, the DirectX SDK was merged into the Windows Platform SDK, and DirectDraw was included once again.
Replacement
There has been a deterioration of Windows compatibility with old games that rely upon DirectDraw, with Command & Conquer, Warcraft 2, and Theme Hospital among those affected. In newer Windows versions, some games will refuse to run under a 32-bit bit depth (Dangerous Waters for example), others showing a black screen or glitching when switched out. Re-implementation of DirectDraw has been observed to fix these compatibility problems. Commonly used replacements include:
WineD3D from Wine, which translates into OpenGL.
cnc-ddraw and ts-ddraw from CnCNet, a Command & Conquer multiplayer network. Translates into GDI, OpenGL (with GLSL support), or Direct3D 9.
DDrawCompat, a wrapper for the vanilla ddraw that corrects problematic calls. ddwrapper is an earlier, unrelated wrapper that does the same thing.

Kayla Denise Parker-Tolbert (June 29, 1971 – April 21, 2007) was an American gospel and R&B singer and songwriter.
As a songwriter, producer and background singer, she has worked with a number of gospel and R&B musicians, including CeCe, BeBe and Vickie Winans, Brandy, Anthony Hamilton, Michelle Williams of Destiny's Child and Mark Kibble of Take 6. Her television appearances included Oprah, Late Show with David Letterman and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and her songs were performed on Good Morning America, CNN, BET and TBN among others.
Biography
She was born Kayla Denise Parker to Richard and Aseneth Parker on June 29, 1971 in Detroit, Michigan.
She showed an early interest in music, influenced by her father, a songwriter, producer and label executive who was discovered by Sam Cooke, and her mother, a jazz singer. After her parents' divorced, Kayla's mother bought her a piano, on which she would learn songs by the likes of DeBarge, Michael Jackson, the Clark Sisters, the Winans and Stevie Wonder.
Kayla became a Christian and continued to develop her musical ability as she served as an apprentice under the Minister of Music, Ted Thomas at Goodwill Community Chapel.
At Detroit's Pershing High School she formed an all-female vocal group, taking the name "God's Special Gift" after an audience member's compliment. The group won a talent show and went on to become widely known in the city's churches. As their fame spread, producer Michael Powell (Anita Baker) heard them and began working with them. At this point the group shortened their name to "Special Gift". Their recordings and performances, riding the strength of Kayla's songwriting, quickly earned them national recognition.
As a member of the National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Chorus (founded by Dr. Thomas A. Dorsey), Kayla's 1989 arrangement of "Since Jesus Came Into My Life" won the convention's nationwide competition for "Song of the Year". This arrangement was later included on the album Ron Winans Family and Friends Volume 3.
Kayla joined Perfecting Church, whose pastor was Marvin Winans, in 1990. Her song "Now Are We", performed by the Perfected Praise Choir, gained her national recognition.
A fan of Twinkie Clark, Kayla would listen to the Clark Sisters and try to play their music at the church piano between services. When Twinkie Clark left the Clark Sisters, Kayla was chosen as their first background singer, a slot she held for a year.
She worked with Mark Kibble of Take 6 on gospel's Grammy- and Stellar- award-winning Donnie McClurkin's first solo project. She did commercials with Fred Hammond and Eric Dawkins, wrote songs for Hammond's second album, and wrote the hit "Now Are We" for Marvin Winans and the Perfected Praise Choir.
She was also a background singer for BeBe Winans, traveling to Europe and performing on Oprah Winfrey's and Jay Leno's shows. She met superstar producer David Foster and sang on Brandy's record, then moved to California.
In 1999 Parker was diagnosed with cancer, and returned to Detroit for treatment and recovery.
After overcoming the disease, she returned to California, where she threw herself back into songwriting and also learned to engineer her own recording sessions.
Working with a producer friend, she pulled together recordings of a number of her songs, both gospel and inspirational R&B - - "life music," she calls it - - and looked to develop her own artistry. Her material was also recorded by other artists: CeCe Winans recorded "He's Concerned About You," whose message of hope found a natural audience in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and Vickie Winans recorded the hit single "It's Alright". Others including Rodney and Joy Jerkins and gospel jazz artist Tim Bowman have recorded material written by Parker.
In 2004, Kayla married David E. Tolbert.
Her music was played at the funeral of Coretta Scott King.
Kayla Parker died on April 21, 2007 from breast cancer. She is buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery in West Covina, CA.

Kenfield Nunatak () is an isolated nunatak which lies about southeast of the head of Cosgrove Ice Shelf and east-northeast of Pryor Cliff, at the extreme northern end of the Hudson Mountains, Antarctica. It was mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from ground surveys and U.S. Navy air photos, 1960–66, and was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for Richard E. Kenfield, a USGS topographic engineer working from Byrd Station in the 1963–64 season.

CSS Rappahannock, a steam sloop-of-war, was built at the Blackwall Yard on the River Thames by Money Wigram & Son in 1855 as an for the Royal Navy and named HMS Victor. Although a handsomely modeled vessel, numerous defects occasioned her sale in 1863. An agent of the Confederate States Government purchased her ostensibly for the China trade, but British authorities suspected she was destined to be a Confederate commerce raider and ordered her detention. Nevertheless, she succeeded in escaping from Sheerness, England, on November 24, with workmen still on board and only a token crew. Her Confederate States Navy officers joined in the English Channel.
When he bought her from the Admiralty through his secret agent on November 14, Commander Matthew F. Maury had intended Rappahannock to replace the cruiser and was about to transfer Georgias guns to her. She was ideal for a cruiser — wooden-hulled and bark-rigged with two engines and a lifting screw propeller.
She was commissioned a Confederate man-of-war underway, but while passing out of the Thames Estuary her bearings burned out and she had to be taken across to Calais for repairs. There Lieutenant C. M. Fauntleroy, CSN, was placed in command. Detained on various pretexts by the French Government, Rappahannock never got to sea and was turned over to the United States at the close of the war.

Total primary energy supply (TPES) in Slovenia was 6.80 Mtoe in 2019. In the same year, electricity production was 16.1 TWh, consumption was 14.9 TWh.
Total energy
Total primary energy supply (TPES) in Slovenia was 6.80 Mtoe in 2019. The three greatest sources of energy in Slovenia during that year were oil (34.0% in 2019), nuclear power (22.0% in 2019), and coal (16.0% in 2019). The transportation and industrial sectors were the largest consumers of energy in Slovenia in 2019.
Slovenia is a net energy importer, importing all its petroleum products (mainly for the transport sector) and natural gas, as well as some coal.
Electricity
Electricity generation is mainly provided by nuclear power (36.2% in 2019), hydroelectricity (29.1% in 2019), and coal (27.9% in 2019); the three sources accounting for 93.2% of total electricity generation. Minor sources of electricity generation, each contributing less than 4% of total electricity generation, are natural gas, solar photovoltaic (solar PV), and biofuels. Following steep declines in use since 1990, Slovenia eliminated the use of oil for generating electricity in 2019. Renewable energy sources other than hydropower (e.g., biofuels, solar PV, waste, and wind) together provided 3.5% of total electricity generation in 2019.
Coal and lignite
Lignite deposits are found in the north central and northeastern regions of Slovenia; the country does not have any identified hard coal reserves. There is one active lignite mine in Slovenia, near Velenje in the north central region of the country. The mine produced 3.2 million tonnes of lignite in 2018 for combustion in the neighboring Šoštanj Power Plant. The mine is Slovenia's only producing fossil fuel facility. The power plant has an expected closure date of 2033 nonetheless the government hopes to close the plant between 2024 and 2029.
Some coal is imported for district heating and electrical power generation use at the Ljubljana Power Station.
Hydroelectricity
With abundant precipitation and numerous mountains, including the Julian Alps across the north of the country, Slovenia has significant hydropower natural resources.
Nuclear
The single nuclear reactor at the Krško Nuclear Power Plant near Krško in the eastern part of the country produced 22% of all of Slovenia's total energy needs in 2019. The plant generated 36.2% of the electricity produced in Slovenia. Designed by United States company Westinghouse, the two loop, light water, pressurized water reactor was constructed and is operated as a 50% / 50% joint venture between Slovenia and neighboring Croatia.
Slovenia electric company GEN Energija is seeking to construct a second nuclear reactor at the site to support national climate, electrification, and energy security goals.
Petroleum and natural gas
Slovenia has essentially no natural gas or petroleum reserves or production. In the late 2010s Slovenia began construction of two major gas interconnector projects, one with Hungary and Italy and one with Croatia and Austria, respectively.
Renewable energy
Hydropower is Slovenia's most significant renewable energy source for electricity generation; biofuels provided the greatest contribution to total energy needs among renewables. Variable renewable energy sources such as solar PV and wind produced 1.9% of electricity in 2019.
Per analysis published by the World Bank which considers natural features of a location such as altitude, humidity, cloud cover, and topography, Slovenia's solar PV potential is relatively low compared to global resources, but is comparable to that of other central and eastern European countries which lie north of the Alps. The sunny coastal strip along the Adriatic Sea has better potential than the inland areas, similar to that of northern Italy and southern France.
Onshore wind energy potential for Slovenia is typical of central and eastern Europe. A northwest to southeast band of higher potential wind energy is found across far southwest Slovenia, roughly between Gorizia, Italy and Rijeka, Croatia. Unlike the Atlantic Ocean and North Sea offshore areas of western and northern Europe, the offshore wind resources for Slovenia in the Adriatic Sea are not that much greater than onshore.
Climate change
Slovenia, both as an independent party and a member of the European Union, signed the Paris Agreement in 2016. The European Union Nationally
Determined Contribution (NDC) towards climate goals includes Slovenia. In the December 2020 update to the European Union NDC, Slovenia committed to the common goals and to reduce its emissions from outside of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme by 15% from 2005 levels by 2030. For comparison, the four adjoining countries pledged the following reductions in the same document:
Austria 36%
Croatia 7%
Hungary 7%
Italy 33%
As a member of the European Union, Slovenia was required to prepare and submit a national energy and climate plan (NECP). Slovenia submitted their Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan of the Republic of Slovenia in February 2020. The country is seeking to move away from fossil fuels through electrification of areas of the economy such as transportation and heating with generation resources which emit little or no greenhouse gasses such as nuclear power and renewables.
Slovenia generated 68.8% of its electricity with zero carbon or carbon neutral sources in 2019, dominated by nuclear power and hydroelectricity. Fossil fuels oil, coal, and natural gas contributed 61% of the total energy supply of Slovenia in 2019.

Iguanacolossus (meaning "Iguana Colossus" or "Colossal Iguana") is a genus of iguanodontian ornithopod dinosaur that lived in North America during the Early Cretaceous period. It is known from UMNH VP 20205, the associated holotype with a large partial skeleton of a single individual.
Discovery and naming
The holotype of Iguanacolossus, UMNH VP 20205, was discovered by Donald D. DeBlieux in 2005, unearthed from the Yellow Cat Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation, Utah; dating from the Valanginian stage in the Early Cretaceous, it wasn't named and described until 2010 by Andrew T. McDonald, James I. Kirkland, Donald D. DeBlieux, Scott K. Madsen, Jennifer Cavin, Andrew R. C. Milner, and Lukas Panzarin, along with the genus Hippodraco, also from the Cedar Mountain Formation. UMNH VP 20205 is assigned to a single individual, including skull elements: fragmented predentary, partial right maxilla, right squamosal, teeth, right and left quadrates. Body remains compromise: vertebrae (cervical, dorsal and caudal), chevrons, ribs, right scapula, right ilium, right pubis, right metatarsals and left fibula. The generic name, Iguanacolossus, is a combination of the reptile genus "Iguana", and the Latin word "colossus" (meaning colossal and/or giant) in relation to the iconic Iguana-like teeth of iguanodontians and the notorious large body size of the specimen. The specific name, "fortis", means mighty. The binomial means "Mighty Iguana Colossus". Additional findings at the Doelling's Bowl site are currently on revision, compromising mostly juvenile material based on lower jaws and humerus. Other remains include a large femur and pubis.
Description
Iguanacolossus is a large, robust iguanodontid, probably reaching long and weighing in body mass. According to McDonald and colleagues, Iguanacolossus differs from other iguanodontians in having a contact surface for supraoccipital on caudomedial process of squamosal curved in caudal view, cranial pubic process with concave dorsal margin but little expansion of its cranial end, postorbital process of the squamosal mediolaterally compressed and blade-like, pubis tapers to a blunt point, cranial extremity of preacetabular process of ilium modified into horizontal boot, axial neural spine blade-like and semi-circular in profile, and the dorsal margin of ilium straight.
It had stock metatarsals and a prominent left fibula measuring . The maxilla preserves 14 alveoli, the presence of two concave surfaces suggest an elliptical and elongate antorbital fossa. Based on comparisons with Camptosaurus and Dakotadon, the two isolated teeth are clasiffied as dentary and maxillary, having a shield-shaped crown and lozenge-shaped crown respectively. The scapular bone is almost complete; a denticle is preserved on the predentary, various vertebrae indicate a very iguanodontian-like body shape, specially dorsal vertebrae. The two right metatarsals are classified as metatarsals III and IV based on Camptosaurus and Iguanodon. The right pubis shows derived and plesiomorphic features, seen on related iguanodontians.
Classification
Iguanacolossus was placed in the Iguanodontia, being a styracosternan, a basal subgroup containing the Hadrosauridae and all dinosaurs more closely related to hadrosaurids than to camptosaurids. Below are the results obtained in the phylogenetic analysis performed by its describers in 2010:
Paleoecology
Iguanacolossus was recovered in the Yellow Cat Member from the Cedar Mountain Formation. However, this Member is divided in two beds: Upper and Lower Yellow Cat; Iguanacolossus was unearthed from the Lower bed, where it shared its environment with Theropods: Falcarius, Geminiraptor and Yurgovuchia. The sauropod Mierasaurus and the turtle Naomichelys. There are also indeterminate Goniopholidids crocodiles known from the Lower Yellow Cat.
The other paleofauna is from the Upper Yellow Cat, which includes: Aquatilavipes; Sauropods: Cedarosaurus and Moabosaurus; Iguanodontians: Cedrorestes and Hippodraco; Theropods: Martharaptor and Utahraptor; the nodosaurid Gastonia; Turtles: Glyptops and Trinitichelys; Fish: Ceratodus, Semionotus and indeterminate remains of Hybodontids and Polyacrodontids sharks. Lastly, the mammal Cifelliodon. Additional unnamed genera is known from this bed: U. Sail-backed Iguanodont, U. Eudromaeosaur and Velociraptorine, U. Goniopholidids, U. Mesoeucrocodylian and U. Neochoristodere.

Alfred Bryan (1852–1899) (born as Charles Grineau) was a popular English illustrator, best known for his many contributions to the London-based weekly theatrical review Entr'acte.
Bryan's first professional sketches were published in The Hornsey Hornet. He also produced sketches for The London Figaro. Bryan worked for the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News for most of his career and was also published in periodicals such as Judy magazine. Walter Sickert, a contemporary art critic, described him as "the complete, trained draughtsman", praising his illustrations as "[...]unfaltering in their mastery of line, their perfect style, their elegance and wit."
Bryan was buried in New Southgate Cemetery, in Barnet, North London.
His son was Charles William Grineau (1883–1957), an artist known for his paintings of motorcars under the pseudonyms Bryan de Grineau and John Bryan.

In 2008, Sheffield ranked among the top 10 UK cities as a business location and aims to regenerate itself as a modern technology and sports based city. Sheffield has an international reputation for metallurgy and steel-making. It was this industry that established it as one of England's main industrial cities during the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. This industry used Sheffield's unique combination of local Iron, Coal and water power supplied by the local rivers. This fuelled a massive growth in the city's population that expanded from 60,995 in 1801 to a peak of 577,050 in 1951. However, due to increasing competition from imports, it has seen a decline in heavy engineering industries since the 1960s, which has forced the sector to streamline its operations and lay off the majority of the local employment. The steel industry now concentrates on more specialist steel-making and, in 2005, produced more steel per year by value than at any other time in its history. The industry is now less noticeable as it has become highly automated and employs far fewer staff than in the past. However a small number of skilled industrial automation engineers still thrive in it. Today the economy is worth over £7 billion a year.
The largest employers are now all public sector: the two universities, NHS, and national and local government employees. Private fee-paying international students are also a major source (£120 million per year) of income to the local economy through the universities.
History
The steel industry dates back to at least the 14th century. In 1740 Benjamin Huntsman discovered the crucible technique for steel manufacture, at his workshop in the district of Handsworth. This process had an enormous impact on the quantity and quality of steel production and was only made obsolete, a century later, in 1856 by Henry Bessemer's invention of the Bessemer converter which allowed the true mass production of steel. Bessemer had moved his Bessemer Steel Company to Sheffield to be at the heart of the industry. Thomas Boulsover invented Sheffield Plate (silver-plated copper), in the early 18th century. A major Sheffield steel invention was that of stainless steel by Harry Brearley in 1912, and the work of Profs. F. B. Pickering and T. Gladman throughout the 1960s, '70s, and '80s was fundamental to the development of modern high strength low alloy steels.
The Sheffield Assay Office, which opened in 1773, stamps precious metals with the city's crown mark. The Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire was created in 1624 to regulate the manufacture of edged tools. The head of this company (the Master Cutler) is held in regard equal to the city's lord mayor and it has powers over the trademarking of steel with the Sheffield area.
While iron and steel have always been the main industries of Sheffield, coal mining has been a major feature of the outlying areas, and the Palace of Westminster in London was built using limestone and paving from quarries in the nearby villages of Anston and Green Moor.
The Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust, a partnership between Sheffield City Council, Sheffield Hallam University and the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire has preserved key sites associated with the city's industrial heritage, some of which actually still operate ancient equipment for the public, such as the Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet and the Kelham Island Museum. Northwest of the city lies Wortley Top Forge, which was a heavy ironworks of international renown. It is a site of historical and industrial importance, contributing to Sheffield's reputation for manufacturing high-quality, precision steel goods, though actually it is located within the boundaries of neighbouring Barnsley.

The city spearheaded the knowledge advances which gave it preeminence in steel and cutlery production; today the transfer of technology from Sheffield's universities is claimed by some to be "guaranteeing" Sheffield's continuing industrial and commercial evolution, creating cutting-edge enterprises across the city. High technology businesses such as the US company Fluent, Inc., for example, have chosen Sheffield as the centre for their international operations and so has Jennic, specialists in semiconductor design for the home automation, commercial building automation, and industrial process monitoring and control markets. The University of Sheffield supports the growth of technology transfer in the Sheffield City Region through the Kroto Innovation Centre and Sheffield Bioincubator which house small and medium enterprises as well as startup companys working in similar areas, or occasionally alongside, University of Sheffield researchers.
Insight Enterprises will invest £50 million in a new European headquarters in the city resulting in 1700 jobs over the 2005-2008 period, while Boeing, through its collaboration with the University of Sheffield will be at the centre of an Advanced Manufacturing Park (AMP) on the edge of the city, home to a cluster of businesses in the advanced manufacturing sector. Other areas of employment include call centres, the City Council, universities and hospitals.
There are signs that the Sheffield economy is seeing a revival. The 2004 Barclays Bank Financial Planning study revealed that, in 2003, the Sheffield district of Hallam was the highest ranking area outside London for overall wealth, the proportion of people earning over £60,000 a year standing at almost 12%. A survey by Knight Frank revealed that Sheffield was the fastest growing city outside London for office and residential space and rents during the second half of 2004.
Cushman & Wakefield's respected Global Research Reports include the "UK Cities Monitor 2008" which placed Sheffield among the top ten "best cities to locate a business today", and reported 3rd and 4th places respectively for best office location and best new call centre location. The same report places Sheffield in 3rd place regarding "greenest reputation" and 2nd in terms of the availability of financial incentives.
As an example of the city's move away from traditional industry, Sheffield is now the home to one of the country's fastest growing online job boards, My Job Group, whose HQ is based there and serves the city with its very own jobs board. This site competes strongly with the traditional way of finding employment in Sheffield which is through the local newspaper whose main vacancies day is Thursday.
Organised by the Sheffield Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Sheffield Business Awards are an awards ceremony held on an annual basis to help highlight and promote business and industry in Sheffield and boost the economy of the city.
In 2012, Sheffield City Region Enterprise Zone was launched to promote development in a number of sites in Sheffield and across the wider region. In March 2014 additional sites were added to the zone.

Sam Cearns was a British ship-rigged sailing cargo ship and emigrant carrier, built in 1864. In 1871 she was wrecked near Tierra del Fuego after the crew members gallantly saved the crew of another windjammer Knight Errant.
Description
The Sam Cearns was built in 1864 by Scott & Co at Cartsdyke, Greenock as Yard No 97 for H T Wilson & Chambers' White Star Line. She was built with an iron hull and rigged as a three-masted full-rigged ship. She was 315.5 feet in length, 36.3 feet in breadth and had a depth of hold of 25 feet; she measured 1402 Gross register tons. She was launched on 22 June 1864.
Commercial service
She sailed from Liverpool on her maiden voyage with 367 passengers and 45 crew, arriving at Melbourne on 17 October 1864 after 80 days at sea, during which 4 passengers died. On 17 November 1864 Sam Cearns departed Hobsons Bay, Melbourne for Madras. After taking on a cargo of jute, linseed, cotton, and saltpeter, the Sam Cearns arrived at Liverpool from Calcutta on 13 August 1865. This maiden voyage could have been her last as she caught fire in the entrance lock, but it was successfully extinguished.
The Sam Cearns''' second voyage to Melbourne from Liverpool for White Star Line took 88 days and arrived on 25 December 1865. Thereafter she traded more widely, including Sydney NSW, Port Chalmers and San Francisco.
Final voyage
On this last voyage, the ship under Capt Frederick Williams had already suffered 30 days of smallpox and a near-mutiny when, off Tierra del Fuego, on 22 June 1871 she came upon the Liverpool ship Knight Errant about to break up in a heavy gale. Williams hove to and attempted to launch their lifeboat but this was destroyed by breaking seas; led by mate Edwin Wright with a volunteer crew, a second boat set off and took off all the crew of Knight Errant in three trips - on the last the boat was destroyed as it returned to Sam Cearns, the master of Knight Errant, mate Edwin Wright and five others were killed with only four getting on board; a search with Sam Cearns' last boat found no more alive - 24 from Knight Errant were saved.
In the aftermath, Sam Cearns herself was wrecked on 26 June 1871 in the same heavy gale but all aboard were able to get off via the rigging to shore. In driving snow they remained in a makeshift shelter for two weeks until they were able to hail a passing schooner (actually a wrecker's vessel). All sixty survivors were taken by the schooner to Port Stanley.
Capt Williams received the gold medal of the Liverpool Shipwreck & Humane Society and every volunteer member of the rescuing boat the silver medal, and a gratuity to the widow of the mate. Williams was absolved of all blame for the loss of Sam Cearns'' but was "tired of windjamming" and intended to go to a steamship line, where pay and conditions were better.

The Paramillo tapaculo (Scytalopus canus) is a species of bird in the family Rhinocryptidae.
Taxonomy
It has traditionally included the more widespread S. opacus as a subspecies, but under the common name Paramo tapaculo (a name now used exclusively for S. opacus). The two have different voices, leading to them being split into separate species in 2010.
Distribution and habitat
The Paramillo tapaculo is endemic to humid highland scrub in the Cordillera Occidental in Colombia. At present it is only known from Páramo de Paramillo and Páramo de Frontino (also known as Paramo del Sol). It may occur elsewhere in the Cordillera Occidental of Colombia. It is restricted to a narrow swath of treeline vegetation (scrub, stunted trees and Polylepis woodland) situated between montane forest and Páramo grasslands that is often just hundreds of meters wide.
Description
The Paramillo tapaculo resembles other Scytalopus tapaculos, being overall dark grey, but lacking the brown lower flanks of the Paramo tapaculo.
Status and conservation
Given the estimated extent of occurrence and observed decline in the extent and quality of habitat, the Paramillo tapaculo has an IUCN status of near threatened. While locally common, the estimated area of suitable habitat within the known range of the Paramillo tapaculo is 3 km2 in total. Only 0.1 km2 is effectively protected by the Fundación ProAves Colibri del Sol Bird Reserve (which also harbours the highly threatened dusky starfrontlet and Fenwick's antpitta). Páramo de Paramillo is a national park, but very poorly protected.

Founded in 1855, the Amateur Dramatic Club (or ADC) is the oldest university dramatic society in England – and the largest dramatic society in Cambridge.
The club stages a diverse range of productions every term, many of them at the fully equipped ADC Theatre in Park Street, where they are the resident company. They also regularly stage shows at other Cambridge venues, annually at the Edinburgh Fringe and occasionally on tour abroad.
History
The Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club was officially founded during the Easter Vacation of 1855 by F.C. Burnand and a group of his friends, who had acquired back rooms in the Hoop Hotel on Jesus Lane during the course of the previous year.
The university's response to the project was reported to have been ‘unfavourable', but this did nothing to dampen the enthusiasm of those involved.
The club's first presentation was a series of short one act plays of varying quality, of which the club's first minute book reports that ‘the receipts were scanty, but a start was effected'.
Over the course of the next five years, the society grew slowly but steadily.
A contribution of £5 from each of the club's members allowed the club to pay for the renovation of their cramped and bare rooms, and in 1860 the new stage at the Hoop Hotel, roughly on the site of the current building, was opened.
Though the university's approval was initially begrudging, attitudes towards the club changed over the course of the next 40 years, and by the beginning of the 20th century the club was a nationally renowned and respected group.
Tragedy struck in 1933 when the Hoop Hotel stage was destroyed in a fire.
Support flooded in, including messages of goodwill from the King, and a mere 18 months later a new building was opened by the club.
The ADC Theatre, now the oldest university playhouse in the country, was reborn.
The club continued to run the theatre until it ran into financial difficulties in 1974 when the university took over the running of the theatre, as a department of the university leasing the building from the club for a nominal annual fee.
Activities
The CUADC puts on around 20 shows every year. These cover a huge range of subject matter and playwrights, from comic to tragic, from Chaucer to Stoppard via Shakespeare and Beckett to name just a few. Although many are performed at the 228-seater ADC Theatre, where the club is the resident performing company, recent venues have also included the Corpus Christi Playroom, The Octagon at St Chad's, King's College Lawn and the Round Church.
Constitutionally, the club also has an obligation
to spread interest in the theory and practice of theatre, in all its aspects, by every possible means amongst those qualified to be members of the Club; to encourage the active involvement of the same regardless of previous experience; and to maintain interest in the running of the ADC Theatre.
To this end, the club puts on a programme of professional and student-run workshops for actors, directors and technicians as well as a series of late-night experimental pieces known as One-Night Stands.
Membership
Anybody aged 17 or over, studying for a qualification at the University of Cambridge, or who is engaged in full-time study at any other educational institution within Cambridge is eligible for ordinary membership.
From time to time special membership may be conferred onto people who do not otherwise qualify for ordinary membership.
It is a requirement that anybody participating in a show put on by the club must have some class of membership status for insurance reasons.
Committee
The club is run on behalf of its members by a committee of fourteen students of the university.
The President usually must have been a member of the committee the previous year and is elected by that committee, all other roles are elected by club members at the AGM, held in Lent Term.
The committee is in charge of show selection and support, as well as organisation of one-off events such as the annual garden party, annual dinner, and freshers' squash.
There is also a senior treasurer, who, by university statutes, must be a senior member of the university. This post is currently held by Dr Richard Barnes, the vice-master of Emmanuel College and senior treasurer of Amalgamated Clubs.

Alejandro Castellanos (born 1954) is a Cuban-American political consultant. He has worked on electoral campaigns for Republican candidates including Bob Dole, George W. Bush, Jeb Bush, and Mitt Romney. In 2008, Castellanos, a partner at National Media Inc., co-founded Purple Strategies, a bipartisan communications firm. Castellanos is also a regular guest commentator on Meet the Press and a contributor for CNN.
Early life and education
Alex Castellanos was born in Havana, Cuba in 1954 and immigrated to the United States in 1960 or 1961 with his family. He lived in North Carolina and attended the University of North Carolina, where he was a National Merit Scholar and a philosophy major. Castellanos is married and has two children.
Career
Castellanos has worked as a political consultant for Republican candidates for state and federal elections since the 1980s, including six presidential elections. In particular, he has received media attention for his work developing ads for political campaigns and is sometimes referred to as "the father of the attack ad".
1980s and 1990s: Early political work
Castellanos began his career working on the successful 1984 re-election campaigns for United States Senators Jesse Helms and Strom Thurmond. While working on these campaigns Castellanos met Mike Murphy, with whom he later formed the firm Murphy & Castellanos. Their firm worked on Bob Dole's 1988 presidential campaign. In 1989, Castellanos became a partner at National Media, Inc.
In 1990, Castellanos again worked on the re-election campaign for Jesse Helms. During the campaign, Castellanos drew media attention for an ad he created that showed the hands of a white man holding a rejection letter because he had lost a job to a minority worker. The ad, known as "Hands", was criticized by supporters of Helms' opponent, Harvey Gantt for appealing to racial biases of white voters. Castellanos later explained that the intended message behind the ad was that "nobody should get a job, or be denied a job because of the color of their skin." Also in 1990, Castellanos created television commercials for Bob Martinez's re-election campaign for governor of Florida.
Throughout the 1990s, Castellanos worked on a variety of Republican campaigns as a media consultant and strategist. These included George H. W. Bush's 1992 presidential election campaign, Jeb Bush's 1994 campaign for governor of Florida, and Guy Millner's 1994 campaign for governor of Georgia.
Castellanos again worked for Bob Dole on his 1996 presidential election campaign. It was during this campaign that Castellanos discussed the importance of "soccer moms" as a political demographic with The Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne. The phrase went on to become one of the key buzzwords of the election year. Castellanos worked on Jesse Helms' re-election campaign in 1996; Helms pulled controversial ads against Charlie Sanders and Harvey Gantt in April 1996, and Castellanos left the campaign at that time. He worked for Bob Taft's 1998 campaign for governor of Ohio.
2000s: Bush-Cheney and Romney campaigns
Castellanos served as a media advisor to George W. Bush in both his 2000 and 2004 presidential election campaigns. During the campaigns, "he sealed his reputation as one of the keenest, most cutthroat strategists in the business." While working on the 2000 campaign, Castellanos created an ad about the Medicare prescription plan Al Gore proposed in which the word "RATS" flashed briefly on the screen as the word "bureaucrats" appeared. This was discussed in the media as potential "subliminal messaging".
In 2007 Castellanos was named to GQ Magazine'''s list of the "50 Most Influential People in D.C." The following year, Castellanos worked for Mitt Romney's 2008 presidential campaign as part of the firm Midnight Ride Media, which managed advertising, production and media buying for the campaign.
2008 to present: Purple Strategies
In 2008, the communications firm Purple Strategies was founded by Castellanos and Democrat Steve McMahon. According to Purple Strategies' managing partner Bruce Haynes, Castellanos and McMahon would routinely see each other while pitching to clients. The two ultimately decided to merge their "blue" and "red" consultancies to create a "purple" company.
Castellanos is currently a principal partner at Purple Strategies, major clients of the bipartisan firm have included the United States Chamber of Commerce, BP and PhRMA.
Other activities
Castellanos is a guest commentator and contributor for CNN and has appeared on Meet the Press where he argued with Rachel Maddow in April 2012 about the existence of a gender gap in pay. Additionally, Castellanos writes online commentary for The Huffington Post and National Review, and is also a public speaker and member of the Washington Speakers Bureau.
In 2008, Castellanos was a resident fellow at Harvard University's Institute of Politics. The following year, Castellanos became a senior communications advisor to Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele.
In 2013, Castellanos shaved his mustache on The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer'' after promising to do so if 500 new donors would give to Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy. Also in 2013, Castellanos led a Super PAC project called NewRepublican.org, which is focused on broadening the Republican Party's demographic base. Along with other Republican political consultants, Castellanos signed a "friend of the court" brief in support of gay marriage in February 2013.

New Centre-Right Autonomous Veneto (Nuovo Centrodestra Veneto Autonomo, NCD–VA) was the regional section in Veneto of the New Centre-Right, a Christian-democratic political party in Italy. The party, founded in November 2013, took the new denomination in Veneto in September 2014.
In the Regional Council of Veneto's ninth term, the NCD–VA's group was composed of seven regional councillors, notably including Marino Zorzato (Vice President of Veneto) and Clodovaldo Ruffato (President of the Regional Council). All of them were former members of Forza Italia/The People of Freedom, but Sandro Sandri, a splinter from Liga Veneta–Lega Nord. At the national level, the party's high-ranking member is Maurizio Sacconi, NCD former leader in the Senate.
Despite the bad relations between NCD and Lega Nord in Rome, the regional party was a strong supporter of Luca Zaia and a loyal coalition partner of Liga Veneta until 2015. NCD also distinguishes itself as a keen proponent of the transformation of Veneto into a special-statute autonomous region.
In the 2015 regional election NCD formed a joint list with the Union of the Centre (under the banner of Popular Area) and supported Flavio Tosi, Liga Veneta's former leader and splinter, for President. The list won a mere 2.0% of the vote, but its leader Marino Zorzato was re-elected to the Regional Council.

William Crooke (6 August 1848 – 25 October 1923) was a British orientalist and a key figure in the study and documentation of Anglo-Indian folklore. He was born in County Cork, Ireland, and was educated at Erasmus Smith's Tipperary Grammar School and Trinity College, Dublin.
Crooke joined the Indian Civil Service. While an administrator in India, he found abundant material for his researches in the ancient civilizations of the country. He found ample time to write much on the people of India, their religions, beliefs and customs. He was also an accomplished hunter.
Although Crooke was a gifted administrator, his career in the ICS lasted only 25 years because of personality clashes with his superiors. He returned to England and in 1910, he was chosen to be the president of the Anthropological Section of the British Association. In 1911, having been for many years a member of the council of the Folklore Society, he was elected its president. Re-elected as president of the society in the following year, he then became the editor of its journal, Folk-lore, in 1915. He continued in this last position until his death at a nursing home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, on 25 October 1923.
Crooke received various honours later in life, including degrees from the universities of Oxford and Dublin and a fellowship of the British Academy.
Early life
William Crooke was born on 6 August 1848 in Macroom, County Cork. He was one of three sons of an English family that had been settled in Ireland for many years. His father, Warren, was a doctor. He was educated at Erasmus Smith's Tipperary Grammar School, then won a scholarship to Trinity College, Dublin. He graduated from there with a BA degree.
Indian Civil Service
In 1871, Crooke passed the competitive examination for the Indian Civil Service (ICS). He arrived in India on 2 November and spent his entire 25-year tenure in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, the area where the Indian Rebellion of 1857 had come close to causing the collapse of British control in India and which had resulted in jurisdiction being taken from the hands of the British East India Company in favour of direct control by the British government. During this time, he held charge as Magistrate and Collector of various districts such as Etah, Saharanpur, Gorakhpur and Mirzapur, and would have held sole power over around 300,000 people with regard to judicial and revenue matters. His near-contemporary, Richard Carnac Temple (1850–1931) described Crooke's work as an "uneventful though strenuous official life" and noted that Crooke had the time to demonstrate his skills in hunting tigers.
Ethnology while in India
In the aftermath of the 1857 revolt, members of the ICS such as Temple believed that if a similar event was to be avoided in the future then it was necessary to obtain a better understanding of their colonial subjects and in particular those from the rural areas. Crooke engaged such a process, working with those subjects in his official capacity and also studying them, although he noted that it was impossible to do both simultaneously because if he asked any general questions during official business then he would be "met with coldness or distrust, or will suddenly find himself unable to make himself unintelligible in the local dialect." These amateur studies led to his 1888 book, A Rural and Agricultural Glossary of the NW Provinces and Oudh, following his contributions to The Indian Antiquary that began in 1882.
Crooke had a burst of activity as a published ethnologist in the field. This began in 1890 when he took over a journal previously edited by Temple, who had moved to Burma. Over the next six years, Crooke's output in the field of ethnography was considerable, comprising the journal, two volumes of Popular Religion and Folklore and the four volumes that make up Tribes and Castes of the North Western Provinces; in addition, he continued to contribute to journals produced by other people.
Notes and Queries
Temple's journal was renamed from Punjab Notes and Queries to North Indian Notes and Queries and first appeared under that new name in 1891. Published from Allahabad, Sadhana Naithani believes that the journal demonstrates "the emergence and growth of that brand of ethnography for which Crooke should be better known and in which he differs from most other colonial ethnographers." The defining feature of the journal was that it considered its subjects in the context of the popular culture of the present day rather than dwelling on the past.
Crooke changed the focus of Temple's journal, which had previously contained material from across south Asia but henceforth concentrated on the subject of North India and, in particular, on those areas where Crooke believed the dominant language to be of an Aryan variety. The April 1891 edition made this clear:
Although intended for the British audience in India, as were numerous other such publications of the time, it was Indians who provided almost all of the content for the revised Notes and Queries format. One in particular featured heavily: Pandit Ram Gharib Chaube. An eager Indian scholar, Chaube first contributed in 1892 and thereafter his input accounted for around a third of each edition, which was rather more than even Crooke supplied. It initially maintained Temple's coverage of a vast range of subjects, from antiquities through folklore, philology, history, numismatology, ethnology, sociology and religion, as well as examining fields such as arts and manufacture. However, the focus soon narrowed to cover four subject areas, being religion, anthropology, folktales and miscellany. The folktales section had been renamed from "folklore" and its emphasis changed from documenting ancient remedies and suchlike to recording traditional stories.
The work on folklore was to prove important, according to Naithani, even though it came towards the end of a prolonged period during which various missionaries and British colonial officials had been documenting the phenomenon. Unlike many other such collections of the time, Notes and Queries generally acknowledged the people who provided folklore information, noted their precise location in the region and also tried to gather information from a broad spectrum of society, although this did not extend as far as including the input of women. It was work in which Chaube was heavily involved as a methodical collector, collator and translator, and the output was based on what were considered to be scientific principles of analysis and depiction. Naithani says of Notes and Queries that
Notes and Queries may not have been well received by the governing elite of the day. Naithani has suggested that Crooke's provision of this outlet for the Indian voices which lamented the loss of the past and the drive towards what the British deemed to be civilisation could have been one reason why he was marginalised within the bureaucracy. The journal ceased publication on his retirement from the ICS, with Rose noting that this was because of "the prevailing apathy and utter lack of official support".
Popular Religion and Folklore
Crooke's Popular Religion and Folklore was more successful with the British audience than had been Notes and Queries. It was published firstly in 1894, quickly selling out and then being re-issued as a two volume revised and illustrated edition in 1896. This pair of volumes examined the reality of Hindu worship in northern India from the perspective of its popular manifestation. In rural areas, practical Hinduism differed dramatically from organised vedic Hinduism and included cult worship of a multitude of local deities which were not formally recognised by the vedas but exerted a greater influence on the rhythms, meanings and decisions of day-to-day life. Crooke's study may have been the first to look at the religion through eyes other than those of missionaries or the Hindu elite and was in the opinion of Naithani, "a counter to the established school of German and British indology, which was obsessed with scriptures, palm-leaf manuscripts and their translation, and the exact age of Indian civilisation ... [It] sought to fill a gap in European intellectual knowledge of India by documenting living traditions in a serious and accessible manner. Crooke conformed to the colonial program but gave it a new interpretation."
Chaube, who was an intelligent scholar with a BA from Presidency College in Calcutta, subsequently claimed to have assisted with much information in Popular Religion and he resented that his input was not acknowledged by Crooke. His contribution to Tribes and Castes of the North Western Provinces, published in 1896, was only briefly acknowledged in two footnotes. The relative contributions to the latter have been described by Chandrashekhar Shukl: "While Chaube was going places collecting information, Crooke used to sometimes delve into collecting tit bits." Crooke did, however, pay Chaube well and he did so from his own pocket.
A third edition was in preparation at the time of Crooke's death.
Tribes and Castes
The four volumes of Tribes and Castes of the North Western Provinces – the area now encompassed by Uttar Pradesh – were produced for the Raj government, as a part of the Ethnographic Survey of India project that had been initiated in 1901.
It has been noted by modern academics, such as Thomas R. Metcalf and Crispin Bates, that Crooke was involved in a contemporary debate regarding the nature of caste. Whereas Crooke was among those who believed caste to be defined by occupation, that someone was born into a community that traditionally performed work such as cow-herding or barbering, Herbert Hope Risley believed that there was a racial definition and went to considerable lengths to collect anthropometric data to support his position. Bates believes that Crooke was Risley's "principal rival and critic" in this debate. According to Susan Bayly
Studies in retirement
Crooke left India in 1896 after 25 years service spent entirely in the Northwestern Provinces and Oudh. He received a generous pension, as was usual for employees of the ICS, and returned to England with a reputation for scholarship, particularly in the field of folklore. According to Horace Rose he was "too outspoken a critic of the mechanically efficient 'Secretariat' system" to find favour with his superiors, hence his relatively early retirement.
Thereafter, Crooke spent his time working principally on matters relating to the study of India and of folklore generally. Aside from contributing articles for the Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics and for journals such as Folk-lore and those of the (Royal) Anthropological Institute, he wrote books including Things Indian, and Northern India (for the Native Races of the British Empire series). He also edited several other works, such as the memorial edition of Risley's The People of India, Fryer's New Account of East India and Persia and James Tod's Annals of Rajast'han. Crooke was the editor of the second edition (published 1903) of the dictionary of Anglo-Indian usage and loan words Hobson-Jobson, "add[ing] a few entries and some further quotations, and correct[ing] some etymologies". Among his various studies that were wholly unrelated to India was a draft book called Homeric Folk-Lore; although this was never published, an article on the subject was printed.
Crooke also had an interest in archaeological matters and produced a paper – The Rude Stone Monuments of India – for the Proceedings of the Cotteswold Naturalists' Field Club in 1905. In 1911 he was President of that body and delivered his Address on the theme of The importance of anthropological investigation. He was also a member of The Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society, of which he sat on the Council in 1901 and 1917.
Family
Crooke was somewhat detached from his much younger wife, Alice, and their five sons, as indeed he had been when in India. They had married in 1884 and one of his grandchildren has said that "Well, it was a strange marriage". Three of the sons predeceased him, two of whom died in World War I.
Legacy
In 1919 Crooke was awarded a DSc by the University of Oxford and also became a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE). In 1920 he was awarded a DLitt, by the University of Dublin and in 1923 he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy.
Rose wrote of Crooke's contribution to studies of India that
Richard Mercer Dorson describes Crooke as "the central figure in Anglo-Indian folklore". However, in his role as an editor he has been viewed sometimes as adopting an interventionist approach, as with his work on Tod's Annals and Antiquities of Rajast'han or the Central and Western Rajpoot States of India which Norbert Peabody believes under Crooke's hand may have become "a cipher for interpreting the Hindu political order writ large".

"A God Walks into Abar" is the eighth episode of the HBO superhero drama miniseries Watchmen, based on the 1986 DC Comics series of the same name by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. It was written by Jeff Jensen and Damon Lindelof and directed by Nicole Kassell, and aired on December 8, 2019. The episode centers on the character of Doctor Manhattan and events of his life after the comic.
Synopsis
In 2009, on the anniversary of VVN (Victory in Vietnam) Day, Angela Abar, then a police officer in Saigon, is met by Doctor Manhattan in a bar. Manhattan introduces himself and asks Angela to dinner the next night. Angela initially doesn't believe Manhattan, as numerous people are dressed as him for the holiday. After explaining how he experiences time simultaneously, Manhattan says that after leaving Earth in 1985, he had been on Europa, creating life in a closed ecosystem. He had created clones of Phillips and Crookshanks, the lord and lady of a British manor who had housed him and his father after they escaped Nazi Germany in the 1930s. Manhattan explains that, after he surreptitiously witnessed the two having sex, Phillip and Crookshanks encouraged him to create something beautiful. After creating life on Europa, he teleported the manor there for the clones, but eventually left because of the clones' obsession with pleasing and worshiping him.
Angela continues to doubt Manhattan's identity and his reasons for his interest in her. Manhattan explains events of the future to her, knowing she will help him during a period in time that he cannot foresee. In two weeks' time, Angela helps Manhattan select a body from a morgue to take on its human appearance to avoid detection. He adopts the persona of Calvin Jelani, who had recently died of a presumed heart attack. In six months, Angela becomes frustrated with Manhattan's lack of empathy. Manhattan visits Adrian Veidt, who has isolated himself at Karnak, his Antarctica base. Seeing that Manhattan has fallen in love, Veidt offers him a small device he had created in 1985, originally intended as a weapon to use against Manhattan. The device uses tachyons to inhibit Manhattan's memory, rendering him unable to use his powers except in life-or-death circumstances. In exchange, Manhattan offers to teleport Veidt to his Europa ecosystem, where the Phillips and Crookshanks clones will serve and adore him as he so desires.
Before allowing Angela to use the device on him, Manhattan visits Will in New York City, explaining he will need to help his granddaughter Angela in 2019.
In 2019, after Angela removes Veidt's device, Manhattan tells her that he is aware of the Seventh Kavalry's plan to capture him, and teleports their children to safety with Will in downtown Tulsa. Angela realizes Manhattan is speaking simultaneously to her in 2019 and to Will in 2009, and demands Manhattan ask Will how he knew of Judd's connection to Cyclops. Will, in 2009, tells Manhattan that he does not know Judd, and Angela realizes that she gave Will the idea to kill Judd that started the events of the series. Manhattan states the Kavalry are about to attack. Angela, despite knowing that Manhattan is aware of the future, prepares to defend him; Manhattan tells her this was the moment he fell in love with her. The two kill most of the Kavalry, but the last one fires a tachyon cannon to capture him, to Angela's anguish.
In Vietnam 2009, Angela accepts Manhattan's story and invitation to dinner.
In a post-credits scene, Veidt is punished by the Phillips and Crookshanks clones for wanting to leave. In his cell, the Game Warden brings him an anniversary cake. It is revealed that the Game Warden was the first Phillips clone created by Manhattan. After the Warden leaves, Veidt discovers a horseshoe baked into the cake, and begins to use it to escape.
Production
The episode was directed by Nicole Kassell, who also directed the series' first two episodes. Kassell stated that Yahya Abdul-Mateen II played Doctor Manhattan throughout the episode, including within the bar scenes. As Dr. Manhattan, Abdul-Mateen spoke outside of his normal voice range. The choice to not reveal his face during these scenes was part of Damon Lindelof and Jeff Jensen's script. They also feared that showing Manhattan's face at this point would cause fans of the limited series to be disappointed and upset, regardless of what approach they used for matching the comic. As shooting a conversation where only one person's face would be visible, Kassell worked with cinematographer Greg Middleton to establish what blocking shots they would use to avoid excessive repetition through these scenes, as well as how they would transition in and out of these scenes.
Abdul-Mateen had accepted the role of Cal before knowing he would also be Doctor Manhattan; he was only told this between filming of the second and third episodes. Because he knew this would likely involve him being naked, he hired a personal trainer and started a diet to be able to present a good body image for the camera. Makeup to cover Abdul-Mateen took about two and a half hours of airbushing, while removing the makeup took another hour of washing with solvents.
The Vietnamese bar was modeled after Eddie's bar in Vietnam in the comic. The episode included scenes from within Karnak, Veidt's Antarctica base, and Kassell directed some shots to be nearly identical to those from the comic. In the flashback to young Jon Osterman's time at the manor, an illustrated Bible is shown to him. The illustrations were drawn by Dave Gibbons, the illustrator of the original limited series, who served as a consultant on the TV series.
The episode featured the series' only post-credits scene with Veidt after being put on trial. Kassell said that they opted to use a post-credits scene to avoid disrupting the calculated flow of the rest of the episode, comparing the scene to the comic's additional material after each chapter.
The title of the episode was a happenstance, according to Kassell. They had given Angela the surname "Abar" early in development. Later, as they were storyboarding episodes, Kassell had seen one of the writers had put down "...walks into a bar..." as a concept for this episode, and on seeing that, realized the serendipitous nature of the Abar name.

Sasia is a genus of birds in the family Picidae, that are native to the Old World. They are very small, virtually tailless woodpeckers, with a crombec or nuthatch-like appearance and foraging habits. Their habitat is forest and secondary growth.
All three species have a flesh orbital ring and a rounded (in cross-section) upper mandible. The African species has only eight rectrices but four toes in a zygodactyl arrangement (a weak first digit), while the two Asian species have ten rectrices and only three toes (absent first digit, or hallux). In addition the African species differs from the Asian species in plumage colour of the adult, but not at all in plumage pattern, body anatomy or in habits.
Their relationship with genus Picumnus has not been established, and the Picumninae may be either monophyletic or paraphyletic.

Inverness is a heritage-listed detached house at 58 Fulham Street, Toogoolawah, Somerset Region, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by John Henry Burley and built in 1917 by D A Menzies. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.
History
Inverness was erected in 1917 for the Nestle & Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company Limited, as the manager's residence associated with their Toogoolawah condensed milk factory.
The enterprise had been established in 1898 by the McConnel family on part of their Cressbrook estate, and was known as the Cressbrook Dairy Company's Condensed Milk Factory. An early manager's residence of timber and iron was erected adjacent to the factory about the same time.
The village of Cressbrook grew around the factory. With the arrival of the railway linking the town to Ipswich in 1904, the town expanded and was renamed Toogoolawah.
In 1907 the Nestle & Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company bought out the Cressbrook Dairy Company, comprising the condensed milk factory and at least eight Cressbrook farms. At the time, Queensland was the only place in the world in which Nestle invested in company-owned farms. The factory was expanded and the number of employees doubled.
Production rose during the First World War, and in 1917 a more prestigious company residence, Inverness, was erected on part of Nestle's Bellambi Farm, on the hill adjacent to the township. The large home reflected the manager's status in a prosperous factory town.
It was designed by Brisbane architect John Henry Burley. His use of asbestos cement roofing tiles and interior wall sheeting was amongst the earliest application of these products in Queensland.
The builder was local contractor DA Menzies, who erected most of the buildings constructed in Toogoolawah until the mid-1920s.
The residence was occupied in 1917 by Archibald C Munro, manager of the factory from 1909 to 1931, and his family. The Munros named the house Inverness, after the district in Scotland from which AC Munro's father had emigrated. They employed a permanent gardener, cook and housemaid.
Nestle closed the bulk of the factory in 1929, retaining some secondary production until December 1930. The farms were sold, and the population of Toogoolawah halved. The Munros left the manager's residence in 1931.
During the Second World War, Nestle stored their Brisbane records in the old factory, and female staff were accommodated at Inverness. In 1948 the house was sold. It remains a private residence on just over .
The factory was destroyed by fire in 1951, and the site was sold in 1956.
Description
Inverness is a large, single-storeyed timber house, situated on the hill top above Toogoolawah. The building shows influences of stylistic trends popular around Federation in the treatment of decorative elements.
The hipped roof has projecting gables above the front entrance, side verandah entrance and billiards room. The roof features decorative eaves and gables with diamond patterned asbestos (Durabestos) shingles and decorative terra-cotta ridges and finials. The two chimneys are tapered and rendered.
The building sits on timber stumps. Verandahs are situated on the eastern, northern and western elevations with tapered timber brackets and valances and vertical timber paling balustrading. Corners are treated differently, with verandah posts being closer together and the timber valance consisting of open vertical railing.
The main entrance is approached from a circular drive to a double staircase and symmetrical entrance porch. The entrance features floral motif leadlight panels in the door and fanlight.
Internal walls are clad in asbestos cement with timber cover strips, the patterns of which vary from room to room. Service rooms are clad in VJ boards.
Internal doors feature fanlights above, and rooms open onto the verandahs via French doors. Rooms to the rear of the building have double-hung sash windows with window hoods of timber and Durabestos shingles.
The entrance hall features a fireplace with timber surrounds and a decorative screen to the rear. Fireplaces also feature in the dining room and bedrooms one and two. A wall between the entrance hall and drawing room has been removed, and the kitchen layout has been altered.
A laundry structure with a skillion roof is attached to the rear of the building with a brick cellar under the kitchen area.

The Paston Way is a footpath. It is entirely within the English county of Norfolk in the United Kingdom. The footpath is twenty miles in length, the portals to the path are Cromer at its northwestern end and North Walsham at it southeastern end.
The Designation
The Paston way takes its name from the Paston Family who during the Medieval and Tudor periods were the dominant and wealthy landowners in which much of the trail passes. The Paston Family in turn had taken their name after the north eastern coastal village of Paston. Their origins were from Wulston, one of William the Conqueror's men who arrived with him in 1066.
Description of the Route
Section 1
Starting at the southeastern end, the path begins at the Parish Church of St Nicholas in the town of North Walsham. This is also the path's conjunction with the Weavers Way. Leaving the church the route heads northwards along the old Mundesley road out of the town. On the outskirts of the town the path follows the track bed of the disused Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway Company which linked North Walsham to Cromer. The path crosses the North Walsham & Dilham Canal at Swafield. Knapton Cutting, as this part of the trail is known, is also a nature and Butterfly reserve. This section is an area of wild flowers, brambles, scrub and undisturbed grassy banks, which make it an ideal habitat for butterflies. Nineteen different species have been recorded. Another couple of miles through quiet lanes brings the path to Knapton. Knapton Parish church is called St Peters and Paul's and marks the end of the first section of the route.
Section 2
It is worth a visit to see the roof inside Knapton Church with its ornate Double hammer beam roof.
From Knapton the path heads south east across several open fields towards the village of Edingthorpe. The approach to the village is up a gently sloping farm track towards Edingthorpe Parish church which is called All Saints.
Section 3
The 'way' continues on from All Saints northwest towards the coast and the village of Bacton. A little way along this section a detour can be made at church farm. Take the path north to Paston. Visit the parish church of St Margaret's. inside can be seen the impressive Paston Monuments to the family that gave the trail its name. Retrace your footsteps to church farm and then continue on down the winding lane to Bacton Church.
Section 4
Bacton church is called St Andrews which is approached via an attractive avenue of trees which is in sharp contrast to the Bacton Gas Interconnector Terminal that dominates the horizon behind.
The ‘Way' passes through the churchyard and out across open farm land towards the North Sea coast at the western end of the village. The next three miles take a route along the beach passing by the Gas terminal. At Mundesley the rout follows the main coast road to the northern tip of the village and to All Saints Church.
Section 5
The route now heads back inland towards the next village of Gimingham this part of the trail passes through the valley of the River Mun. The countryside along this section is pleasant and very peaceful. One usual sight to the north of the ‘Trail' is the giant white sphere which can be glimpsed occasionally. This is the Trimingham Early warning station which is in fact part of RAF Neatishead. The path enters the village of Gimingham past the rebuilt old corn watermill and the preserved steam engine. Like Mundesley, Gimingham parish church is called All Saints. It is south down the main street from the engine. From this point there is an optional tour which takes in the villages of Trunch, Swafield, Bradfield and then back on itself to Trimingham and its unusually named church St John the Baptist's Head.
Section 6
From Gimingham the path heads towards Southrepps via a lane known as Jack o' Lantern's Lane. The lane is reputed to be the territory of the Lantern man who lures all travellers to their doom. The parish church of Southrepps is called St James. Note the corbels and gargoyles high up on this church. At this point if you wish to visit the church and village, you must walk south into the village and then retrace your footsteps back to rejoin the Paston Way.
Section 7
From Southrepps the path takes a route to the south of Frogshall Hamlet along the ancient farm lanes towards the coastal village of Overstrand. There are two detours made on this section the first is to the village of Northrepps.
Detour A
Northrepps parish church is called St Mary the Virgin, retrace your footstep back to Paston Way or pass through the village turning east over Hungry Hill and take the second detour.
Detour B
Sidestrand has been forever personified as "Poppyland" having been described as such by Clement Scott In 1883. The Daily Telegraph printed an article which Scott had written about a visit to the north Norfolk coast. He became enamored of the district and gave it the name Poppyland. His writing was responsible for members of the London theatre set visiting and investing in homes in the area. It is in this part of the world that he is perhaps best remembered, but ironically, he was unhappy at the result of his popularization of the area. Sidestrand small parish church is called St Michael and All Angels. This church was moved stone by stone 1880 a third of a mile inland to prevent it from falling into the sea due to coastal erosion. Previous to this date the church had already suffered the loss of its tower in 1841 when it was washed down the cliff after a heavy storm.
Section 8
Return to Hungry Hill via Sandy lane and the Shrieking pit which legend has it was the scene of the demise of a young maiden lured to her death by evil spirits. Then the path moves on to Northrepps and then turn north towards Overstrand down Toll's Hill, once the site of a warning beacon during the time of the Napoleonic wars. The route now enters the village and back to the shoreline there. Overstrand Parish church is called St Martin's and Priscilla Buxton is buried there.
Section 9
The last section of Paston way is between Overstrand and Cromer. The route follows the coastline here although an alternative is to follow the coast road. This part of the coastline is reputed to be the stalking ground of Legendary hellhound Black Shuck. And so on to Cromer and the Parish Church of St Peter and Saint Paul. The tower of the church is 160 ft high and is well worth a visit and also marks the end of Paston Way. The path links with the North Norfolk Coastal Path/Peddars Way and the UK National Trails Network.

Jim Fouratt (born 23 June 1941) is a gay rights activist, actor, and former nightclub impresario. He is best known for his involvement with the Stonewall riots and as co-founder of the Danceteria.
Early life
Fouratt was raised in a working class Catholic home in Riverside, Rhode Island. He attended the La Salle Academy in Providence. After high school he was accepted into Harvard University but could not attend for financial reasons, instead he began studies at St. Peter's Seminary in Baltimore. In 1960, he was kicked out for homosexuality and moved to New York City.
Activism
Fouratt took up political activism more seriously in 1965, after being arrested in Times Square at America's first Anti-Vietnam War demonstration. In 1967 he was one of the organizers of the famous Central Park Be In. That same year he cofounded the Yippies, a youth-oriented countercultural movement, alongside Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krasner.
Fouratt was at the first night of what he calls the Stonewall 'Rebellion', a term he prefers over "Stonewall Riots."I happened to be coming home from my job at Columbia Records. I saw a sole police car outside of the Stonewall Inn. I was out in the New Left movement and the anti-war movement and there was an incredible amount of homophobia—in the old and new left. Like a good '60s radical, I went to see why that car was there. There might have been 20 people around—this was 10:30 at night.On the third night of the rebellion, Fouratt co-founded the Gay Liberation Front, the first of many lesbian and gay liberation movements that sprouted across the country in the following months.
Fouratt was a founding member of the Lesbian and Gay Community Service Center, the Gay Community Service Center, and Wipe Out AIDS (now known as H.E.A.L). He was active in ACT UP, serving on the media committee with Michael Signorile and Jay Blotcher.
In 2009, Fouratt took part in the Democratic primary against City Council Speaker Christine Quinn. He claims to have raised $20,000 in two weeks, but later withdrew. In 2016, Fouratt ran for State Assembly but lost to Deborah Glick. He is a member of the Village Independent Democrats club.
Other Work
Music and nightlife
In 1969 Fouratt worked as an assistant to Clive Davis.
In 1978, Fourrat became the manager for the club Hurrah where he brought in DJs to create the first "rock disco," with music videos playing as well as live music acts. He also worked at Pop Front, and Studio 54.
In 1980, he opened the nightclub Danceteria with Rudolf Pieper. In November 1980, Pieper and Fouratt had prepared to open the New Peppermint Lounge night club, but were pushed out by Frank Roccio and Tom Goodkind. In June 1982, Pieper and Fouratt became embroiled in a legal battle, and Fouratt was pushed out.
In the early 1990s, Fouratt served as director of national publicity at Rhino Records, and from 1995 to 1999, Fouratt was the vice president of A&R at Mercury Records. In the late 1990s, Fouratt attempted to launch the sub-imprint Beauty Records, but that project ended when PolyGram, Mercury's parent corporation, was bought by Seagram's, and Fouratt's acts were let go.
Journalism
Fouratt has been pop culture critic for Billboard and Rolling Stone and a contributing editor at Spin. Additionally, he has written for The Village Voice, The Advocate, Bay Area Reporter, and Gay City News. He is currently an editor for Westview News.
Acting
Fouratt studied for seven years with Lee Strasberg in the early '60s. Fouratt was a member of the Open Theater, and performed at Café Cino and La MaMa. He joined Actors Equity and made his Broadway debut in The Freaking Out of Stephanie Blake. He worked with the National Shakespeare Theatre in Cambridge.
Personal life
In 1969, Fouratt asked his lover Peter Hujar to take a photograph for a Gay Liberation Front recruitment poster. The image is now one of the most iconic of the gay liberation movement. Hujar's boyfriend at the time, Jim Fouratt, arrived on the scene to organize for the Gay Liberation Front (GLF), the first political group to cite homosexuality in its name. Hujar agreed to make a photograph for a GLF poster. The poster, portraying a jubilant group of GLF members under the slogan COME OUT!!, appeared in late spring 1970 in advance of the gay liberation march that marked the first anniversary of Stonewall.Fouratt has faced criticism for his comments on transgender identities and transsexualism, which he views as a method "to make gay men and lesbians straight." He believes that transgender identity reinforces gender stereotypes and that trans discourse is marginalizing the experiences of gays and lesbians. However, in a 2015 Facebook post, he wrote "I support the right of each person to control their body. Period. Fighting the conscription of socially policed gender behavior is an essential fight."
In 2009, when asked by Stephen Colbert if there was a leader in the gay community on par with Martin Luther King Jr., Fouratt said "Well, I would like to think that I'm that leader."
Fouratt previously lived with Carl Miller, Allen Young, and Giles Kotcher in the Seventeenth Street commune.

Oluwafemi Abayomi Alaba "Femi" Ilesanmi (born 18 April 1991) is an English semi-professional footballer who plays as a defender for National League club Boreham Wood.
Ilesanmi started his career with AFC Wimbledon's youth system, making his first-team debut in 2007 before transferring to Queens Park Rangers in 2008, where he played for the under-18 team. He spent a year at QPR where he also played for the reserve team, before his release. He signed for Isthmian League Premier Division club Ashford Town (Middlesex) in February 2010. His form prompted newly promoted League One club Dagenham & Redbridge to sign him in May 2010. He spent three months on loan at Conference Premier club Histon in 2010. Ilesanmi spent four years with Dagenham & Redbridge before joining York City in May 2014, where he played for two seasons before being released.
Club career
Early career
Ilesanmi was born in Southwark, London to Nigerian parents. He started his career with AFC Wimbledon in their youth system. Despite his young age, he made a handful of appearances for the reserve team and also made his first-team debut aged 16 in an Isthmian League Cup match against Whyteleafe in October 2007. He spent nearly a full season with Wimbledon before moving to Queens Park Rangers' under-18 team in 2008. He spent a season at Loftus Road, featuring for both the youth team and the reserves before being released in 2009. After his release he joined League Two club Dagenham & Redbridge on non-contract terms. Whilst on trial he featured several times for the reserves. He also had a brief spell spent on trial at Conference Premier club Salisbury City, where he played for the reserves.
In February 2010, he signed for Isthmian League Premier Division club Ashford Town (Middlesex), where he spent a short spell. Ilesanmi scored his first goal for Ashford in a 2–1 home defeat to Carshalton Athletic. During the last few months of the 2009–10 season, Dagenham & Redbridge monitored Ilesanmi's performances. His last goal for the club came in the final match of the season, when he scored a bizarre goal from an attempted cross which put Ashford in the lead against Harrow Borough. However, Ashford went on to lose the match 6–2 and were relegated for the first time in their history. Ilesanmi made 12 appearances for Ashford, scoring two goals.
Dagenham & Redbridge
Dagenham & Redbridge were impressed with his performances at Ashford and again offered him a trial period with the club. The trial was successful and Ilesanmi signed a two-year contract with the newly promoted League One club in July 2010. In August 2010, he was sent out on loan to Conference Premier club Histon on an initial one-month loan with a view to extending further. His debut came on the opening day of the season in a 3–1 win over Barrow at home. He was sent off in his second match for Histon, a defeat to AFC Wimbledon, receiving his second booking for dissent. After impressing Histon manager David Livermore during his first month at the club, his loan was extended for a further two months. His final match for Histon came in a 1–1 draw with Wrexham on 30 October, where he provided the assist for a stoppage time equaliser. Ilesanmi had become a fan favourite at the club and plans were being made to bring him back on loan in January 2011. He returned to Dagenham having played 17 matches in all competitions for Histon.
Upon his return to Dagenham in November 2010, Ilesanmi impressed manager John Still in a behind closed door friendly. This persuaded him to hand Ilesanmi a surprise professional and league debut for Dagenham in a 1–0 defeat to Oldham Athletic, where he played in place of Damien McCrory. After his first six appearances, Ilesanmi signed a three-and-a-half-year contract extension until 2014. The club also decided to retain Ilesanmi and not send him back to Histon for a second loan spell. He cemented his place as first choice left back for Dagenham for the remainder of 2010–11. He received his first red card for Dagenham in March 2011, in a 1–1 draw with Leyton Orient when he brought down Paul-José M'Poku to concede a late penalty. The club appealed the red card as manager John Still believed that no contact was made. However, the appeal was rejected and Ilesanmi was suspended for two matches. Ilesanmi could not save Dagenham from relegation on the final match of the season when they lost 5–0 away to Peterborough United. Dagenham returned to League Two at the first time of asking after their only season in League One. Ilesanmi 25 appearances for Dagenham that season.
Ilesanmi started 2011–12 as understudy to Damien McCrory, making his first appearance of the season in the League Cup, a 5–0 defeat to AFC Bournemouth. His first league appearance of the season came in a 1–0 home defeat to Oxford United. He returned to the first team line-up in November 2011, which coincided with the club losing nine straight league matches. He remained first choice until February 2012, when he started in a 5–0 home defeat to Cheltenham Town. This proved to be his final appearance of the season, as Dagenham narrowly escaped successive relegation's to the Conference Premier. He made 26 appearances.
In May 2012, manager John Still made Ilesanmi available for transfer. After being transfer listed, Ilesanmi took it on himself to prove the management staff wrong by staying behind for extra training. He started the first match of the season in the League Cup, a 1–0 home defeat to Coventry City. He also started the first league match of the season, a 2–0 away defeat to Cheltenham Town. In November 2012, he thanked John Still for the transfer listing which gave him the "kick up the backside he needed", and resulted in him starting the season in fine form. This also included a fine performance in the 5–0 win over Rotherham United, where he provided two assists. His first professional goal and his first for Dagenham came in February 2013, a 2–1 defeat to league leaders Gillingham. He still remained first choice left back after the departure of manager John Still to Luton Town. Dagenham again narrowly avoided relegation to the Conference, this time on the final day of the season, despite losing 1–0 to York City. Ilesanmi played in every Dagenham match in the season, making 50 appearances scoring one goal.
Ilesanmi remained the first-choice left back for 2013–14. He started in Wayne Burnett's first match in full charge of Dagenham, a 3–1 away defeat to Fleetwood Town. In September 2013, he lost his place in the first team to young defender Jack Connors, who thrived during his spell in the team. Ilesanmi came back into the side for a Football League Trophy tie against Peterborough United. He played well despite Dagenham losing 1–0 and regained his first team place. Having made 32 appearances in 2013–14, Ilesanmi was released by Dagenham in May 2014, with Burnett saying "it was also the right time for him to move on, he's been a fantastic servant for this football club and I wish him every success".
York City
Ilesanmi joined League Two York City on 22 May 2014 on a two-year contract. He made his debut in York's 1–1 away draw with Tranmere Rovers in the opening match of 2014–15 on 9 August 2014. Ilesanmi was released by York at the end of 2015–16.
Boreham Wood and Dover Athletic
Ilesanmi joined National League club Boreham Wood on 5 August 2016, and was an unused substitute the following day in their 1–0 home win over Forest Green Rovers. His debut came on 13 August 2016, as a 76th-minute substitute for Adriano Moke in a 1–1 away draw with York. Ilesanmi made 51 appearances in 2016–17 as Boreham Wood finished 11th in the National League. He was released at the end of the season.
On 27 June 2017, Ilesanmi signed for National League club Dover Athletic on a one-year contract. He made his debut on 5 August 2017 in a 1–0 victory away to Hartlepool United.
Ilesanmi re-signed for National League club Boreham Wood on 25 June 2018.

The 301st Heavy Tank Battalion of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) was a Heavy Tank unit during World War I. Of the eight heavy battalions (the 301st to 308th) raised, only the 301st saw combat. The 301st was reorganized post-war into the 66th Infantry Regiment (Light Tanks), later to become the 66th Armor Regiment, the oldest armored regiment in the United States Army.
Formation
The 301st went many name changes being formed as the "1st Separate Tank Battalion, Heavy Tank Service, 65th Engineers." When it arrived at the Tank School in Bovington, UK it was redesignated the "41st Tank Battalion." In June of 1918 the AEF changed their naming system and which gave the unit its final name, 301st Heavy Tank Battalion. The British agreed to provide 47 Mark V Tanks to the Americans but only if the unit was attached to the British Fourth Army.
Operational history
The 301st, equipped with British Mark V heavy tanks, suffered large casualties in the Battle of St. Quentin Canal on 29 September as part of the British 4th Tank Brigade, under the control of the Australian Corps. Efforts were made to hide the Tanks moving up to the front lines by having Planes fly over German lines. The attack started at 5.50 a.m. in a thick mist. Some tanks were hit by shelling before the start line, while others were lost crossing an unreported British minefield. Of the 34 participating tanks, only 10 reached their objective. Of the crews of the 40 tanks of the 301st Battalion, 112 were casualties. The numbers broke down as three officers and 20 enlisted men were killed, seven officers and 55 enlisted men were severely wounded and eight officers and 15 enlisted men were slightly wounded, and one officer and six enlisted men missing.
The 301st then seized the village of Brancourt on 8 October, fought in the Battle of the Selle on October 17, 1918. During the fighting, the Tanks were required to cross the Selle River a tributary of the Somme. US planners were able to use low-flying aeroplane reconnaissance to select good shallow crossings and 19 tanks out of the 20 operating successfully crossed the stream.
Their four and final battle was the night attack on 22–23 October in the vicinity of the Sambre Canal. Nine Tanks from the 301st were assigned to the 1st British Division on German lines near Bazuel, south-east of Le Cateau. At H-hour, all nine Tanks moved forward rapidly, taking out German strong points. They moved so fast that their supporting infantry had trouble keeping up with them. All Tanks reached their objectives with only five casualties when one of the Tank crews was gassed but was successfully treated.
Post-war
The AEF Tank Corps was removed after 11 November 1918, armistice and remaining tank corps personnel transferred to the United States, where the Tank Corps, National Army was disbanded with the National Army in 1920. Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC), 304th Tank Brigade, Tank Corps transferred to Camp Meade, Maryland and consolidated with HHC, 305th Tank Brigade on 22 June 1921, reorganized and was redesignated HHC, 1st Tank Group. This organization was reorganized and redesignated HHC, 1st Tank Regiment on 1 September 1929. The 1st Tank Regiment was reorganized and redesignated the 66th Infantry Regiment (Light Tanks) on 25 October 1932. After the war, the 301st transitioned in the Regular Army to become the 66th Infantry Regiment (Light Tanks) by way of the 16th Tank Battalion.

SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom – Rehydrated is a 2020 platform game based on the Nickelodeon animated series SpongeBob SquarePants. It is a remake of the console versions of Heavy Iron Studios' SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom (2003), developed by Purple Lamp Studios and published by THQ Nordic for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Stadia, and mobile devices. It is the first major game in the series since SpongeBob HeroPants (2015) and the first since the death of the show's creator Stephen Hillenburg in 2018.
SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom – Rehydrated was released on June 23, 2020. Despite receiving mixed reviews, the game was a commercial success, selling over 2 million copies. A spiritual sequel, SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, is set for release in 2023.
Gameplay
The core gameplay involves collecting items and defeating the robots which have attacked various areas in Bikini Bottom while crossing platforms and avoiding environmental hazards like spikes and flames. Some areas require different characters to beat, as each character has its unique abilities. The player can control SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy. Switching characters requires the player to find a Bus Stop, upon using which the current character will switch to another, and using it again will switch back to the previous character, giving the player an option of two characters in each level. The default character throughout the game is SpongeBob; Sandy and Patrick do not share any levels as playable characters.
Throughout the game, the player will collect Shiny Objects, Socks, and Golden Spatulas. Shiny Objects are dropped by enemies and scattered throughout levels and can be used to pay clams to progress through levels and unlock extra challenges. They can also be traded with Mr. Krabs for Golden Spatulas. Socks are placed in levels in harder-to-reach locations, and 10 of them can be traded to Patrick for a Golden Spatula. Golden Spatulas are used to unlock new areas in the game, and 75 of them are required to fight the final boss.
A new addition to the remake is a multiplayer horde mode in which two players face waves of robotic enemies. The mode includes cut content from the original game, including a fight against a robotic Squidward, a scrapped version of Patrick's dream, and a cut phase of the Robo-SpongeBob fight.
Development and release
Development for Rehydrated began as early as January 2018, when THQ Nordic enlisted Purple Lamp Games as one of their developers. In March 2018, THQ Nordic announced plans for "the global revival of several game titles" for many older Nickelodeon properties. This led to speculation that they were planning to remake or re-release several Nickelodeon games, including Battle for Bikini Bottom.
Rehydrated was first officially announced on June 5, 2019, in the days leading up to E3 2019. The game was not playable until Gamescom, which started August 20 that year, where visitors could get their hands on it at THQ Nordic's booth. On April 16, 2020, it was announced that the game will be released on June 23, 2020. iOS and Android versions of the game were released on January 21, 2021.
The game is available in two limited editions on all platforms. The Shiny Edition includes wall stickers, six lithographs, special SpongeBob SquarePants tennis socks, and a figurine of SpongeBob with a flexible tongue and a golden spatula in his hand. In addition to that, the F.U.N. Edition also comes with two similarly sized figurines of Sandy Cheeks and Patrick Star, as well as a set of five tiki keyrings.
The game features both the original archival recordings from the main campaign, and new recordings, from the English voice cast, as well as new recordings from the French, German, Italian, Spanish (both Spain and Latin American), Polish and Japanese voice casts. It supports text and subtitles in Portuguese, Russian, Malay, Thai, Korean, and Simplified Chinese, alongside the languages mentioned above.
The game is powered by Unreal Engine 4 and supports 4K resolution on the enhanced PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One X models.
Reception
SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom – Rehydrated received "mixed or average reviews" according to Metacritic.
IGN gave the game 5/10, saying that it "sinks under its reverence to nostalgia" and wrote, "[T]here are bright spots that remain fun almost two decades later, and there are pops of ingenuity in its reworking, but it does little to stand alongside the best, or even the pretty good, platformer remakes and remasters we've seen this generation." In its 2/10 review, GameSpot wrote that "remasters, ports, and remakes are nice because they make games more accessible to new audiences, and the ones that excel understand that some features from the game's era are antiquated and should be updated or removed. SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom – Rehydrated flops like a fish out of water when it comes to this." They concluded that the game "winds up being an unpleasant nostalgia trip that nobody should pack their bags for."
Sales
SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom – Rehydrated placed at 19 on NPD's list of top 20 sales in the month of June. In the UK, Rehydrated was the 3rd bestselling video game software in the week of June 27, 2020.
On August 13, 2020, Rehydrated was announced to have sold over 1 million copies. As of May 19, 2021, it reached more than 2 million copies.
In January 2021, THQ Nordic CEO Klemens Kreuzer called Rehydrated a "fantastic success" due to its sales and hinted at the potential for similar games to be developed by the studio in the future. A spiritual sequel, SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, was announced on September 17, 2021, as a part of THQ Nordic's tenth-anniversary showcase. The game is scheduled for release on Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in 2023.

Johnny Murtagh (born 14 May 1970) is an Irish flat racing trainer and former jockey from Bohermeen, near Navan, Kells, County Meath. As a jockey he won many of the major flat races in Europe, including all the Irish Classics, all the Group 1 Races at Royal Ascot, The Derby, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes and Europe's biggest race the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. He was also Irish flat racing Champion Jockey five times. As a trainer, based at stables near Kildare, he has saddled a winner at Royal Ascot and an Irish Classic winner.
Background
Murtagh was born in Navan, County Meath. He was a keen amateur boxer as a young boy and was once Irish boy's under-14 boxing champion. He also came close to joining Blackburn Rovers' youth football team.
At a boxing fight one evening in his native County Meath, a spectator advised his mother that Murtagh had the attributes to make a good jockey, balance, poise, weight, strength, courage. His mother wrote to the Racing Academy and Centre of Education (RACE) in County Kildare, a school for apprentice jockeys, and got a two-week trial for her son. He was one of 26 successful candidates who progressed onto the RACE 10-month course. At the end of the course, he was apprenticed to John Oxx, one of Ireland's leading trainers.
Career as jockey
Murtagh rode his first winner, Chicago Style, at Limerick in 1987.
He became stable jockey to Oxx in 1992, and from then until his departure in 2003, rode 18 Group 1 winners for Oxx's leading owner, the Aga Khan.
For Oxx, Murtagh rode Sinndar to win The Derby and Irish Derby, as well as the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 2000. He won the Derby again on the Michael Bell trained Motivator. Murtagh was also the regular jockey for talented filly Soviet Song. In 2004, the partnership won two Group 1 races, including the Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood. Here she beat a strong field of colts, including the 2,000 Guineas winner Haafhd.
From 2008 to 2010, he was stable jockey for Coolmore, taking over from the drug-banned Kieren Fallon. He had been riding for them on an ad-hoc basis since 2002, most notably winning the Derby on High Chaparral in 2002. In 2008, he rode 19 Group 1 winners in a single season for O'Brien (21 in total for Coolmore), and followed it up in 2009 with another 10, including the Irish Derby, Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, Sussex Stakes, Ascot Gold Cup, St. James's Palace Stakes and an Irish 1,000 and 2,000 Guineas double.
He resigned his post as stable jockey to Coolmore in November 2010, issuing a statement via his agent to say he had informed Coolmore he wouldn't be renewing his contract. No reason was given but there was speculation that O'Brien was looking for another jockey, and on his recent return from the Breeders Cup at Churchill Downs, where he had ridden four losers for O'Brien, one bookmaker had been offering odds on his replacement. His last Group 1 winner for the team was Roderic O'Connor in the Criterium International at Saint-Cloud on 31 October 2010.
This meant he was back riding for Oxx who trained 90 of the Aga Khan's horses, and additionally for Mick Halford who trained 30.
"I am thrilled to be renewing my association with His Highness' horses in Ireland," Murtagh said in a statement, "We have shared some fantastic moments over the years and I have always enjoyed riding in the green and red colours. This will also give me an opportunity to ride for John Oxx again. I started off riding for Mr Oxx and it has always been a pleasure to be part of his Currabeg team".
In February 2014, Murtagh announced that he would retire from riding to concentrate on his training career.
Career as trainer
Murtagh obtained his trainer's licence in 2013. In his first season he achieved a Group 2 and two Group 3 wins, including the Blandford Stakes with Belle de Crecy and the British Champions Long Distance Cup with Royal Diamond, riding the horses himself. His first Group 1 winner as a trainer was Champers Elysees in the Matron Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse in September 2020. His first win at Royal Ascot as a trainer came in 2021, when Create Belief, ridden by stable jockey Ben Coen, won the Sandringham Stakes. Later that season, Sonnyboyliston provided the trainer with his first Irish Classic win when Coen rode him to victory in the Irish St. Leger.
Personal life
He is married to Orla, daughter of famous Tipperary hurler Michael "Babs" Keating, and has five children, Caroline, Charles, Lauren, Grace and Tom.

Giraltovce (, ) is a town in the Prešov Region of eastern Slovakia.
History
The town was first mentioned in 1383 as Giralth. It was named after a man called Geralth who was first hereditary scultetus (a locator serving a noble in founding a new village). The town was founded in the 13th century. In 1427 it was the property of the Széchy family, a few years later it belonged to the Somosy family. The scultetus had a leading role in the village. They acted as the representative of the village before the landlords, regional and religious authorities. They controlled villagers to pay their taxes. Moreover, they had also right of minor magistracy. Their rights were more restricted by changes in the 16th century. In the 17th century, the institution of hereditary scultetus in the village expired. Since that moment, local villagers voted their Chief Magistrate ("Richter").
The most privileged part of inhabitants of the village was nobility, who built at least two mansions there. Moreover, János Semsey conducted to build in the village the temple of the Lutheran church (1650 - 1654), which was the first temple built in the village.

The varzea piculet (Picumnus varzeae) is a species of bird in the family Picidae, the woodpeckers, piculets, and wrynecks. It is endemic to Brazil's Amazon basin where it occurs in seasonally flooded Várzea forests, which gives the bird its common name. Its natural habitat is tropical moist lowland forest, and as the trees are progressively being cleared in the Amazon basin, the population of the bird is declining, and as a consequence, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated it as an "endangered species".
Taxonomy
This species was first described in 1912 by the German-Brazilian ornithologist Emilie Snethlage who collected birds in Brazil for two decades. The specific name refers to "várzea", the Brazilian name for the seasonally flooded forested area close to the Amazon River. There are no subspecies. This bird occasionally hybridises with the white-barred piculet (Picumnus cirratus).
Description
The varzea piculet is a small species, some in length. The male differs from the female in having variable amounts of red on the fore and mid-crown; this red patch is the result of the crown feathers having broad red tips, and the rest of the crown in males and the whole crown in females is black with white speckles. The upper parts of the body are chocolate-brown, sometimes with an olive tinge, and occasionally slightly barred with black. The tail is deep brown apart from the central pair of feathers, which are whitish, and the two outer pairs of feathers which have a whitish bar near the tip. The underparts are some shade of brown with light barring and streaking in darker brown and white. The iris is brown, the beak is black and the legs and feet are bluish-grey. The juvenile is similar to the female but the underparts are more heavily barred. This piculet is unlikely to be confused with any other piculet because it is the only species in its range with dark underparts.
Distribution and habitat
The varzea piculet is endemic to Brazil in tropical South America where it has a rather limited range. It lives along the Amazon River in a wildlife corridor, in the forest called várzea forest, a freshwater swamp forest. It ranges from the confluence of the Amazon River with the Rio Negro in a , variable-width corridor downstream for about to the confluence of the Trombetas River from the north. The confluence of the Tapajós River joins here from the south. Its typical habitat is dense forest with vines and creepers on the Amazon floodplain and adjoining swampy forested areas, wooded islands and riverine woodland. It is a sedentary and non-migratory species.
Ecology
The varzea piculet is presumed to feed on small invertebrates like other members of the genus, but its diet has not been studied. Its breeding habits are also poorly known, but the breeding season may be from June to December, and young birds have been recorded in September.
Status
The varzea piculet is a poorly known bird with a restricted range in the Brazilian rainforest. It is threatened by the clearance of the forest for agricultural purposes and by proposed changes in the Brazilian Forest Code which will allow landowners amnesty for illegal fellings and the right to leave narrower strips of forest alongside watercourse. There are also proposals to build dams to provide hydro-electric power in the area which will permanently flood part of its habitat. Suitable habitat for the bird is projected to reduce by 50% or more over the next ten years (three generations). For these reasons, the conservation status of this bird has been assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being "endangered".

O'Donnabhain v. Commissioner 134 T.C. 34 (2010) is a case decided by the United States Tax Court. The issue for the court was whether a taxpayer who has been diagnosed with gender identity disorder can deduct sex reassignment surgery costs as necessary medical expenses under . The IRS argued that such surgery is cosmetic and not medically necessary. On Feb 2, 2010 the court ruled that O'Donnabhain should be allowed to deduct the costs of her treatment for gender-identity disorder, including sex-reassignment surgery and hormone treatments. In its decision, the court found the IRS position was "at best a superficial characterization of the circumstances" that is "thoroughly rebutted by the medical evidence".
History
Rhiannon O'Donnabhain is a transgender woman who underwent sex reassignment surgery in 2001. She grew up in a devout Irish Catholic family in Boston and previously tried to conform to traditionally masculine roles, enrolling in the United States Coast Guard during the Vietnam War, working as a construction worker, marrying and fathering three children. Conflicted by gender identity issues, she divorced in 1992. In 1996, she was diagnosed with gender identity disorder, a condition recognized in the DSM-IV under which a person identifies as belonging to a different gender than the one usually corresponding to the sex they were assigned at birth, and feels significant discomfort or the inability to deal with this condition.
Under the supervision of her doctors and in accordance with the standard treatment regime, O'Donnabhain began taking hormonal therapy and came out to her family and coworkers as transgender. She changed her legal name and presented herself as female in her day-to-day life. In 2001, she completed her transition by undergoing sex reassignment surgery. After six weeks of recovery, she returned to work.
O'Donnabhain claimed a tax deduction for about $25,000 in costs related to her treatment. She initially received a full refund from the IRS, but after an audit, the IRS characterized her surgery as "cosmetic" and not "medically necessary", thus denying the deduction under . The IRS demanded the refund back, and O'Donnabhain sued the IRS in Tax Court. Her case was taken by the Massachusetts-based Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders (GLAD), the non-profit legal services organization that in 2003 won the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court case granting gay and lesbian couples the right to marry (Goodridge v. Department of Public Health).
On Feb 2, 2010, O'Donnabhain won in Tax Court in an 11 to 5 decision reversing the IRS decision. On November 2, 2011, the IRS announced that it intends to issue a formal agreement, known as a "notice of acquiescence", with the Tax Court decision.
Arguments
allows taxpayers to deduct medical expenses, but not cosmetic surgery, which it defines as "any procedure which is directed at improving the patient's appearance and does not meaningfully promote the proper function of the body or prevent or treat illness or disease."
O'Donnabhain argued that her surgery was "medically necessary and directed toward the cure, mitigation and treatment of Ms. O'Donnabhain's diagnosed gender identity disorder."
The IRS issued a memorandum stating that:
Whether gender reassignment surgery is a treatment for an illness or disease is controversial. For instance, Johns Hopkins Hospital has closed its gender reassignment clinic and ceased performing these operations. ... In light of the Congressional emphasis on denying a deduction for procedures relating to appearance in all but a few circumstances and the controversy surrounding whether GRS is a treatment for an illness or disease, the materials submitted do not support a deduction.
In the clearest possible statement the US Tax Court declared "In its decision yesterday, the tax court said the IRS position was 'at best a superficial characterization of the circumstances' that is 'thoroughly rebutted by the medical evidence. The IRS case was based on unverified studies by Johns Hopkins' Paul R. McHugh, who worked for the Catholic Church. McHugh declared even before taking over the Johns Hopkins that it was his intention to close out any department that had anything to do with gender reassignment. He ordered a study of what he could find of the 24 women the unit had treated. Of 2,000 applications made by reassignment only 24 were chosen and they were chosen entirely for looks. Many questions remain about the religious bias of the IRS, as the results of the follow-up study were published in a Catholic journal the IRS would later use to close out deductions for surgery.
Reception in the medical community
The IRS's decision to classify O'Donnabhain's sex reassignment surgery as cosmetic "sparked outrage" from experts who specialize in gender identity disorder. According to Marshall Forstein, associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, "it's absolutely clear that transgender identity is a condition discussed in diagnostic manuals. It seems the IRS is now in the business of practicing medicine without a license."

The Transcontinental Race (TCR) is an annual, self-supported, ultra-distance cycling race across Europe. It is one of the world's toughest ultra-endurance races. The route and distance varies for each edition between about 3,200 and 4,200 km, with the winners generally taking 7 to 10 days. Interest in the race grew rapidly from 30 people starting the first edition of the race in 2013 to over 1,000 people applying for a place in the fourth edition in 2016, 350 of whom were successful; since then, these numbers have been reasonably stable.
It is not a stage race, the clock never stops from the moment the riders leave the start to the moment that they reach the finish, so it is a long individual time trial. Riders must therefore strategically choose how much time to devote to riding, resting, and refuelling each day. Being self-supported or unsupported means that drafting is not allowed, receiving any form of support from other racers is not allowed, nor is it from friends or family; all food, accommodation, repairs, etc., must be purchased from commercial sources.
Route
Despite being an individual time trial, there is a mass start, which has most often been in northwestern Europe, two to four intermediate control points must then be reached, and the finish has most often been around southeastern Europe. The 2019 edition went from east to west.
Apart from some sections of "parcours" or route that must be ridden near the start, some control points, and the finish, participants are mostly free to choose their own route that they have independently planned. Even so, many riders use the same roads as each other, particularly when choices are limited. All local laws must be adhered to regarding which roads cyclists are allowed to use and the organizers may ban additional roads that they believe are too dangerous.
For the sake of time and efficiency, nearly all participants ride solely on paved, public roads, and so nearly all use road bikes. However, due to routing errors, adventurous planning, or more challenging parcours being chosen by the organizers, some off-road sections are occasionally used.
During the first 7 editions of the race, the most-often used country for the location of a start, control point, or finish was Italy, which featured in 6 editions. Tied for the second-most often visited country are Belgium and France, each with 5 visits, followed by Turkey with 4 and Montenegro with 3. The race visited Asia just once, with the finish line being on the Asian side of the Dardanelles strait in Turkey for the 2016 edition.
Following the race
Racer positions are monitored using GPS satellite-based tracker devices mounted on all participants' bikes that upload their positions every 5 minutes. This information is then posted on the Trackleaders website for racers and followers to view. Many participants also update followers on their progress using social media websites.
During the race, volunteers are stationed at each control point to register the passage of each rider. Volunteer "dot watchers" remotely follow the progress of each racer's tracker position and inform the organizers of possible rule violations (e.g., individual riders appearing to ride together for extended periods or people riding on prohibited roads).
Rules
Rules are listed on the official website and in the Race Manual.
The idea of self-supported or unsupported bicycle racing is a key component. Drafting is not allowed, receiving any form of support from other racers is not allowed (which includes sharing food and equipment), and neither is receiving support from friends, family, etc. (again including food and equipment). Social/emotional support is allowed, but information should not be shared between different racers or between racers and their supporters once the race has begun. All supplies, accommodation, repair, etc., must be purchased from commercial sources that are equally available to all participants. Since the 2015 edition, in addition to the solo race category, a pairs category has existed in which riders may draft the other person in the pair and they may share equipment. The rules concerning the type of bicycle that can be used and the equipment that must be carried are minimal. To ensure that everyone is riding somewhat similar equipment, recumbent bicycles are not allowed and neither are tandem bicycles.
Results
The main results are summarized in the table below:
Many people who are not competing to win tend to have the goal of arriving before the finish party at the end of the 15th or 16th day,. Since 2016, a distinction has been made between people finishing in the "general classification" and those that are simply "finishers". To be awarded a place in the general classification, riders must adhere to the principles of being self-supported and also pass each of the checkpoints before it officially closes, which requires riding approximately 250 km per day.
Full results from all editions can be found on DotWatcher.cc.
Organization
The race was founded by the English cyclist Mike Hall, who won several similar events: In 2012 he set the Around the world cycling record, in 2013 and 2016 he won the Tour Divide, and in 2014 he won the TransAm Bicycle Race.
Mike Hall was the main organizer from 2013 until 2016, with The Adventurists helping to organize the first edition. After Mike Hall's death in early 2017, the remaining members of the Transcontinental Race team created the Lost Dot organization to administer the race.
Criticisms and risks
Contact between the organizers and participants is minimal outside of the checkpoints (although an emergency number is provided to all riders) and not all checkpoints are staffed 24 hours per day. Riders' satellite trackers can also fail, which is typically due to the tracker's batteries going flat despite riders being encouraged to carry spares and to change them at certain intervals. Many forms of cheating are possible due to the lack of monitoring, including the use of performance-enhancing substances. The organizers hope that an honor system is sufficient to curb violations, and in 2015 an online form was created for people to submit reports of rule-breaking. It is impossible to know how big a problem cheating actually is, but it is hoped that it is low since winning has no monetary value.
Organizers have given a thorough explanation about the process used for selecting which applicants are awarded a place. Previous volunteers are given preference, followed by applicants who improve the demographic diversity. The remainder who display sufficient understanding of the requirements and risk in their application are entered into a simple lottery.
Up to half of the riders who start the race may not reach the finish for various reasons, but this proportion varies every year. This indicates that the degree of difficulty is high, that some riders may not have prepared sufficiently for this type of race, and that so many different things can go wrong in an event of this length.
In 2017, Frank Simons was killed in a hit and run collision 5 hours after starting the race in Belgium. Other serious accidents have occurred leading to participants receiving hospital treatment.
The frequency of such incidents should be contrasted with the distances ridden, with an estimated 2,000,000 km being ridden in total by participants during the first six editions of the race. The organizers have addressed safety issues by being more explicit about which roads are allowable and attributing penalties to participants who rode on sections of roads forbidden to cyclists. For 2016, the finish was moved away from Istanbul due to safety concerns. also, the control points for 2016 were chosen to keep riders away from areas that have been found to be particularly dangerous in the past.
Similar races
This form of ultra-distance, unsupported bike racing first became popular with the Tour Divide mountain bike race, which was first held as a mass-start event in 2008 and goes over the Rocky Mountains from Alberta, Canada, through the USA and finishes at the Mexican border in New Mexico. The Trans Am Bike Race started in 2014 is more similar because it is primarily on paved roads, but it uses the TransAmerica Trail as a fixed route from the Pacific coast in Oregon, USA, to the Atlantic Coast in Virginia. Following the success of these events, many others were launched in subsequent years.
The self-supported nature of the TCR makes it very different from supported ultra-distance events like the Race Across America (RAAM), in which each racer has a large support crew with multiple vehicles. All such support is prohibited in the TCR and similar races that are described as self-supported or unsupported. Ultra-distance audax and randonneuring cycling events are somewhat similar, except that drafting is allowed in those and the race organizers may provide support at the control points.

The SS Clyde Valley was a steamship which achieved notoriety for its role in the Larne gun-running in April 1914.
History
The ship was built by MacIlwaine, Lewis and Company Ltd; Belfast and launched in 1886 as the SS Balniel for the Wigan Coal and Iron Company. She was named after Lord Balniel, the owner of Wigan Mines. She was sold in 1909 to the Clydeside Steamship Company in Glasgow and in 1910 renamed SS Londoner, and in 1912 renamed again as SS ClydeValley.
In 1914 she was sold to Hugh Crawford and acquired in April of the same year by Major Frederick Crawford on behalf of the Ulster Volunteers she was briefly renamed Mountjoy II and on 24 April 1914 she rendezvoused with the coaster SS Fanny at sea as part of the Larne gun-running operation.
By 1916 she was operating as a German Army Transport but was repatriated in January 1919 by Richard Cowser of Glasgow. She remained in the Glasgow area until 1928 when she was sold to Colonial Shippers of Guysborough, Nova Scotia and used to run coal to Trinidad and bring salt back. In 1934 she was abandoned and left on a sandbank until 1940 when she was acquired by A.S. Publicover of Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. In 1942 her steam propulsion was removed and she was converted to a motor vessel.
Further changes of ownership occurred in Canada, with her passing to Halifax Fisheries in 1943, Riverport Steamship Company in 1946 and Lake Shipping Company in 1955.
In 1969 she was acquired by Samuel Campbell of Whitehead, County Antrim with the aim of preserving her. She was moved to Carrickfergus but the project was unsuccessful and she went to Lancaster to be broken up in 1974.

The 1982 Wyoming gubernatorial election took place on November 2, 1982. Incumbent Democratic Governor Edgar Herschler ran for re-election to a third term. He faced former State House Speaker Warren A. Morton in the general election after several prominent Republicans, including then-Congressman Dick Cheney, declined to challenge him. However, Herschler remained personally popular and the national political environment favored Democrats, and he had little difficulty defeating Morton to win a third term. In doing so, Herschler became the first (and, with the subsequent adoption of gubernatorial term limits, likely the last) Governor of Wyoming to win three terms in office.

Candy is a 2005 young adult novel by Kevin Brooks about a doomed teenage love affair between a musician and a prostitute.
Plot summary
The story opens when Joe Beck, a music lover with a knack for curiosity, meets 16-year-old Candy on the streets of London. Joe soon learns that Candy is not only a runaway from her home town, but also a teenage prostitute and heroin addict. He immediately becomes infatuated with her.
The pair begin dating cautiously, visiting London Zoo once. Candy also comes to a gig that Joe and his band, The Katies, play at a local club. However, Candy's pimp, Iggy, feels that Joe is a threat, worrying that Joe will reduce the business Candy takes in and thus reducing Iggy's income. When Joe finds Candy beaten, the pair attack Iggy and leave the city to hide and to ease Candy off heroin.
Iggy subsequently kidnaps Joe's older sister Gina, and uses her as a bargaining chip, claiming he will free her if Candy is returned to him. At the novel's climax, Joe, Candy, Joe's sister, and her boyfriend confront Iggy at Joe's family's remote country house. Candy stabs Iggy in the neck, concluding the novel's main story. Candy is sent off to a rehab centre for adolescents where Joe has a final meeting with her. Candy apologizes for everything and is taken away. Joe is left wondering where she is and if he will ever see her again. The last chapter briefly explains that Joe's band received a record deal and recorded Joe's song for Candy. Joe receives several calls for permission to record the song, but he never answers the messages. Although Joe is not at all upset by this, Candy very much is. In the final scene, Candy cries in Joe's arms, asking why their song was recorded. Did he have something to do with it? Left hanging on the streets all alone when Candy leaves, Joe is baffled, heartbroken, and still deeply in love.
Characters
Joe Beck: Young, naïve and caring, he is the novel's protagonist. Joe is in a band called The Katies, who at the end of the novel, go off to record without him. He is obsessed with Candy and does everything he can to help her with her addiction.
Candy (Candice): A young prostitute, runaway, and heroin addict.
Iggy: Candy's pimp, who controls her life by using her addiction as a tool. He is a violent man, bent on destroying Candy and Joe's forbidden relationship.
Gina: Joe's older sister. She cares for and worries about Joe but is supportive of his relationship with Candy. She and Joe are very close.
Mike: Gina's fiancé. He provides Joe with many favors via connections through his DJing hobby. Has a good understanding of Iggy and his crew.
Symbolism
In a review of the novel, Professor Wendy Kelleher of Arizona State University states that the book focuses on the idea that "From the stories of Eve's seduction in the Garden of Eden to the present, men and women have chased the forbidden, sacrificing everything else in the bargain." Brooks plays with this fundamental, human instinct through the use of Candy's drug addiction. As the story unfolds, language referring to drug addiction begins to describe Joe's love for Candy. The more Joe becomes involved with Candy, the more Joe becomes obsessed with how Candy makes him feel. In the novel, Joe claims "she fired me up and turned my body inside out ... and usually that would have messed me up so much I wouldn't have been able to feel anything, but this time I could feel it." Therefore, Candy's drug addiction mirrors the obsessive love Joe has for her.

Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos is a 1993 role-playing video game developed by Westwood Studios and published by Virgin Games for MS-DOS, the NEC PC-9801, and FM Towns. It was the first installment of the Lands of Lore series. The player travels around various environments, collecting items and battling monsters in an attempt to save the kingdom from a witch named Scotia, who has acquired shape-shifting abilities.
Westwood wanted to create something new after being acquired by Virgin, and it was intended that the game outperform Eye of The Beholder II. Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos received generally positive reviews, with reviewers complimenting the graphics and the skill system, but some criticized its combat and repetitiveness. In 1994, the game was re-released on CD, adding voice-overs, including some by Patrick Stewart. Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos was followed by a sequel, Lands of Lore: Guardians of Destiny, in 1997.
Gameplay
The game is a dungeon crawler, presented in a real-time, three-dimensional view from the character's perspective similar to the interface used on the Dungeon Master game and the Eye of the Beholder series. The player can move around and interact with the world by performing actions such as picking up items, throwing them, and using them on objects. Features such as locks and switches (which affect the world by triggering events such as walls appearing or disappearing) are abundant, and the latter can be interacted with directly. The player can obtain a map showing the player's current location, as well as important points on the level.
The player can play as one of four characters, each of which have their own statistics and specialize in certain areas. The characters' main statistics are might and protection, which affect the damage dealt and absorbed, respectively. The player can equip characters with items such as weapons and armor, which affect these statistics. Some weapons have special properties, such as having a chance to deal extra damage or kill enemies straight away. Not all special properties are favorable: for example, there is a bow that never hits anything. Other items that can be collected and placed in an inventory include medicine, keys, and rings that grant the wearer benefits such as increased health regeneration. Characters also have Fighter, Rogue, and Mage skills. Fighter affects the character's ability to engage in combat, Rogue affects their ability to use bows and pick locks, and Mage affects their ability to cast spells. Spells include fireballs, lightning, and healing characters, each having four power levels. Performing these actions increases the character's ability to do so. Characters join and leave the party throughout the game.
Throughout the game, the player will encounter and engage in combat with various monsters. Weapons and magic can be used to attack enemies. Some monsters can poison (which drains the character's health) or stun (rendering the character temporarily unable to do anything) party members. Medicines can be used to heal party members, and the party can rest at any time (although the party can be woken by monsters), regeneration health and mana, If all party members lose all their health, the game is over. Party members who have lost all their health can only be healed by magic or medicine.
The player travels through environments such as forests, caves, mines, swamps, and castles. Some contain areas that affect the party by draining mana or causing them to fall asleep. Many contain features such as chests, which contain items when opened. Many levels also consist of multiple floors. The player will also come across shops where items can be purchased and sold using silver crowns. Many levels also contain puzzles such as escaping from an area or figuring out how to get to one.
Plot
King Richard, ruler of Gladstone Keep, has received word that Scotia, an old witch, has acquired a ring called the Nether Mask, which allows its user to assume any form of any power or capability. The King sends the player out on a mission to acquire the Ruby of Truth.
When the player finds the ruby's guardian, he learns that it has been stolen as the guardian dies. When the player returns to Gladstone, Scotia poisons King Richard and escapes. The player is tasked with saving the King and defeating Scotia. To do this, the player obtains the recipe of an elixir that will cure King Richard. Once the recipe is obtained, the player travels through the realm to find the ingredients, and create the elixir. During their quest, they come across the Ruby of Truth, and when King Richard is cured, he gives the party the Shard of Truth, which combines with the Ruby to make the Whole Truth. The Whole Truth is then used against Scotia to defeat her.
Development and release
After Westwood Studios was acquired by Virgin Interactive, the decision was made to drop the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons license to focus on a new property. Producer Rick Gush said that the executive producer Brett Sperry, was involved in the decision. Gush explained that Sperry knew about the benefits of such a venture, and Gush believed that creating a new brand was a good move for the studio's promotion. According to Joseph Hewitt, an artist for Westwood, Westwood wanted to develop their own properties instead of games for other publishers to profit from.
Westwood already had the engine and experience from the Eye of The Beholder series, but it was known that creating a new game was going to be difficult. Gush said that the lead programmer Philip Gorrow proposed the ideas for the new game. Bill Crum was hired and became the designer. Westwood's intention was to outperform Eye of The Beholder 2, which included increasing the story's depth. One concern was making the game accessible so it could reach a wide audience. Hewitt said that Sperry wanted to make the game user-friendly. He also explained that the team did "odd things" for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons games. The team's desire to be different with Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos affected game design significantly, especially the in-game characterization. Sperry was frustrated at the prospect of creating a character for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, which would have involved creating statistics which he knew little about. He came up with the idea of the player having a choice of four pre-made characters.
During development, the team knew the game was going to be "special", but Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss, which used 3D graphics, was released. Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos was too far into development for the team to rework its 2D engine, so the team worked hard to tweak it. Blurred movement was added to give the game a 3D effect. Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos was developed from the engine of Eye of the Beholder, and the user interface was also updated from that game.
Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos was released for MS-DOS in September 1993. An Amiga version with 32 colors was planned. Initial versions of the game contained a bug that prevented players from completing the game: at one point, the player can be tricked into handing over a crucial item. If the player does so, the item was supposed to be retrievable later in the game. The team missed this and did not put the item back into the game in the event the player handed it over, making the item permanently lost and the game unwinnable. One player who encountered this bug was asked to send his save game file to Westwood, so they could edit it to add the lost item to his inventory.
The game was re-released on CD-ROM in 1994, which featured voice-overs, some of which were performed by Patrick Stewart. It also features an additional narrative history read by Stewart. According to Gush, the team was "really impressed" with Stewart's professionalism, and he stated that they had paid $30,000 for him to be with the team for three hours. Stewart finished the voice-overs in less than three hours, and the team received a cardboard cutout of him in a Star Trek uniform. This version features 130 MB of digitized speech.
The game was re-released on GOG.com in November 2011, bundled with the sequel.
Reception
According to Westwood Studios, Lands of Lore was a commercial success, with global sales in excess of 250,000 units by November 1996.
Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos was well received. Writing for CD-ROM Today, Trent C. Ward called Lands of Lore "one of the best games available for the PC". Computer Gaming Worlds Scorpia stated that Lands of Lore "breaks new ground in a number of pleasantly surprising ways". She approved of the graphics that improved on those of Eye of the Beholder, sophisticated automap, and simplified skill, magic, and inventory systems. While disliking the combat, Scorpia concluded that "Lands of Lore is a better-than-average game of this type [and] worth playing, especially" for Eye of the Beholder fans. The (reviewer) of Dragon believed the game's graphics are "good and quite varied" and said the game is not significantly more advanced than other RPGs. Despite this, he said that Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos was "a lot of fun to play" but criticized some puzzles for being "pathetically easy". Ray Ivey of Just Adventure stated that the game is one of the longest he had ever played and said that locations with multiple levels cause the game to be repetitive. He also criticized the subtlety of certain aspects, such as requiring certain skills, but praised the combat and skill progression, saying they give the game "real purpose". Edges reviewer praised the game for not being reliant on irrelevant statistics such as hunger and described it as "a joy to play". A reviewer of the French magazine Joystick believed the graphics are "beautiful" and the intermediary scenes "magnificent", but complained about the inability to skip non-interactive scenes. Paul Rand of Computer and Video Games believed that Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos is "everything Eye of the Beholder III should have been—and more" but criticized the game for being too easy because the party can frequently rest and heal. The review also described the presentation as "beautiful" and the animations as "wonderful". The reviewers of Génération 4 were highly complimentary: one described the graphics and animation quality as "perfect" and thought elements such as the scenarios and puzzles combined to make the "ultimate" role-playing game, and the other described the game as "Perfection in the domain of PC role-playing games".
Computer Gaming World in May 1994 said that the CD version's "quality voice-overs ... may offer just enough freshness to tackle this superb RPG again". Joystick thought the music and voices of the CD version are "excellent quality" but said that the CD version does not add much to the floppy original. PC Gamer UK said of the CD version that Stewart's voice evoked phrases from Star Trek: The Next Generation, and that it added "enormous weight" to the game's soundtrack, which was described as "spooky". The magazine added that the characters' voices were "really well directed" and that the CD version is what the game should have been from the start.
Lands of Lore was a runner-up for Computer Gaming Worlds Role-Playing Game of the Year award in June 1994, losing to Betrayal at Krondor. The editors wrote that it "features impressive special effects that some said couldn't be done in the MS-DOS world and a delightful story that blends together many of the classic fantasy archetypes of shape-shifting". Stewart won the Best Male Voice-Over Award. The editors stated that he "was perfectly cast as the royal monarch. His vocal range gives a sense of urgency and reality to the game as the story unfolds".
In 1994, PC Gamer UK named it the 22nd best computer game of all time. The editors wrote that it "is still one of the only RPGs to stand up against the Ultima series. It's not similar, by any means, but that's one of its strengths: it succeeds by being different".

The Society of American Foresters (SAF) is a professional organization representing the forestry industry in the United States. Its mission statement declares that it seeks to "advance the science, education, and practice of forestry; to enhance the competency of its members; to establish professional excellence; and, to use the knowledge, skills and conservation ethic of the profession to ensure the continued health and use of forest ecosystems and the present and future availability of forest resources to benefit society". Its headquarters are located in Washington, D.C.
History
The Society of American Foresters was founded on November 30, 1900 by Gifford Pinchot and seven colleagues in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Division of Forestry.
Membership and structure
, SAF had 11,000 members and is the largest professional organization for foresters. SAF is structured around two different networks—a geographic network and a network of scientific disciplines. The geographic network has 31 state societies, further subdivided into divisions and chapters. Student chapters exist at many forestry schools. The scientific disciplinary network has 20 working groups. Each working group is a self-selected cluster of SAF members interested in a particular area of science.
Education
Accreditation
The SAF is active in improving the quality of postsecondary forestry education in the United States, however, SAF was denied recognition by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation as an accrediting organization in 2015, after being recognized since 2001 for academic degree programs in professional forestry, both at a Bachelor's and Master's level. Accreditation is provided for selected programs, not institutions or academic departments.
SAF maintains a list of its accredited programs in forestry, urban forestry, natural resources and ecosystem management, and forest technology on their website. It also publishes an annual college guide to help secondary school students and guidance counselors become better informed about career opportunities in forestry and natural resources.
Continuing education
SAF offers a Continuing Forestry Education (CFE) program and a Certified Forester credential program. Some states with licensing or registration statutes and regulations for professional foresters require continuing education credits to renew a license or registration. For example, Maine and Alabama accept SAF's CFE credits.
Publications
The SAF produces two periodic journals, published by Oxford University Press: the Journal of Forestry and Forest Science. Past volumes and issues of both journals are available through their respective Oxford University Press websites.
Journal of Forestry, in print since 1902, is a peer-reviewed journal published bimonthly: January, March, May, July, September, and November. . The current Editor-in-Chief is Dr. Keith A. Blatner. Impact factors for Journal of Forestry can be found on the Oxford University Press website.
Forest Science, in print since 1955, is a peer-reviewed scientific journal published bimonthly: February, April, June, August, October, and December. . The current Editor-in-Chief is Dr. Scott Roberts. Impact factors for Forest Science can be found on the Oxford University Press website.
From 1977 to 2013, SAF published three regional journals: the Southern Journal of Applied Forestry; the Northern Journal of Applied Forestry; and the Western Journal of Applied Forestry. In 2013, the three regional journals were absorbed into the applied research section of Forest Science. Issues are archived online by Oxford University Press.
SAF also publishes a variety of technical publications, such as the Dictionary of Forestry.
The Forestry Source, , is a monthly newspaper for SAF members that reports on current events.
The E-Forester is an electronic newsletter emailed to SAF members and subscribed nonmembers weekly.
Conventions and meetings
State societies of SAF hold annual or semi-annual meetings to advance networking among members, review recent scientific findings, conduct continuing forestry education, and plan local outreach activities.
Each year, SAF also holds a national convention—open to both non-members and members. Each convention has a specific theme, plenary sessions, and a wide variety of concurrent technical sessions, each a cluster of scientific papers focused on a specific topic. The concurrent sessions span the breadth and diversity of the ecological, economic, and social sciences related to forests. The location of the national convention rotates around the United States to make it easier for SAF members from different parts of the country to attend. Proceedings are published in a subsequent issue of the Journal of Forestry. For example, proceedings from the October 3–7, 2018 convention in Portland, OR were published in the January 2019 issue.
Awards
SAF recognizes distinguished individual achievements in forestry through its awards program. The society features numerous awards in various categories.
Sir William Schlich Memorial Award
The oldest and most prestigious SAF award, dating back to 1935, is the Sir William Schlich Memorial Award. Named for the influential German forester Wilhelm Philipp Daniel Schlich, the award recognizes broad and outstanding contributions to the field of forestry with emphasis on policy and national or international activities. Notable winners of the Schlich Memorial Award include Franklin D. Roosevelt (1935), Gifford Pinchot (1940), Henry S. Graves (1944), William B. Greeley (1946), Ralph Hosmer (1950), Tom Gill (1954), Richard E. McArdle (1962), and John R. McGuire (1984).
Gifford Pinchot Medal
The Gifford Pinchot Medal recognizes "outstanding contributions by a forestry professional in the administration, practice, and professional development of North American Forestry." Notable winners of the Gifford Pinchot Medal include Henry S. Graves (1950), Raphael Zon (1952), Earle H. Clapp (1960), and Edward P. Cliff (1973).
Fellows
One of the highest honors for SAF members is the rank of Fellow. This is an exceptional recognition bestowed on a member by his or her peers for outstanding contributions and service to the SAF and the profession. Notable Fellows include William B. Greeley (1918), Bernhard Eduard Fernow (1918), Lyle F. Watts (1945), Edward P. Cliff (1963), and John R. McGuire (1973).

Joshua Lockwood Logan III (October 5, 1908 – July 12, 1988) was an American director, writer, and actor. He shared a Pulitzer Prize for co-writing the musical South Pacific and was involved in writing other musicals.
Early years
Logan was born in Texarkana, Texas, the son of Susan (née Nabors) and Joshua Lockwood Logan. When he was three years old, his father committed suicide. Logan, his mother, and his younger sister, Mary Lee, then moved to his maternal grandparents' home in Mansfield, Louisiana, which Logan used 40 years later as the setting for his play The Wisteria Trees. Logan's mother remarried six years after his father's death and he then attended Culver Military Academy in Culver, Indiana, where his stepfather served on the staff as a teacher. At school, he experienced his first drama class and felt at home. After his high school graduation he attended Princeton University. At Princeton, he was involved with the intercollegiate summer stock company, known as the University Players, with fellow student James Stewart and also non-students Henry Fonda and Margaret Sullavan. During his senior year, he served as president of the Princeton Triangle Club. Before his graduation, he won a scholarship to travel to Moscow to observe the rehearsals of Konstantin Stanislavski, and Logan left school without a diploma.
Broadway
Logan began his Broadway career as an actor in Carry Nation in 1932. He was also in I Was Waiting for You (1933).
He then spent time in London, where he staged two productions and directed a touring revival of Camille. He also worked as an assistant stage manager.
Director
Back on Broadway he staged It's You I Want (1935) and To See Ourselves (1935) and was stage manager for Most of the Game (1935). He staged Hell Freezes Over (1935–36) and returned to acting with A Room in Red and White (1936).
He went to Hollywood where he did some dialogue directing on The Garden of Allah (1936), History Is Made at Night (1937), and Suez (1938). Logan was given the chance to co-direct the feature film I Met My Love Again (1938) for Walter Wanger.
Logan returned to Broadway where he had his first major success as a director with Paul Osborn's On Borrowed Time (1938), which ran for 321 performances. He followed it with the musical I Married an Angel (1938–39), which ran for 331 performances.
He directed Knickerbocker Holiday (1938), Stars in Your Eyes (1939), Osborn's Morning's at Seven (1939–40), Two For the Show (1940), and Higher and Higher (1940, 84 performances). None of these was a break-out success but his revival of Charley's Aunt (1940–41) went for 233 performances, and the Hart-Rodgers musical By Jupiter (1942–43) with Ray Bolger went for 427 performances.
World War II
In 1942, Logan was drafted by the U.S. Army. During his service in World War II, he acted as a public-relations and intelligence officer. Logan was selected to become an assistant director of Irving Berlin's This Is the Army and when in Europe organised "jeep shows" of entertainers serving as soldiers doing their shows near the front lines.
When the war concluded he was discharged with the rank of captain, and returned to Broadway. He married his second wife, actress Nedda Harrigan, in 1945; Logan's previous marriage, to actress Barbara O'Neil, a colleague of his at the University Players in the 1930s, had ended in divorce.
Post-war success
Logan's directing career resumed with the musical Annie Get Your Gun (1946–49), which ran for 1,147 performances.
He followed it with Anita Loos' Happy Birthday (1948, 563 performances), and Norman Krasna's John Loves Mary (1948–49, 423 performances). Logan's golden run continued with Mister Roberts (1948–1951) which he co-wrote as well as directed; it ran for 1157 performances and earned him a Tony Award.
Then he directed and co-wrote South Pacific (1949–54), which went for 1,925 performances. Logan shared the 1950 Pulitzer Prize for Drama with Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II for co-writing South Pacific. The show earned him a Tony Award for Best Director. Despite his contributions to the musical, The New York Times originally omitted his name as co-author, and the Pulitzer Prize committee initially awarded the prize to only Rodgers and Hammerstein. Although the mistakes were corrected, Logan wrote in his autobiography: "I knew then why people fight so hard to have their names in proper type. It's not just ego or 'the principle of the thing,' it's possibly another job or a better salary. It's reassurance. My name had been so minimized that I lived through years of having people praise South Pacific in my presence without knowing I had had anything to do with it."
Logan wrote, produced and directed The Wisteria Tree (1950), an adaptation of The Cherry Orchard, which was a minor success.
Logan cowrote, coproduced, and directed the 1952 musical Wish You Were Here. After the show was not initially successful, Logan quickly wrote 54 new pages of material, and by the ninth performance, the show looked new. In its fourth week of release, the show sold out, and continued to offer sell-out performances for the next two years.
He had another success with Picnic (1953–1954), the play by William Inge, which went for 477 performances. Krasna's Kind Sir (1953–54) lasted 166 performances, and Fanny (1953–1954) which Logan co-wrote, co-produced and directed, ran 888 performances.
Hollywood
When director John Ford became sick, Logan reluctantly returned to Hollywood to complete the filming of Mister Roberts (1955). It was a success commercially and critically.
Logan directed the film adaptation of his own Picnic (1955), for which Logan received an Oscar nomination. Bus Stop (1956) with Marilyn Monroe, his next movie, was another hit.
Logan returned to Broadway, directing Middle of the Night by Paddy Chayefsky, which ran 477 performances.
He visited Japan to direct Marlon Brando in Sayonara (1957), which earned him a second Oscar nomination for Best Director. He did the movie version of South Pacific (1958).
Logan went back to Broadway and directed Blue Denim (1958, 166 performances) and the hugely popular The World of Suzie Wong (1958–1960, 508 performances). He produced Epitaph for George Dillon (1958).
Logan returned to Hollywood with Tall Story (1960), which introduced Jane Fonda to movie audiences. Back on Broadway, he directed There Was a Little Girl (1960), his first theatre flop in some years, running for only 16 performances. In Hollywood he did the movie adaptation of Fanny (1961).
In 1961, he was a member of the jury at the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival.
Logan continued to alternate Broadway and Hollywood for the rest of the 1960s. He did the Broadway musicals All American (1962, 86 performances) and Mr. President (1962–1963, 265 performances), and Tiger, Tiger Burning Bright (1962–1963, 33 performances), then made the film Ensign Pulver (1964).
After Ready When You Are, C.B.! (1964–1965, 80 performances), he did the movies of Lerner and Loewe's Camelot (1967) and Paint Your Wagon (1969). Back on Broadway, he did Look to the Lilies (1970, 31 performances).
Later career
Logan's 1976 autobiography Josh: My Up-and-Down, In-and-Out Life gives a frank account of his bipolar disorder. He appeared with his wife in the 1977 nightclub revue Musical Moments, featuring Logan's most popular Broadway numbers. He published Movie Stars, Real People, and Me in 1978.
In 1979, he produced Larry Cohen's Trick on Broadway. He directed Horowitz and Mrs. Washington (1980), which ran for six performances.
From 1983 to 1986, he taught theater at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida. He was also responsible for bringing Carol Channing to Broadway in Lend an Ear!.
Personal life
Logan experienced mood fluctuations for many years, which in the 1970s psychiatrist Ronald R. Fieve treated with lithium, and the two appeared on TV talk shows extolling its virtues.
Logan was married briefly (1939–1940) to actress Barbara O'Neil. After the couple divorced, he was married to Nedda Harrigan from 1945 until his death from progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) in New York City in 1988.
In 2019, Jane Fonda, who starred in Logan's 1960 film Tall Story, claimed both she and Logan were in love with lead actor Anthony Perkins at the time of filming, causing tension during an already difficult shoot.

Xenotarsosaurus is a genus of abelisaurid theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous of Argentina.
Discovery
In 1980 geologist Juan Carlos Sciutto discovered a rich fossil site six kilometres north of the Ocho Hermanos ranch in Chubut province. Among the fossils found there were some theropod remains. Later, a team led by Argentinian paleontologist José Fernando Bonaparte recovered some more theropod bones, possibly from the same individual.
In 1986, Rubén Martínez, Olga Giménez, Jorge Rodríguez and Graciela Bochatey described the theropod fossils and coined the genus and species Xenotarsosaurus bonapartei for them. The generic name is derived from Greek xenos, "strange", tarsos, "tarsus", and sauros, "lizard", a reference to the exceptional build of the ankle. The specific name bonapartei honours Bonaparte.
The type specimens (and only known fossils of Xenotarsosaurus) were found in the Bajo Barreal Formation. In 1986 this formation was seen as Campanian; today it is thought to date to the earlier Cenomanian–Turonian. The bones consist of two cotypes: UNPSJB PV 184, a series of two anterior dorsal vertebrae, and PVL 612, a right hind limb including the long femur, the tibia, fibula and astragalocalcaneum of the ankle. The exceptional complete fusion, without sutures, of the astragalus and calcaneum, forming an element that is again fused to the widened lower end of the tibia, occasioned the generic name.
In 2010 Gregory S. Paul estimated its length at 6 meters (19.7 ft), its weight at 750 kg (1,654 lbs). In 2016, its length was estimated to be . The same year Molina-Pérez & Larramendi gave a similar length of 5.4 meters (18 ft) and a weight of 430 kg (948 lbs).
The remains show some similarities to Carnotaurus sastrei, causing the describers to assign Xenotarsosaurus to the Abelisauridae, which has remained a common determination. However, it has also been proposed that Xenotarsosaurus is a neoceratosaurian of uncertain affinities.

The Tragedy of the Street of Flowers (Portuguese: A Tragédia da Rua das Flores) is a novel by José Maria de Eça de Queirós (1845 - 1900), also known as Eça de Queiroz. It was only first published in Portuguese in 1980. The first English version, translated by Margaret Jull Costa, was published by Dedalus Books in 2000, to coincide with the centenary of the author's death.
Background
This novel was written between 1877 and 1878 in Newcastle upon Tyne, where Eça was the Portuguese Consul. It was discovered amongst his papers after his death and remained unpublished for more than one hundred years, only being published in 1980 after copyrights expired. It is possible that the writer's family refused to publish the book earlier due to the fact that an incestuous relationship is the dominant feature of the story.
For some commentators the novel was designed to serve as an outline for the author's novel The Maias, as it contains resemblances between characters and events described; for others it has been seen as a draft for his novel Cousin Bazilio.
The Plot
The narrative focuses on the beautiful Joaquina (later known as Genoveva) who leaves her husband and child in Portugal and flees with a Spaniard to Spain, where she becomes a courtesan, eventually marrying a French Senator and moving to Paris. With the fall of Napoleon Bonaparte and the death of the husband, she returns to Lisbon where she attracts considerable attention both for her beauty and because of her mysterious history. She becomes a paid mistress of the unattractive, but rich, Dâmaso while, at the same time, falling in love with a young man called Vítor da Silva. Only after their love has been consummated does she learn that she is Vitor's mother, and this leads to her suicide so that Vitor will not discover the truth.
Reviews and analysis
While considered a fairly unpolished work that may not have been regarded by the author as his final version, the reviews have noted the high quality of the English translation. However, several commentators express surprise that, in her Introduction to the novel, the translator gives away the plot.
Although the story is tragic, the book is primarily a satirical portrait of 19th-century Lisbon society, a feature common to most of Eça's work. It has been described as a “fascinating visit to a period with a very different approach to morality”, and as having “beautiful descriptions of 19th century Portuguese life with a huge amount of satire and societal critique layered thick on top.” A strong vein of both comedy and tragedy runs throughout, while Eca "delights in shocking in order to expose the puritanical, narrow-minded Portuguese society".
The satire begins early in the novel, when Genoveva throws a party. This allows Eça to describe typical characters from Lisbon society. The influence of the founder of Literary realism, Honoré de Balzac (1799-1850), author of novels that depict Parisian society, can be detected. Particularly amusing is Camilo, “a pretentious artist, full of talk but little action, who goes on and on about art history and styles and technique, but never paints anything.” Eça “brilliantly dissects a world in which only surface counts, providing the reader with a vivid and gripping portrayal of a society and class consumed by hypocrisy, greed and materialism.”
Several writers have explored the role of incest in Eça's works. Ponte notes that in Greek Tragedy incest represented the protagonist's hopeless fight against fate. As an allegory for social decadence incest is found elsewhere in nineteenth-century literature, most notably in Émile Zola's La Curée. In her Introduction to the book, the translator suggests that this could have been one reason why the book was neither published by Eça nor his heirs, speculating that the incidents described were “too close to home”. Eça was born illegitimately and although his parents did eventually marry he lived apart from them until he was 21. In The Tragedy of the Street of Flowers, Vítor first sees his mother when he is 23.
Film adaptation
In 1981, the book was adapted for a Portuguese television series, titled Homónimo, directed by Ferrão Katzenstein.

Darrell "J.R." Salzman (born 1979) is a champion logroller and an Iraq War veteran. ESPN has called him "among the preeminent outdoors athletes" of the last decade.
Salzman grew up in Hayward, Wisconsin. His sisters, Tina Bosworth and Crystal Salzman, are also top logrollers. He attended the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Education from the University of Wisconsin–Stout.
Career
Sports
Salzman was a competitor in log rolling and boom running, a sprint on floating logs, in all six seasons of ESPN's Great Outdoor Games, winning 14 medals (more than any other player). In 2005 he was awarded the Best Outdoor Sportsman ESPY.
Between 1998 and 2015, he won ten world titles at the Lumberjack World Championships in Hayward. Between 2010 and 2015, Salzman competed with the advanced effects of Lyme disease but despite this, he managed to secure two more world titles, tying with Canadian logroller Jubiel Wickheim for most logrolling titles.
Salzman used his log rolling skills as a stuntman in the film Cheaper by the Dozen 2.
Salzman runs a small business by the name of Salzman Custom Sawing which focussed on turning trees into lumber, slabs, furniture and various other products. He has also spent his time working as a freelance journalist, specifically writing about his endeavors in the military as well as right-wing politics.
Injury in Iraq
Salzman joined the National Guard, enlisting shortly after the two-year anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks. He was assigned to the Minnesota National Guard. His unit was activated as part of the 34th Infantry Division in the fall of 2005 and in the spring of 2006, he was deployed to Iraq.
On December 19, 2006, his vehicle was struck by an Explosively Formed Penetrator. His right arm was severed below the elbow, his left hand was pulverized by the blast, and he suffered a traumatic brain injury. He recovered at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and a nearby Fisher House, learning to use a prosthetic arm and recover his physical skills. He is considered 100 percent physically disabled. Nevertheless, after returning to Hayward, he successfully logrolled again, practicing with and without his prosthetic. Salzman returned to competition and won a log rolling world title in 2009.
Personal life
Salzman runs a milblog, "Lumberjack in a Desert", on which he has recounted his military life and his medical recovery. When he completes his education, he hopes to go into teaching. Salzman married his girlfriend, Josie Salzman, on March 10, 2006, before he deployed to Iraq. They have since divorced. Together they have one son.

General Chang is a fictional character from the Star Trek fictional universe who was portrayed by Christopher Plummer as the central antagonist in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, a feature film released in 1991.
In The Undiscovered Country, Chang is Chancellor Gorkon's chief of staff, and subsequently serves Chancellor Azetbur. He is depicted as being an avid fan of William Shakespeare, whom he frequently quotes in the film, much to the chagrin of the Enterprise crew. The character is almost completely bald, a trait not seen among Klingons before the release of Star Trek VI.
The Chang makeup originally included a wig appliance. However, Christopher Plummer felt removing the wig has made the character more distinct. He also asked that Chang's Klingon makeup be made less severe. Chang's attire is also unique in that an apparent eye injury is disguised with a metal eyepatch, which is attached directly to his skull by bolts bearing the Klingon emblem. Later depictions of Klingons with eye injuries, such as Deep Space Nine's Martok, had them flaunting their mutilations as battle scars.
Plummer's delivery of lines and depiction of this character has been praised in the Star Trek franchise.
Overview
In Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, Chang was a well-known Klingon general who believed that "in space all warriors are cold warriors." Throughout the film he was often depicted as fierce, cunning and willing to participate in battles personally. Chang had a deep-seated hatred for the United Federation of Planets and believed that a war with them was inevitable.
As a result, in the events described in the video game Star Trek: Klingon Academy, he created a simulated campaign against the Federation and used it to train students at an Academy for future starship commanders. This hatred eventually led him to participate in a conspiracy to thwart plans for a lasting peace between his people and the Federation.
Between the years of 2291 and 2293 in the Star Trek universe, the general played a key role in two violent Klingon power struggles. The first was when a Klingon named Kalnor led an unsuccessful coup to depose the current Chancellor. Chang attacked and crippled Kalnor's ship, but he did not destroy it. Instead, he beamed himself aboard the enemy vessel and challenged Kalnor to single combat in front of his men. Chang killed Kalnor but lost his left eye in the fight. This resulted in the eyepatch that he is seen wearing in The Undiscovered Country.
The second conflict broke out after the Chancellor died. Kalnor's brother, Melkor, blocked the accession of Gorkon, the former chief of staff who was the legitimate successor. Melkor declared himself emperor and touched off a brutal civil war that had devastating consequences for the Klingon Empire, largely due to the usurper's treacherous and cowardly tactics. At one point, Melkor had a whole star system destroyed, rather than surrender it. He also had help from the Romulan Star Empire, another major power.
Chang fought Melkor, but he did not support Gorkon. The two men were friends, but the general was wary of Gorkon's desire for a lasting peace with the Federation. As a result, Chang hoped to keep Gorkon from becoming the next leader of the Klingon Empire. However, Chang was eventually forced to accept help from Gorkon's forces. This led to a key victory against Melkor and his Romulan allies. It also meant that Chang was honor-bound to accept Gorkon as the new Klingon leader.
Melkor was not finished. His supporters tried to trick Chang into thinking the Federation were invading. When the ruse was discovered, Chang had to make a choice: fight the fight he had waited for his whole life, or defend his people against the threat Melkor posed. He chose the latter, and Melkor was finally killed.
During the events depicted in The Undiscovered Country, the Klingon Empire faced a momentous ecological disaster in 2293, when its key energy facility exploded and polluted the homeworld's atmosphere. This crisis had the potential to put an end to the Klingon Empire. Chang's worst fears came to life when Gorkon turned to the Federation for help. The Klingon Chancellor proposed putting an end to the cold war between the two powers and dismantling several outposts in the neutral zone between both powers. Rather than see this happen, Chang joined a secret conspiracy (which would be known as the Khitomer conspiracy) of Klingon, Federation and Romulan officials to stop the peace process by any means necessary.
The first step involved the creation of a secret warship (a Bird of Prey) with a unique ability; unlike other Klingon warships, it could fire its weapons while its cloaking device was enabled. As Gorkon's new chief of staff, Chang accompanied the Chancellor and his daughter, Azetbur, to meet with the Federation President. They were escorted through Federation space by the USS Enterprise, under the command of Captain James T. Kirk. An admirer of Kirk, Chang met him when Chang and his entourage were invited aboard the Enterprise for dinner. The Klingon general greeted Kirk as a "fellow warrior". During the dinner, Chang inadvertently paraphrased Adolf Hitler with a comment about "breathing room", which Kirk noted.
After the Klingons returned to their ship, the conspirators struck. The modified Bird of Prey, invisible and near the Enterprise, attacked Gorkon's ship and made this look like the Federation ship was responsible. Then, two Starfleet conspirators beamed aboard Gorkon's ship, mortally wounded the Chancellor and killed several other Klingons.
Chang accused Kirk of attacking them and then tried to launch a "counterattack" with Gorkon's ship. But instead, Kirk surrendered, and both he and the ship's doctor Leonard McCoy beamed aboard Gorkon's ship. Despite McCoy's efforts, Gorkon died and Chang arrested them both. (Despite his role in orchestrating Gorkon's death, Chang seemed genuinely affected by the death of his former comrade.)
Gorkon's assassination was not enough to derail the peace process. The Federation President and Azetbur (who was the new Klingon Chancellor) were both determined to continue with this. The next meeting was set to take place at a neutral site, Camp Khitomer. The conspirators started to make plans to kill their next target: the Federation President. Meanwhile, Kirk and McCoy stood trial for Gorkon's assassination. Chang prosecuted them both and succeeded in having them both found guilty. However, the judge commuted a death sentence and sent them both to the penal asteroid Rura Penthe.
Not satisfied with this, Chang ordered the commandant of Rura Penthe to make sure Kirk and McCoy were killed during an escape attempt. However, Kirk and McCoy's escape succeeded. Kirk and McCoy were rescued by Enterprise. Knowing that his enemy would find out where the peace conference was, Chang took the modified Bird of Prey to Khitomer to wait for him.
As Chang predicted, the Enterprise arrived and tried to achieve an orbit of Khitomer. Safe from enemy fire in his invisible ship, Chang taunted Kirk and his crew with Shakespearean quotes. The Bird of Prey fired one torpedo after another, causing massive damage to the Enterprise. Another Federation ship, the Excelsior, arrived to help, but Chang only fired at it as well. For Chang, victory seemed very near. The Enterprise was very close to being destroyed, followed by its companion ship.
Suddenly, the Enterprise fired a torpedo. To Chang's surprise, the torpedo had been properly aimed at his supposedly invisible warship. The Enterprise had found a way to locate Chang's ship, by tracing its exhaust. Chang and his bridge crew were killed when a reconfigured gas-sampling torpedo hit. The Enterprise and Excelsior destroyed the Bird of Prey. Realizing he was beaten, Chang uttered his last Shakespeare quote: "To be, or not to be." Members of the Enterprise crew were then able to transport to Khitomer and stop the conspirators from shooting the Federation President. The resulting conference led to a peace that lasted almost a century — exactly the thing that Chang was trying to prevent.
Reception
In 2013, Rolling Stone magazine ranked Chang the 9th best villain of the Star Trek franchise, praising the performance of actor Christopher Plummer.
Time magazine rated General Chang the second best villain of the Star Trek franchise in 2016. In 2019, SyFy rated General Chang as the 8th greatest Klingon of the Star Trek franchise. In particular they note Plummer's brilliant delivery of lines, and an exceptional Klingon court scene with Captain Kirk (played by William Shatner) and Doctor McCoy (DeForest Kelley).

No. 317 "City of Wilno" Polish Fighter Squadron () was a Polish fighter squadron formed in Great Britain as part of an agreement between the Polish Government in Exile and the United Kingdom in 1941. It was one of several Polish fighter squadrons fighting alongside the Royal Air Force during World War II.
History
The squadron was formed at RAF Acklington on 22 February 1941 and reached operational readiness on 24 April 1941. It was equipped with Hurricane Mk.Is until July when it received Mk.IIs. The squadron moved south in June and received Spitfires in October. As with most Fighter Command squadrons it alternated its operations between offensive sweeps from bases in the south and defensive duties whilst based in the north and midlands.
In June 1943 the squadron was allocated to the 2nd Tactical Air Force and moved to RAF Heston. During the buildup to the invasion of Normandy the squadron carried out offensive sweeps in preparation for the landings. After the invasion they conducted ground attack operations in support of Allied ground forces, moving to the continent in August.
The squadron arrived in Belgium in October 1944 and Germany in April 1945, remaining there as part of the occupation forces until disbanding as a Polish fighter unit on 3 January 1947 (it had earlier disbanded as a RAF fighter unit at RAF Hethel on 18 December 1946).

Lichen nitidus is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown cause characterized by 1–2 mm, discrete and uniform, shiny, flat-topped, pale flesh-colored or reddish-brown papules that may appear as hypopigmented against dark skin. Occasionally, minimal scaling is present or can be induced by rubbing the surface of the papules. The disease usually affects children and young adults and is painless and usually nonpruritic, although protracted itching may occur in some cases. It is sometimes referred to by dermatologists as "mini lichen planus".
Presentation
Linear arrangements of these papules is common (referred to as a Koebner phenomenon), especially on the forearms, but may occasionally be grouped, though not confluent, on flexural areas. Generally, the initial lesions are localized, and remain so, to the chest, abdomen, glans penis, and flexor aspects of the upper extremities; however, less commonly, the disease process can (1) be strictly isolated to the palms and soles, presenting with many hyperkeratotic, yellow papules that may coalesce into plaques that fissure or “...sometimes a non-specific keratoderma resembling chronic eczema,” or (2) become more widespread, with papules widely distributed on the body—the extensor surfaces of the elbows, wrists, and hands, folds of the neck, submammary region in females, groin, thighs, ankles, and feet—and fusing into erythematous, minimally scaled plaques, with redness that develops tints of violet, brown, and yellow.
Pathology
The histology of lichen nitidus is significant for a "...localized granulomatous lymphohistiocytic infiltrate in an expanded dermal papilla with thinning of overlying epidermis and downward extension of the rete ridges at the lateral margin of the infiltrate, producing a typical 'claw clutching a ball' picture...."
Treatment
Generally, lichen nitidus is asymptomatic and self-limited; therefore, no treatment is required. However, if persistent pruritus is present, or the appearance “...interferes with daily activities or outlook...” topical glucocorticoids may be tried. If the disease process is symptomatic, generalized and extensive, oral glucocorticoids may be indicated. Other reported treatments include PUVA, UVA/UVB phototherapy, astemizole, acitretin, and etretinate.
When appears with sun/humidity; air conditioning (cool dry air) reduces swelling and discomfort.
History
Felix Pinkus first described the condition in 1907.

Admiral Philip Affleck ( December 21, 1799) was an admiral in the Royal Navy. He was the younger brother of Sir Edmund Affleck. Affleck held various commands throughout the latter half of the 18th Century, most notably as commander-in-chief of the Jamaica Station and as a Lord of the Board of Admiralty. Early in his career he fought at the Siege of Louisbourg where he was promoted commander after carrying out a successful cutting-out mission. He was promoted to post-captain a year later after impressing Admiral Edward Boscawen during the Battle of Lagos. Later in his career he joined Admiral Sir George Rodney in the West Indies and took part in the capture of Sint Eustatius. Between 1790 and 1792 he held the position of commander-in-chief of the Jamaica Station and between 1793 and 1796 he held his position as a Lord of the Board of Admiralty. Although his career was marked with long periods of inaction and unemployment Admiral Affleck was known as a good officer and was well respected by his peers.
Early career
Affleck began his nautical career in the service of the East India Company. He joined the navy at an undetermined date and was promoted acting-lieutenant in 1755. As a lieutenant he served either in the sloop-of-war or the bomb ketch although as his brother Edmund was serving at almost exactly the same time the records are a little unclear. At the Siege of Louisbourg he distinguished himself in leading the boats that cut out the French men-of-war Prudente and and was promoted to command. His promotion to commander was confirmed on 1 August 1759 and Affleck accompanied Edward Boscawen in the 18-gun sloop of war to the Mediterranean. In Gramont Affleck took part in the Battle of Lagos where he impressed Boscawen to such a degree that the admiral promoted Affleck to post-captain with the effective date of 28 August 1759 and put Affleck in command of the flagship . On his return to England he was assigned to and sent to India. During the blockade of Pondicherry on 1 January 1761 Panther was dismasted in a hurricane and once more Affleck impressed his superiors by his calm handling of the situation. In May 1761 he exchanged command of Panther with Captain Newsom to command the storeship but resigned command of her in early 1762. He then became captain of , which the British had captured some two years earlier at Pondicherry. Not long thereafter he returned to England.
HMS Triumph and the West Indies
In 1779 he was appointed captain of in the Channel Fleet.
In the spring of 1780 Affleck was sent to the West Indies to reinforce Admiral Rodney. He missed the Battle of Martinique in April of that year but was present with Rodney once more at the capture of Saint Eusatia and Saba the following February. He returned to England in 1781 and was on the beach until April 1783 when the Thunderer was recommissioned to be the guard ship in Portsmouth. He commanded her until July 1784 when his brother Edmund took over temporary command. Affleck remained unemployed until 24 September 1787 when he was appointed rear-admiral of the blue Squadron. In 1790 he was made commander-in-chief of the Jamaica Station.
Lord of the Admiralty
He returned to England in 1792 and was promoted in early 1793 to vice-admiral of the blue squadron. In April of that year he was appointed as one of the Lords of the Admiralty under John Pitt, Earl of Chatham. 11 April 1794 he was promoted to vice admiral of the white, 4 July 1794 vice admiral of the red, 1 June 1795 admiral of the blue and on 14 February 1799 to the rank of admiral of the white.
Retirement and death
Affleck retired from his seat on the Board of the Admiralty in 1796 and lived quietly and privately at his home in Bath. He died at his home on 21 December 1799. The Naval Chronicle said of him that he was "Universally respected as an officer, as a gentleman, and as a christian."
The Earl of Sandwich commented on Affleck that he was "very respectable and thoroughly right headed".

Week-End in Havana (also known as A Week-End in Havana and That Week-End in Havana) is a 1941 20th Century Fox Technicolor musical film directed by Walter Lang and starring Alice Faye and Carmen Miranda. It was the second of three pictures the two stars made together and the second Faye film to have a Latin-American theme, typical of Fox musicals of the early 1940s. Faye was pregnant during filming.
Plot
When his cruise ship, the Cuban Queen, runs aground near Florida on its way to Havana, New York ocean liner magnate Walter McCracken (George Barbier) sends his vice-president, Jay Williams (John Payne), to the site to forestall any legal action. Jay gets the passengers to sign claim waivers in exchange for future passage on another McCracken ocean liner. One passenger, Macy's salesclerk Nan Spencer (Alice Faye), refuses to sign, because she has saved for years for the vacation and cannot take it at any other time. When Nan hints that she is aware of the captain's negligence in the accident, Jay accedes to her demand that the company ensure her an enjoyable vacation in Havana. Nan refuses to sign the waiver until after her vacation is completed, so McCracken orders Jay to accompany her, even though he is soon to be married to McCracken's snobbish daughter Terry. Upon reaching Havana, Nan is delighted with the scenery but bored with Jay, who is too stodgy to provide the romance she craves. When charming fortune hunter Monte Blanca (Cesar Romero) comes across Nan, he believes that she will be the solution to his gambling debts.
Monte takes Nan to a casino run by Boris, who threatens Monte upon discovering that Nan is a simple salesclerk who cannot make good on the losses she believed Monte himself was going to pay. Jay, who has followed the couple, offers to pay off Monte's debts if he will romance Nan, thereby making sure she has a good time and will sign the waiver. Monte readily agrees, despite the jealousy of his tempestuous girlfriend, Rosita Rivas (Carmen Miranda), a singer whom Monte manages. In order to forestall Rosita's tantrums, Jay agrees to be her new manager, but regrets his decision when it becomes apparent that she wants to romance as well as advice.
One evening, Rosita meets Jay at a secluded inn, but Monte and Nan are already there, and during an ensuing argument, Monte reveals that he accepted Jay's proposition in order to repay Rosita money he owes her. Nan is furious at both men for the deception, and when Jay tries to follow her after she leaves, his car is accidentally wrecked. While walking back to town, Jay and Nan discover that they are genuinely attracted to each other. The next morning, happy that her vacation is going well, Nan gives Jay a signed waiver, but tears it up when Terry appears and intimates that Jay's behavior has been strictly business. Heartbroken, Nan signs another waiver and accepts from Terry a check for $1,000, which Terry says came from Jay. When Jay sends her a check for $150, however, Nan realizes that Terry was trying to bribe her without Jay's knowledge. Terry's scheming soon becomes apparent to Jay as well, and after he angrily sends her back to New York, he finds Nan in the nightclub where Rosita is performing. As Rosita and Monte dance together, Jay and Nan are reconciled, and everyone sings the praises of their weekend in Havana.

Production
The film was a follow-up to Down Argentine Way and That Night in Rio.
The working titles of the film were Caribbean Cruise and Honeymoon in Havana. In early March 1941, Betty Grable was scheduled to play Nan Spencer, and executive producer Darryl F. Zanuck suggested that Henry Fonda play Jay Williams. The March 17, 1941 The Hollywood Reporter also noted that Grable and Fonda were set for the lead roles, while the May 2, 1941 The Hollywood Reporter stated that Don Ameche would have a lead role. The same publication reported in late 1940 that Jack Andrews and George Seaton were to work on the film's screenplay. Although the extent of Seaton's contribution to the completed picture has not been confirmed, the Twentieth Century-Fox Records of the Legal Department, indicate that Andrews' material was not used. The legal records also indicate that an original story outline entitled Caribbean Cruise, written by Frank S. Nugent, was not used. The story files and The Hollywood Reporter articles reveal that first Harry Joe Brown and then Fred Kohlmar were set to produce the picture.
When Kohlmar left to work at Paramount, William LeBaron assumed production responsibilities. This was the first film produced by LeBaron for Twentieth Century-Fox. The Hollywood Reporter reported that the studio had tested Phillip Reed for a role and were considering casting him in the picture, and that Mal St. Clair had been signed to direct the musical sequences. Their participation in the released picture has not been confirmed, however. According to studio records and The Hollywood Reporter, "long shots with doubles, atmospheric shots and process plates" were filmed on location in Havana and the Cuban countryside. Second unit director James Havens and his crew were on location for approximately one month. The September 26, 1941 The Hollywood Reporter reported that Alice Faye was going to retire from the screen temporarily while awaiting the birth of her first child. Faye returned from retirement for Hello Frisco, Hello (1943).
According to information in the Motion Picture Production Code, the PCA rejected a May 14, 1941 version of the script because of "the inference of an illicit sex relationship" between Rosita and Monte, and Jay and Nan, and the indication that Rosita wished to enter into such a relationship with Jay. The PCA especially objected to the use of the words "manage" and "manager" in respect to the relationships between Rosita, Monte and Jay. In June 1941, the PCA informed the studio: "We still get the impression that the word 'manage' is so used, or over-used, that one gets the feeling that it is intended to mean something which is sex suggestive." The problems were eventually resolved and the script approved.
Reception
In its release week, the film went to the top of the box office (at $25,000) and topped the now-classic Citizen Kane, which was in its second week of release ($9,000; $10,015 in the first week).
In his review of the film for The New York Times, Bosley Crowther wrote, "a slight improvement is noted in the simple plot this time (...) and as usual, Fox has filled it with color and rhythm and songs. Of the latter the final number, The Nango, sung by Miss Miranda and danced by dozens of flashy girls and boys, is far and away the best."

Melaleuca halmaturorum, commonly known as South Australian swamp paperbark, kangaroo honey-myrtle or salt paper-bark is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria. It is often a tree with an unusual, crooked form, sometimes looking like an enlarged example of bonsai.
Description
Melaleuca halmaturorum is a slow growing shrub or small tree, eventually growing to tall, often with a crooked, straggling, irregular or untidy form and creamy-grey, papery bark. Its leaves are dark green, glabrous and arranged in alternate pairs at right angles to the ones above and below (decussate), so that there are four rows of leaves along the stem. The leaves are linear to lance-shaped, long, wide, with many distinct oil glands on the lower surface and a stalk about long.
The flowers are white or cream and arranged in heads, sometimes on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering but also in the upper leaf axils. The heads are up to in diameter and contain up to five individual flowers. The flower buds are surrounded by brown, papery bracts which fall off as the flowers open. The petals are long and fall off as the flowers age. The stamens are arranged in bundles of five around the flower, usually with 6 to 17 stamens in each bundle. Flowering occurs from August to October and the fruit which follow are woody, cup-shaped capsules long and wide in loose clusters along the stem. The clusters remain in place for several seasons.
Taxonomy and naming
Ferdinand von Mueller was the first to give a formal description of Melaleuca halmaturorum but his description was not validly published. The first formal, valid description was by the Dutch botanist, Friedrich Miquel in 1856 and published in Nederlandsch Kruidkundig Archief. The type specimen was collected "Ad flumen three-Wells-river insulae Halmaturorum", a Latin phrase meaning "near the Three Wells River on Kangaroo Island". Halmaturus was an earlier name for a genus of kangaroo. Three Wells River was later named the Morgan, then the Cygnet. The specific epithet (halmaturorum) refers to Kangaroo Island where the type specimen was collected.
Distribution and habitat
Melaleuca halmaturorum occurs in southern parts of Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria. In Western Australia it is found in the Eremaean and South-West botanical provinces. In South Australia it occurs in the Eyre Peninsula, Murray, Yorke Peninsula, Southern Lofty, Kangaroo Island and South-Eastern bioregions. In Victoria it occurs in the Mallee, Loddon Murray, Central and Northern and Wimmera bioregions but is becoming rare due to invasion by tall wheat grass (Lophopyrum ponticum). Melaleuca halmaturorum is salt tolerant and often found in swampy, waterlogged areas such as estuaries, coastal dunes and the fringes of salt lakes.
Conservation status
This melaleuca is listed as "not threatened" (in Western Australia) by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife.
Use in horticulture
Melaleuca halmaturorum is a very hardy plant in full sun. It is often used in revegetation to remediate and stabilise saline sites.

The Kanawha County textbook controversy was a violent school control struggle in the 20th century United States. It led to the largest protests ever in the history of Kanawha County, West Virginia, the shooting of one bystander, and extended school closings. The controversy erupted in 1974 when new, multicultural textbooks were introduced that some parents considered blasphemous.
1974 school board ruling
In 1970, West Virginia's Superintendent of Schools signed a proposal for funding to ensure the training of teachers to "induce change" so that children in the state's educational system could elevate and expand above their own cultural surroundings the state views as limited. On 12 March 1974, the English Language Arts Textbook Committee of Kanawha County, West Virginia recommended 325 books and textbooks to the school board for use in Kanawha schools ranging from kindergarten to 12th grade. The books were selected by the Committee based on state guidelines that had been set, including but not limited to some that books should be "multicultural in content and authorship". An English teacher on the committee stated that although she held strong conservative values, she felt that removing books that showed opposing opinions would be equivalent to "telling lies by omitting ideas I know exist". Among these were titles such as America Reads and Language of Man. These textbooks were part of a new state curriculum that included for the first time the concepts of multiculturalism and egalitarianism in textbook writing. Most school board members saw no reason to question the state's decision.
Alice Moore
Alice Moore had previously campaigned against sex education being taught in the county and was elected as the only member of the Kanawha County School Board that did not have a college degree. Moore also had four children attending county schools. Moore was concerned by the term dialectology, which implied the teaching of Appalachian English and African American Vernacular English as "equally correct" dialects. Historian Carol Mason writes that Moore did not want White children to learn language used by African Americans with the belief that it would cause the White children "to speak in ghetto dialect."
The school board moved to review the books before sending them to schools. Upon receiving the review copies, Moore was offended by a quote from the Autobiography of Malcolm X in which he referred to Christians as "brainwashed"; she requested and received all 300 textbooks, and claimed that she found unsettling quotations from Allen Ginsberg, Sigmund Freud's writings on the Oedipus complex, and convicted Black Panthers such as Eldridge Cleaver's "Soul on Ice" and by George Jackson.
Moore then telephoned Mel Gabler, a textbook evaluator who ran Educational Research Analysts, a conservative Christian non-profit organization in Texas. Gabler in return sent pamphlets and outlines of some of the ways in which the content of the books allegedly conflicted with Christian values, moral uprightness, and patriotism. Moore, the wife of a fundamentalist minister, reported her concerns to the board and local newspapers. On 23 May, Moore came to the school board meeting and charged that the textbooks were "filthy, disgusting trash, unpatriotic and unduly favoring blacks". She argued that the textbooks taught children to disrespect the beliefs of their parents and taught a brand of relativism that did not belong in West Virginia. She generated much publicity for her cause and won the support of the local Parent–Teacher Association and the Magic Valley Mother's Club. However, the West Virginia Council of Churches supported the books.
On 27 June the school board, including Moore met again, with over 1,000 local residents observing, and voted to approve the books after a three-hour debate over the merits of teaching a liberal curriculum. This was met with much consternation from conservative groups. Reverend Marvin Horan called for a boycott of all public schools. Flyers were distributed around the county which purported to demonstrate the lewdness of the books, but were actually quotations from completely different books like Sexual Politics that were not part of the curriculum. When parents could not find these passages in their children's own textbooks, they accused the teachers of hiding the real books from them.
In 2011, Moore received the Dr. Robert Dreyfus Courageous Christian Leadership Award, from a South Carolina based ministry that promotes Christian based schools to parents. Announced in The Washington Times, a conservative news publication. The article states that she is a "culture war heroine" who fought against anti-Christian education and liberal indoctrination. The publication went further to state that her leadership in the "uprising" was a pre-cursor to the Tea Party Movement.
Boycott and violence
The boycott escalated quickly. Nine thousand out of 45,000 elementary school students in the county were kept home from school. Thousands of miners, bus drivers, and trucking workers joined in the boycott. The Department of Education called for a compromise, but Reverend Horan denounced them, demanding that the boycott continue until the books were permanently removed and the supporting members of the school board fired. Bombs were planted at an elementary school and a school board building; another elementary school was dynamited, school buses were attacked with shotguns, and rocks were thrown at the homes of children who continued to attend school during the boycott. Alice Moore herself fled town during this time.
Reverend Charles Quigley asked Christians to "pray that God will kill the giants who have mocked and made fun of dumb fundamentalists", leading one student to point out, "They're shooting people because they don't want to see violence in books." Kanawha's sheriff asked for state troopers to be sent in, but West Virginia Governor Arch A. Moore, Jr. denied the request. Schools were closed several times to avoid further violence.
In April 1975 Marvin Horan was sentenced to three years in prison on charges related to the bombings, effectively ending the demonstration. In the fall of 1975, the school board restored the full line of books that they had approved before to all county schools.
Legacy
Joe L. Kincheloe in Understanding the New Right and its Impact on Education (1983) made the argument that the actions of Kanawha County School Board Member Alice Moore and her fundamentalist Christian allies in the 1974 controversy represented a defining moment in not only educational politics but American political history as well. Arguing that the Kanawha County textbook controversy was the first major victory for conservative evangelical Christians in the politically polarizing cultural debates that emerged from the 1960s social unrest, Kincheloe wrote in the early 1980s and in subsequent work that the victory was a key moment in what he and Aaron Gresson (2004) have labeled the right-wing recovery movement. This movement has profoundly shaped subsequent American education and electoral politics, as proponents have attempted to regain the power they perceived themselves to have lost in the 1960s cultural movements. In the case of the Kanawha County controversy, Moore and her supporters perceived that progressive secularists were undermining Christian values in their embrace of moral relativism, atheism and sexual experimentation (amongst other things) in educational textbooks a la 1960s liberationism.
After the textbook controversy, a network of private Christian schools was founded across the state, teaching Christian principles in place of the concepts at the center of the controversy.

Alf Clay (8 January 1914 – 24 January 1995) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Hawthorn, Footscray, Fitzroy and North Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL).
It wasn't until Clay came to Fitzroy that he gained regular senior selection, having been a fringe player at both Hawthorn and Footscray. He kicked four goals on debut for Fitzroy in 1940, against St Kilda at Brunswick Street Oval. After making just five appearances that year, Clay played a total of 35 games in his next three seasons. In 1943 he played in a semi final but missed out on Fitzroy's premiership the following year when he crossed to North Melbourne early in the season.
He was of no relation to the Clay twins, Bert and Ivor, who played for Fitzroy during the time he was at the club.

Māhia Peninsula (Maori: or ) is located on the east coast of New Zealand's North Island, in the Hawke's Bay region, between the towns of Wairoa and Gisborne.
Rocket Lab has set up its Launch Complex 1 close to Ahuriri Point at the southern tip of the peninsula to launch its Electron rocket. Currently, it is being used as a commercial launcher of small satellites in the range of 135–235 kg, and miniature satellites called CubeSats. New Zealand's first orbital space launch took place from Launch Complex 1 on 21 January 2018.
Geography
The peninsula is long and wide. Its highest point is Rahuimokairoa, above sea level. The peninsula was once an island, but now a tombolo joins it to the North Island.
Demographics
The statistical area of Mahia, which at 472 square kilometres is larger than the peninsula and includes Nūhaka, had a population of 1,119 at the 2018 New Zealand census. This was a decrease of 153 people (−12.0%) since the 2006 census. There were 456 households. The median age was 49 years, compared with 37.4 years nationally. Ethnicities were 64.9% Māori, 48.8% European/Pākehā, 1.1% Pacific peoples, 0.8% Asian, and 1.3% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities). This compares with a 16.5% of New Zealanders identifying as Māori.
Although some people objected to giving their religion, 35.4% had no religion, 49.3% were Christian and 9.1% had other religions.
Of those at least 15 years old, 126 (13.9%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 207 (22.8%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $21,400, compared with $31,800 nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 339 (37.3%) people were employed full-time, 150 (16.5%) were part-time, and 72 (7.9%) were unemployed.
History and culture
Māori history
In Maori legend, Whatonga, who came to New Zealand in search of his grandfather Toi, settled at Mahia.
The peninsula is the tribal area of the Ngāti Rongomaiwahine iwi. The word māhia means "indistinct sound" or "scrofulous swelling".
The name "Te Māhia" comes from "Te Māhia-mai-tawhiti" (the sound heard from a distance).
Portland Island, also called Waikawa, is a small island off the southern tip of Mahia Peninsula. It was named Waikawa by Kahungunu when he visited there to look for fresh drinking water and only found salt water – Waikawa means "sour water". Portland Island has an unmanned lighthouse.
European history
Shore whaling was briefly important on the Mahia Peninsula. Early whalers had a whaling station on the farm "Kini Kini", sheltered by "Long Point" on the west coast of the peninsula. The peninsula community these days is still generally a mix of Maori and European.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was proposed to by her partner, Clarke Gayford, on Mokotahi Hill.
Marae
There are four maraes in the Mahia area affiliated with the hapū of the Ngāti Kahungunu iwi:
The Kaiuku or Oku-ra-renga Marae and its Kiwi meeting house are affiliated with the hapū of Ngāti Tama, Ngāi Tū and Rongomaiwahine.
Te Rākatō Marae is affiliated with the hapū of Ngāi Rākatō.
Tuahuru Marae and its Hine te Rongo meeting house are affiliated with the hapū of Ngāti Tama, Ngāi Tū and Rongomaiwahine.
Ruawharo Marae is also affiliated with Ngāti Tama and Rongomaiwahine.
In October 2020, the Government committed $1,949,075 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade 24 Ngāti Kahungunu marae, including both Kaiuku and Ruawharo Marae, creating 164 jobs. It also committed $102,644 to upgrading Tuahuru Marae, creating 4 jobs.
Economy
Sheep and cattle farms are an important part for the local community, but tourism is now the peninsula's main industry. Mahia's population swells greatly during the warmer months and in particular during school holidays.
Mahia is well known for its surf, scuba diving, hiking, and fishing. Morere Hot Springs is 15 minutes away, towards Gisborne. The area is a popular school holiday destination and contains a holiday park dating back to the 1960s. The remaining settlement consists mostly of holiday houses and baches.
From 2007 to 2010 Mahia became known for the presence of Moko, a dolphin.
The peninsula is the location of the Rocket Labs launch facility, which has been used to launch spy satellites for the United States of America.
Education
Te Mahia School is a year 1–8 co-educational state primary school. It is a decile 1 school with a roll of as of The school opened in 1917.

A series of riots began in Dublin's south city centre on the night of 4 June 2021 over the June bank holiday weekend and during the COVID-19 pandemic, in which glass bottles and other objects were thrown at members of the Garda Síochána. A number of public order incidents began when Gardaí attempted to disperse large organised groups congregating at a number of locations including South William Street, St Stephen's Green and Temple Bar Square.
Riots
First night
On the evening of Friday 4 June 2021, large crowds were present in Dublin city centre with the vast majority of people socialising responsibly and enjoying outdoor activity. A number of public order incidents occurred in the south city centre, primarily involving large organised groups congregating, drinking alcohol, singing and dancing at a number of locations including South William Street, St Stephen's Green and Temple Bar Square.
The night saw clashes between the Garda Public Order Unit and people partying on the street at South William Street, in breach of COVID-19 restrictions, where violence broke out with glass bottles and other objects being thrown before a Garda baton charge dispersed the crowd. Footage of the baton charge was widely shared on social media with some expressing criticism at the tactics used by Gardaí on the scene. The violent attacks resulted in 14 people, including nine adults and five juveniles, arrested for public order offences, a Garda member sustaining a leg injury and receiving hospital treatment, and a Garda patrol vehicle being damaged.
Assaults
Videos shared online showed assaults on the streets of Dublin as groups of people were drinking. On Grafton Street, a man in his 40s required hospital treatment after suffering a slash to the head. In a separate incident, an employee at a local business was assaulted and left with facial injuries. Other videos showed incidents in Temple Bar and an assault in a train station.
Second night
Throughout the afternoon and evening of Saturday 5 June, Gardaí maintained a visible presence in Dublin city centre. A number of main streets were sealed off by Gardaí, crowds were cleared from South William Street, South Ann Street, Dawson Street, St Stephen's Green and Temple Bar, while Gardaí were armed with riot shields in a bid to disperse crowds that had begun gathering and prevent similar scenes to Friday night and restricted access to St Stephen's Green for people who carried alcohol.
However, for a second consecutive night of public order incidents, violence erupted in Dublin's south city centre. Gardaí again came under fire from glass bottles and other objects after around 200 youths gathered on South Anne Street at around 9pm. "Soft cap" public order units with shields were deployed, and dispersed crowds along the street, as well as Dawson Street. At around 10:15pm, more glass bottles were thrown in the Temple Bar area and the public order unit once again dispersed crowds. The violent attacks resulted in 19 people, including two juveniles, arrested for public order offences, two Garda members injured, a bin set on fire, a passer-by assaulted, and a Garda patrol vehicle being damaged.
Third night
An extensive, high visibility policing operation was put in place by uniformed officers supported by public order units on Sunday 6 June.
14 people (including 3 juveniles) were arrested during a third consecutive night of public order incidents, as Gardaí dispersed crowds of youths "loitering" in the city centre. The night was, however, quieter with most people socialising responsibly outdoors, and no Gardaí were injured.
Response and reaction
On 5 June, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly described the public order incidents in Dublin's south city centre as "thuggish behaviour and completely unacceptable". He said what happened in the South William Street area "was nothing short of a disgrace" and that "nobody has the right to attack our Garda". The Lord Mayor of Dublin Hazel Chu described the anti-social behaviour in Dublin as "appalling", "obnoxious" and "depressing".
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said she had contacted the office of Garda Commissioner Drew Harris seeking to discuss her concerns around what she said was a lack of planning for large gatherings in Dublin, and said nobody wanted to see a repeat of the scenes witnessed on 4 June and that a plan was needed to avoid that. She said: "I'm looking to speak to Drew Harris because we need to know at this stage that there is a plan, we need to know what the plan is and we need very tight communication now with the Garda Síochána and Dublin City Council in particular."
On 6 June, Minister for Justice Heather Humphreys defended the Garda response to the Dublin disorder by saying the vast majority of people were enjoying themselves responsibly outdoors and "we cannot let the actions of a tiny minority intent on causing trouble overshadow that", and warned: "We have made so much progress in tackling the virus and we must not put the further re-opening of our society and economy at risk." The Green Party leader Eamon Ryan condemned the public order incidents and called for policing in Dublin to be managed "in a much more thought through manner".
The Garda Síochána said they would not tolerate anti-social behaviour in Dublin city following the two consecutive nights of public order incidents. Assistant Commissioner Ann Marie Cagney defended the police approach taken stating that it was necessary for Gardaí to have shields for their protection.
On 7 June, speaking on RTÉ's Morning Ireland, the President of the Garda Representative Association Frank Thornton claimed that the vast majority of people in Dublin over the weekend complied with COVID-19 restrictions and it was only "a minority grouping that seemed hell bent on just creating havoc", and said there were only "a small number of occasions" when Gardaí were met with hostility.
Garda Commissioner Drew Harris said an element of young, drunk people were responsible for causing violent disturbances in Dublin, and singled out the selling of takeaway alcohol from licensed premises which, he said, led to people drinking in public places, resulting in attacks on Gardaí, criminal damage, and public disorder. Harris rejected criticism that the Garda response may have been over-reactionary, and said Gardaí were simply doing their job by responding to the violent events.

Venkatraman, the film won the Indira Gandhi Award for Best Debut Film of a Director at the 30th National Film Awards in 1983. The film was based on Indira Parthasarathy's novel Kuruthipunal which won the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1977. It stars newcomer Vijaymohan and Poornima Jayaram, with Jaishankar, Rajesh, N. Viswanathan and Raveendran in pivotal roles. The film's score and soundtrack were composed by Ilaiyaraaja while cinematography was handled by Soumendu Roy.
Plot
Gautam, a photojournalist with revolutionary ideas, leaves his job after his editor fails to publish the true happenings of the society in their newspaper. One of Gautam's friends suggests him to organize an art exhibition to showcase his paintings. During the event, he happens to meet Arundhati, a Bharatanatyam dancer, who is keen to stage a classical ballet on Nandanar, a tenth century dalit saint. Gautam suggests Arundhati to present it in a folk-art form rather than a classical-art form like Bharatanatyam to which she agrees.
Gautam and Arundhati travel to Kilvenmani, a village in Thanjavur district, Tamil Nadu, to meet Thambiran, an aged exponent of Theru Koothu, a common folk-art form in Tamil Nadu. Gautam and Arudnhati both stay at the landlord's (Rajarathinam) house. In the village they happen to meet various characters – Vairam, a tea shop owner, his pregnant wife Valli, their daughter Amudha, Kaalai, a blacksmith, Pakkiri, a mad minstrel, and Papathy, a village belle who works as a maid in Rajarathinam's house. Gautam and Arundhati become more attached with these characters. Vairam and Kaalai stand up against Raja demanding higher wages for workers employed by Raja. Gautam and Arundhati happen to meet Thambiran who agrees to help them stage the ballet. An angered Raja tells the police that Vairam's teashop has encroached the temple's land, and orders his henchmen to destroy the shop. Kaalai provides shelter to Vairam and his family. Gautam, on seeing the injustice being done to Vairam, talks to Raja for which the latter advises him not to interfere in this issue. Papathy wishes to be photographed and approaches Gautam for which Raja's henchmen attack him. After this incident, Gautam and Arundhati leave Raja's house and take shelter at Thambiran's house. While researching Nandanar's biography, Gautam gets a new perspective for the story based on the events that take place in the village and develops a story based on Raja's cruel acts. In the meanwhile, Raja's goons abduct Vairam. A group of villagers led by Kaalai gather outside Raja's house. Gautam approaches Papathy to join the protest against Raja and asks her to reveal the whereabouts of Vairam. Kaalai and the villagers rescue Vairam after Papathy lets them know that Vairam is kept at Raja's rice mill.
As the villagers protest demanding higher wages, Raja employs workers from nearby villages. When Vairam and Kaalai try to stop the workers, Raja arrives with a group of policemen. Kaalai beats Raja and gets immediately arrested for the act. A lawyer bails out Kaalai and ask them to take police protection to which they refuse. Vairam and Kaalai are attacked by Raja's henchmen while returning to their village during which Kaalai gets killed. With the help of the police, Raja labels Kaalai as a Naxalite to get the case closed. On hearing this, the villagers refuse to cremate Kaalai, but Vairam cremates him outside the village. Meanwhile, Raja files a complaint against Gautam, Arundhati and Vairam on a false pretext that they have stolen his possessions and attacked his mother. Arundhati gets saved by one of the villagers when Raja's goons try to molest her. The goons also set Kaalai's hut on fire, but Pakiri saves Vairam's family. He along with Vairam fight Raja's goons and kill them before being arrested by the police. The whole colony gets burnt. The following day, Raja is seen walking happily on his land. Papathy meets him and at first appears affectionate, but after they hug, she stabs him to death.

Sreedhar Rajan, a journalist and film critic, wrote the screenplay of Kann Sivanthaal Mann Sivakkum based on Indira Parthasarathy's novel Kuruthipunal which won the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1977. The novel, in turn was based on the Kilvenmani massacre that took place in Thanjavur district in 1968. Inspired by the novel, Sreedhar Rajan made the film with a revolutionary theme, set in the backdrop of folk-arts. It marked Sreedhar Rajan's directorial debut. Sreedhar Rajan used a fusion of revolutionary communism and folk in the film. The film narrated the tale of Nandanar, a dalit saint and one of the 63 Nayanars. Bharata Natyam dancer V. P. Dhananjayan appeared in a song sequence, thus performing for the first time in a film. The sequence was meant to narrate Nandanar Charitam, the story of the saint.

Ras Tarkhan was a Khazar general of the mid 8th century, sometimes referred to as As Tarkhan, who led an invasion of Abbasid territories in Armenia, Caucasian Albania and northwestern Persia. He defeated the Arabs in the Battle of Shirvan and ensur the dominance of the Khazar Khanate in the Caucasus, and this battle was the end of the Khazar-Arab Wars. Scholars have debated over whether Ras Tarkhan is a name or a title. As Tarkhan, used as a title, would mean "general of the Alans", possibly indicating a role as commander of Alan mercenaries or auxiliaries.
According to Zeki Validi Togan and Peter Benjamin Golden, Ras Tarkhan came from a clan called Khatiriltber.

Vortexx was a short-lived American Saturday morning children's television programming block that aired on The CW from August 25, 2012 to September 27, 2014. Programmed by Saban Brands, it replaced Toonzai, a block that was programmed by 4Kids Entertainment until its bankruptcy. The Vortexx block primarily featured animated programs, although it also featured several live-action series, including the Lost Galaxy installment of the Power Rangers franchise (which had been re-acquired by Saban), and the WWE wrestling series WWE Saturday Morning Slam.
The block was replaced by Litton Entertainment's One Magnificent Morning which features live-action educational programming on October 4, 2014. It was the conclusive Saturday morning block across the major U.S. broadcast television networks primarily featuring traditional entertainment programming aimed at children with little to no educational value. The last airing on the block was Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal episode 89, "Darkness Dawns" at 11:30 a.m.
History
On April 6, 2011, following a lawsuit involving the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise, 4Kids Entertainment, which programmed the CW4Kids/Toonzai block for the network, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On May 1, 2012, Kidsco Media Ventures, an affiliate of Saban Capital Group, placed a bid to acquire some of Jessica Borutski' assets. On June 26, 2012, after competition from 4K Acquisition Corp, a subsidiary of Konami, the deal was finalized, with 4K Acquisition receiving the U.S. rights to the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise and Saban receiving all other assets, including the programming rights to The CW's Saturday morning block. On July 2, 2012, it was announced that Saban Capital Group, via Kidsco Media Ventures, would begin programming the block that fall. On July 12, 2012, it was announced that the block would be named Vortexx, which launched on August 25, 2012.
In 2013, Vortexx became the only Saturday morning block without a strictly E/I-based lineup to air on broadcast TV. This happened in November of that year, when Tribune acquired Weigel's 50% stake in This TV, and their Cookie Jar Toons/This Is for Kids block came to an end.
Cancellation and replaced by One Magnificent Morning
In June 2014, The CW announced that Vortexx would be discontinued and replaced on October 4, 2014 by One Magnificent Morning, a block produced by Litton Entertainment that would feature live-action documentary and lifestyle programs aimed at pre-teens and teenagers, similarly to a block also introduced by Litton for CW co-owner CBS the previous year. The move came as part of a shift by broadcast television networks towards using their Saturday morning lineup solely to comply with the educational programming requirements mandated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), along with the cultural shift towards cable and online video on demand viewing of children's and animated programming. Vortexx aired for the final time on September 27, 2014. It was the last conclusive Saturday morning block across the major American broadcast television networks that primarily featured non-educational programming aimed at children. The KidsClick block from Sinclair Broadcast Group launched on both Sinclair stations and This TV on July 1, 2017, but had no association with a traditional broadcast network otherwise.
Scheduling
Officially the network preferred the block to air from 7:00 a.m. to Noon in each time zone, though there were local scheduling variances in some areas that may have moved it to different hours, to Sundays, or split the lineup between Saturday or Sunday, along with local pre-emptions of select shows. CW Plus stations in the Central, Mountain, and Alaska time zones also aired the block one hour earlier or later, depending on the local time zone, as The CW Plus operates separate feeds based on the network's Eastern and Pacific time zone scheduling for primetime shows. San Antonio CW affiliate KMYS split the Vortexx block over two days, between early Sunday and early Monday mornings before 5:00 a.m. due to an existing arrangement to air Fox's Weekend Marketplace paid programming block in lieu of sister station KABB.
Past exclusions
WTVW in Evansville, Indiana (which hurriedly joined The CW on January 31, 2013 due to the market's former affiliate going dark) was unable to schedule the block when it initially began its affiliation with the network, due to contractual obligations to paid programming slots and existing syndicated E/I'm programming on Saturday mornings through March 2013. The station began carrying Vortexx in its network-recommended timeslot on April 6, 2013, with the station's acquired E/I'm programming moving to Sunday afternoons.
Video-on-demand
On April 29, 2013, Saban Brands announced a separate partnership with Kabillion to add programming from the Vortexx block to the existing Kabillion video on demand service for cable providers. The programs were listed on the service without any separate Vortexx subdivision under their individual show titles, with Vortexx promotional advertising. The shows currently remain on Kabillion with other advertising, even with the discontinuance of Vortexx.
Programming
Most of the block's programming aired in high definition, with older standard definition content presented in 4:3 or widescreen with stylized pillarboxing and windowboxing.
Vortexx only ran an hour of programming that met the FCC's educational programming guidelines; as a result, The CW's affiliates handled the responsibility of filling the remaining two hours, The CW Plus cable-subchannel affiliates had E/I-compliant programs not acquired from the syndication market built into the national schedule, alleviating stations carrying CW network programming via that feed from the responsibility of purchasing the local rights to such programs.

St Abraam Coptic Orthodox Church (Coptic: // transliteration: ti.eklyseya en.remenkimi en.orthodoxos ente fi.ethowab Abra'am) is a Coptic Orthodox parish in Woodbury, New York. It is one of over 200 Coptic Orthodox Churches in the United States.
History of the Building
St. Abraam Coptic Orthodox Church was incorporated by 20 families residing in Long Island in January 1978, only five years after the first Coptic Orthodox parishes in New York were founded in Ridgewood, Queens and Brooklyn, New York. For over a decade, these families used a Ukrainian church in Hicksville for accommodating weekly Liturgies. In September 1989, Pope Shenouda III blessed the endowned lands in preparation for building the church.
After the church was built in 1990, in a pastoral visit by Pope Shenouda, the parish was consecrated on 12 January 1992. It was the first Coptic Orthodox Church in Long Island, New York.
St. Abraam Coptic Orthodox Church serves areas in and around Long Island, particularly in Nassau County, which is just east of Queens. The closest Coptic Orthodox parish is St. Mary & St. Antonios Coptic Orthodox Church, in Ridgewood, Queens. St. Abraam Coptic Orthodox Church was served by multiple priests such as Fr. Micheal Tobia of East Brunswick NJ, Fr. Marcos Ghaly of Toledo, Ohio, as the Coptic Orthodox clergy in North America often visit or temporarily serve churches that are still developing. However, from recent years, Fr. Girgis Tadros was made a permanent priest of the church up until now. St. Abraam Coptic Orthodox Church currently has two priests, The Very Rev. Fr. Guirguis Tadros, The Very Rev. Fr. Moussa Shafik, and The Very Rev. Joseph Loka. There are currently about 600 Coptic families served by St. Abraam Coptic Orthodox Church.
The Coptic Orthodox Diocese of New York and New England was officially established in 2013 by Pope Tawadros II. Bishop David was consecrated in formal ceremonies taking place in Cairo, Egypt on November 16–17, 2013. Bishop David was formally enthroned on December 7, 2013 at St. Abraam Coptic Orthodox Church in a ceremony that brought together thousands of the Coptic faithful, clergy, and dignitaries. This church is now the seat of the bishop.

The Treaty of Windsor is the diplomatic alliance signed between Portugal and England on 9 May 1386 at Windsor and sealed by the marriage of King John I of Portugal (House of Aviz) to Philippa of Lancaster, daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster. With the victory at the Battle of Aljubarrota, assisted by English archers, John I was recognised as the undisputed King of Portugal, putting an end to the interregnum of the 1383–1385 Crisis. The Treaty of Windsor established a pact of mutual support between the countries.
This document is preserved at the Portuguese National Archives.
Historian Matthew Winslett says, "This treaty has been the cornerstone of both nations' relations with each other ever since."

Požun is a settlement in Croatia, part of the town of Ozalj in Karlovac County. Požun sits on the left bank of the Kupa, opposite Ozalj Castle.
Name
Požun is also the Croatian and Slovene name for Bratislava (formerly Slovak Prešporok; or ; ; ). The village of Požun may have been named after this city.
History
Little is known of the history of Požun. The museum in Ozalj Castle holds a stone axe found in Požun from the Neolithic Lengyel culture that dates from the 5th century B.C. This testifies to ancient settlement in the area, but it is unknown when the modern village of Požun was founded.
From 1102 to 1526, Croatia was ruled by the King of Hungary. After Hungary's defeat at the Battle of Mohács in 1526, a large swathe of Hungarian territory was occupied by the Ottoman Empire. The parts of Hungary not occupied by the Ottomans, including Croatia, entered the Austrian Habsburg monarchy. With Budapest in Ottoman hands, Poszony was designated the new capital of Hungary. The city became a coronation town and the seat of kings, archbishops (1543), the nobility and all major organisations and offices. Though they entered the monarchy separately, Croatia and Hungary were eventually united again within the monarchy and there were strong links between Poszony and Croatia in this period.
According to legend, Count Nikola Zrinski settled some Croats here from Poszony. There are two Count Nikola Zrinskis, however, and it is not clear to which this refers. The first lived from 1508 to 1566 and the second from 1620 to 1664. Without more exact information, the best that can be determined is that Požun was established at some point between the mid-16th and mid-17th century.
Population
According to the 2001 census, the settlement had 50 residents and 19 households.
According to the 2011 census, the settlement had 35 residents and 15 households. There were also 33 housing units, of which 21 were dwellings for permanent habitation.
Among residents of Požun, the following surnames are present: Čoraga, Jagunić, Volovšćak, Brajković, Tuškan, Volovščak, Kupres, Pavlaković, Badurina, Pilat, Radmanović and Fember. Čoraga is a rare surname in Croatia today, but it is the most common name in Požun (50% of the population).

Survivor Series helped WWE increase its pay-per-view revenue by $1.2 million, through ticket sales and pay-per-view buys. It received mixed critical reviews by various independent sources, including Canadian Online Explorer and the Pro Wrestling Torch. After its release on DVD, the event peaked at number five on Billboard'''s Video Sales chart, before it fell off the chart after ten weeks.
Production
Background
Survivor Series is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV), produced every November by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1987. In what has become the second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, referred to as the "Big Four". The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. The 2007 event was the 21st event in the Survivor Series chronology and featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown!, and ECW brands. The event was scheduled to be held on November 18, 2007, at the American Airlines Arena in Miami, Florida.
Storylines
Survivor Series was the culmination of various scripted plots and storylines. For three months before the event, several professional wrestling matches and scripted plots were played out on WWE's programming—Raw, SmackDown!, and ECW—to create feuds between various wrestlers, casting them as heroes and villains.
The main narrative for Survivor Series from the SmackDown! brand continued the events that unfolded at WrestleMania 23 in which The Undertaker defeated Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship. Over the course of several months, the two wrestlers fought in various matches over the title, which eventually involved Edge. Undertaker was injured in one of these matches on the May 11 episode of SmackDown!, in which Edge had won the title after cashing in his Money in the Bank contract to defeat Undertaker. During Undertaker's absence, Edge was legitimately injured and vacated the championship, and The Great Khali won the vacant championship in a Battle Royal. At Unforgiven, Batista won the World Heavyweight Championship from Khali, and Undertaker returned from his injury. Afterwards, the original feud between the two wrestlers was restarted and culminated into a singles match for the title at Cyber Sunday; Batista won this match and retained his title. On the November 2 episode of SmackDown!, a rematch was booked in a Hell in a Cell match at Survivor Series.
The prime rivalry from the Raw brand continued a storyline that extended from Cyber Sunday, between WWE Champion Randy Orton and Shawn Michaels over Orton's title. At Cyber Sunday, Michaels was chosen by the WWE fans, via online voting, to face Orton for the title, though, Orton retained his title via disqualification. A rematch was promoted for Survivor Series on the October 29 edition of Raw, in which Michaels would face Orton for his title. Afterwards, Michaels and Orton fought in different match types over the weeks leading to Survivor Series. On the episode of Raw before Survivor Series, Michaels and Orton met "Face to Face", in which Orton attacked Michaels.
The prime storyline on the ECW brand featured ECW Champion CM Punk, John Morrison, and The Miz. Morrison and Punk's rivalry revolved over the outcome of their match at Vengeance: Night of Champions, in which Morrison (then known as Johnny Nitro) defeated Punk to win the vacant title. Punk sought revenge, but Morrison defeated Punk in two championship matches at The Great American Bash and SummerSlam; however, Punk won the title from Morrison on the September 4 episode of ECW. At Cyber Sunday, Miz was voted online by fans to challenge Punk for the ECW Championship, though, Punk defeated Miz to retain his title. A Triple Threat match was announced for Survivor Series on the November 13 episode of ECW, in which Punk would defend his title against Morrison and Miz, and the first wrestler to gain a pinfall or submission would win the match and the title.
In a narrative extending to the September 10 episode of Raw, in which Hornswoggle, a dwarf, was announced as Vince McMahon's illegitimate son. In this storyline, McMahon did not like the fact that Hornswoggle was his son, and as a result, he promoted matches in which Hornswoggle faced much larger opponents. As part of this storyline, McMahon announced that The Great Khali would face Hornswoggle at Survivor Series. In a promotional in-ring segment on the episode of SmackDown! before the pay-per-view event, Khali and Hornswoggle weighed in for their match, in which Khali weighed double the weight of Hornswoggle; this was a segment created by McMahon to humiliate his son. The event included an inter-brand 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination tag team match. Announced via WWE.com, WWE's official website, Team Triple H (Triple H, The Hardy Boyz (Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy), Rey Mysterio, and Kane) would face Team Umaga (Umaga, Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP), Finlay, Big Daddy V, and Mr. Kennedy).
Event
Preliminary matches
The pay-per-view began with the ECW Championship Triple Threat match, in which CM Punk defended the title against John Morrison and The Miz. Throughout the match, The Miz and Morrison double-teamed Punk, however, Miz turned on Morrison by attacking him. After Miz threw Morrison out of the ring, Punk performed a Go-To Sleep on Miz to retain the ECW Championship.
The next scheduled match was an inter-brand 10-Diva tag team match, in which the team of Kelly Kelly, Torrie Wilson, Mickie James, Maria, and Michelle McCool faced Victoria, Beth Phoenix, Melina, Layla, and Jillian Hall. Phoenix's team had the advantage over James' team, until James was tagged into the match. She delivered a Clothesline and a Long Kiss Goodnight to Melina to earn the victory for her team.
Next was a tag team match for the World Tag Team Championship, in which the champions, Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch defended against Hardcore Holly and Cody Rhodes. At one point, Holly performed a Clothesline on Cade, and sent Cade and himself onto ringside. In the ring, Murdoch performed the "Ace of Spades" on Rhodes to retain the World Tag Team Championship for his team.
The fourth match was the five-on-four Survivor Series Elimination Tag team match between Team Triple H (Triple H, Jeff Hardy, Rey Mysterio, and Kane) and Team Umaga (Umaga, Mr. Kennedy, Montel Vontavious Porter, Finlay, and Big Daddy V). Before the event, it was announced that Matt Hardy would be unable to compete in the match due to a scripted injury. Kane was the first wrestler eliminated after an elbow drop by Big Daddy V. Umaga then eliminated Mysterio after the "Samoan Spike. MVP was eliminated by Hardy after a Twist of Fate. Kennedy was eliminated by Triple H after Big Daddy V accidentally performed an elbow drop on Kennedy. Big Daddy V was eliminated after Hardy and Triple H performed a Double DDT. Finlay and Umaga were then eliminated after a "Pedigree" to Finlay, and a "Swanton" to Umaga. As a result, Team Triple H won.
The Great Khali faced Hornswoggle in the next scheduled match. At one point, Hornswoggle tried to hit Khali with a shillelagh, but Khali slapped Hornswoggle down to the mat. The match ended via disqualification, after Finlay, Hornswoggle's original caretaker, entered the ring and hit Khali in the head with his own shillelagh and Finlay turned face.
Main event matches
The sixth match was Randy Orton defending the WWE Championship against Shawn Michaels. In the match, Michaels was banned from using "Sweet Chin Music", while Orton was unable to get disqualified, and if either man broke those stipulations they would have lost the match. Michaels attempted various submission moves, such as the Sharpshooter, Crossface, and ankle lock. Eventually, Michaels attempted to perform Sweet Chin Music but to prevent himself from losing the match, he stopped, which then allowed Orton to perform an RKO to retain the WWE Championship.
The main event was Batista defending the World Heavyweight Championship against The Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match. At one point, Batista performed a Batista Bomb through a table on Undertaker for a near-fall. The Undertaker then performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Batista for a near-fall. The Undertaker then performed another Tombstone Piledriver on top of the steel steps and pinned Batista, but as the referee counted the pin, Edge, dressed as a cameraman, pulled the referee out of the ring, and hit The Undertaker with the camera he was holding and then positioned Undertaker's head on top of the steel steps. Edge then slammed a folding chair onto The Undertaker's head. While the referee re-entered the ring, Edge dragged Batista onto The Undertaker, and as a result, Batista pinned The Undertaker to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. After the match, Edge came back into the ring and hit The Undertaker with a chair as he was sitting up.
Reception
The American Airlines Arena usually has a capacity of 19,600, which was reduced for Survivor Series due to production purposes. From an approximate attendance of 12,000 and 341,000 pay-per-view buys, Survivor Series helped WWE earn $19.9 million in pay-per-view revenue versus $18.7 million the previous year; this was confirmed by WWE in its 2007 fourth quarter financial report. Although Survivor Series helped WWE's revenue, it earned 42,000 fewer buys than the previous year's Survivor Series.
In addition, the pay-per-view received mixed reviews. Dale Plummer and Nick Tylwalk of Canadian Online Explorer's SLAM! Sports – Wrestling rated the entire event 7.5 out of 10 points. They also rated Raw and SmackDown's main event an 8 out of 10 points. J.D. Dunn of 411Mania stated that the event was "The best WWE PPV since Backlash." Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch, a professional wrestling newsletter operated since 1987, reported that the main event was "disappointing" and that "WWE set expectations too high for the Cell." He rated the Raw main event 3 out of 5 points, while rating the SmackDown main event 2.25 out of 5 points. Survivor Series was released on DVD on December 26, 2007 by WWE Home Video, and it was distributed by Genius Products. The DVD debuted on Billboard's Video Sales chart on January 19, 2008 at number five. It spent nine more weeks on the chart, before it fell off the chart at number 20.
Aftermath
After Survivor Series, Randy Orton was scripted into a feud with Chris Jericho, who made his return to WWE after a two-year hiatus. The following night on Raw'', the evolving feud culminated into a match being promoted for Armageddon, WWE's December pay-per-view. At Armageddon, Orton retained his WWE Title. After Batista retained his World Heavyweight Championship, Edge was scripted into a rivalry with him over his title. Eventually, The Undertaker was also placed in the feud, which led to the advertising of a Triple Threat match at Armageddon for the title. At Armageddon, Edge won the World Heavyweight Championship. Due to the events that occurred at Survivor Series, a match was announced between Finlay and The Great Khali for Armageddon. Finlay prevailed at Armageddon via pinning The Great Khali. After surviving their Elimination tag team match, Triple H and Jeff Hardy were promoted into a match for Armageddon, in which the winner would win the opportunity to challenge for the WWE Championship. At Armageddon, Hardy defeated Triple H. Because Beth Phoenix and Mickie James were the leaders of their teams at Survivor Series, a feud evolved from this, which culminated into a match at Armageddon over Phoenix's WWE Women's Championship. Phoenix retained her title at Armageddon.
This was the last Survivor Series PPV to air in 4:3 format until January 2008 when all WWE shows went in high definition.

The Changi Boardwalk (Chinese: 樟宜木板路), also known as Changi Point Coastal Walk (樟宜尾沿岸木板路), is a 2.2 km boardwalk at Changi Point, Singapore.
History
The Changi Boardwalk was conceptualised by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) as part of the Singapore Green Plan 2012 to enhance Changi point. The first phase construction of the boardwalk, comprising the western sections of the boardwalk, started on 29 October 2001 and was completed on 15 August 2003, costing S$3.5 million. The second phase construction of the boardwalk, comprising the eastern sections, was completed in five stages from 2004 to 2006. The total cost of environmental improvement works for Changi Point – including the S$5.4 million boardwalks and S$8 million improvements to the Changi Point Ferry Terminal – was about S$16.7 million.
Geography
The boardwalk is located at Changi Point, the easternmost part of Singapore. The boardwalk faces north-northwest to northeast for much of its length. It connects Changi Beach Club in the western end to the Changi Sailing Club at its midpoint and the Changi Point Ferry Terminal in the eastern end. The boardwalk is accessible from four entry points, namely Changi Village, Changi Sailing Club, Changi Beach and Changi Beach Park. The walk, with footpaths as wide as 2.4 metres, replaces mud tracks and trails that led from the road towards the rocky coastline. Night-lighting, tuned to a romantic glow, and rest points along the waterfront are among a host of amenities that the URA has put in place for visitors.
The area also offers a glimpse of giant heritage trees, such as the Damar Gajah Hitam, Tampines tree and the Malayan Rengas – all signposted – in the Netheravon Road area, which is connected to the coastal walk by a 1.5-km long park connector. The new park connector from Netheravon Road to Changi Village, completed in early 2005, links Changi Point to Pasir Ris and Changi Beach Park at a cost of $2.3 million. It includes a jogging and cycling track, fitness corners, rest areas and a surface car park for visitors.
Sections
The Changi Boardwalk consists of six distinct sections: from west to east, Sunset Walk, Kelong Walk, Cliff Walk, Sailing Point Walk, Beach Walk and Creek Walk.
Sunset Walk
This is the westernmost portion of the boardwalk. It is flanked by a hill of lush greenery on one side and the sea on the other. Its western end has a beautiful view of the sunset, hence its name.
Kelong Walk
This stretch of the boardwalk is built above water on kelong-like stilts. Several lookout pavilions on this walk are popular fishing spots.
Cliff Walk
Built slightly inland, the Cliff Walk is a path through lush greenery. Viewing decks constructed along the Cliff Walk offer panoramic views of the surroundings.
Sailing Point Walk
The longest stretch of the boardwalk, the Sailing Point Walk is built beside the sea, in front of Changi Sailing Club.
Beach Walk
This is the second longest stretch of the boardwalk. The Beach Walk faces the Serangoon Harbour and Changi Beach.

The Skirmish at Joncherey () was a clash in the Territoire de Belfort, on the border between France and Germany, and was the first military action of the Western Front of World War I. It occurred in the village of Joncherey near the French–German border in Alsace-Lorraine. The skirmish took place a day before the German declaration of war against France on 3 August 1914.
Skirmish
At around on 2 August 1914, Leutnant Albert Mayer and his small cavalry patrol illegally crossed the French border. They did not meet resistance, as the French had moved their troops back from the border, to avoid provoking the Germans and to show good faith in their attempts to avoid war. Twice that morning as the German party advanced further into France, they exchanged fire with small groups of French infantry. At Mayer slashed with his sabre at (but did not injure) a French sentry, who was on lookout at the entrance to Joncherey. French Corporal Jules Andre Peugeot and four other soldiers were at their billet, owned by a certain Louis Doucourt, eating breakfast at the time. The daughter of the owner of the house, Adrienne, came back inside from fetching water and reportedly said "The Prussians! The Prussians are coming!"
Around Peugeot and his four comrades went to arrest the Germans. Upon meeting, Mayer fired three shots at Peugeot. One hit his shoulder and Peugeot fired back as he was falling. Peugeot's comrades fired at the patrol with pistols. Mayer was shot in the stomach and seconds later was killed by a shot to the head. Peugeot stumbled back to the billet house where he died at Three more German soldiers were injured; one fled to the woods, where he hid for a few days before being captured; one went missing; and two made their way back to Germany.

Three O'Clock High is a 1987 American teen comedy film directed by Phil Joanou. The script, about a meek high schooler who is forced into a fight with a volatile new transfer student, is based on the high school experiences of screenwriters Richard Christian Matheson and Thomas Szollosi. It was shot in Ogden, Utah.
Plot
Meek high school student Jerry Mitchell and his sister Brei have the house to themselves while their parents are on vacation. The students this morning are gossiping about the new student Buddy Revell, a violent delinquent who has just transferred to Weaver from a continuation high school.
Jerry's first hour is spent at the school newspaper, where his best friend, Vincent Costello, is the editor. Their journalism teacher has the idea of doing an article about Buddy to welcome the "new kid", and she assigns Jerry to do an interview. Jerry sees Buddy in the restroom and clumsily attempts to introduce himself but realizes he is only making Buddy angry. He tells Buddy to disregard the interview request, and gives Buddy a friendly tap on the arm. Buddy, who does not like to be touched, responds by tossing Jerry against a wall and states the pair will fight outside the school at 3:00 P.M. Buddy also tells Jerry that running away or reporting the incident to a teacher will only make the situation worse.
With little more than six hours to go, Jerry tries different strategies to avoid the fight. Trying to reason with Buddy doesn't work. Vincent suggests that he plant a switchblade in Buddy's locker to get him kicked out of school; Brei advises him to simply skip school, but when Jerry tries to leave, he finds the switchblade he planted now stuck in his car's steering wheel, and his ignition wires cut. Trying to run, Jerry is caught by overzealous school security guard, Duke, who finds the switchblade and takes Jerry to the office of Mr. Dolinski, the Dean of Discipline. Doliniski warns Jerry he is under suspicion.
Jerry makes several other attempts to avoid the fight. All attempts fail, and the clock continues to tick down. Ultimately Buddy accepts cash Jerry stole from the school store in exchange for calling off the fight, but declares Jerry is a coward. Now seized with self-loathing and anger, Jerry decides to confront Buddy, and demands the money back. When Buddy refuses, Jerry insists that he is no coward and declares that their fight is back on.
The clock finally reaches the appointed hour, and the fight begins with hundreds of eager students awaiting the fight outside the school. Jerry, though out-matched, stands his ground while being knocked down. His sister picks up Buddy's dropped brass knuckles and slips them to Jerry. He uses them in a desperate move to stun and knock-out Buddy; during the excitement that follows, Buddy vanishes.
The next day, many students show their admiration and support to Jerry for such a great fight. They begin buying individual sheets of paper for $1 from the school store to help Jerry make up the store's missing cash. Buddy suddenly shows up, silencing the crowd. He openly returns the cash to Jerry, begrudgingly showing his respect. Weaver High is now filled with new gossip, as Jerry replaces Buddy as the school's hot discussion topic, with rumors having a wide and humorous range from the actual truth.

Box office
The film opened in 849 theaters nationwide on October 9, 1987 and earned $1,506,975 on its opening weekend, 40.9% of its total gross. The total lifetime gross is approximately $3,685,862, against the original budget of $5,000,000.
Critical response
The film earned mixed reviews, and has a "rotten" rating of 57% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 14 critical reviews.
Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times gave the film one out of four stars, declaring the plot to be "pretty stupid" and lamenting that the bully Buddy Revell, "the most interesting character", was underdeveloped.
In a retrospective review from 2016, critic Rob Hunter called the film "a wildly inventive and energetic look at the failures and successes of a typical high school day, and it shapes the daydreams and anxieties into an exaggerated delight."
The dark tone of the film contrasted with other teen films of the time—so much so that executive producer Steven Spielberg removed his name from the credits. In 2017, Adrian Halen wrote that Three O'Clock High was released in "an era when The Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, National Lampoon's Vacation and Weird Science were the general norm for moviegoers."

Kathryn ("Katy") Bindon (1949 - 9 Sep 2020) was the President of Okanagan University College from 1997 to 2004. She was the only woman to hold the position.
Katy Bindon was born in Toronto, Ontario. She earned her bachelor's degree in History at Sir George Williams University in 1972 with an Honours degree in Canadian History, was awarded a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship, and earned her master's degree from Queen's University in 1974; and a Ph.D. degree in 1979.
Bindon returned to Montreal in 1978 to teach history at Concordia University, where she was promoted to the rank of Associate Professor in 1983. She was appointed Principal of the School of Community and Public Affairs/Ecoles des Affaires Communautaires et Publiques in 1981. After four years, she moved to the Rector's Office as Special and Executive Assistant.
In 1986, Bindon was appointed vice-president (Academic) of Mount St. Vincent University in Halifax. In 1991, Bindon accepted the position of Principal of Sir Wilfred Grenfell College in Corner Brook, the West Coast campus of Memorial University of Newfoundland.
On 1 November 1997, Bindon become President of Okanagan University College, succeeding Dr. Bill Bowering. Between 1997 and 2004 she oversaw significant growth in the institution, including obtaining recognition from the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC) and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC). Under her stewardship external research funding grew from virtually nothing to $6.8 million in 2004–2005.
Along with the Chair of the OUC Board, Ian Wickett, Bindon was heavily involved in lobbying the Provincial Government for full university status for OUC. This intensive lobbying lead to strained relations between the Board and the Ministry and, as a result, the Board was fired by the Ministry and replaced with a new Board in 2001. Bindon, now along with the Chair of the new Board, Dr. George Ivany, continued her intensive lobbying efforts. Relations between the Ministry and OUC grew even more strained resulting in a government decision to dismiss the new Board in 2004 and replace it with a public administrator. At the same time, the Government announced that OUC would be dissolved, with the University of British Columbia taking over the university operations and the non-university operations becoming the basis for a new community college, which would later be named Okanagan College. Bindon was dismissed, and replaced by OUC vice-president, Dr. Peter Ricketts, for the final year of OUC's existence.
Bindon was for a time the President of The Royal University for Women (RUW, which describes itself on its home page as the first private, purpose-built, international University in the Kingdom of Bahrain dedicated solely to educating women). She was removed as president in 2007 after 18 months. Around 2012 she became program director of the Takatuf Scholars Programme, a Corporate Social Responsibility initiative of Oman Oil Company that invested in outstanding Omani youth, from preparation for higher education through completion of a four-year bachelor's degree in international placements.

Gil-dong is a dong, neighbourhood of Gangdong District in Seoul, South Korea.
Exit 1 leads to many different love motels, hoffs, and noraebangs. In this direction it is about 2 km to the Han River.
Exit 2 and 3 lead to the post office and a large Korean market. Along the main road on this side of the street, there are retailers and many Korean restaurants. There are also many dentists and noraebangs.
On the same street as the post office is a typical outdoor Korean market, made up of mostly fruit, vegetable, fish and Tteok sellers. It has become more gentrified lately and shops such as "The Face Shop" have moved in. This market runs the length of gil-dong on this backstreet. This area back from the main road is made up of many small one-way streets with many villas and traditional Korean houses lining them.
Gil-dong has the feel of an older, poorer Korean neighbourhood. There are many families and people riding bikes and buying groceries. The area is starting to change, though, and newer high rises are being built up near the Gildong-Gangdong intersection.
The area has relatively few hagwons, and hardly any foreigners live here.
History
Gil-dong is geographically located far away from the Han River, so the natives believe this area is easy to be settled and safe to avoid any damage from storm and flood, based on Feng shui Theory. In 1995, Seoul Subway Line 5 was passed through this area stopping at Gil-dong Station. On the area of Gil-dong, Gangdong Public Library, Sinmyung Middle School, Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital of Hallym University and a Leadership Training Institute of Doosan Group named Yeongangwon is located.
Area information
The current postal code of Gil-dong is 134–010. 134 is for Gangdong-gu and 010 is for Gil-dong.
Notable people from Gil-dong
Choi Ye-na (Hangul: 최예나), singer, rapper, dancer, entertainer and K-pop/J-pop idol, former member of K-pop/J-pop girlgroup Iz*One.

Perfecto "Perf" de Castro (born August 14, 1974) is a Filipino musician currently based in Los Angeles, California best known for having been a celebrated fixture in the Philippine alternative rock scene during the 1990s. During the course of that decade, he was one of the original members of the alternative rock band Rivermaya, founded the band Triaxis, and also collaborated with the seminal Filipino rapper Francis Magalona and Filipino hard rock band Wolfgang, all of which received critical and commercial acclaim. De Castro is also known for being adept at Classical and Flamenco music played on the Ten-string guitar
Life and career
De Castro started learning classical guitar at 13 but switched to electric guitar after less than a year, and spent the next decade learning, playing and teaching electric guitar. He was introduced to the ten-string classical guitar by musician Jose Valdez in 1998, and has since then concentrated on this instrument. He uses a unique tuning adapted from the Valdez tuning.
His most notable awards as a musician include the 1998 Katha Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance and Composition and the 1998 NU Rock Award for Guitarist of the Year. He is also widely recognized as an acclaimed album producer and sound engineer, with his works including the multi-platinum albums of Wolfgang (“Semenelin”), Francis M (FreeMan and FreeMan II), and Marc Velasco (eponymous). From these, he received numerous accolades, including the Producer of the Year Award in the 1998 NU 107 Rock Awards and the 2001 Awit Award for Best Rap Recording for a song done in collaboration with Magalona.
In 2004, de Castro relocated to Los Angeles, CA where he continues to record, perform and teach the guitar.
In 2006, de Castro produced a benefit album called "Leyte: The Benefit CD". It consists of compilation of songs from Filipino and Filipino-American artists aimed at helping the victims of the 2006 Southern Leyte mudslide and the proceeds went to relief organizations in the Philippines, such as the Philippine National Red Cross and the Department of Social Welfare and Development, to fund their relief efforts to the people affected by the Leyte mudslide disaster.
On January 9, 2016, de Castro re-united with his former Rivermaya co-members, Nathan Azarcon, Mark Escueta and Rico Blanco for a "secret mini semi-reunion", following his gig at 19 East, Taguig.
On September 7, 2018, de Castro performed in the launching of the Hollywood Wish Bus at Universal CityWalk with 90s OPM band Introvoys and Robin Nievera, the DJ for The Roadshow program of Wish 107.5.
In February 2021 he collaborated with Gloc 9 in his latest album on the song "Payong".

Vestknatten Nunatak () is an elongated nunatak in the center of Polarforschung Glacier, about 13 nautical miles (24 km) east-southeast of Mount Caroline Mikkelsen. It was first mapped from air photographs by the Lars Christensen Expedition, 1936–37, and named Vestknatten, meaning "the west crag." It was then visited by I.R. McLeod, a geologist with the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE) Prince Charles Mountains survey party in January 1969.

Cloelia () was a legendary woman from the early history of ancient Rome.
She was one of the women taken hostage by Lars Porsena, as a part of the peace treaty which ended the war between Rome and Clusium in 508 BC. There are two different stories explaining her escape and it is unclear which one is true as both are accepted by different scholars and historians. The first version of Cloelia's escape recognizes that the female hostages went to the river to bathe. Once having persuaded their guards to leave them alone at the river, in order to remain modest, they swam across the river into Roman territory. Once in Roman territory the female hostages were then safe from their captures. The second version of Cloelia's escapes claims that she escaped from the Etruscan camp, leading away a group of Roman virgins. According to Valerius Maximus, she fled upon a horse, and swam across the river Tiber through a barrage of hostile darts thus bringing her band of girls to safety.
When Porsena learnt of their escape, he quickly sent emissaries to Rome demanding her return. However, Porsena soon reconsidered deciding that her deeds were worthy of admiration, equal to that of Cocles and Mucius. He declared to the Romans that if she were restored to him he would send her back to Rome safe and inviolate, but if his demands were not met he should regard the treaty as broken.
The Romans agreed to the conditions and returned the pledge of peace, as the treaty required. Porsena praised Cloelia on her arrival and as a reward for her heroism, promised to release half the share of his hostages of her choice. It is said that she selected the young boys, as was unanimously decided by the hostages, since they were particularly in at the risk of abuse.
Once peace had been established The Romans celebrated her valour by building a statue of a maiden seated in a horse, set up on the summit of the Via Sacra.
Cultural depictions
Cloelia has been depicted in several paintings and in the libretto Il trionfo di Clelia (1762) by Pietro Metastasio.

Okay for Now is a children's novel by Gary D. Schmidt, published in 2011. It is a companion to Schmidt's 2007 novel The Wednesday Wars and features one of its supporting characters, Doug Swieteck.
Plot summary
Douglas "Doug" Swieteck is a fourteen-year-old boy living somewhere on Long Island in 1968 during the Vietnam War. After Doug's dad is fired for mouthing off to his boss, the Swietecks move to the small town of Marysville, NY, where Doug feels out of place and unwelcome.
In Marysville, Doug is fascinated by The Birds of America, a book illustrated by John James Audubon, on display under glass at the local library. Doug starts to learn how to draw, starting with a copy of Audubon's Arctic Tern under the tutelage of Mr. Powell, a librarian. Doug also meets a girl named Lillian "Lil" Spicer, on whom he eventually has a crush. Lil's father owns a deli, and hires Doug as a delivery boy, which lets him get to know other residents of Marysville. Around Christmas, Doug's oldest brother Lucas returns home from Vietnam with permanent injuries, and Doug helps him adjust. As the novel progresses, Doug faces issues such as his father's abuse, problems at school, and the illness of his friend, with maturity and confidence that he develops through learning to draw and his interactions with the townsfolk.
Chapters
Each chapter is named for a different plate from The Birds of America. In order, they are:
Development
Schmidt stated "I have always made fun of authors who say they had to write a sequel because there were characters they couldn't get out of their heads, but now I have to take back all those truly horrible things I said." The novel was initially drafted from a third-person perspective, and Schmidt struggled with telling the story, but after switching to a first-person narration, Schmidt wrote on "my third start on this stupid novel, it was Doug telling the story and it was right." Like Doug, Schmidt was underestimated by his teachers until one taught him to read.
Critical reception
Writing for The New York Times, author Richard Peck said the novel "is crowded with more incident and empowerment than any eighth-grade year or novel can quite contain" but praised its emotional weight. Augusta Scattergood, reviewing for the Christian Science Monitor, called the novel "often heartbreaking but always funny" and the audience "will also have discovered something important about the capacity for love and the power of resiliency" by the end of the novel.
Awards
Okay for Now was on The New York Times Best Seller list and an Amazon Book of the Year. The book also was a Children's Choice award winner. The novel was named a finalist for the National Book Award for Young People's Literature in October 2011.

"The Pink" or "The Carnation" is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm in Grimm's Fairy Tales as tale number 76.
It is Aarne-Thompson type 652, the boy whose wishes always come true.
Synopsis
A childless queen prayed for a child. An angel told her she would have a son with the power of wishing. She had such a son, and every day went with the child to a park where wild beasts were kept. There she washed herself in a stream. One day, a cook stole the child and stained the queen's clothing with hen's blood; then he accused the queen of having let the child be eaten. The queen was imprisoned in a tower to starve, but angels were sent to feed her.
The cook, afraid of being caught, had the prince wish for a castle and a little girl as a companion; they lived there, but the cook grew afraid that the boy would wish for his father and reveal his crime, and told the girl, who had grown to a maiden, that she must murder the boy while he slept and cut out his heart and tongue. The girl refused to murder someone so innocent, but the cook threatened to kill her the next day if she didn't obey. She killed a hind and cut out its heart and tongue; then she had the boy hide in the bed. The cook asked about the murder, and the boy got out of the bed and turned him into a poodle for his betrayal.
The boy wished to go home. The girl was frightened at the thought of the journey, so the boy turned her into a pink (or carnation) and went home, with the poodle running after and the pink in his pocket. He went to his mother, who at first took him for the angels who fed her; he assured her he would free her. Then he worked as a huntsman for his own father. He hunted so much game that the king insisted that the huntsman sit by him at the feast. During the feast the boy reveals he is the king's son and that the cook was behind the evil plan all along. He changed the cook back into his own shape, and the king had him executed; he changed the pink back into the maiden, and because she had brought him up so tenderly and refused to murder him, the king sanctioned their marriage.
The queen was freed, but refused to eat, because angels, having supported her, would now deliver her. She died three days later, and the king died of grief, but the prince married the maiden and they ruled the kingdom together.

German scholar indicated that an ancestor of the tale type is the Dutch poem Esmoreit. He also mentions the existence of tale type in Judeo-Arabic tradition.
Researcher Richard Dorson reported that the tale type can be found sporadically throughout 15 European countries, mainly in Finland. In addition, Canadian folklorist Carmen Roy stated that the type was "widespread" (tres répandu) across Germany, Scandinavia, Southeastern Europe, Turkey and in the "Indes".
This tale has also been given the alternate title "The Lost Son". In this version the angels are replaced by fairies.

Madison Miller (1811–1896) was a US soldier, military officer and railroad manager.
In the Mexican–American War, Miller held a captaincy within the 2nd Illinois Regiment of Volunteers and was wounded at the Battle of Buena Vista.
By the Civil War, Miller had already held posts as the mayor Carondelet, Missouri, president of the St. Louis and Iron Mountain Railroad, and Missouri State Legislator. Mayor Miller was a passenger on the Pacific Railroad excursion train that crashed through the temporary bridge over the Gasconade River on November 1, 1855. He was badly injured in the accident. He then organized the 1st Missouri Light Artillery and was made commanding captain of the unit. Miller soon distinguished himself in the Union defeat at the Battle of Wilson's Creek.
In February, 1862, Miller was given the command of the 18th Missouri Volunteer Infantry following the removal of W. James Morgan as colonel. In the Battle of Shiloh, Miller commanded the 2nd Brigade in Benjamin Prentiss' division and took part in the fighting in the Hornet's Nest. Despite his courage in battle, he was taken prisoner when the men of the Hornet's Nest defense were captured. He was exchanged and returned to briefly command a brigade in the XVI Corps during the Winter of 1863–64. He resigned in March 1864 but was appointed Brigadier General in the Missouri State Militia in September 1864. He commanded a militia brigade during Price's Raid. On March 13, 1865 he was given a brevet promotion to brigadier general of U.S. volunteers for his service at Shiloh.
Following the war, he managed portions of the Pacific Railroad, dabbled in St. Louis, Missouri area real estate and held the position of vice-president within the Society of the Army of the Tennessee in 1893. He is buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis.

Hisham ibn Isma'il al-Makhzumi () was an eighth century Umayyad Caliphate official, and the maternal grandfather of caliph Hisham ibn 'Abd al-Malik. He served as the governor of Medina from 701 to 706.
Family
Hisham was a member of the Banu Makhzum, a clan of the Arab tribe of Quraysh, being a great-grandson of al-Walid ibn al-Mughira. Hisham gained prominence when his daughter A'isha married the fifth Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (). In 691 he became a grandfather to the future caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (), who was reportedly named after him at A'isha's insistence. Hisham's sons Ibrahim and Muhammad, like their father under Abd al-Malik, served as governors of Medina for Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik. They fell out of favour during the reign of his successor al-Walid ibn Yazid () and were tortured to death by Yusuf ibn Umar al-Thaqafi in 743. A third son, Khalid, participated in the failed rebellion of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik's son Sulayman in 744 and was consequently executed by the caliph Marwan ibn Muhammad ().
Governor of Medina
Abd al-Malik appointed Hisham, his father-in-law, governor of Medina in 701. During his time in that position he dismissed Nawfal ibn Musahiq al-Amiri from the head of the judiciary and appointed Amr ibn Khalid al-Zuraqi in his stead, and led the people of the city in rendering the oath of allegiance to Abd al-Malik's sons al-Walid I () and Sulayman (). When the faqih Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab refused to give the oath, Hisham ordered him to be beaten and imprisoned, and subjected him to a mock execution by having him marched to a mountain pass where individuals would normally be killed and crucified. Hisham also led the annual Hajj pilgrimages to Mecca in 703 and 704, and possibly those of 702/3 and 705 as well.
Following the death of Abd al-Malik in 705, Hisham was initially confirmed as governor by his successor al-Walid I. The new caliph disliked Hisham, however, and in early 706 he dismissed him in favour of Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz. Al-Walid also instructed Umar to display Hisham in front of the people of Medina, as a form of humiliation for his conduct during his governorship, but Hisham was spared from further harm after both Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab and the Alid Ali ibn al-Husayn ordered their followers to refrain from acts of retaliation against him.

Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust is an action-adventure video game developed by Team17 and published by Codemasters for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It was released on March 27, 2009 in Europe. It is the 8th game in the series, and the first Leisure Suit Larry game to be released for seventh generation consoles. It was announced on January 17, 2008 in a press release. There was a Wii version in development to be released 2 months after the release of the HD version, but was cancelled due to negative reviews.
Gameplay
Box Office Bust has open-world sandbox gameplay such as exploration, platforming, racing, and puzzle-solving. As with other games in the series, it features humor, attractive women, and suggestive themes, although, unlike Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude, this game does not contain nudity and sexual content despite its appeal to adult audiences. This was a decision championed by Executive Producer John Melchior, who believed that nudity was just a "mask for poor gameplay" and had stated that they (Team17) created a game with "a good solid story, clever set ups, and great pay offs."
Plot
Box Office Bust features Larry Lovage, the main character of Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude, whose uncle Larry, the original Larry Laffer calls upon his assistance at his movie studio (Laffer Studios), doing odd jobs and trying to uncover a mole from a rival studio who is attempting to sabotage Laffer Studios.
The storyline was written by Allen Covert of Happy Madison Productions, and the voiceover cast includes Josh Keaton as Larry Lovage, Jeffrey Tambor as Larry Laffer, Jay Mohr, Patrick Warburton, Shannon Elizabeth and Carmen Electra. Artie Lange and Dave Attell were also featured as voice characters.
Development
The game was announced by Sierra Entertainment on January 17, 2008, for a release in the fall. A Mobile game was also in production from Vivendi Games Mobile.
On July 29, following Vivendi Games' merger with Activision to create Activision Blizzard, the company announced that they would only publish five Sierra titles, with Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust not being one of them, leaving the game in limbo. The game's publishing rights were bought by Codemasters in February 2009.
This is the second Larry game that was created entirely without any input from original Larry game designer and developer Al Lowe, though the character Big Al is a homage to Lowe.
Artie Lange, who voiced Big Al, said he was paid $30,000 for his 1.5-hour studio session. He has also stated that this installment has a higher budget than all the predecessors.
Reception
Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust was met with unfavorable reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Xbox 360 version 26.08% and 25/100, the PC version 20.22% and 20/100 and the PlayStation 3 version 16.00% and 17/100.
Chris Walters of GameSpot described the game as "Mindless, repetitive gameplay and a truly atrocious sense of humor help Leisure Suit Larry live up to its name—it's a total bust" while Charles Onyett expressed his opinion on his review of the game on IGN as "The lowest rating numbers here at IGN are reserved for games with nearly no redeeming qualities or interesting ideas, with next to nothing enjoyable to offer players, and which under no circumstances should be purchased by anyone. Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust is, without a doubt, one of those games."
GameTrailers gave the game a 2.3 out of 10, making it the lowest-rated game on the website; it also described the game as "A horrible joke in and of itself, if you buy Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust the joke will be on you. We can think of a good number of other uses for your two hands; and we're using ours to give this stinker two thumbs way down."
Official Xbox Magazine (UK) gave the game a 1 out of 10, calling it an "astroturd" of a game. They also stated it was their worst-rated game of the year so far, as well as going as far as to say that it was the worst game on the Xbox 360 console thus far.
Al Lowe thanked Vivendi Games on his website for keeping him away from what he called "the latest disaster".
In PlayStation: The Official Magazine's September 2009 issue, they joked about punishing a PlayStation 3 owner's dog by making it play the Leisure Suit Larry game. The dog had urinated on his owner's PlayStation 3, which surprisingly still works.
GameSpot nominated the game for "Flat Out The Worst Game of the Year" in 2009. It "lost" to Stalin vs. Martians.
Giant Bomb gave the game the Worst Game of the Year Award in 2009. Australian television show Good Game "honored" it as the Worst Game of 2009.
Screwattack.com gave the game a SAGY award for the Worst Multiconsole game of 2009. Similarly, GamesRadar gave Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust the title of the 28th worst game of all time.

Henry Stewart Caulfield (December 9, 1873 – May 11, 1966) was an American lawyer and Republican politician from St. Louis, Missouri. He represented Missouri in the U.S. House from 1907 to 1909 and was the 37th Governor of Missouri from 1929 to 1933.
Biography
Caulfield was born in St. Louis, Missouri on December 9, 1873. He attended the public schools of St. Louis public schools and St. Charles College of Missouri. In 1895 Caulfield graduated from Washington University School of Law in St. Louis. He was admitted to the bar later that year and practiced in St. Louis.
Caulfield was an unsuccessful candidate for the United States House of Representatives in 1904. In 1906 he was the successful Republican nominee for a seat in the House. He served in the 60th Congress (March 4, 1907 – March 3, 1909), and was not a candidate for renomination in 1908.
After Caulfield left Congress, Governor Herbert S. Hadley appointed him state excise commissioner in St. Louis, and Caulfield served from 1909 to 1910. From 1910 to 1912 Caulfield served as Judge of the Missouri Court of Appeals for the Eastern District, based in St. Louis. In 1914 Caulfield served as Counsel for the St. Louis City and County Board of Freeholders. In 1921 and 1922 Caulfield was St. Louis City Counselor. In 1925 and 1926 he was chairman of the Board of Freeholders.
In 1928 Caulfield ran successfully for Governor of Missouri, and he served from January 14, 1929 to January 9, 1933. During his term Caulfield founded the Missouri State Highway Patrol, and worked to cope with strains on the state budget caused by the Great Depression. Near the end of his term in 1933 state legislature, which was controlled by Republicans, attempted to gerrymander Congressional districts in order elect more Republicans. Caulfield vetoed the bill, which forced Missouri's U.S. House members to run at-large, resulting in Democratic candidates winning every seat.
Caulfield was the keynote speaker at the 1932 Republican National Convention. In 1937 and 1938 he served on the St. Louis Board of Election Commissioners. He was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for United States Senator in 1938, losing to incumbent Democrat Bennett Champ Clark. From 1941 to 1949 he served as director of public welfare in St. Louis. He then resumed the practice of law, and in 1953 served as a member of the State Reorganization Commission, which proposed reforms to state government.
Death and burial
Caulfield died in St. Louis on May 11, 1966. He was interred at Oak Grove Cemetery in St. Louis.
Family
His brother William E. Caulfield (1871-1946) was also involved in politics, and served on the St. Louis City Council, in the Missouri House of Representatives, and in the Missouri State Senate.
Caulfield was married twice. In 1897 he married Adele Lopez, who died in 1898. In 1902 he married Fannie Alice Delano, and they were the parents of four children.

Kosmos-2251 ( meaning Cosmos 2251), was a Russian Strela-2M military communications satellite. It was launched into Low Earth orbit from Site 132/1 at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome at 04:17 UTC on 16 June 1993, by a Kosmos-3M carrier rocket.· The Strela satellites had a lifespan of 5 years, and the Russian government reported that Kosmos-2251 ceased functioning in 1995. Russia was later criticised by The Space Review for leaving a defunct satellite in a congested orbit, rather than deorbiting it. In response, Russia noted that they were (and are) not required to do so under international law. In any case, the KAUR-1 satellites had no propulsion system, which is usually required for deorbiting.
Destruction
At 16:56 UTC on 10 February 2009, it collided with Iridium 33 (1997-051C), an Iridium satellite, in the first major collision of two satellites in Earth orbit. The Iridium satellite, which was operational at the time of the collision, was destroyed, as was Kosmos-2251. NASA reported that a large amount of debris was produced by the collision.

Having been detained and threatened by Special Anti-Robbery Squad officers for "perceived homosexuality", Blaise became active in the October 2020 End SARS protests, where they were verbally assaulted for carrying a sign with the words "Queer Lives Matter". They additionally organized a group of other queer people to attend the protests.
After the 2020 Lekki shooting, Blaise started working with Safe HQuse to support queer protestors and survivors.
Personal life
Blaise is non-binary, and uses they/them pronouns. they were attending Alex Ekwueme Federal University Ndufu Alike Ikwo in Nigeria, seeking a Bachelor of Arts in English and Literary Studies.
Blaise became more outspoken about their sexuality on social media after they were punched and choked by a priest for being gay in 2019, and other people in the church did not intervene.
Recognition
Blaise was a Woman Deliver youth leader in 2020; they were 22 years old at the time. Also in 2020, they were a winner of The Future Awards Africa "Prize for Leading Conversations", and The Initiative for Equal Rights' award for "SOGIESC Rights Activist of the Year".

Stephen Bruce Harris (4 January 1887 – 4 October 1960) was an English sports journalist, prominent from the 1930s to the 1950s, who wrote mostly on tennis and cricket.
Life and career
Bruce Harris was born in Londonderry and trained as a journalist in England in Middlesbrough and Birmingham. He joined the Evening Standard in London in 1920 and turned his attention to sport. At first he specialised in tennis, but in 1932 the Evening Standard chose him ahead of his younger colleague E. W. Swanton, a cricket expert, to cover the forthcoming English cricket tour of Australia. He was the first journalist ever to have been sent on an overseas cricket tour by an individual newspaper.
On the voyage to Australia, Douglas Jardine, England's captain on the 1932-33 tour, was planning his bodyline tactics, which he knew would be controversial. Harris was learning how to be a cricket writer. They soon won each other's confidence. Harris supported Jardine's tactics throughout the tour, and when the tour finished he wrote his first book, Jardine Justified, for which Jardine wrote a grateful foreword. Arthur Mailey, the former Australian Test player, while deploring the closeness between Jardine and Harris, thought Jardine Justified full of "interesting and well-written passages" and better than most tour books. The reviewer for the Brisbane Telegraph noted that apart from the behaviour of the cricket crowds Harris evidently enjoyed Australia and wrote about it enthusiastically. The reviewer for The Age noted that the book included "several entertaining chapters relating to matters other than cricket".
This "other-than-cricket" journalism became a feature of Harris's tour books. Of his book on the 1936-37 tour of Australia and New Zealand, the New Zealand Herald'''s reviewer wrote that between accounts of the matches Harris records "his journalist's impressions of Australia and its institutions. Gambling, life-saving on the beaches, hotel-closing, and immigration are discussed. Many a good story enlivens his pages." The Sydney Morning Herald reviewer of Harris's book on the 1946-47 tour praised his ability to rise above the partisanship that often mars cricket journalism, and said, "he is an agreeable companion in these pages, in which he shows that he has an eager capacity for observing the life and people around him as he passed [sic] from place to place". The Sydney Daily Telegraph reviewer of the same book devoted most of his review to an appreciation of Harris's chapter on Australia's liquor licensing laws.
Harris was the first journalist to accompany five touring English cricket teams to Australia, beginning with the 1932-33 tour and ending with the 1954-55 tour. He wrote a book about each Australian tour, as well as several about Test series in England in the 1950s.
Harris was the secretary of the Cricket Writers' Club soon after its founding in 1947 and later served as the club's chairman. He died at his home in Ealing after a long illness, aged 73.

John Steinhoff (15 September 1942 ) is a classical physicist, best known for his important contributions to computational fluid dynamics field. He invented a physics based method called vorticity confinement to compute the numerical solution of partial differential equations.
Biography
Steinhoff studied at University of Chicago where he was awarded a M.S. degree in physics. Later, in 1972, University of Chicago awarded him with a Ph.D. degree. He later held a faculty position in the department of aerospace engineering, University of Tennessee Space Institute from 1981 to 2011.
Most of his research has been involved the treatment of vortex-dominated flows in computational fluid dynamics and the treatment of short wave equation pulses, including the solution of real problems of engineering importance. The recent development of the vorticity confinement method that eliminates effects of numerical diffusion, for computations on Eulerian grids, without the use of Lagrangian markers. This technique has recently been used in many applications involving computation of: Helicopter Blade—Vortex Interaction, Delta Wing Flow, Helicopter Rotor/Body Flow, Helicopter Body—Vortex Interaction, Dynamic Stall, Aircraft Trailing Vortices, Supersonic Flow Over Missiles. Steinhoff also developed another computational technique, wave confinement, for propagating short wave equation pulses over long distances without the use of Lagrangian markers, which require the use of complex logic and are not feasible for intersecting pulses. This has major applications in communications, radar wave scattering, etc. His methods have also been used in creating special effects for movies such as Harry Potter and The Core.
He also authored many scholarly articles and chapters on Vorticity Confinement. He was awarded the Arnold Research award for his major accomplishments in CFD field.

Maurice Samuel (February 8, 1895 – May 4, 1972) was a Romanian-born British and American novelist, translator and lecturer of Jewish heritage.
Biography
Born in Măcin, Tulcea County, Romania, to Isaac Samuel and Fanny Acker, Samuel moved to Paris with his family at the age of five and about a year later to England, where he studied at the Victoria University. His parents spoke Yiddish at home and he developed strong attachments to the Jewish people and the Yiddish language at early age. This later became the motivation for many of the books he wrote as an adult. Eventually, Samuel left England and emigrated to the United States, settling in New York City's Lower East Side. He served in the United States Army during World War I.
A Jewish intellectual and writer, Samuel is best known for his book You Gentiles, published in 1924. Most of his work concerns itself with Judaism or the Jew's role in history and modern society, but he also wrote more conventional fiction, such as The Web of Lucifer, which takes place during the Borgias' rule of Renaissance Italy, and the fantasy science-fiction novel The Devil that Failed. Samuel also wrote the nonfiction King Mob under the pseudonym "Frank K. Notch". He and his work received acclaim within the Jewish community during his lifetime, including the 1944 Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for his non-fiction work, The World of Sholom Aleichem. He received the Itzik Manger Prize for Yiddish literature posthumously in 1972.
Samuel died in New York City in 1972 at the age of 77.

The bluish-fronted jacamar (Galbula cyanescens) is a species of bird in the family Galbulidae. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru.
Taxonomy and systematics
The bluish-fronted jacamar is monotypic. It and the rufous-tailed (Galbula ruficauda), white-chinned (G. tombacea), coppery-chested (G. pastazae), and green-tailed jacamars (G. glabula) are considered to form a superspecies.
Description
The bluish-fronted jacamar is long and weighs . The male's crown, including the forehead ("front") is metallic green to bluish and the upper parts are metallic green with a bluish gloss. The chin and upper throat are blackish, the lower throat and chest green, and the rest of the underparts rufous. The female differs only in that the lower breast and belly are ochraceous.
Distribution and habitat
The bluish-fronted jacamar is found east of the Andes and south of the Amazon River, in eastern Peru, in western Brazil as far east as the Madeira River, and south into Bolivia's La Paz Department. It inhabits humid primary forest, gallery forest, and secondary forest up to elevation. It is typically found in mid-stage succession vegetation along the forest edges and especially along watercourses and lakesides.
Behavior
Feeding
The bluish-fronted jacamar's diet has not been described in detail but is believed to be many kinds of flying insects. It perches on exposed branches or in scrub and sallies from there to capture its prey. It sometimes joins mixed-species foraging flocks.
Breeding
The bluish-fronted jacamar's breeding phenology has not been documented.
Vocalization
The bluish-fronted jacamar's song is rendered as "kip kip-kip-kipkikikrkrkrrr-kree-kree-kree-kip-kip-kikikrrrrreeuw" .
Status
The IUCN has assessed the bluish-fronted jacamar as being of The Least Concern. It appears to be common throughout its range and occurs in several protected areas.

Coffee production in Nicaragua has been an important part of its history and economy. It is one of the country's principal products. The areas most suitable for the cultivation of coffee have been Managua Department, Diriamba, San Marcos, Jinotepe, as well as the vicinity of Granada Department, Lake Nicaragua, Chontales Department, and in Nueva Segovia; historically, the best coffee is produced in Matagalpa and in Jinotega. Most of the coffee was grown in Managua Department, but Matagalpa Department produced the best bean quality. The most convenient altitude to grow coffee is 800 meters above the sea level.
History
Large-scale coffee growing began in Nicaragua in the 1850s, and by 1870 coffee was the principal export crop, a position it held for the next century. Coffee is a demanding crop, however, because coffee trees require several years to produce a harvest, and the entire production process requires a greater commitment of capital, labor, and land than do many other crops. Coffee also grows only in the rich volcanic soil found on mountainous terrain, making transportation of the crop to the market difficult.
The crop of 1891 amounted to more than ; of land were used, corresponding to a yield of . The principal means of transporting coffee for exportation were the National Railroad from Granada to Corinto, on the Pacific, and the steamships from Lake Nicaragua and the San Juan River to the Atlantic Ocean. The Government of Nicaragua encouraged the establishment of coffee plantations, and decreed to award a prize of 5 cents for each tree in plantations of more than 5,000 trees. The majority of the Nicaraguan coffee was exported to Europe, because the freight to the United States was more expensive, and because in Europe it sold at a higher price. The United States consul stated that the coffee crop of Nicaragua amounted in 1900 to 150,000 bags, versus 75,000 in the preceding year; the coffee export duties amounted to approximately $300,000. The exportation of coffee in 1900 through the ports of El Castillo, Bluefields, and San Juan del Norte was 1,464,351 kilograms, the value of which amounted to $295,348.
In 1992 more land was planted in coffee than in any other crop. The actual amount of land devoted to coffee varies somewhat from year to year, but averaged in the 1980s. Production is centered in the northern part of the central highlands north and east of Estelí, and also in the hilly volcanic region around Jinotepe. Although production of coffee dropped somewhat in the late 1980s, the 1989 crop was still . Nicaragua's poor transportation system and ecological concerns over the amount of land devoted to growing crops on volcanic slopes in the Pacific region limit further expansion of coffee cultivation. These limitations have led growers to explore planting other crops in undeveloped areas of the country.
In 2019 researchers from CIRAD, using test plots in Nicaragua developed a new F1 hybrid coffee tree named Starmaya that is designed to be propagated by seed in seed gardens. Starmaya has rust resistance, very good cup quality potential at high altitudes, and high yield potential.

Atelopus pastuso is a species of frog in the family Bufonidae. It has not been seen since 1993, and is possibly extinct.
Taxonomy
Atelopus pastuso was described in 2010. The specific name pastuso is from a Spanish word for inhabitants of the Pasto region of southern Colombia and northern Ecuador.
Description
Atelopus pastuso is a medium-sized member of its genus, with males being an average of 31.82mm long and females being larger at an average of 38.68mm long. Males and females also differ in that females have long, slender limbs, while males have much shorter and stouter ones. The color of their dorsal side ranges from a bright green, to a grayish color, to nearly black.
Habitat and Distribution
The range of Atelopus pastuso extends from Nariño Department in southern Colombia and Imbabura Province in northern Ecuador. They inhabit the páramo, and are terrestrial.
Diet
Atelopus pastuso eats both vegetation and insects.
History
Atelopus pastuso was once a common species in its locality, but it experienced a dramatic dramatic decline in the past several decades. The last individuals in Colombia were seen on November 16th, 1982. The last living individuals in Ecuador were seen on June 29th, 1993. Extensive searches since then have failed to turn up any individuals. In 2010, Atelopus pastuso was classed as a new species, and was declared Critically Endangered and possibly extinct by the IUCN.
Disease may have played a role in the species' decline. In Ecuador, several unhealthy and deceased individuals were seen before the disappearance of Atelopus pastuso. In 2001, three specimens were examined, and all tested positive for chytridiomycosis. It's believed that climate change and habitat loss could have also led to Atelopus pastuso's decline.

Parvati Valley is situated in the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. From the confluence of the Parvati River with the River Beas, the Parvati Valley runs eastwards, through a steep-sided valley from the town of Bhuntar, in the Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh in Northern India.
Overview
The precipitous valley road climbs past a side valley leading to the village of Malana near the famous tourist spot Kasol. From here, the road passes through the Sikh and Hindu pilgrimage town of Manikaran and terminates at Pulga, where the construction of the Parvati Hydel Project, a hydroelectric dam, dominates the landscape. From Pulga, the footpath climbs to a temple and small dhaba at Rudra-Nag waterfall, apparently after its resemblance of a water snake. Beyond Rudra-Nag waterfall, the trail ascends further through thick pine forests to the spiritual site of Kheerganga where Shiva is said to have meditated for 3000 years. The hot springs at Kheerganga are extremely important for Hindu and Sikh pilgrims as well as many others who believe the waters have sacred healing properties.
From Kheerganga to the site of Tunda Bhuj village (3285m) the Parvati Valley cuts a steep-sided gorge through the mountains and as the altitude increases, the thick, coniferous forest gradually makes way for patches of meadowland scattered with boulders.
Several tributaries join the main Parvati River and numerous waterfalls cascade down the steep valley sides. Beyond Tunda Bhuj, the conifers continue only as far as the Basuki Nal tributary but groves of silver birch continue to line the valley, quickly becoming sparse as the altitude increases.
At Thakur Kuan village (3560m), the Parvati Valley meets the valley of Dibibokri Nal river which is a tributary of Parvati River, which climbs towards the Northeast to the Dibibokri Glacier and Dibibokri Pyramid mountain peak (6400m). The area is characterised by abundant alpine flowers and rocky outcrops glittering with mica. Beyond Thakur Kuan village, the Parvati Valley ascends gradually to Pandupul village (Pandu Pul) where two natural, rock bridges cross the Parvati River and a southern tributary. According to legend, these bridges were created by the massive strength of the Pandava brothers.
From Pandupul, the wide valley of the upper Parvati valley climbs gradually through the wide, high-altitude meadowland of Odi Thatch to the sacred site of Mantalai Lake (4100m), the source of the Parvati River. Continuing east from Mantalai lake, it is possible to cross the Pin Parvati Pass (5319m) into the Pin Valley National Park and on to the Mudh village in the Lahul and Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh.
Parvati Valley's scenic trekking routes are a popular destination for trekkers and tourists.

Nicolas Noël (1712-1781) was a Benedictine monk, instrument and telescope maker at the workshop of l'abbaye de Saint-Germain des Prés. He became custodian of Louis XV's telescopes in 1759, having presented an eight foot (focal length) telescope to the king, under the sponsorship of the duc de Chaulnes, on December 14, 1756. Between 1759 and 1774 Dom Noël assembled a collection of his own instruments and those acquired from others in buildings erected for the purpose adjacent to the Château de la Muette. Noêl's position was later held by Abbé Rochon. In 1772 Noël made a 22-inch diameter 24-foot focus Gregorian, which at the time was the largest telescope in the world. The speculum mirror was re-polished by Carochez in 1787. It was installed in Paris at the Hôtel de la Muette (also known as the Cabinet de Passy). The "Grand Telescope of Passy" was too large and cumbersome to serve as an effective scientific instrument, and after being re-mirrored in 1800 was dismantled in 1841.

The brigantine Yankee was a steel hulled schooner, originally constructed by Nordseewerke, Emden, Germany as the Emden, renamed Duhnen, 1919. As Yankee, it became famous as the ship that was used by Irving Johnson and Exy Johnson to circumnavigate the globe four times in eleven years. She appeared on the cover of National Geographic in December 1959.
Duhnen
The Duhnen, built in 1911, was the last schooner the Germans built before the construction of steam powered ships. It was used first as a North Sea pilot vessel, taking pilots out to ships heading for Hamburg on the Elbe River (and back from those departing), and then for recreation during World War II by the Luftwaffe, and was captured by the British and used as an RAF recreation ship. The Duhnen was refitted and renamed Yankee at the Brixham yards. The new Yankee was overall, with a waterline of , a maximum draft of . The rig was changed to that of a brigantine with of canvas.
Johnsons
The brigantine Yankee was the second Yankee purchased by Irving Johnson and his wife, Exy (Electa). They bought it in 1946 with the help of a friend, film star Sterling Hayden. With the Johnsons, Yankee sailed the Caribbean and made four global circumnavigations with amateur crews on a share-expense basis. Each of these voyages was from Gloucester, Massachusetts, westward around the world via the Panama Canal and around the Cape of Good Hope and back to Gloucester, and took exactly 18 months.
The Johnsons had sailed their schooner Yankee around the world three times before World War II, so that their first trip in the brigantine was known as their Fourth World Cruise. It departed Gloucester on 2 November 1947 and returned on 1 May 1949, stopping at over one hundred mostly remote ports and islands, but also in Honolulu, Singapore, and Cape Town for the receipt of large shipments of canned food from S. S. Pierce in Boston. This voyage was described in the Johnsons' book Yankee's Wander-World.
These cruises were made on a three-year cycle, so that between each two, Yankee was on the northeast coast of America for two summers and one winter. During these winters, Capt. Johnson gave lectures on these voyages all over the country. In the summers, the Brigantine was under charter to the Girl Scout Mariners of America, taking groups of 16 scouts and four leaders on coastal voyages between Larchmont, NY, in Long Island Sound, and the Saint John River in New Brunswick, Canada.
The Johnsons' final voyage in the Yankee, made in 1956–58, was featured in the 1966 CBS/National Geographic television special, Voyage of the Brigantine Yankee. It was scored by Elmer Bernstein and narrated by Orson Welles.
The Johnsons sold the Yankee to Reed Whitney in 1958. He operated it during the summers of 1958 and 1959 in New England waters.
Sometime after that it was sold to Mike Burke of Miami Beach. Burke used the Yankee and the schooner Polynesia, on 10- to 14-day Windjammer Cruises in the Bahamas, hiring on amateur sailors.
The last voyage of the Brigantine Yankee
The Brigantine Yankee lifted anchor in Nassau with complement of 26 passengers and crew on the evening of February 10, 1964 and set sail on what was to be a fourteen-month Windjammer Cruises, Inc., 'Around the World Cruise'. After stopping at San Salvador and Jamaica, and passing through the Panama Canal, the Yankee proceeded to the Galapagos Islands. On April 8, during a stop at Floreana Island, one of the passengers (Sara "Saydee" Reiser) of the Yankee disappeared. Search parties combed the island for several days to no avail and the Ecuadoran navy was eventually called out to investigate. Her remains were not discovered until 1980. The Brigantine Yankee was held at Isla Santa Maria and her crew escorted to Guayaquil, Ecuador to be held until a formal inquest was completed. That same week, Time magazine published an article about the Yankee and her troubles, including the loss of a passenger. Captain Derek Lumbers and crew were eventually returned to the Yankee and they quickly set sail for French Polynesia on May 8, after failing to pay a $400 levy placed on the ship by the local police. After sailing thirty-two days to the Marquesas and spending two days in port, the Yankee sailed another eight days to reach Papeete, Tahiti on June 19. On July 8, the Yankee set sail for Bora Bora before arriving at Rarotonga, Cook Islands in the early afternoon of July 16.
Sometime between the evening of July 23 and the morning of July 24, during very high winds and rough surf, one of the Yankee anchor chains broke and the brigantine was washed aground on the reef at Avarua. The ship was ultimately abandoned on the reef. A court of inquiry regarding the fate of the Yankee was held the following day, with acknowledgments by several passengers that the entire cruise had been under-funded and the ship poorly-maintained. The hull of the wreck of the Yankee could easily be seen from shore for decades after the event.
By 1995, the remains of the hull had been pushed onto the beach by successive storms and was cut up and moved to the island's dump, although pieces of hardware could still be found in the sand on the beach.

Ibon Koteron (born in Bilbao in 1967) is a Basque musician renowned as a player of the alboka. His 1996 debut release was a joint record with Kepa Junkera, entitled Leonen Orroak (the roarings of Leon, a homage to the great albokalari Leon Bilbao).
He was educated in a Jesuit school in Bilbao where he was known for his expertise playing chess and his anarchist tendencies. He graduated in Basque philology in the University of Deusto, but he is now teaching Philosophy in IES Ategorri, Erandio.
His career as musician started after he studied alboka and dultzaina in 1987-88 and became a teacher of these instruments himself. In the early 1990s, forming a duo with his brother, he started playing, often for free, as an accompanist to numerous popular acts, notably in support of the Conscientious Objection Movement, which was then waging a popular disobedience campaign against conscription and the army itself.
He has published many articles on the alboka and is developing a multimedia method to learn to play this unique instrument.
In 2004 he released a second record entitled Airea (the air), produced by Kepa Junkera.
He has also collaborated with other musicians, including Gilles Chavenat, Soledonna and Faltriqueira, Heikki Syrjänen, Andrea Pisu and Roston Kuchichian.
He leads a band that includes the following musicians:

The East Side Hebrew Institute was a traditional Jewish day school, in the East Village/Alphabet City area of Manhattan, New York City. It was "once one of the major institutions of the Jewish East Side".
History
The East Side Hebrew Institute (or as it was called: ESHI) was founded in 1910 by a group of immigrants from the town of Zhitomir in Russia (present day Ukraine). David R. Zaslowsky was its first principal and founder. The school spent the bulk of its years, 1928–1974, in a large red brick building at the corner of 8th Street and Avenue B (295 East 8th Street).
At first, ESHI was a Talmud Torah. Children attended the school at the close of public school and on Sunday mornings. They received two hours of instruction each session. On Saturday the children conducted their own service in the building's synagogue.
In 1948, after Rabbi Max D. Raiskin's appointment as Principal, a nursery-kindergarten was opened to serve the Peter Cooper Village—Stuyvesant Town area. Soon after that, a Day School was established which grew grade by grade through High School. In 1975 the first High School Graduation was held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.
One of the major reasons for establishing the Day School was the need for a quality Jewish day school in lower Manhattan serving the general Jewish public, not only the religious population.
Alphabet City had been in rapid transition. The Jewish population moved out of the crowded tenements for new middle-class neighborhoods. The numbers that remained behind dwindled rapidly, and the student body of the Talmud Torah diminished. The Day School, however, was meeting a radically different need; it grew and grew. Parents would not send their children into the increasingly dangerous East Side for an hour and a half of Jewish after-school instruction, which could have frequently been conducted closer to the student's home. But a quality Day School education, valuing Judaism and academic excellence, and offered at a rate lower-middle income people could afford, was something worth traveling to obtain. There was, however, a limit to parental interest in searching out the special values offered by the ESHI Day School. If the area around the school became so blighted that parents feared to send their children, the school would cease to be effective. It became increasingly clear that a move would be necessary.
For years, taking note of the increasing pressures, the school's leadership and friends searched for an alternative that would keep the tuition levels of the school within reason. The location had to be physically close to the existing parent body in order to allow for continuity. In July, 1975, the move was made to 61 Irving Place, in Manhattan.
In the early 1980s, the East Side Hebrew Institute merged with the Park East Synagogue, the latter having only a pre-school until the merger. The new merged school was named "Park East ESHI". Several years later, the name “ESHI” was removed by the new school board, which gave it the old-new name, “Park East” (the Park East Day School). The old school had still been alive through the veins of these remaining students, but under a new name; and in a way, ESHI continues to exist through the Park East Day School and its students today as well.

There is a lively ESHI Alumni Group on Facebook with nearly 200 ESHI alumni posting stories, photographs and opportunities to reconnect.
Extracurricular activities
There were class newspapers, while the upper classes were also instructed to read and use The New York Times as a basis. Science fairs were held several times a year. Every class had to present some science experiment and the best one would be chosen as the winner. On Lag Ba'omer, the school used to go to Randalls Island for a picnic, or to the Palisades Park. The school also held the first program in the U.S. for preparing mentally challenged and blind children for their Bar Mitzvah, initiated and directed by Rabbi Raiskin. ESHI also had its own youth movement named “Shimshon" and "Shimshona”, for the boys and girls, respectively, which was founded by Mordecai Wucher of Bridgeport Connecticut.

The Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy (Eisenhower School), formerly known as the Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF), is a part of the National Defense University. It was renamed on September 6, 2012, in honor of Dwight D. Eisenhower who graduated from this school when it was previously known as the Army Industrial College.
The Eisenhower School is a United States military educational institution tasked with preparing selected military officers and civilians for senior national security leadership positions dealing with the resource component of national power. The college conducts postgraduate, executive-level courses of study, and associated research, awarding a Master of Science degree in national resource strategy to its graduates. Special emphasis is placed on material acquisition, joint logistics, and their integration into national security strategy.
History
The United States suffered severe mobilization difficulties during World War I. To minimize a recurrence, the Army Industrial College was established in 1924 to focus on wartime procurement and mobilization procedures. Bernard M. Baruch, a prominent Wall Street speculator and Chairman of the War Industries Board, is regarded as one of the founding fathers.
The first class at the Army Industrial College had only nine students, but by the early 1930s, the college was graduating 40 to 50 students in each class. During the first three years, the college provided a five-month course of study. In 1927, the program was expanded to ten-months with one graduating class each year. Major Dwight D. Eisenhower graduated from the college in 1933 and later served on the faculty. In 1940, the colleges expanded to two classes and then graduated four classes in 1941. The college was closed in December 1941 after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor to make officers available to support the World War II. By that time approximately 1,000 officers had been trained at the college.
The college re-opened in December 1943. Before war's end senior Army officers, including General Eisenhower (who was then the Allied Supreme Commander of the European Theatre), supported the concept of a joint war college to study mobilization planning and military logistics. From 1944 to 1946, Donald Armstrong was commandant of the Army Industrial College. In 1946, the school's name was changed to the Industrial College of the Armed Forces. ICAF moved to Fort McNair, near the newly founded National War College. The Industrial College offered a ten-month academic program for selected high potential officers. In 1948, Secretary of Defense James V. Forrestal removed the college from the Army's jurisdiction and reconstituted it "as a joint educational institution under the direction of the Joint Chiefs of Staff."
ICAF moved into a newly constructed facility, Eisenhower Hall, in 1960. During the next several years, the character of ICAF changed dramatically. As the United States found itself increasingly involved in the Vietnam War, ICAF shifted from focusing on national industrial mobilization to educating leaders to manage logistical resources in such conflicts. Student demographics changed, with the first woman and African American students graduated in 1973.
In 1976, ICAF became part of the newly established National Defense University. The Goldwater-Nichols Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 called for substantially increased attention to joint military education. In response, the college expanded its curriculum, adding a joint operations module and a mandatory acquisition course. In 1991, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff gave ICAF responsibility for conducting a senior acquisition program military and civilian personnel from all the Services and Department of Defense agencies. The new senior acquisition program was offered in conjunction with the Defense Acquisition University.
In 1993, Congress passed legislation authorizing the Industrial College to award master's degree in national resource strategy. The graduating of the class of 1994 was the first to be awarded a master's degree.
In 2012, the college was renamed The Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy. It is now commonly known as The Eisenhower School. Today, the official mission of the college is to: "Prepare selected military officers and civilians for strategic leadership and success in developing our national security strategy and in evaluating, marshalling, and managing resources in the execution of that strategy."
Faculty
The faculty is composed of civilian academics and highly qualified military officers from all the military Services. The military faculty members are normally Army and Air Force colonels along with Navy captains. Both the civilian and military faculty members are experts in the specific fields they teach. Civilian faculty members normally hold doctorate degrees (or equivalent professional degrees). The faculty includes representatives from the United States Department of State and other federal agencies. The faculty are grouped into four academic departments.
The college's academic departments are:
Defense Strategy and Resourcing
National Security and Economic Policy
National Security and Industrial Base
Strategic Leadership
Students
The Eisenhower School educates 330 students on campus each academic year. The joint, interagency and international student body is composed of:
Senior military officers from all services – 56 percent
Departments of Defense and State and 10 other federal agencies – 34 percent
International military officers – 8 percent
Private sector – 2 percent
Students generally have approximately 20 years of experience in the military or civilian agencies and have proven themselves as very high-level performers at the operational level. In addition, The Eisenhower School has a number of International Fellows, and it is the only Senior Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) school with Industry Fellows (private sector).
Curriculum
The college's curriculum focuses on the resource components of national security. Its academic program includes courses in national security studies, defense strategy, joint operations, leadership and communications, economics, military acquisition, and industry studies. The college's core curriculum is supplemented by elective courses, focuses research opportunities, and an industry studies program. The college is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.
The curriculum includes an industry studies program that looks at the economic health of selected industrial sectors, both within the United States and globally. Students study and analyze how specific industries can be used to support national security during peacetime and war. The program includes field research. This is conducted during field trips to industry center across the United States and internationally. During these visits faculty and students meet with government officials, corporate executives, and labor leaders. Each industry seminar prepares a comprehensive report on its focus area. The reports are published at the end of the academic year.
The senior acquisition program is the capstone course for procurement professionals within the Department of Defense. This course of study prepares selected military officers and civilians for senior level positions in the department's acquisition organizations. The program consists of the college's normal ten-month curriculum plus two in-depth elective courses that address acquisition policy and issues. Students completing the program receive a diploma from Defense Acquisition University along with their master's degree.

Fitz Eugene Dixon Jr. (August 14, 1923 – August 2, 2006) was an American educator, sportsman, and philanthropist.
Early life
He was the son of banker Fitz Eugene Dixon Sr. and Eleanor Widener (1891-1966), a member of the wealthy Widener family from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Dixons built "Ronaele Manor" ("Eleanor" spelled backward), an Elizabethan mansion, in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, where Fitz Jr. grew up.
Fitz Jr. graduated from Philadelphia's Episcopal Academy, then Harvard University, after which he returned to Episcopal to teach English, French, and Health; he also coached the school's squash, tennis, and 120-pound football teams and served as director of athletics and assistant to the headmaster.
Career
In 1971, on the death of his mother's childless surviving brother George Dunton Widener Jr., Fitz Jr. inherited his uncle's entire estate, including the Erdenheim Farm in Whitemarsh Township, Pennsylvania, and took over the running of the Widener Foundation. The Widener fortune, amassed in the meat-packing and streetcar businesses, saw Fitz Eugene Dixon Jr. listed in Forbes Magazine's 400 Richest Americans in 1985, 1991, and 1995.
Dixon bred thoroughbred racehorses at Erdenheim Farm, and was a member and one-time Chairman of the Pennsylvania Horse Racing Commission. Dixon was also a patron of equestrian show jumping, having owned such horses as Jet Run and Rhum IV, who competed and medaled in domestic, Pan American, World Cup, and Olympic events.
Professional sports
Dixon became an owner of and investor in Philadelphia professional sports franchises, including the Eagles, the Phillies, the Flyers, and the Wings, but his most notable sports investment was the Philadelphia 76ers. He served as vice chairman for the Flyers when they won the Stanley Cup in 1974 and 1975. He purchased the Philadelphia 76ers from Irv Kosloff for $8 million on May 28, 1976, and a few months later brought Julius "Dr. J." Erving to the team for $6.6 million. In his brief stint as owner, the team made it to the NBA finals twice but never won a championship. He sold the team to Harold Katz in 1981.
Philanthropy
One of his best-known civic accomplishments was the 1976 purchase of the iconic Love sculpture that now stands at the head of John F. Kennedy Plaza in Center City Philadelphia. Dixon purchased the statue from the Robert Indiana studio after the artist had removed it from the city when it failed to come up with the $45,000 he had sought for its purchase. Dixon bought the sculpture for $35,000 and donated it to the city. The plaza has since come to be known popularly as LOVE Park.
He served on the boards of the Fairmount Park Commission, the Philadelphia Art Commission, and the Delaware River Port Authority, and was at times chairman of all three.
He also served on the boards of several universities, including as chairman at Widener University, Lafayette College, Philadelphia College of Art, and Temple University. The Dixon Halls, North and South, at Widener University were enabled by his gift to establish an alternative apartment living experience for upper-class students. Temple University's Dixon Hall, built in 1983 on the university's Ambler campus, is named in his honor. Dixon Hall, a residence hall at Kutztown University of Pennsylvania, is also named after him. He was also selected in 1982 as the founding chairman of the board of governors of the State System of Higher Education, which was founded to bring together several former teachers' colleges and Indiana University of Pennsylvania. In 1993, the system's headquarters, the Dixon University Center, was named in his honor. The Dixon Trophy, awarded each season by the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference to the league's most successful program, is also named for him.
Personal life
In 1952, he married Edith Bruen Robb, the daughter of David B. Robb. Together, they had two children.
Dixon died of melanoma on August 2, 2006, in Abington, Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia, where he was interred at Saint Thomas' Church Cemetery in Whitemarsh.

Christian Lauba (born 26 July 1952) is a Tunisian born French composer and teacher, especially noted for his compositions for saxophone. His compositions often incorporate the music of his native North Africa as well as Japanese influences. He sometimes composes under the name of Jean Matitia, particularly for jazz and rag music.
Biography
Lauba was born in Sfax, Tunisia. His family later settled in Bordeaux, France, where he studied languages at the University of Bordeaux and music at the Conservatory of Bordeaux with composer Michel Fusté-Lambezat. Early in his compositional career, he also worked with saxophonist Jean-Marie Londeix. In 1993, he was appointed professor of analysis at the Conservatory. It was here that he composed pieces that had extended techniques for the saxophone including slap tonguing, circular breathing, multiphonics, and the altissimo register. He has also composed literature for other solo instruments as well as ensembles.
He has given master classes in composition and lectured at many universities including Bowling-Green in Ohio, Winnipeg in Canada, and the University of Maryland as well as at several European conservatories including those of Milan, Madrid, Lisbon (Conservatório Nacional de Lisboa), and Amsterdam. He chaired the jury of the Gaudeamus International Composers Award in 1996.
From 2004 to 2007, Lauba was artistic director of the Orchestre National Bordeaux Aquitaine and from 2004 to 2006, also its music director.
In the 2007/2008 season he was composer in residence with the Orchestre symphonique de Mulhouse, where his New York Concerto (a triple concerto for saxophone, cello and piano) received its world premiere.
Awards and commissions
Lauba won First Prize for composition in the class of Michel Fuste-Lambezat and the Medal of Honor of the City of Bordeaux. In 1994 he won first prize in the Berlin International Composition Competition (Institut für Neue Musik), and his Neuf études pour saxophones (Nine études for saxophones), commissioned by Jean-Marie Londeix and composed between 1992 and 1994, won the SACEM prize in composition. He has received commissions both from the French state and from a variety of contemporary classical music ensembles (Diotima Quartet, Cuarteto Casals, Percussion de Strasbourg, Belcea Quartet, Ensemble Court-Circuit, Ictus Ensemble, and the Netherlands Wind Ensemble) as well as from larger orchestras, including the Orchestre Symphonique de Mulhouse, Orchestre Poitou-Charentes, Orchestre Régional de Cannes, Orchestre Colonne, MDR Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre National Bordeaux Aquitaine, and the Opéra National de Bordeaux.

Henriette Mertz (1898–1985) was an American patent attorney from Chicago and a proponent of pseudoarchaeological hyperdiffusionism in relation to ancient American history. During World War II, she worked as a code-breaker for the U.S. government's cryptography department. She published several controversial works during the 1960s and 1970s relating to the early discovery and settlement of America.
Bat Creek Stone
In 1964, Mertz suggested that a photograph of the Bat Creek inscription had been published upside down. Later Cyrus H. Gordon suggested that the inscriptions were derived from a Hebrew alphabet from the 1st century AD but today mainstream archaeologists consider it to be a fraud.
Greek voyages
In her work entitled The Wine Dark Sea, Mertz argued that Odysseus sailed through the Straits of Gibraltar and into the North Atlantic. Moreover, Mertz believed that Odysseus faced Scylla and Charybdis when he arrived at the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia. Mertz also proposed that the Argonauts travelled across the Atlantic Ocean, down the east coast of South America, past the mouth of the Amazon and Rio de Janeiro to the Rio Plata of Argentina. From Rio Plata, Jason went to the altiplano of Bolivia and to Tihuanaco where the Golden Fleece was located.
Chinese voyages
In her work entitled Pale Ink (self-published c. 1958), Mertz proposed that two accounts of Chinese travels to Fusang—one found in the Shan Hai Jing (which Mertz dates to 2250 BC) and the other by Buddhist missionary Hui Shen in 499 AD—describe visits to the American continent. As supporting evidence she proposed that the Milk River inscriptions were Chinese glyphs made by one of the exploration parties. According to David Hatcher Childress, Mertz also interpreted Fusang as meaning "fir trees" in Chinese, and ruminated that they might refer to the fir trees of British Columbia. The hypothesis had long been rejected by academic sinologists having been first advocated in English by Charles Godfrey Leland in 1875, but apparently Mertz was unaware of these facts. In her book, Mertz also proposed that Quetzalcoatl was Hui Shen, the 5th century Buddhist traveler to Fusang. About Mertz's hypotheses, Joseph Needham writes in a footnote that "the proposed identities in general require a heroic suspension of disbelief".

Dugave is an urban settlement of the Croatian capital of Zagreb, within Novi Zagreb – istok District. Its neighbors are Travno, Sloboština and Hrelić, making Dugave the center of its district. The quarter itself has over 10,000 residents and two primary schools. It is the southernmost neighborhood in Novi Zagreb. The neighborhood is known for having a luxurious part known as the "Beverly Hills of Dugave".
History
The assembly of the Novi Zagreb municipality made a decision in 1975 about the implementation of the urban neighborhood, and the first award for an ideal solution was given to Ivan Čižmek, Tomislav Odak, Tomislav Bilić and Zdenko Vazdar.
The setting stone for the commencement of the building of the new neighborhood in Zagreb was set on 25 May 1977. During its designing, the orthogonal way that some of the older neighborhoods in the city were built in was abolished.
Arrangement
The neighborhood has a lot of green areas which makes it one of the more pleasant neighborhoods to live in. It is appropriate for children due to many playgrounds, parks and spots to play. The neighborhood has its own church, school, kindergarten, soccer club and library.
The dried out branch of the Sava river, Savišće, crosses through the neighborhood north-south.
The neighborhood is also the home of the largest crest of GNK Dinamo Zagreb which is located next to the school.
Education
Dugave has its own kindergarten, Vrtić Tratinčica (eng. Kindergarten Daisy), which consists of a main building near the center of the neighborhood and more buildings around Dugave. The kindergarten was founded in 1980.
The primary school in Dugave was built in 1980 also, bearing the name OŠ Josipa Kraša (eng. Josip Kraš Primary School). However, the demographic boom happened and the school had more students than it was allowed. Thus, in 1991, the school was divided into two schools: I. OŠ Dugave and II. OŠ Dugave (eng. Dugave Primary School 1 and Dugave Primary School 2). II. OŠ Dugave was later renamed into OŠ Frana Galovića (eng. Fran Galović Primary School). The two schools work together in the same building to this day, working in two shifts. The building itself has a peculiar shape consisting of three hexagonal-looking buildings, adjoined by an annex and a special building where the gyms and the locker rooms are. There are four fields behind the school: two for soccer and two for basketball. I. OŠ Dugave is a high quality primary school known for hardworking and intelligent students who excel in Math, Geography and Physics (courtesy of Pavo Majić). The school paper, Dugi, which stopped being published in the year 2009, got many critical acclaims and rewards, as well as the school's drama group. The school has been on TV many times; in 2008, one of the students of the 2nd grade won the televised learning competition Učilica for the first time in the year, and in 2013 the school was once again visited by a local TV company which presented it. A game of basketball was played amongst the two schools, with I. OŠ Dugave winning. OŠ Frana Galovića had a school paper, Crn-Bel, as well.

Glacier hiking involves walking on a glacier with special equipment, such as crampons, rope, climbing harness, helmet and ice axe, so that to some degree it resembles mountaineering.
Glaciers are found on every continent except for Australia. They need a specific climate: generally a lot of snowfall during the winter and relatively cool temperatures during the summer. Glacier Hiking has become a tourist attraction in some countries, but it requires special knowledge of the constantly-changing environments and glacial features. Hazards like crevasses and serac are difficult obstacles that glacier hikers should be aware of during this activity.
Locations for Glacier hiking
All continents, with the exception of Australia, have glacier hiking destinations. Some of these destinations are easily accessible, while others are more enjoyable at certain times of the year. Each glacier hiking excursion features at least one, if not more, different paid services to help with guided tours and different sightseeing experiences.
North America
Alaska features a variety of different glaciers that people enjoy visiting and hike. These glaciers are enjoyed especially during the summer months, as Alaska's temperatures are always cold.
Montana is the home to the Glacier National Park, which features over 50 glaciers on its 734 mile long trail. The trail includes other climbing and sightseeing activities as well.
South America
Argentina is where the Perito Moreno Glacier is located. This glacier is very popular due to the fact that it is easily accessible; the glacier is 185 m above sea level. The glacier itself has remained stable since 1917.
Europe
Switzerland has the Great Aletsch Glacier, which is located on a hiking path that includes lakes and other mountain paths. The glacier itself features 32 peaks that are 4,000 meters high.
Iceland is home to Svínafellsjökull, a very popular glacier for hiking. It is one of the oldest and bluest glaciers in Iceland. Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon features the Breiðamerkurjökull glacier, which is one of the most popular ones in the country. In the winter season, it features caves that are a large tourist attraction.
Africa
Located in Tanzania, Mount Kilimanjaro features glaciers that you can view while hiking up the mountain. These glaciers are unstable; the ice is melting and therefore, the structure is not safe to climb.
Pacific Ocean
Although Australia has no glaciers, the neighboring nation of New Zealand does; glaciers Fox and Franz Josef are able to be hiked. The glaciers lead into a neighboring rainforest. To trek these glaciers, hikers must utilize helicopter transportation.

Gino Severini (7 April 1883 – 26 February 1966) was an Italian painter and a leading member of the Futurist movement. For much of his life he divided his time between Paris and Rome. He was associated with neo-classicism and the "return to order" in the decade after the First World War. During his career he worked in a variety of media, including mosaic and fresco. He showed his work at major exhibitions, including the Rome Quadrennial, and won art prizes from major institutions.
Early life
Severini was born into a poor family in Cortona, Italy. His father was a junior court official and his mother a dressmaker. He studied at the Scuola Tecnica in Cortona until the age of fifteen, when he and a group of fellow-classmates were expelled from the entire Italian school system for the attempted theft of exam papers. The boys escaped a custodial sentence but Severini never again attended formal education. For a while he worked with his father; then in 1899 he moved to Rome with his mother. It was there that he first showed a serious interest in art, painting in his spare time while working as a shipping clerk. With the help of a patron of Cortonese origins he attended art classes, enrolling in the free school for nude studies (an annex of the Rome Fine Art Institute) and a private academy. His formal art education ended after two years when his patron stopped his allowance, declaring, "I absolutely do not understand your lack of order."
In 1900 he met the painter Umberto Boccioni. Together they visited the studio of Giacomo Balla, where they were introduced to the technique of Divisionism, painting with adjacent rather than mixed colors and breaking the painted surface into a field of stippled dots and stripes. The ideas of Divisionism had a great influence on Severini's early work and on Futurist painting from 1910 to 1911.
Severini settled in Paris in November 1906. The move was momentous for him. He said later, "The cities to which I feel most strongly bound are Cortona and Paris: I was born physically in the first, intellectually and spiritually in the second." He lived in Montmartre and dedicated himself to painting. There he met most of the rising artists of the period, befriending Amedeo Modigliani and occupying a studio next to those of Raoul Dufy, Georges Braque and Suzanne Valadon. He knew most of the Parisian avant-garde, including Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Juan Gris, Pablo Picasso, Lugné-Poe and his theatrical circle, the poets Guillaume Apollinaire, Paul Fort, Max Jacob, and author Jules Romains. The sale of his work did not provide enough to live on and he depended on the generosity of patrons.
Futurism
He was invited by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and Boccioni to join the Futurist movement and was a co-signatory, with Balla, Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, and Luigi Russolo, of the Manifesto of the Futurist Painters in February 1910 and the Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting in April the same year. He was an important link between artists in France and Italy and came into contact with Cubism before his Futurist colleagues. Following a visit to Paris in 1911, the Italian Futurists adopted a sort of Cubism, which gave them a means of analysing energy in paintings and expressing dynamism. Severini helped to organize the first Futurist exhibition outside Italy at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, Paris, in February 1912 and participated in subsequent Futurist shows in Europe and the United States. In 1913, he had solo exhibitions at the Marlborough Gallery, London, and Der Sturm, Berlin; it was during the show in London when he met and befriended British artist C. R. W. Nevinson, ultimately leading to the latter's decision to become a fellow Futurist.
In his autobiography, written many years later, he records that the Futurists were pleased with the response to the exhibition at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, but that influential critics, notably Apollinaire, mocked them for their pretensions, their ignorance of the main currents of modern art and their provincialism. Severini later came to agree with Apollinaire.
Severini was less attracted to the subject of the machine than his fellow Futurists and frequently chose the form of the dancer to express Futurist theories of dynamism in art. He was particularly adept at rendering lively urban scenes, for example in Dynamic Hieroglyph of the Bal Tabarin (1912) and The Boulevard (1913). During the First World War he produced some of the finest Futurist war art, notably his Italian Lancers at a Gallop (1915) and Armoured Train (1915). He spent part of the war in Barcelona, but returned to Paris by July 1915.
Crystal Cubism and Neo-classicism
In 1916 Severini departed from Futurism and painted several works in a naturalistic style inspired by his interest in early Renaissance art. After the First World War, Severini gradually abandoned the Futurist style and painted in a synthetic Crystal Cubist style until 1920.
By 1920 he was applying theories of classical balance based on the Golden Section to still lifes and figurative subjects from the traditional commedia dell'arte. He became part of the "return to order" in the arts in the post-war era. Works such as The Two Pulchinellas (1922) exemplify Severini's turn toward a more conservative, analytic type of painting, which nonetheless suggests metaphysical overtones.
After 1920, Severini divided his time between Paris and Rome. In 1921, he was commissioned by George Sitwell to paint murals for Montefugoni castle, which the latter had bought in 1909; the same year, Severini published Du cubisme au classicisme: Esthétique du compas et du nombre, a book summarizing his research into mathematical theories of harmony and proportion. The murals were completed in 1922.
In 1923 and 1925 he took part in the Rome Biennale. He exhibited in Milan with artists of the Novecento Italiano group in 1926 and 1929 and in their Geneva exhibition of 1929. From 1928 he began to incorporate elements of Rome's classical landscape in his work. In 1930 he took part in the Venice Biennale, exhibited in the Rome Quadrennials of 1931 and 1935, and in 1935 won the first prize for painting, with an entire room devoted to his work. He contributed a cycle of works to the Paris Exhibition. He explored fresco and mosaic techniques and executed murals in various media in Switzerland, France, and Italy.
During this decade, he taught the Swiss printmaker Lill Tschudi, who had previously studied at the Grosvenor School of Modern Art.
Later life
In the 1940s Severini's style became semi-abstract. In the 1950s he returned to his Futurist subjects: dancers, light and movement. He executed commissions for the church of Saint-Pierre in Freiburg and inaugurated the Conségna delle Chiavi ("Delivery of the Keys") mosaic. His mosaics were shown at the Cahiers d'Art gallery in Paris and he participated in a conference on the history of mosaic at Ravenna. He received commissions to decorate the offices of KLM in Rome and Alitalia in Paris and took part in the exhibition The Futurists, Balla - Severini 1912–1918 at the Rose Fried Gallery in New York. In Rome he reconstructed his Pan Pan Dance mosaic, which had been destroyed in the war. He was awarded the Premio Nazionale di Pittura of the Accademia di San Luca in Rome, exhibited at the 9th Rome Quadrennal and was given a solo exhibition at the Accademia di San Luca.
Throughout his career he published important theoretical essays and books on art. In 1946 he published an autobiography, The Life of a Painter.
Severini died in Paris on 26 February 1966, aged 82. He was buried at Cortona.

The Thrill Hunter is a 1933 American pre-Code comedy film directed by George B. Seitz. Buck Jones stars as a habitual teller of tall tales, while Dorothy Revier plays the film star he tries to impress.
Plot
Braggart Buck Crosby rescues movie star Marjorie Lane when her horse bolts during location shooting. She invites him to dinner, where he regales the film crew with tall tales of his exploits. When someone notices his resemblance to a noted car racer, he takes credit for that, too. After he leaves, he is attracted to a commotion in an isolated cabin. Shots ring out, and he finds two men dead inside. They turn out to be members of the Blake gang, which just pulled off a $100,000 gold robbery. Buck finds a locket and keeps it, then claims the reward for shooting the two men. This latest exploit convinces director Ed Jackson to invite Buck to go to Hollywood and star opposite Marjorie in her next picture.
Much to Buck's dismay, Jackson has believed his stories about being an expert driver and pilot. Buck is expected to drive a high-powered car around an oval track and fly a biplane. After a hair-raising few minutes, he crashes the car. He then tries to learn how to fly overnight. However, he is spotted at an airplane simulator/ride by Roy Lang, assistant to studio producer Sam Levine. Roy informs Sam that Buck is a fake. They rush out to the airport, but not in time. Buck takes off, flies around, then crashes. When they pull him out of the wreckage unscathed, Sam fires him on the spot. Buck confesses and apologizes to Marjorie, then hops on a freight train.
When he gets off, two other riders take him at gunpoint back to the cabin where he found the bodies. They turn out to be Al Blake and Lou Norton, the other members of the Blake gang. Al wants the locket, which is told to have the directions to where the gold is stashed hidden in it. Buck tells them he gave it to Marjorie. They tie him up and go to the train station. As luck would have it, Marjorie and her crew have returned to resume filming. The robbers kidnap Marjorie. Meanwhile, Buck frees himself and spots them as they drive past. He steals an airplane, gives chase and shoots the two crooks from the air (just like he claimed he shot Japanese officers in China). Afterward, he tells Marjorie he will never lie again. He soon starts to tell her another tall tale, but then sheepishly remembers his promise.

The pous ( podes; , poûs) or Greek foot ( feet) was a Greek unit of length. It had various subdivisions whose lengths varied by place and over time. 100 podes made up one plethron, 600 podes made up a stade (the Greek furlong) and 5000 made up a milion (the Greek mile). The Greek pous also has long, median and short forms.
The pous spread throughout much of Europe and the Middle East during the Hellenic period preceding and following the conquests of Alexander the Great and remained in use as a Byzantine unit until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453.
Comparative analysis
A pous is divided into digits or fingers (daktyloi) which are multiplied as shown. Generally the sexagesimal or decimal multiples have Mesopotamian origins while the septenary multiples have Egyptian origins.
Greek measures of short median and long podes can be thought of as based on body measures. The lengths may be compared to the Imperial/U.S. foot of 304.8 mm. Stecchini and others propose the Greek podes are different sizes because they are divided into different numbers of different sized daktylos to facilitate different calculations. The most obvious place to observe the relative difference is in the Greek orders of architecture whose canon of proportions is based on column diameters.

USS Cohocton (AO-101) was lead ship of her class of fleet oiler acquired by the United States Navy for use during World War II. She had the dangerous but necessary task of providing fuel to vessels in combat and non-combat areas. She served in the Pacific Ocean Theatre of operations late in the war.
Cohocton was launched 28 June 1945 by Marinship Corp., Sausalito, California, under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs C. O. Day; commissioned 25 August 1945 and reported to the Pacific Fleet.
End-of-war Pacific Theatre operations
Cohocton sailed from San Francisco, California, on 5 September 1945 for Eniwetok, carrying ammunition and fresh water. She supported occupation forces in the Far East and western Pacific by carrying water from one port to another and serving as station water tanker. She called at Guam, Ulithi, Samar, Leyte, Yokosuka, Wakayama, and Kagoshima before arriving at Tsingtao, China, on 10 January 1946, for station duty until 21 April. She returned by way of San Pedro, California, and the Panama Canal to Mobile, Alabama, where she was decommissioned on 14 June 1946 and returned to the War Shipping Administration the same day.
Reassigned to MSTS
Cohocton was reacquired by the Navy and operated by a civilian company under contract to the Navy Transportation Service.
She was reassigned to Military Sea Transportation Service on 1 October 1949; reinstated in the Naval Register and placed in-service as USNS Cohocton (T-AO-101). Placed out-of-service, (date unknown); struck from the Naval Register, (date unknown); transferred to MARAD for lay up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, (date unknown).
Cohocton was withdrawn from the reserve fleet on 27 September 1967 and transferred to the Hudson Waterways Corporation as part of the MARAD Exchange Program, and renamed SS Transoneida, IMO 6120965. The ship was converted to container ship in 1969. Upon completion of the conversion she was sold to the C.T.I. Corporation on 16 September 1969 and began hauling containerized cargo for Seatrain Lines between U.S. west coast ports and Hawaii, Guam and other U.S. Pacific territories. In 1974 Transoneida was leased to Matson, Inc. when Seatrain sold its Hawaiian operations to the Hawaiian-based shipping company. She was sold for scrapping to the Keun Hwa Iron & Steel Work Enterprise, Ltd., Taiwan, on 29 July 1980.

Alan Burns (29 December 1929 – 23 December 2013)"R.I.P.", Ansible 319, February 2014. was an English author and one of the key figures in the short-lived group of experimental writers working in Britain in the 1960s and early 1970s, which included writers such as B. S. Johnson, Christine Brooke-Rose, Ann Quin and Giles Gordon. Burns wrote eight novels, a play and the script for two short films (one in collaboration with B. S. Johnson), as well as several short pieces, a book of interviews with writers, articles and edited an American report on pornography and censorship for publication in the UK. Burns was one of the earliest teachers of creative writing as an academic discipline in Britain, appointed as the first writer in residence on the University of East Anglia's Creative Writing Master's programme and later he went on to teach this discipline in both Australia and the USA. Burns also worked with Peter Whitehead, writing Jeanette Cochrane, a short experimental film in a montage style, which featured early music from Pink Floyd and an appearance by Nico.
Biography and creative works
Alan Burns was born on 29 December 1929 to a middle-class family, the second of his parents' three sons. He attended Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood. Burns recounts his experiences at the school in fictionalised form in Buster, his first and most autobiographical novel. While at the school, Burns published an absurdist and satirical essay on Samuel Johnson in the school magazine, which he reuses in Buster. Burns subsequently did national service from 1949 to 1951 in the Royal Army Education Corps. He studied law at Middle Temple, and was called to the bar in 1956. He was assistant legal manager at Beaverbrook Newspapers from 1959 to 1962.Buster, Burns' debut novel, was published by John Calder in 1961. Largely autobiographical, it recounts a middle-class childhood spent during the Second World War and an adolescence and young adulthood in its aftermath. Burns' brother and mother both died during the war, and the novel deals with the consequences of their deaths for the remaining family members. All of his subsequent works feature a protagonist who experiences the death of a parent or sibling, and the trauma this engenders.
With his second novel, Europe After the Rain, titled after the Max Ernst painting, Burns begins to use collage techniques and cut-ups. As a result, the writing becomes starker, more distanced, as the novel recounts the movements of an anonymous narrator moving through an unnamed but ruined country during a war that several, also anonymous, characters say has ended but whose violence persists so that the distinction between wartime and peacetime is blurred.Celebrations transposes the techniques of Europe After the Rain into the workplace, where the violence persists, but is more concealed, occluded by family hierarchies and arcane legal structures. Burns' focus seems narrower, the narrative concentrating on a factory-owning family, particularly the patriarch, Williams and his son, Michael. After Williams's other son, Phillip, is killed in what might be an industrial accident but might also be at the hands of his brother, Williams and Michael compete for the attention of Phillip's widow, Jacqueline.
Following Celebrations, Burns published Babel, stylistically his most radical work, and the high point of his experimental phase, with no narrative, a huge cast of characters including politicians and celebrities of the time, and short sections of highly condensed, often grammatically difficult prose. Again, Burns's targets in the novel are the state, violence and power. The novel deals repeatedly with the Vietnam War, the effects of colonialism, religion, the amorality of the political class, the workplace, the violence inherent within the family, with the movement of money and state-sanctioned violence. But more than its explicit content, Burns's novel deals, on a structural level, with the increasing fragmentation of the society it depicts.Babel received mixed reviews, even from those, like Robert Nye, whom Burns saw as supporters of his work, and sold relatively poorly. But Burns continued his commitment to its style in Dreamerika!, which traces a fictional history of the Kennedy family in America, seeing them as exemplars of the insidious movement of money and power, and of the relationship between politics and money. In the novel the Kennedys become mythical figures, but incredibly wealth and influence cannot shield them from an essentially tragic character, and as the various members die, it's possible to see Burns replicating his own family pattern.
Following the publication of Dreamerika!, Burns's style changes significantly. His next book, The Angry Brigade (Allison and Busby, 1973), presents a fictionalised account of several members of the short-lived British activist group known as The Angry Brigade. Burns presents their accounts in the form of transcripts from interviews, and in fact Burns did interview several people (including some left-wing activists) in preparing the novel. Though Burns is still working with found material, gone are the difficult to parse sentences, the bursts of incongruous images and non-sequiturs. Instead, the focus is on how a community performs its politics, and the way in which their personal interactions and day-to-day living conflict with their ideologies. The question of the efficacy and morality of using violence against the state in activist projects, as the real Angry Brigade did, and were imprisoned for, hangs heavy over the novel, and its protagonists endlessly discuss how they can avoid simply replicating the strategies of the state in their attempt to inspire political change.
Burns' drastic change in approach comes at a time when a great deal was changing in his personal life. In the early seventies his first marriage, to author and artist Carol Burns broke down, and Burns moved from being a full-time novelist to taking on teaching roles, where he became increasingly permanent as a member of staff. In 1974 this led to Burns moving to Australia to work as a senior tutor in creative writing at the Western Australia Institute of Technology (now Curtin University). Burns later taught creative writing at various educational institutions, including the University of East Anglia, Norwich, the City Literary Institute, London, the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, and Lancaster University. Burns was the University of East Anglia's first writer-in-residence. Aspiring writers who came under his tutelage included Ian McEwan.
In his own accounts of the period, Burns suggests that the reasons for his change in writing style are political and theoretical, claiming to be inspired by Heinrich Böll's Nobel Prize acceptance speech, which extolled the virtues of writing plainly to achieve a political effect. Burns, in his interviews, seems uncomfortable with the associations that experimental writing has with elitism and, following Böll, sees the need for a plainly expressed writing which can speak to, and inform, a wide audience.
Alongside these personal and theoretical changes, the group of experimental writers that had formed in London in the mid sixties had lost much of its impetus following the suicides of Ann Quin and B.S. Johnson, both in 1973, less than three months apart, the first in August, the latter in early November. Burns had been close friends with Johnson. They wrote the short film Unfair together, and Burns considered writing a biography of Johnson, two short chapters of which appear in the 1997 Fall issue of the Review of Contemporary Fiction alongside another short piece by Burns and several critical essays.
In 1981, Burns published The Day Daddy Died, his most conventionally written novel. The novel traces the life of Norah, a working-class woman, whose life is made up of a series of encounters with institutions which exploit and oppress her, and with men who are representatives of those institutions. Toward the conclusion of the novel Norah and her large family (she has five children with five different partners) are confined to what Burns describes as "factory, hospital and work-camp [combined] into an all purpose institution to represent the power of the State", a particularly Thatcherite institution in which the workplace, the prison, the hospital and the school combine, and here in particular Burns seems to anticipate the sweatshops and maquiladoras that arrive with emerging globalisation. The novel is written in a very straightforward, vernacular style, and again Burns used interview material as his source for the novel.
In 1982 he co-edited (with Charles Sugnet) The Imagination on Trial: British and American writers discuss their working methods, which The Washington Post "Book World" called "diverting, iconoclastic, and compulsively readable". The book included interviews with 11 authors (as well as Burns himself): J. G. Ballard, Eva Figes, John Gardner, Wilson Harris, John Hawkes, B. S. Johnson, Tom Mallin, Michael Moorcock, Grace Paley, Ishmael Reed, and Alan Sillitoe.
Burns published his final novel in 1986. Revolutions of the Night was a return to a lighter prose style, and in places its short, gnomic utterances recall his work in Celebrations. Again the title is taken from a Max Ernst painting, and the focus is a wealthy, middle-class family in which one member, on this occasion the mother, dies early on, and the remainder of the novel is focussed on the fallout from her death. The novel consists of a series of set pieces, most of which concern the incestuous relationship between the two children of the family, Hazel and Max, a relationship which seems to shield them from the institutions of the state that they encounter. Midway through the novel a war, or revolution, appears to begin, Max is imprisoned and then released, and the novel ends, in scenes that are reminiscent of the ending of Europe After the Rain, the two siblings escape the country and live together.
Burns taught briefly at Lancaster University in the 1990s, before returning to London, where he moved in with his ex-wife, Carol Burns, as a lodger. This movement, back to his first wife, to his hometown, retraces the movement of the protagonist of Burns' first novel, Buster, and is itself an instantiation of the traumatic encircling and repetition that takes place in his novels. He died in December 2013.

The bar-breasted piculet (Picumnus aurifrons) is a species of bird in the family Picidae. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.
Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and sometimes in heavily degraded former forest. The bar-breasted piculet is generally found in humid forests, including terra firme and várzea, and are generally seen within such areas in the edges, second growth, and clearings.
This species is of note as the smallest extant species in the highly diverse woodpecker family. A typical adult will measure only in length and will weigh . The average sized male was found to weigh while the average sized female . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the bill is and the tarsus is . These yellowish green piculets have horizontal barring on the chest and vertical streaking on the belly. Several different subspecies exist throughout their large range. Unfortunately, very little is known about their life history and basic ecology.

Birth in Four Cultures: A Crosscultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden, and the United States is an anthropological study of childbirth by Brigitte Jordan published in 1978.
Background
Throughout the book Jordan explores the birth practices of four different cultures: the Yucatan, Holland, Sweden, and the United States. In chapter four, she explains in detail why she decided to focus her study on childbirth: "I never chose to study birth. In some sense, birth chose me."
Concept
Jordan's work argues against romanticized perspectives of "early, less complex societies" that present childbirth as uncomplicated. Instead, she suggests that childbirth is a life-altering event in all societies, but can be understood differently by using a cross-cultural perspective. In their edited collection, Childbirth and Authoritative Knowledge: Cross-Cultural Perspectives, Robbie E. Davis-Floyd and Carolyn F. Sargent praised the book for focusing "anthropological attention on childbirth as a subject worthy of in-depth ethnographic fieldwork and cross-cultural comparison, and that inspired many others to enter the field."
Jordan argues that birth should be examined utilizing a biosocial approach, which recognizes birth as a biological process that is shaped by social and cultural practices. Along with a concern for medical safety, Jordan also focuses on "maternal attitudes and participation in birth, the birth setting, and the mother's selection of birth attendants." Jordan uses her observations in the field, alongside academic anthropological sources to analyze birth as it occurs in four different societies.
Field method
As an ethnographer, Jordan and her collaborator Nancy Fuller incorporated qualitative and quantitative approaches to compare health policies and statistical data from the four birthing systems. Jordan employed formal and informal interviews based on her participant observation. In particular, she used technological means of data collection, such as videotaping and tape recording devices, to record and review her findings and produce high-quality documentation. Jordan reflects upon the methodological and ethical responsibility in her research to justify the decision-making process of the biosocial framework.
Reception and recognition
Honors and awards
In 1980, Jordan received the Margaret Mead Award in recognition for Birth in Four Cultures.
Academic reviews
While much of the reception for Birth in Four Cultures has been overwhelmingly positive, some anthropologists have criticized Jordan for her exclusive focus on the social aspects of birth without much attention to religious or ideological concerns in her research.
Birth in Four Cultures was one of the first ethnographies to study cross-cultural systems of birth. Jordan argued that economics, culture, and politics affect birth as a system, which led to the beginning of the sub-category of anthropology called Anthropology of Birth.
Birth in Four Cultures has been used to advocate for preserving midwifery care in developing countries.
Updates and editions
There have been four editions of the book in 1978, 1980, 1983, and 1993, including updates to the material from Jordan's continued research on the subject. The 4th edition was revised and expanded by anthropologist Robbie Davis-Floyd.

Cascading Waterfall is a public art work by American artist John Joseph Earley, located in Meridian Hill Park, Washington, DC. Cascading Waterfall was originally surveyed as part of the Smithsonian's Save Outdoor Sculpture! survey in 1994. The fountain, reminiscent of 16th century Italian villas, focuses primarily on thirteen large semi-circular basins forming a water cascade that overlooks the historic park. The fountains are the largest of their kind in the United States.
Description
Primarily made of concrete, the water flows from two terrace fountains and reappears in "three columns of water and two shell spills in five niches which are located in the face of terrace retaining wall." After entering the niches, the water moves from two basins and two more spout overflows, and then into a series of thirteen graduated cascade basins that enter into large pools. The large pools feature four grotesque spouting masks, four urn jets, two dolphin sprays, and eight white water jets that help to refresh the water of the pool. The 16th Street side of the fountain has more niches and shell overflows and a recirculation room is in the control room under the great wall. Landscaping and walkways flank the fountain on both sides.
Information
The waterfall, which was completed in 1936. The walkways surrounding the waterfall features the first use of aggregated concrete anywhere in the world. The waterfall is maintained by the National Park Service.
Condition
The waterfall was surveyed in 1994 by Save Outdoor Sculpture and at the time treatment was needed.
A broken pump caused the fountains to stop operating in 2016. In 2017, local residents living near the fountains created a community group to report to the National Park Service whenever the fountains were not operating. The following year, WAMU reported that the water supply piping had leaks. Contractors began to fix the piping, however, work stopped when they discovered that the pipe was cast iron. The National Park Service reported that they would replace 90 feet of piping to ensure the waterfall's continual operations. As of 2016, half of the funding to maintain Meridian Hill Park was used to maintain the fountains.

Oregon Ballot Measure 64 (IRR 25) was an initiated state statute ballot measure on the November 4, 2008 general election ballot in Oregon.
This measure would have prohibited money collected with the use of public resources from being used for political purposes, except elections, official voter pamphlets and most lobbying. "Political purpose" is defined as: candidates, political committee or party, initiative or referendum committee, and supporting/opposing candidates or ballot measures (including signature gathering for petitions).
Background
The measure was initially filed as a potential initiative by chief petitioner Bill Sizemore in 2006. In December 2007, Sizemore turned in 139,000 signatures to qualify the measure for the November 2008 ballot.
Sizemore put similar measures on the Oregon ballot in 1998 and 2000; all of them were defeated by a coalition of unions, charities, and non-profit organizations. Measure 59 was defeated 51–49; two years later, Measure 92 was defeated by a wider margin: 55–45. Also in 2000, another similar measure, Measure 98, was defeated 53–47.
Sizemore has filed nearly identical initiatives every two years since, although none qualified for the ballot until 2008. For 2010, he's filed Initiative Petition 25, which would make political contributions from unions "bribery."
Newspaper endorsements
Here is how Oregon's major newspapers endorsed on Measure 64:
No Oregon newspapers endorsed a yes vote on Measure 64.
Supporters
The official name of the initiative petition committee to put Measure 64 on the ballot was "Ban Public Money for Politics".
The Oregonian reported in September 2007 that Nevada-based millionaire Loren Parks was the leading contributor to put Measure 64 on the ballot. According to the newspaper, Parks gave money directly to the signature gathering firm, rather than to Sizemore directly.
Opponents
Measure 64 was opposed by the Don't Silence Our Voice committee. It was also opposed by the Defend Oregon Coalition, which opposed all of Bill Sizemore's 2008 ballot initiatives.
Don't Silence Our Voice describes itself as "a broad coalition of community advocates, charities, and labor organizations committed to protecting the voices of all Oregonians."
The official Oregon voter's pamphlet had arguments in opposition from the United Way, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the Oregon PTA, the Oregon Education Association, the League of Women Voters, and the Oregon State Council of firefighters, among others.
Arguments against Measure 64
Measure 64 would limit the ability of working people to participate in politics, but would still allow out-of-state corporations and millionaires to spend money freely, giving them even more political influence in Oregon. (Steve Novick, Blue Oregon, October 24)
From the Oregonian's No on 64 endorsement: "Of course, this would have the effect of giving Oregon firefighters and nurses less voice in Oregon politics than Loren Parks, which is not most Oregonians' view of how things should work. But the measure also runs the risk of badly hurting Oregon charitable organizations, which is why so many of them have raised their voices loudly in the campaign. Oregon public employees contribute to many state charities through payroll deductions, and the charities are concerned, after reading the measure's language and consulting attorneys, that they will be banned from speaking on behalf of their clients."
The measure would have damaging effects, including restricting public employee unions' ability to collect dues from members.
The Yamhill News Register says, "Though seemingly sensible on its surface, in practice, both these measures prohibit political free speech by public employees.\
It was authored by Bill Sizemore
Donors opposing Measure 64
The Oregon Nurses Association donated $500,000 to the campaign against the proposal.
Defend Oregon, as a committee, is fighting seven different ballot measures, and supporting two others. As a result, it is not possible to discern how much of its campaign warchest is going specifically to defeat Measure 59. Altogether, the group has raised over $6 million in 2008.
Major donations to the Defend Oregon group as of October 8 include:
$4.1 million from the Oregon Education Association.,
$100,000 from School Employees Exercising Democracy (SEED)
$100,000 from the AFL-CIO.
$50,000 from Oregon AFSCME Council 75.
Petition drive history
On May 13, 2008, the Oregon Secretary of State announced that according to an unofficial verification conducted by their office, supporters of the measure had turned in 87,348 valid signatures, slightly more than the 82,769 required. This represented a validity rate of 66% of the 132,347 signatures turned in. Democracy Direct was hired to collect signatures for the measure,
A union-funded watchdog group asked the Oregon Secretary of State to conduct an investigation into how some of the signatures on the measure were collected. Secretary of State Bill Bradbury said, "…most all of the initiatives Oregon voters will decide this fall got there through practices that are now illegal. But those practices were legal at the time most of the signatures were submitted." A lawsuit has been filed in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the new laws governing the initiative process in Oregon.

DDAIP is a pharmaceutical ingredient added to topical products to increase penetration through the skin. Chemically, DDAIP is an ester of N,N-dimethylalanine and dodecanol. DDAIP is typically formulated as its hydrochloride salt (DDAIP.HCl). This salt is a white crystalline solid with a melting range of 88-93 °C and is an amphiphilic molecule with a pKa of 4.87 that is soluble in water up to about 40% w/v. DDAIP is proprietary to NexMed USA, a subsidiary of Apricus Biosciences.
Mechanism of action
DDAIP is a permeation enhancer that temporarily changes the permeation dynamics of the lipid bilayer and opens up the tight junctions between skin cells so active drug molecules can be rapidly absorbed through the skin into systemic circulation. It can also improve the solubility of compounds resulting in enhanced drug permeation.
Clinical use
DDAIP hydrochloride is a functional inactive excipient currently used in the topical drug Vitaros, an alprostadil vasodilator cream used to treat erectile dysfunction. It is also used in MycoVa, a terbinafine antifungal nail lacquer for onychomycosis currently in phase-III clinical trials.
Safety
Overall, about 5,000 patients have been exposed to this compound with no serious adverse events recorded. DDAIP is primarily metabolized by esterases on cell surfaces and plasma to N,N-dimethylalanine, which is further demethylated to alanine; and dodecanol which is oxidized to lauric acid, both naturally occurring compounds already present in the body.

After victory in the Xinhai Revolution, the Nanjing Provisional Government of the Republic of China, led by Sun Yat-sen, framed the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China (, 1912), which was an outline of basic regulations with the qualities of a formal constitution.
On 11 March 1912, the Provisional Constitution replaced the previous organizational outline of the government, and came into effect as the supreme law. It was later replaced by a constitutional compact instituted by Yuan Shikai on 1 May 1914. However, it was restored once again on 29 June 1916, by President Li Yuanhong.
The Constitutional Protection Movement launched by the Military Government of the Republic of China in Guangzhou on 10 September 1917, was intended to "protect" this provisional constitution. However, as the Warlord Era divided the country into warring factions, the provisional constitution was gradually superseded by the constitutions issued by each rival government. In the Beiyang Government, the provisional constitution was replaced by Cao Kun's constitution on 10 October 1923. In the Nanjing Government, the provisional constitution was not replaced until 1 June 1931, when the Provisional Constitution of the Political Tutelage Period was announced, although the old constitution was already rarely discussed after the establishment of the Nationalist Government on 1 July 1925. From 1928 onwards, the Nationalists were operating under an Organic Law that had an ambiguous relationship with the 1931 Provisional Constitution as it was not completely superseded.
The Constitution of the Republic of China superseded it in 1946, ending the Period of Tutelage.
Outline of the constitution
The government system was to imitate the French cabinet: the Senate at the time wanted to restrain Yuan Shikai's ambitions, and they changed the presidential system to a parliamentary system so that Yuan would be turned into a figurehead.
The general principles were to be outlined concisely, regulating the fundamental elements of the nation in principle.
The presidential election would still be held in the Senate according to the organizational outline of the provisional Government.
The Judiciary system was completely independent, which matched the principle of separation of powers: the provisional Constitution regulated that the provisional president and the Minister of the Judiciary would appoint judges separately. Trials were to be administered by judges independently without the intervention of the government.

"Kol Meqadesh Shevi'i" is an ancient hymn, possibly composed by Moses b. Qalonymus. The hymn is first found in Add MS 27200, a 13th-century copy of the 11th-century Machzor Vitry, as the first hymn for the Sabbath; because the section with hymns does not appear in superior copies of Machzor Vitry, it is likely a later addition. Over the generations it has been set to many tunes. Ashkenazi Jews customarily sing it on Sabbath Eve.
Each stanza has four lines; the first three continue the acrostic and the fourth are a Biblical verse or verset.
Words
Content of the hymn
The hymn praises those who keep the Sabbath, and stresses the reward waiting anyone who keeps the Sabbath. The hymn stresses the Sabbath experiences, the hope of the redemption of Jerusalem and the imminent rebuilding of the Temple.
Most prayerbooks omit the final stanza which completes the acrostic and instead insert the line "O LORD, god of Israel, eternal savior."
Abraham Abba of Pittsburgh, who did not realize that the acrostic was complete in manuscript, wrote an alternative final stanza:

"Body Like a Back Road" is a song co-written and recorded by American country music singer Sam Hunt. It was released to country radio, by MCA Nashville on February 2, 2017, as the lead single from his second studio album Southside. The song is written by Hunt, Zach Crowell, Shane McAnally and Josh Osborne. It was released to American hot adult contemporary radio on April 3, 2017, becoming his second crossover single promoted to a pop music format.
The song is Hunt's most successful song to date. It broke two records within a month of one another; in early June 2017, the song was the longest running number one since Leroy Van Dyke's "Walk On By" 55 years earlier. With 20 weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart – this made Hunt the solo country artist with the second longest run at the top of the 59-year old Hot Country Songs chart. (Hank Snow's, "I'm Moving On" spent 21 weeks). The song broke records again in late July 2017, becoming the only song in the history of the Hot Country Songs chart to stay at number one for more than 24 weeks, a record previously held since 2012 by Florida Georgia Line's "Cruise". The song spent a total of 34 weeks on top of the Hot Country Songs chart. Additionally, the song peaked at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Hunt's highest-charting single, and his first top 10 single overall, on that chart. With this peak, the song became the highest-charting country song on the US Billboard Hot 100 since "Cruise" by Florida Georgia Line, which reached number four in 2013.
Background
The song was written by Hunt with his producer Zach Crowell, Josh Osborne and Shane McAnally. According to Hunt, the song was written after his engagement to Hannah Lee Fowler. Hunt described it as "a lighthearted song" as he wanted to release something lighter than the "heavy direction" that his new album was taking. Hunt said: "I connect music to the emotions that come from relationships, so most of the songs that I write are inspired by those circumstances, emotions, feelings, all that kind of stuff." He had previously broken up with Fowler, and wrote "Drinkin' Too Much" as an apology (the break-up also inspired a few other songs in Montevallo). The couple got back together, and a few days after "Drinkin' Too Much" was released in January 2017, he announced their engagement.
Composition
The song is composed in the key of F major with a tempo of 96–100 beats per minute.
Commercial performance
In the US, the song reached number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and remained there for 34 consecutive weeks until it was knocked off by "What Ifs" performed by Kane Brown and Lauren Alaina, breaking the record set by "Cruise" by Florida Georgia Line for the most weeks atop the chart (24 weeks). The record was later broken by Bebe Rexha and Florida Georgia Line's collaboration "Meant to Be" which stayed atop the chart for 50 consecutive weeks. It is Hunt's longest chart-topping single, overtaking "Take Your Time", which stayed on top of the Hot Country Songs chart for 11 weeks.
"Body Like a Back Road" also reached number one on the Country Airplay chart and stayed at that spot for three consecutive weeks. On the week after Hunt's performance at the ACM Awards, the song sold 70,000 copies and jumped up six places from number 12 to number six on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Hunt's highest-charting single, and his first top 10 single overall, on that chart. With this peak, the song became the highest-charting country song on the US Billboard Hot 100 since "Cruise" by Florida Georgia Line, which reached number four in 2013. The song also crossed over to pop radio.
The song was certified 4× Platinum on October 16, 2017. It was the third best-selling song in the US in 2017, and the best-selling country song, with 1,818,000 copies (3,723,000 units including streams) sold in the year. It has sold 1,951,000 copies in the United States as of June 2018.
Criticism and critical reception
The song has however been in the midst of controversy and being called out by some reporters and neo-traditional country artists for lack of similarity to country music's "roots." Many also took issue with the comparison between a woman's body and a back road. The song has received generally negative reviews. Multiple critics have cited "Body Like a Back Road" as one of the worst songs of 2017.
As of March 2022, this song has an average user rating of 8% on Album of the Year based on 19 user ratings.

Cinetrain or cine-train was a documentary film project conducted across the Soviet Union in the late 1920s by director Aleksandr Medvedkin. All 60 films created in Cinetrain were considered lost until 1980, when some of them were discovered in the archives of film historian Nikolai Izvolov.
Medvedkin outfitted three railroad cars to house his production crew and a lab for rapid developing, processing and assembly of films during the first Five Year Plan. His goal was to travel around the country, creating and exhibiting documentary films as quickly as possible.One of the wagons was installed as a movie trailer.
Cinetrain made "sweeping raids shock construction projects Five-Year Plan".
The film is in one box! Acute! Taking her heart! Made quickly, he must cling to the big screen thriller as a burr in the dog's tail and go with him on any road film distribution.The severity of raised topics and timely responses allow you to put shorts Medvedkin on a par with modern telehronikoy: "Arriving at an ordinary object, it is the move to remove" hot "subjects, they immediately showed, mounted and on the same day, or at least the next demonstrated at a local club or theatre, to the indescribable delight of the audience ". The idea was, by exposing shortcomings, to convince the audience of the need to improve the production process.
The cinetrain provoked a lively response among the French left int the 1960s. Members of the Medvedkino group, led by Chris Marker, perceived Medvedkin as the "Che Guevara of cinema" - "an enthusiastic militant propagandist, created in an almost partisan style, in the shortest possible time and on the spot."

The Second Mrs. Tanqueray is a problem play by Arthur Wing Pinero. It utilises the "Woman with a past" plot, popular in nineteenth century melodrama. The play was first produced in 1893 by the actor-manager George Alexander and despite causing some shock to his audiences by its scandalous subject it was a box-office success, and was revived in London and New York in many productions during the 20th century.
Background and first performance
The English dramatist Arthur Wing Pinero had won fame as a writer of farces and other comedies, including The Magistrate (1885), Dandy Dick (1887) and The Cabinet Minister (1890). Wishing to write about serious subjects, he wrote The Profligate (1889), in which past misdeeds come to haunt a seemingly respectable man. Pinero intended the central character to kill himself at the climax of the play, but the actor-manager John Hare persuaded him to tone down the ending to avoid alienating his respectable society audience.
When his next such drama – The Second Mrs Tanqueray – came to be produced, Pinero remained firm: the play would, and did, end in tragedy. While he was planning it, several plays of Henrik Ibsen were presented in London for the first time, regarded by much of polite society as avant garde, blunt and shocking. Seeing Ghosts led Pinero to reconsider his approach to playwriting, which now seemed old-fashioned by comparison. He was far from uncritical of Ibsen's plays, but recognised that if he was to be a serious dramatist he must treat social problems and human misconduct frankly.
The Second Mrs Tanqueray centred on "a woman with a past". Hare thought it too shocking for his audience and declined to present it. George Alexander, the actor-manager running the St James's Theatre, to whom Pinero then offered the play, said, "Sorry, I daren't do it". He had second thoughts, and accepted it. It was presented at the St James's on 27 May 1893. The cast was:
Aubrey Tanqueray – George Alexander
Sir George Orreyed, Bart – Adolphus Vane-Tempest
Captain Hugh Ardale – Ben Webster
Cayley Drummie – Cyril Maude (later Henry V. Esmond)
Frank Misquith, QC, MP – Nutcombe Gould (later H. H. Vincent)
Gordon Jayne, MD – Murray Hathorn
Morse – Alfred Holles
Lady Orreyed – Edith Chester
Mrs Cortelyon – Amy Roselle (later Charlotte Granville)
Paula – Mrs Patrick Campbell (later Charlotte Granville)
Ellean – Maude Millett
Source: The Era.
The piece was a box-office success and was still playing to full houses when Alexander, who disliked acting in long runs, closed the production in April 1894.
Plot
The play opens with a late night dinner between the widower Mr Tanqueray and some of his longtime professional friends. All are upper class members of British society, and the friends are disturbed when they learn of the forthcoming second marriage of Tanqueray to a Mrs Paula Jarman, a woman with a "bad reputation".
As the play progresses we see the misery of the mismatched couple and their shared efforts to foster a bond between Tanqueray's young and impeccably proper daughter Ellean and her young unhappy stepmother. This is compromised when Mrs Tanqueray learns the identity of her stepdaughter's fiancé; he is the man who ruined her, years ago. She reveals her knowledge to her husband, who prevents the marriage and alienates his daughter. This spreads and husband and wife, father and daughter, step-parent and child are all angered and alienated. When the daughter learns the reasons behind her disappointment she is struck with pity and makes a speech about trying again with her stepmother, only to go to her and find her dead, evidently by suicide.
Revivals and adaptations
Madge Kendal and her husband W. H. Kendal took the play on tour in Britain, and then to Broadway where self-appointed guardians of morality condemned it, and audiences flocked to see it. There were London revivals in 1895 at the St James's, 1901 at the Royalty Theatre, 1903 at the New Theatre, 1913 at the St James's and 1922 at the Playhouse Theatre. Eleonora Duse appeared in an Italian adaptation in 1905, and the play was given in English in Paris in 1907 at the Théâtre Sarah-Bernhardt. The Internet Broadway Database records New York revivals in 1900, 1902, 1907, 1908, 1913 and 1924. More recently, the play has been revived in the West End with Eileen Herlie in the title role in 1950, and at the National Theatre in 1981, starring Felicity Kendal.
The play was adapted for the cinema in 1916, with Alexander in his original role. A later film version was released in 1952, with Pamela Brown as Paula and Hugh Sinclair as Tanqueray. The BBC has broadcast several radio adaptations of the play, starring Margaret Rawlings and Nicholas Hannen (1940), Coral Browne, Malcolm Keen and Jack Buchanan (1944), Joyce Redman and André Morell (1951), Gladys Cooper and André Morell (1954), Margaret Robertson and Tony Britton (1967) and Michelle Newell and Gary Bond (1992). A BBC television adaptation was broadcast in 1962, starring Elizabeth Sellars and Peter Williams.

An O(1) scheduler (pronounced "O of 1 scheduler", "Big O of 1 scheduler", or "constant time scheduler") is a kernel scheduling design that can schedule processes within a constant amount of time, regardless of how many processes are running on the operating system. This is an improvement over previously used O(n) schedulers, which schedule processes in an amount of time that scales linearly based on the amounts of inputs.
In the realm of real-time operating systems, deterministic execution is key, and an O(1) scheduler is able to provide scheduling services with a fixed upper-bound on execution times.
The O(1) scheduler was used in Linux releases 2.6.0 thru 2.6.22 (2003-2007), at which point it was superseded by the Completely Fair Scheduler.
Overview
The Linux scheduler was overhauled completely with the release of kernel 2.6 in 2003. The new scheduler was called the O(1) scheduler. The algorithm used by the O(1) scheduler relies on active and expired arrays of processes to achieve constant scheduling time. Each process is given a fixed time quantum, after which it is preempted and moved to the expired array. Once all the tasks from the active array have exhausted their time quantum and have been moved to the expired array, an array switch takes place. Because the arrays are accessed only via pointer, switching them is as fast as swapping two pointers. This switch makes the active array the new empty expired array, while the expired array becomes the active array.
About O(1) notation
An algorithm operates over an input, and the size of that input usually determines its running time. Big O notation is used to denote the growth rate of an algorithm's execution time based on the amount of input. For example, the running time of an O(n) algorithm increases linearly as the input size n grows. The running time of an O(n) algorithm grows quadratically. If it is possible to establish a constant upper bound on the running time of an algorithm, it is considered to be O(1) (one might say it runs in "constant time"). That is, an O(1) algorithm is guaranteed to complete in a certain amount of time regardless of the size of the input.
Improvement in Linux scheduler performance
The Linux 2.6.8.1 scheduler did not contain any algorithms that run in worse than O(1) time. That is, every part of the scheduler is guaranteed to execute within a certain constant amount of time regardless of how many tasks are on the system. This allows the Linux kernel to efficiently handle massive numbers of tasks without increasing overhead costs as the number of tasks grows. There are two key data structures in the Linux 2.6.8.1 scheduler that allow for it to perform its duties in O(1) time, and its design revolves around them: runqueues and priority arrays.
Issues
The main issue with this algorithm is the complex heuristics used to mark a task as interactive or non-interactive. The algorithm tries to identify interactive processes by analyzing average sleep time (the amount of time the process spends waiting for input). Processes that sleep for long periods of time probably are waiting for user input, so the scheduler assumes they're interactive. The scheduler gives a priority bonus to interactive tasks (for better throughput) while penalizing non-interactive tasks by lowering their priorities. All the calculations to determine the interactivity of tasks are complex and subject to potential miscalculations, causing non-interactive behavior from an interactive process.
Replacement
In 2.6.23 (October 2007), the Completely Fair Scheduler was introduced, replacing the O(1) Scheduler. According to Ingo Molnar, the author of the CFS, its core design can be summed up in single sentence: "CFS basically models an 'ideal, precise multitasking CPU' on real hardware."

Paul D. Eaton (born 1950) is a former United States Army officer most known for his command of operations to train Iraqi troops during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Eaton served in that capacity between 2003 and 2004, and then returned to the US to become Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Training, United States Army Training and Doctrine Command, Fort Monroe, Virginia. He previously served as Senior Adviser to the now-defunct National Security Network, a progressive Washington, D.C.-based think tank that focused on foreign policy and defense issues.
Early life and education
Eaton was raised in Oklahoma. His father, U.S. Air Force Colonel Norman Dale Eaton, graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in 1949 and went on to become a U.S. Air Force pilot. He was piloting a B-57B when it crashed on a night interdiction mission over Salavan Province, Laos on 13 January 1969 and he and the other crewman, Paul E. Getchell, were listed as missing in action for many years. His remains were recovered, identified and buried at Arlington National Cemetery in early 2007.
Eaton followed in his father's footsteps to West Point in 1968, graduating with the class of 1972. He is fluent in French, receiving a Master of Arts from Middlebury College in French and Political Science.
Career
As a lieutenant and captain, Eaton served in the 4th Infantry Division, Fort Carson, Colorado, and was later transferred to Germany as part of 4th Brigade, 4th Infantry Division ("Brigade 76"), where he served as an assistant brigade S3 (operations) officer and later was an infantry company commander. As major and lieutenant colonel Eaton was assigned to key battalion and brigade staff positions in the old 9th Infantry Division, then on the I Corps staff. He also commanded the 3rd Battalion, 14th Infantry, 2nd Brigade of the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, New York, and later served as the G-3 (operations officer) of the division during Operation Restore Hope in Somalia.
As a colonel in the mid 1990s he commanded an Army brigade in Germany and following promotion to brigadier general was the assistant division commander of the 1st Armored Division. In 2000, he returned to the U.S. to serve as deputy commanding general of the U.S. Army Infantry Center and School at Fort Benning, Georgia, and later he led the creation of the Army's new Stryker brigades at Fort Lewis, Washington. As a major general he returned to Fort Benning to be commanding general of the Army Infantry Center and School. He was then assigned to Iraq as Commanding General of the Coalition Military Assistance Training Team (CMATT), where he was in charge of training the Iraqi military from 2003 to 2004.
Following the first Iraqi army battalion's graduation, their first mission received heavy casualties and raised questions about the efficacy of Iraqi soldiers trained under U.S. supervision. During an initial mission in April 2004 to assist U.S. Marines in Fallujah and under the supervision of a Marine advisory team, the Iraqi soldiers ran from the scene when they first were attacked by insurgents. "The convoy got stalled when one of the IAF soldiers driving one of the trucks simply jumped out and ran, leaving the truck running. This truck struck a civilian vehicle, creating a jam that prevented part of the convoy from moving. About 30 Iraqi soldiers were lost in this ambush. Some simply ran away, some sold their AK-47s and donned civilian clothes, and some had civilian clothes under their uniforms, so they simply took off their uniforms and ran." The Marine advisors managed to salvage the convoy and get them to safety, but with significant casualties. What was a battalion of 695 Iraqi soldiers has been reduced significantly with 30 casualties in the ambush, alongside 8 wounded, 24 combat deserters, 104 mutineers, 78 AWOL (absent without leave) and 170 on leave. This stands in contrast to the support of Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, the senior U.S. commander in Iraq, whose remarks during the Iraqi battalion's graduation spoke of "high expectations that in fact they would help us bring security and stability back to the country."
Upon return to the US he was Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Training, United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Fort Monroe, Virginia.
VoteVets
After retiring from the Army in 2006 Eaton was a frequent guest on various media outlets, where he often criticized the George W. Bush administration's prosecution of the Iraq War. In 2007, Eaton appeared in a political ad for VoteVets.org, similar to the ones prepared by retired Army Major General John Batiste.
Eaton asserted that President George W. Bush did not heed the advice given by his military commanders. Eaton appeared on Bill Maher's HBO talk show and spoke out strongly against those who launched the Iraq War. In 2008 Eaton served as an advisor to Senator Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Following Clinton's concession of the Democratic primary, Eaton has made several appearances in support of Senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign. In July 2016, Eaton appeared in a political campaign ad critical of Donald Trump, using the catchphrase "Too Dangerous for America."
Awards and decorations
Eaton's awards and decorations include the Army Distinguished Service Medal, Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit (with 3 Oak Leaf Clusters), Meritorious Service Medal (with 2 Oak Leaf Clusters), Army Commendation Medal (with 2 Oak Leaf Clusters), Army Achievement Medal, Expert Infantryman Badge, Parachutist Badge, Ranger Tab, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff Identification Badge.
Personal life
Eaton's wife, P.J., is a former U.S. Army captain and a daughter of a United States Marine Corps colonel. She is now a licensed mental health counselor who primarily works with perpetrators of domestic violence. They were married in 1973. They have two sons and a daughter.

Robert J. Healey Jr. (May 3, 1957 – March 20, 2016) was an American attorney, businessman, and political activist. He was the founder of Rhode Island's Cool Moose Party, the state's third-largest political party from 1994 until 2002, and was a perennial candidate for statewide office. Healey ran for governor or lieutenant governor a total of seven times. Running as an independent candidate in 2010, he won 39% of the vote for lieutenant governor, running on a platform of abolishing the office. As the Moderate Party nominee for governor in 2014, Healey won 22% of the vote while spending less than $40 on the campaign.
Early life, education and early career
Robert J. Healey was born in Providence, Rhode Island to Robert J. Healey Sr. and Mary (née Martinelli) Healey on May 3, 1957. His father was a plumber and his mother a factory worker. He grew up in Warren, Rhode Island, and graduated from Warren High School in 1975. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in English and Secondary Education from Rhode Island College, a master's degree in Reading Education from Boston University (1980), a degree in law from the New England School of Law (1983), and a master's degree in English literature from Northeastern University (1985). In 1983 he began a PhD program at Columbia University, but after he had completed all the requirements, his dissertation supervisor died and he could not find a replacement.
He was elected to the Warren School Committee in 1982, serving as chairman until 1986. His election slogan was "A Strange Man for a Strange Job". He ran for governor as an independent in 1986. After his first run for governor, He was also secretary of the Bristol County Bar association.
Cool Moose Party
The Cool Moose Party (CMP) was founded by Healey in 1994 during his second gubernatorial campaign. The party's platform is "to break down the ideological barriers that have kept common sense out of our government". Healey won 9% of the vote in 1994. In 1996, twenty CMP candidates ran for office; all were defeated.
In 1998, the Cool Moose Party successfully sued the state of Rhode Island to change its restrictive laws regarding primary elections. Cool Moose Party v. State of Rhode Island has been referenced in other states' court decisions relating to third-party candidates.
Healey ran for lieutenant governor in 2002, 2006, and 2010. In 2010 he ran on a platform of abolishing the office, as it has no constitutionally-mandated duties outside of waiting for the governor to become incapacitated. Running against incumbent Lieutenant Governor Elizabeth Roberts in that election, Healey won 39% of the vote after Republican Heidi Rogers dropped out so as not to split the "abolish the office" vote.
2014 gubernatorial campaign
In September 2014, Healey announced he was running for governor as a Moderate Party candidate. His announcement came after the original Moderate nominee, James Spooner, withdrew from the race for health reasons. Healey stated he would not accept any funding, instead opting for a "guerilla campaign" for a "cerebral revolution". Shortly after he filed his candidacy, the Rhode Island GOP challenged the legality of the move on procedural grounds. The state board of elections finds that Healey was in fact eligible to replace Spooner on the ballot. Healey spent a total of only $35.31 on his entire gubernatorial campaign, which he said went to purchase a prepaid mobile phone and a phone card, items he purchased himself. Healey's only advertisement during the campaign was a minimalist billboard featuring a caricature of his face, which he painted himself on the side of his friend's house overlooking Interstate 95 in Providence.
Healey came in third, with 21.4% of the election votes.
Other activities
Healey invested in several business ventures. A liquor wholesaling company that he founded with a partner was very successful and Healey sold out his stake and invested in land in South America. He also exported California wines to Uruguay, imported tableware from Uruguay, started an ice cream business, a wine and cheese outlet, and a yachting service. He wrote a children's book, The King Needs Sleep.
Healey served as secretary of the Bristol County Bar Association from the mid-1980s to the mid-2010s.
Death
Healey was found dead in his bed at his home in Barrington, Rhode Island before midnight on March 20, 2016. He is believed to have died from a heart attack in his sleep. He was 58 years old. He was buried on March 29 next to his parents at St. Alexander's Cemetery in Warren, Rhode Island.
Upon Healey's death, Rhode Island governor—and his 2014 gubernatorial opponent—Gina Raimondo issued a statement to the Providence Journal that she would "miss his passion and willingness to engage in spirited debate."

The Zona Rosa is an area in San Salvador, El Salvador.
San Benito suburb
It was created in 1946 with a design inspired by the European and North American Garden city movement.
In the early 1980s a process of commercialization of the area began, replacing the houses located on Boulevard del Hipódromo with restaurants and bars, and since then the area has been known by the name of Zona Rosa.

In 2010 remodeling and modernization work of Zona Rosa began which consisted of construction of a central flower bed that connected the traffic circles Italia and Brasilia, as well as planting palm trees, adding LED lighting, construction of access ramps for disabled people and the remodeling of the public squares. Surveillance cameras and police points were added as well.
This remodeling earned a recognition by the International Down Town Association as the first "Special Improvement District in Central America".
Hotels
The Zona Rosa has several hotels, both national and international chains, which include Villa Serena, Villa Florencia, Hotel Las Magnolias, Sheraton Presidente and Hilton Princess.
Bars, Restaurants y Cafes
The area also has several restaurants of fast and casual dining, clubs, bars and cafes. International brands include Papa John's Pizza, Domino's Pizza, Pizza Hut, McDonald's, Denny's, Tony Roma's, and others include La Pampa, Gourmet Burguer Company, Inka Grill, Maki Sushi, Shaw's, Crepe Lovers, Paradise, Green House, Antique Club, Republik, Zanzibar, Code, 503 Restaurant and Champagne Lounge, Marquee, Alive and many others.
Museums
In the area are two of the country's most important museums, which are the National Museum of Anthropology Dr. David J. Guzmán and the Art Museum of El Salvador.
Monument to the Revolution
The Monument to the Revolution is the area too. The construction began during the administration of Colonel Oscar Osorio to commemorate the uprising that ousted General Salvador Castaneda Castro from the power in 1948. It was completed in the administration of Colonel José María Lemus.
Embassies
The zone is also the home of several embassies:
Embassy of Brazil
Embassy of Spain
Embassy of Mexico
Embassy of Italy
Embassy of Uruguay
Embassy of Dominican Republic
Residential Area
The area also has many residences, some of which have been modified to become in restaurants or nightclubs, however, there are two towers complex with luxury apartments overlooking the entire area.
One residential tower is Alisios 115, a Groupo Bolívar Property. It is 96 meters high and consists of 26 floors of luxurious apartments. It is the third highest tower in El Salvador and the fourth in Central America excluding Panama. There are other towers as well, such as Torres 105 Campestre, Torre 525 Avenida La Capilla, Torre 515 Avenida La Capilla and Torre 370 Avenida La Capilla.
International Center of Fairs and Conventions (CIFCO)
The area also has an amphitheater with capacity for 15 thousand people, the Central American Hall, 12 multipurpose halls, a mall area and parking for up to 800 vehicles.

St John's Priory in Wells, Somerset, England, from the 14th century. Along with its boundary walls and railings it has been designated as a Grade I listed building.
The initial development was as a hospital for poor, aged and sick men by 1210. The original foundation was by Jocelin of Wells, after his consecration in 1204, along with his brother Hugh of Wells.
It was made into a priory in 1350 providing accommodation for a prior, chaplain and ten brothers, which lasted until the dissolution of the monasteries when it had an income of £40 per year. It then became crown property until 1575 when it was given to Sir Christopher Hatton and later became the property of Baron Brooke.
Land was donated to St John's in both 1667 and 1716.
The former priory building may also have been used as a guest house for visitors to Wells Cathedral and the Bishop's Palace. There was a cemetery associated with the building. The history of the buildings is set out in 33 deeds including one from 1738 which is displayed in the dining room.
The land surrounding the priory was disturbed and remaining archaeological remains destroyed around 1850 when new roads and a school were built on the site. This also involved demolition of some of the building. In the 1860s the building was owned by the Lovell family.
The two-storey stone building was an open hall but a first floor corridor and bedrooms have been added. The roof is supported by cruck trusses and purlins. Dendochronology has shown the wood used for the roof was felled in the winter of 1313 to 1314.

Hams Hall Power Station refers to a series of three, now demolished coal-fired power stations, situated in Warwickshire in the West Midlands of England, from Birmingham.
History
Hams Hall A
Following the death of Lord Norton in 1905, his estate was put up for sale in 1911. Part of the house was rebuilt near Cirencester, but the rest was demolished in 1920. Hams Hall Power Station was constructed by the municipally owned City of Birmingham Electricity Supply Department on the site in 1928. It was opened on 6 November 1929, equipped with two Fraser & Chalmers 30,000 kW turbo-alternators. The generating capacity of the site was progressively increased to 240,000 kW. The station burned approximately 774,000 tonnes of coal a year. At the time it was one of the largest power stations in Europe.
The station was also the first power station in the United Kingdom to burn pulverised coal, rather than lumps of coal. It was also used as a prototype site for the installation of gas turbines in coal-fired plants. Water for the station was cooled by six reinforced concrete hyperbolic cooling towers. At the time, these were the largest cooling towers ever built. The station had two tall chimneys.
In 1962 a 15 MW Bristol Siddeley Olympus aircraft gas turbine was commissioned. It was used to assess the suitability of aircraft gas turbine generators for meeting peak-load and emergency requirements. The installed capacity and electricity output is summarised in the table.
The station's closure was announced in 1975, following a fall in electricity consumption. By the time of its closure its generating capacity had fallen to 151 MW. The station's chimneys and cooling towers were demolished in 1978. A gas-turbine rated at 15 MW associated with the A station was operational in 1980.
During World War Two (WW") the station given its strategic value was guarded by the regular army till September 1942 (probably an anti-aircraft battery and a Home Guard company (formed from the staff; they also guarded Nechells power station) which remained on guard till being stood down on 1st October 1944. Before war was declared cables nearby were damaged by explosives - a rare example of possible sabotage. The Home Guard website records both power station sites were attacked (minus details).
Hams Hall B
The second station on the site, Hams Hall B Power Station, was planned in 1937. It began generating electricity in 1942. The station was expanded between 1946 and 1949. In 1947 the B station had the highest thermal efficiency of any plant in the UK. The station had a generating capacity of 160,500 kW. With its completion the two stations formed the greatest concentration of generating plant in Europe. Its water was cooled by four cooling towers. The station used Parsons turbo-alternators. These were supplied with steam from the Stirling (4) and Yarrow (4) boilers which delivered 450.0 kg/s of steam at 44.8 bar and 441 °C. In 1980/1 the station sent out just 575 MWh.
In December 1945 there was complaint about pollution from the station. This was caused by a corroded metal connection between the boilers and the chimneys. The pollution continued until 1948, when the connection was eventually replaced.
The combined Hams Hall "A" and "B" stations were nationalised on 1 April 1948 under the terms of the Electricity Act, 1947. The installed capacity and electricity output is summarised in the table.
The station closed on 26 October 1981 after 39 years of operation. It had a generating capacity of 306 MW at the time of its closure. Its four cooling towers were demolished in November 1985, with chimney number 2 going down in September 1988.
Hams Hall C
The third, final station to be constructed on the site was Hams Hall C Power Station, built in the 1950s and commissioned between 1956 and 1958. The station's water was cooled by three high natural draft cooling towers. It generated 357 MW of electricity using six generating sets each of 65 MW. The turbo-alternators were supplied with steam from the boilers which produced 788 kg/s of steam at 241.3/158.6 bar and 593/566 °C. In 1980/1 the station sent out 3,439.623 GWh, the thermal efficiency was 29.60 per cent.
In 1968, the station was under consideration to be converted to fuelled by natural gas, after a successful experimental trial of the fuel in one of the station's boilers earlier in the year. In October 1968 permission for the conversion was refused due to difficulties in the coal industry. Despite this, talk of conversion started again in 1970, and following discussion with the National Coal Board and the National Union of Mineworkers, permission was granted for the station to co-fire coal and natural gas. The installed capacity and electricity output is summarised in the table.
Following privatisation in 1990, the station was operated by Powergen. The C station closed in 1992. Its two chimneys and three cooling towers were demolished on 15 December 1993, under darkness.
Proposed D station
In 1968 the site was considered for a fourth power station. The CEGB made routine investigations into the feasibility of a D station, but nothing was ever built.
Post closure
After closure and demolition of the power stations an industrial estate was constructed on the site. Alfred McAlpine were involved in the construction work of the new estate. The site is still owned by E.ON, the current form of PowerGen, and known as Hams Hall Distribution Park.

Fernandina's flicker (Colaptes fernandinae) is a species of bird in the woodpecker family. Endemic to Cuba, its small population of 600–800 birds makes it one of the most endangered species of woodpecker in the world. Fernandina's flicker is threatened by habitat loss.
Description
Fernandina's flicker is a medium-sized woodpecker, ranging in length from 14–15 inches (33–35 cm). Overall, it is mostly yellowish-tan, covered with varying amounts of black barring; its underwings are yellow. The male has a black moustachial stripe, which the female lacks.
Distribution and habitat
Fernandina's flicker is endemic to Cuba. Though it was apparently never common, it was formerly found across the island. Now, however, it is restricted to isolated locations in nine of the country's 15 provinces: Camagüey, Cienfuegos, Granma, Holguín, Las Tunas, Matanzas, Pinar del Río, Santiago de Cuba, and Villa Clara. The largest population is found in Zapata Swamp, where some 120 pairs are estimated to live, though this number may have dropped following recent hurricanes.
The flicker's natural habitats include dry forests, dry savanna, swamps, and pastures.
Behavior
Though not a particularly social bird, Fernandina's flicker will sometimes form loose colonies of up to 15 pairs. It regularly fights with other woodpeckers.
Feeding
Like its congeners, Fernandina's flicker often forages—primarily for ants, but also for other insects, worms, grubs and seeds—on the ground. It uses its strong bill to probe the ground and flick aside leaf litter.
Breeding
Fernandina's flicker breeds between March and June; during courtship, pairs regularly engage in high-flying chases. Like all woodpeckers, it is a cavity nester. Recent fieldwork has shown that it prefers to use nest holes started by West Indian woodpeckers; the flicker usurps the original owners, finishes off the excavation work, and moves in. The female lays a clutch of three to five white eggs, which are incubated for a period of about 18 days. The young fledge after 22 days.
Voice
Though it is regularly silent, the flicker's calls include a repeated wicka (the onomatopoeic sound which gives the genus its common name), and a loud series of pic notes.
Conservation
With an estimated population of only 600–800 birds, Fernandina's flicker is one of the most endangered woodpeckers in the world. Overall, that population is declining, principally because of habitat loss. Farming, logging, hurricane damage and the caged bird trade—trappers bring down whole palm trees in order to capture nestling Cuban amazons (Amazona leucocephala leucocephala)—are combining to squeeze the remaining birds into smaller and smaller isolated tracts. In addition, West Indian woodpeckers have been observed killing the chicks of Fernandina's flickers.

The Winchester College War Cloister is a war memorial at Winchester College, in Hampshire, designed by the architect Sir Herbert Baker. The roofed quadrangle is said by Historic England to be the largest known private war memorial in Europe. It became a Grade II listed building in 1950, and was upgraded to Grade I in 2017, as one of 24 war memorials in England designed by Baker that were designated by Historic England as a national collection.
Background
The memorial was a project of the school's headmaster Montague Rendall, to commemorate the 500 Wykehamists killed in the First World War, at a time when the total number of boys at the school was around 450; a similar number of Wykehamists were wounded in the war, and around 900 were awarded decorations for gallantry. Around 2,500 former pupils, quiristers (choristers), and staff from the Winchester College served in the British armed forces in the war; four were awarded the Victoria Cross: Captain Arthur Kilby, Second Lieutenant Dennis Hewitt, and Lieutenant Colonel Charles Doughty-Wylie (all posthumously), and Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Burges (who was the only one of the four to survive the war).
The first proposal for a school memorial made as early as 1915. The initial suggestion for a memorial hall expanded over time to include proposals for a new suite of rooms around a cloister. Baker was engaged as the architect, and made initial suggestions in April 1918. The large project was abandoned in 1921 due to lack of funds, and the proposals were scaled back to comprise a new cloister, together with rebuilding the reredos and a new altar by W. D. Caröe for the school chapel, and funds to educate the sons of Wykehamists killed in the war. (Baker was also commissioned to design a memorial cloister for his own school, at Tonbridge, but the project was abandoned on grounds of cost.)
The new cloister was constructed to the southwest of the school's original medieval buildings – Outer Court, Chamber Court, and a cloister – which were erected in the 1390s by its founder William of Wykeham. A foundation stone for the new War Cloister was laid by Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon on 15 July 1922.
Cloister
The War Cloister was constructed from knapped flint and Portland stone ashlars. The cloister arcade is made of Portland stone, with round-headed arches supported by Tuscan columns. A crown-post oak structure supports a roof of Purbeck stone tiles. Badges from 120 regiments, in which men from the school served, decorate the walls, corbels and roof beams, to designs by George Kruger Gray which were painted by Laurence Arthur Turner. The roof also has carved wooden angels, and above the main arches over the paths that cross at the centre of the cloister are the badges from four regiments of particularly associated with the school: the Rifle Brigade, the King's Royal Rifle Corps, the Hampshire Regiment, and the Royal Artillery. There is an apse at each of the four corners of the cloister which are dedicated to: South Africa (southeast), Australia (southwest), Canada (northwest), and India (northeast). Each apse has a large circular stone floor slab: granite from Table Mountain in South Africa, syenite from New South Wales, marble from Texada Island in British Columbia, and black marble from Budh Gaya in India. Four small stones from Ypres set into the floor near the Meads Gate to the east. The names of those killed in the First World War are listed on the outer wall of the cloister, on tablets of Hopton Wood stone; each of the outer walls bears a pair of large tablets, eight in all, each comprising six smaller panels listing the names.
Within the cloister is a garden designed by Gertrude Jekyll, with roses and white lilies, and four grass lawns separated by paths leading to a central memorial cross made by the sculptor Alfred Turner, with a wheel-headed Latin cross supported by an octagonal shaft on an octagonal plinth with three steps. To either side of the cross is the carved figure of a crusader knight. Baker had proposed a similar design of wheel-headed memorial cross to the Imperial War Graves Commission (now Commonwealth War Graves Commission), but a different design by Sir Reginald Blomfield was selected instead: the Cross of Sacrifice familiar at many CWGC cemeteries.
The school's art master Reginald Gleadowe designed the main gate leading to the Meads to the east, which is decorated with angels blowing trumpets. Above the arch of the entrance is a carving of the school's patron, St Mary, by Charles Wheeler. The cloister is also accessible from Kingsgate Street to the west, through the South Africa Gate which commemorates the Wykehamists killed in the Second Boer War. The Victory Gate to the south leads to other school buildings. Gleadowe also designed the Lombardic script used for the main flushwork inscription running around the outer wall of the cloister.
Reception
The completed cloister was dedicated on 31 May 1924, at a ceremony attended by Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, the former Bishop of Winchester Edward Talbot, and Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon, who delivered an address. Winchester College OTC formed the guard of honour, with music from the band of the Coldstream Guards. Montague Rendall retired later that year. It became a school tradition for staff and pupils to raise their hats on entering the cloister, to recognise the school's war dead.
Baker's work at the War Cloister influenced his designs for the larger memorial at Tyne Cot, the largest cemetery for Commonwealth forces in the world for any war. Baker was responsible for the design of 113 cemeteries on the Western Front, including Tyne Cot, Delville Wood South African National Memorial and Neuve-Chapelle Indian Memorial. He was knighted in 1926.
A further 2,500 Wykehamists served in the Second World War, and the names of another 285 casualties from the Second World War are listed on the inner columns, on twelve panels grouped in six pairs. Opposite the Meads Gate, a bronze bust commemorates Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding. Cloister was re-dedicated on 14 November 1948 by the Bishop of Winchester Mervyn Haigh, with an address by Field Marshal Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell.

Rear-Admiral, Sir Henry Palmer (c. 1550 – 1611) was an English naval commander and Comptroller of the Navy.
Life
His family was from Tottington by Aylesford. He is first mentioned as commanding a squadron of the queen's ships on the coast of Flanders in 1576. From that time he was constantly employed in the queen's service. In 1580 and following years he was a commissioner for the repair and maintenance of Dover harbour. In 1587 he had command of a squadron before Dunkirk, and in 1588, in , commanded in the third post under Lord Henry Seymour in the "Narrow Seas", against the Spanish Armada. When this squadron joined the fleet under the lord admiral before Calais on 27 July, Palmer was sent to Dover to order out vessels suitable to be used for fireships. Before these could be sent, fireships, hastily improvised, drove the enemy from their anchorage, and Palmer, rejoining Seymour, took apart in the battle of Gravelines on the 29th. When Seymour, with the squadron of the Narrow Seas, was ordered back from the pursuit of the Spanish, Palmer returned with him, and continued with him and afterwards with the fleet till the end of the season. He remained in command of the winter guard on the coast of Flanders.
Through the next year he continued to command in the Narrow Seas, and in September convoyed the army across to Normandy. He was employed in similar service throughout the war, his squadron sometimes cruising to the coast of Cornwall, or to Ireland, but remaining for the most part in the Narrow Seas, and in 1596 blockading Calais. On 20 December 1598 he was appointed Comptroller of the Navy, in place of William Borough, and in 1600 had command of the defences of the River Thames. In 1601 he again commanded on the coast of Holland.
After the peace he continued in the office of comptroller at his office held at Chatham Dockyard overlooking the mast pools
till his death. He died on 20 November 1611 at Howlets in Bekesborne, an estate which he had bought.
Family
He was twice married: first to Jane, daughter of Edward Isaac, and widow of Nicholas Sidley; secondly, to Dorothy, née Scott, and widow of Thomas Hernden. By his first wife he had two sons, of whom the younger, Henry, succeeded his father as comptroller of the navy by a grant in reversion of 17 August 1611. Howlets are left to Palmer's stepson, Isaac Sidley, who made it over to his half-brother Henry. His other son was called Levin and little is known about his life
He was the executor of his close friend Sir John Hawkins and for this task he was bequeathed a diamond worth £20

Suvarnangi (pronounced , meaning the golden bodied one) is a rāgam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). It is the 47th melakarta rāgam in the 72 melakarta rāgam system of Carnatic music. It is called Souveeram or Sauviram in Muthuswami Dikshitar school of Carnatic music.
Structure and Lakshana
It is the 5th rāgam in the 8th chakra Vasu. The mnemonic name is Vasu-Ma. The mnemonic phrase is sa ra gi mi pa dhi nu. Its structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see swaras in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms):
:
:
Its swaras are shuddha rishabham, sadharana gandharam, prati madhyamam, chathusruthi dhaivatham and kakali nishadham. As it is a melakarta rāgam, by definition it is a sampoorna rāgam (has all seven notes in ascending and descending scale). It is the prati madhyamam equivalent of Kokilapriya, which is the 11th melakarta.
Janya rāgams
Suvarnangi has a few minor janya rāgams (derived scales) associated with it. See List of janya rāgams for full list of rāgams associated with Suvarnangi.
Compositions
A few compositions set to Suvarnangi rāgam are:
Sarasa souveera by Muthuswami Dikshitar
Iha para sukha by Koteeswara Iyer
Jaya Jaganmayi by Rukminibai Thampuratti
Sri raghupathim by Dr. M. Balamuralikrishna
Related rāgams
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
Suvarnangi's notes when shifted using Graha bhedam, yields no other melakarta rāgam. Graha bhedam is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the shadjam to the next note in the rāgam.

Quotes
"You must intensify and render continuous by repeatedly presenting with suggestive ideas and mental pictures of the feast of good things, and the flowing fountain, which awaits the successful achievement or attainment of the desires."
"The first principle of success is desire--knowing what you want. Desire is the planting of your seed. Very few persons, comparatively, know how to Desire with sufficient intensity. They do not know what it is to feel and manifest that intense, eager, longing, craving, insistent, demanding, ravenous Desire which is akin to the persistent, insistent, ardent, overwhelming desire of the drowning man for a breath of air; of the shipwrecked or desert-lost man for a drink of water; of the famished man for bread and meat… "
" Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out."

Politics
Montrose is a staunch Republican county. It has not been won by a Democratic Presidential nominee since Lyndon Johnson‘s 1964 landslide – indeed since then, no Democrat has managed forty percent of the county's vote. The county has leaned Republican ever since 1920; although before this, it did tend to vote Democratic between 1896 and 1916 except during the landslide loss of Alton B. Parker in 1904.
In other offices, Montrose also is strongly Republican. The last Democratic Senatorial candidate it backed was Ben “Nighthorse” Campbell, who was later to shift to the Republican Party, in the 1992 election, and since then no Democratic Senatorial candidate has passed forty percent either. Montrose County did back Constitution Party nominee Tom Tancredo in the 2010 gubernatorial election, and Bill Ritter did win 46 percent in 2006, but Roy Romer in 1990 remains the last Democratic candidate for governor to win Montrose County.

David George Hall (born 16 April 1980) is a New Zealand rugby union player. He predominantly played as a hooker. He comes from a rugby background being the grand nephew of former All Black and Southland legend Les George.
Early rugby career
Hall started his career as a loose forward before becoming a hooker in 2002. Hall gained his 50th cap playing for Southland against Tasman on 16 September 2006. He still occasionally plays Number 8 for the Stags due to Jason Rutledge having recently cemented the hooker role for both the Stags and for the Highlanders in Super Rugby.
It was announced Hall would play his 2012 NPC rugby for the Northland Taniwha at the opposite end of the country.
Knee reconstruction
He was forced out of the 2010 Super 14 season with a knee injury sustained in the 2009 Ranfurly Shield Win against Canterbury. His knee was later reconstructed and along with a shoulder operation the rehabilitation process was expected to take up to nine months.
Wrights Bush revival
During his long injury period Hall will attempt to help re-establish the Wrights Bush Rugby Club where he played most of his junior rugby. They will enter a senior team for the first time since 1995 and he is expected to assist with the coaching duties.
Later rugby career
Hall played in his last NPC game for Southland on 10 October 2015 in a 39–20 loss against Canterbury at AMI Stadium coming off the bench as a substitute. He will presumably retire from playing Rugby Union.

The National Christian Network was a religious television network in the United States which formed in 1979. The channel was founded by Ray A. Kassis and located in Cocoa, Florida, where it owned studios. The programming was originated from Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant groups; at the time of launch 54 separate groups had shown interest. The network was the fourth satellite-fed Christian network to be launched, and was a competitor to the Trinity Broadcasting Network, the PTL Satellite Network, and the Christian Broadcasting Network.
NCN shared the same satellite transponder with the Playboy channel. This caused a great deal of trouble for NCN, not because they shared the same transponder at different times of the day, but rather because NCN attempted to broker time on its channel to Christian programmers who were led to believe (falsely) that every cable company that was carrying Playboy was also carrying NCN. In fact most cable operators carried the Playboy feed only during the hours that Playboy was transmitting programming, and they blacked out the NCN portion.
Jerry Falwell acquired NCN in 1986, renaming it to the Liberty Broadcasting Network and moving its headquarters to Chesapeake, Virginia. At that time the network had an estimated 3 million viewers. LBN billed itself as the first "for profit inspirational network".
The Liberty Broadcasting Network was renamed to FamilyNet in June 1988, and at the same time became a for-profit entity. The network had lost about $3.2 million each year, and Falwell associate / former PTL manager Dr. Jerry Nims was brought in to head the new network.
FamilyNet was acquired by the Southern Baptist Radio and Television Commission in 1991. The SBC ran the network alongside its separately programmed American Christian Television System. In 1995 FamilyNet was available to 35 million homes through broadcast stations. The church sold FamilyNet to InTouch Ministries in 2007. In 2013, Rural Media Group purchased the network, converting the channel into the Western sports service The Cowboy Channel at the start of 2018.

Tavistock North was a railway station serving the town of Tavistock, operated by the Plymouth, Devonport and South Western Junction Railway, but forming part of the Exeter to Plymouth section of the London and South Western Railway.
The station opened on 2 June 1890. The main station building is Grade II listed and said to have been designed by Galbraith and Church who were the engineers for the line. The contractors were Pethick and Sons of Plymouth The granite came from Pethwick's Swell Tor quarry, the bricks from the Plymouth Brickworks at Gunnislake and the ironwork from Messrs Mathews and Co at Tavistock Ironworks.
The station was closed 6 May 1968. As it continued to be lived in by the former station-master and then his widow until 1999, the buildings have remained remarkably unaltered since its closure.
The station building has been restored and converted into three self-catering cottages. The stationmaster's house is being restored as a private dwelling, while the goods yard, now known as Kilworthy Park, houses the offices of West Devon Borough Council. The track bed for about south of Tavistock North station is open to the public as a footpath and nature reserve, and it is possible to walk across the viaducts that overlook the town.
The rest of the track bed south of Tavistock is almost intact to Bere Alston, where it joins the present-day Tamar Valley Line. There has been discussion regarding the re-opening of a rail link for a number of years. Engineering assessment has shown that the track bed, and structures such as bridges and tunnels, are in sound condition.

Sergei Vitalevich Mrachkovsky (Russian: Сергеий Витальевич Мрачковский; 15 June 1888 – 24 August 1936) was a Russian revolutionary, Red Army commander, and supporter of Leon Trotsky, who was executed at the start of the Great Purge.
Career
Mrachkovky was born in Tobolsk district, in Siberia, where his mother was a political exile. His grandfather was a founding member of Russia's first underground Marxist circles, the South Russian Workers' Union. His father, a locksmith, was also a revolutionary. After three years at a local school, Mrachkovsky was sent to a railway school in Chelyabinsk, then worked as a locksmith. Reportedly he was interested in anarchism and was in contact with criminals in his teens. He joined the Bolsheviks during the 1905 Revolution. Arrested in 1908, he was in prison until 1911, then returned to work as a locksmith.
After the February Revolution, Mrachkovsky was elected to the Yekaterinburg soviet (council) and the Ural Regional committee of the Bolshevik Party. In February 1918, at the start of the Russian Civil War, he was appointed a political commissar of the Red Army for the Yekaterinburg-Chelyabinsk front. In 1919, he led the Special Northern Expeditionary Detachment, which operated behind enemy lines, fighting against the White Army commanded by Admiral Kolchak. Their mission was to prevent the White army in Siberia from linking up with the British expeditionary force in the far north. He also commanded a division reputedly made up of army deserters and criminals released from prison by the revolution, who put down localised rebellions against Bolshevik rule with great severity. He was later political commissar of the 51st Rifle Division, commanded by Vasily Blyukher, and in 1920–22, was Red Army commander in West Siberia, where Ivan Smirnov was head of the regional communist party. In 1923–24, he was commander of the Volga Military District.
In 1923, Mrachkovsky supported Trotsky against the ruling triumvirate of Joseph Stalin, Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev in the power struggle that began while the Bolshevik leader, Vladimir Lenin was terminally ill. For this reason, he was prevented from continuing military service, and was appointed in charge of an industrial trust in Sverdlovsk. In 1926, when Zinoviev and Kamenev split with Stalin, Mrachkovsky warned against allying with either side. "We will not ally ourselves with anyone. Zinoviev would end by deserting us and Stalin would trick us." In September 1927, when the Politburo, which was controlled by Stalin, banned the publication of a political programme drawn up by the left opposition, Mrachkovsky arranged to have it printed illegally. The print shop was raided by the OGPU on 12 September, and Mrachkovsky was expelled from the Communist Party. In October, he was one of the first Trotskyists to be arrested and imprisoned. After three months in prison he was exiled to a village near Karaganda.
In 1929, Mrachkovsky submitted a statement to the Central Control Commission renouncing the opposition and in May 1930 he was readmitted to the Communist Party. In 1932, he was appointed head of construction for the Baikal–Amur Mainline. Unable to recruit a large workforce to complete the line, the Politburo decided to use convict labour, and put the OGPU in charge. Mrachkovsky remained head of construction, but with an OGPU officer, Nikolai Yeremin, as his deputy. In September 1933, he asked to be removed from this post, and was appointed to an economic post in Karaganda.
Arrest and death
Mrachkovsky was arrested on 25 January 1935, in the wake of the assassination of Sergei Kirov. He was reported to have been interrogated for ninety hours by NKVD officers led by under instruction to force him to confess to being a terrorist, with Stalin's office ringing up "every couple of hours" to find out if he had been broken. He boasted to his chief interrogator, Abram Slutsky that when he was taken before the Soviet premier, Vyacheslav Molotov, he spat in his face. Eventually, worn down by sleep deprivation, on 20 July he signed a confession implicating himself in the Kirov murder and in plots to assassinate Stalin and other leaders, on instruction from Trotsky. Once broken, he was made to confront Ivan Smirnov, who was refusing to co-operate, but did not succeed in breaking him.
As a defendant at the first of the Moscow Show Trials, in which Zinoviev and Kamenev were the main defendants, Mrachkovsky was the first to give evidence, on 19 August 1936, making the first Old Bolshevik to be heard publicly confessing to crimes the state. He was also the first to deliver a final statement, on 22 August, in which he declared "I depart as a traitor to my Party, as a traitor who should be shot."
Mrachkovsky was rehabilitated by a decree of the USSR Supreme Soviet in August 1988 after a commission appointed by the Politburo had acknowledged that there was no evidence against him or any of his co-defendants.

Reynolds Peak () is a prominent peak (785 m) rising 6 nautical miles (11 km) northwest of Eld Peak on the west side of Matusevich Glacier. Two conical peaks were sighted in the area from the Peacock on January 16, 1840, by Passed Midshipmen William Reynolds and Henry Eld of the United States Exploring Expedition (1838–42). The northwestern peak was named for Reynolds by USEE leader Lieutenant Charles Wilkes.
In 1959 Phillip Law of ANARE (Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions) made investigations of features in this area. Reference to Wilkes' narrative showed that the recorded descriptions of the peaks seen by Reynolds and Eld to be in accord with photographs of the peaks on the west side of Matusevich Glacier. The peak described was selected by Law to commemorate Wilkes' naming.

Corby Adams is a Canadian retired ice hockey Left Wing who was an All-American for Clarkson.
Career
Adams played several years of junior hockey in the Barrie area, reaching the top level of competition in 1960 with the Flyers. He accepted a scholarship to Clarkson and joined the varsity team in 1961, playing for Len Ceglarski, and helped the Golden Knights to a third-place finish in the inaugural season of ECAC Hockey. Adams was named First Team All-ECAC and helped the top-seeded Golden Knights reach the conference championship game. Their runner-up finish earned Clarkson a bid to the NCAA Tournament where the team defeated a Michigan team led by future NHLer Red Berenson. The victory sent Clarkson to its first championship game but the team was overwhelmed by Michigan Tech 1–8 in the finale.
For his second season, Adams led Clarkson in scoring and finished in the top ten in the nation. The Golden Knights finished second in the ECAC but were beaten in the conference semifinal by Harvard. The team finished the tournament in third place and weren't expecting to receive a bid to the NCAA tournament, however, because all Ivy League schools were engaged with a dispute over player eligibilities with the NCAA, Harvard declined its invitation and Clarkson was chosen as the replacement. The Golden Knights finished the 1963 NCAA Tournament in third place with Adams as one of the stars for Clarkson.
Prior to his senior season, Adams was named an alternate captain and, though the team's record declined the Golden Knights returned to the conference tournament. Adams made his third All-ECAC First Team and became an All-American as well. Clarkson fell in the conference semifinal again, this time to top-seeded Providence and Adams ended his collegiate career with a loss in the consolation game.
After graduating with a degree in business administration, Adams returned to Barrie and began playing for the local senior hockey team, also named the Barrie Flyers, when it was founded in 1966. Adams played for the Flyers for a decade, becoming the team's all-time leader in games (370), goals (213), assists (353) and points (566). He helped the team win the Allan Cup in 1974 as well as three other league championships in his ten seasons. Adams briefly left the team in 1970 to play with the Canadian national team but a series of decisions led Canada, who was initially supposed to host the 1970 Ice Hockey World Championships, to not even participate in the tournament.
After concluding his playing career in 1978, Adams was fondly remembered in both Barrie and Potsdam. He was inducted into the Barrie Sports Hall of Fame in 1991 and was a member of Clarkson's Inaugural Athletic Hall of Fame class in 1992. Several years later he was also enshrined in the Springwater Sports Heritage Hall of Fame.

Whitfield School, founded in 1952, is a private, non-sectarian preparatory school with more than 400 students in grades 6–12. The campus is in Creve Coeur, Missouri, a suburb of Saint Louis.
History
In 1952 John Barnes and Allen Cole purchased Dumford Academy, located on Bartmer Avenue, and renamed it Whitfield School.
During spring break of 1957, Barnes and Cole and the school moved into a residential house in Creve Coeur, some of which had been converted into classrooms. The house became the nucleus of the current campus; it now serves as administrative offices as well as a meeting and congregating facility, and has come to be named the "Barnes and Cole Alumni House."
The fourth head of school, Mary Leyhe Burke, raised money to build a new building on the land next to the house; this building was completed in the early 1990s. Whitfield then received major additions, as well as several renovations in the 1990s and 2000s.
In 2002, the school added new gymnasiums, locker rooms, a weight room with coaches' offices, a new dance studio and a new music studio. The project added backstage space for the theatre department, new computer commons areas, as well as a library, called the Intellectual Commons, in a former gym. It also added an atrium, visible from nearby Ladue Road, as an entrance to the Cady Athletic Center and Woods Hall.
The parking lot was expanded in 2008.
In 2022, work in the humanities wing turned an area informally known as Stonehenge into the Koman Commons, a large staircase designed for seating and out-of-classroom teaching nicknamed the Whit Pit. An outside terrace was also improved.
Academics
Students in grades 6-12 take required courses each year in the following departments: English, social studies, science, mathematics, and language. Fine arts requirements, including music, theater and visual art, change as students get older. Whitfield classrooms average 12 students per class, and the teacher-student ratio is 1:8.
Arts
Whitfield Performing Arts takes an experimental approach to the way that the main stage shows are executed. Whitfield School is part of the International Thespian Society and is chapter #5436. The school often employs professional costumers, lighting and sound technicians, and scenic designers.
Athletics
Three-quarters of Whitfield's high-school students participate in athletics. All students are guaranteed a spot on a high school team; coaches determine whether they play varsity or junior varsity. Playing time depends on an athlete's aptitude and effort. Students may also choose to participate as coaches' assistants, team managers, or videographers.
Whitfield School has had a consistently successful soccer team led by Coach Bill Daues and assistant coaches Mike Quante, Jeff Cacciatore, a former college and indoor soccer star, and Luke Cano. Since 2001, Whitfield's soccer team has won seven state championships; that's seven out of nine state championships in Missouri Class 1 soccer since there has been three classes. In 2009, Whitfield regained the title after beating Springfield Catholic 1–0 in the final. In 2010, The Warriors took on Springfield Catholic again, and again they won 1–0 with a goal from Nick Doherty. Notable rivalries for soccer are John Burroughs School, Westminster, Bayless, Springfield Catholic, and Pembroke Hill.
Whitfield's wrestling program operates under the direction of Coach Charlie Sherertz: a three-time honoree as Missouri wrestling coach of the year. The varsity wrestling team has won three state titles in five years (2008, 2009 and 2012). In 2012, five Whitfield Warriors earned individual state titles: Rodney Hahn '14, Will Hahn, '13, Ethan Sherertz '12. Austin Smith '12, and Chris Wilkes '13. A successful run between 2015 and 2018 yielded the Warriors another three team state titles, with individual wins from Michael McAteer '15, '16, '17, '18, Max Darrah, '16, '17, Sky Darrah '15, JR Ditter '15, '18, Connor McAteer '18, Logan Ferrero '18, Zac Russell '18, and Kurtis Hahn '16.
Whitfield School won its first Wickenheiser Cup in varsity hockey in March 2008. The previous year, Whitfield Hockey had lost to Priory 4–3 in the Wickenheiser Cup Final. In 2011, the Whitfield hockey team won the Founder's Cup by beating Parkway South High School 7–5, and Nick Kunin was named the MVP of the game. In 2012, the Warriors won their second Wickenheiser Cup Championship by defeating Lutheran High School South 6 to 5 in an exciting game that was tied through regulation and the 10-minute sudden death period. MVP senior Hunt Lucas scored the only goal in the shoot out, and junior goalie Alan Eidelman stopped all three chances to secure the win. Ryan MacInnis led the Warriors scoring with one goal and two assists. Whitfield Hockey is coached by former Blues player Jim Campbell.
Whitfield's varsity dance squad won the 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2015 state championship in the 1A division, and advanced to a national competition in 2008, where the team won first place in pom in the extra small division.
Whitfield's boys basketball team won the state championships in 2000. Two consecutive appearances in the state championship in 2009 and 2010 resulted in 2nd and 3rd places finishes, respectively.
Coached by Harold Barker, the varsity golf team won the 2010 and 2011 state championship. The team's 2011 campaign was highlighted by Mitch Rutledge who shot scores of 74 and 71 to capture medalist honors.
Publications
Whitfield has several publications, both traditional and innovative. All of the school's publications are extracurricular and student-run. Most publications are named after Greek works of literature.
The school's yearbook, The Iliad, is published annually and is designed by students with the help of a faculty advisor.
The school's newspaper, The Odyssey, used published monthly and was student-run and edited, with a faculty advisor. This paper contained articles featured articles about large-scale issues that affect society, movies and other forms of entertainment, and school-wide news and polls. The newspaper has been disbanded.
The school's online magazine, The Aeneid, offered more time-sensitive articles and addressed more urgent issues than the Odyssey. The publication was entirely student-edited and run. It has also been disbanded.
The school's literary magazine, previously know as The Secret Voice, is published once a year and contains works of art and literature, submitted throughout the course of the year by students and faculty. These anonymous submissions are reviewed by a selection committee which decides, based on several factors, what should be included in that year's edition. In 2022 it shifted towards a more virtual version called "Perceptions", where students art is showcased throughout the year virtually, rather than in a physical book.
Traditions
Whitfield's motto, "In Propria Persona," means "to one's own person." Whitfield also has the unofficial motto of "Be Kind and Do the Right Thing" is widely used to convey the moral philosophy of Whitfield.
Every year students adopt a family from the St. Patrick's Center and help them have a special holiday season. In the spring, Whitfield students hosts a Red Cross blood drive. In the spring, students collect can for Whitfield's canned food drive in order to help Operation Food Search.
Whitfield School has a school dog, a golden retriever named Sunshine. Sunshine visits numerous classes daily. Sunshine is Whitfield's fourth dog.

The Moama Historic Precinct is a heritage-listed abandoned settlement location, river wharf and public space on Hunt Street, Moama, New South Wales, Australia. It includes the Echuca - Moama Bridge and the Echuca Wharf on the Victorian side of the river. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.
History
Prior to European occupation, the Aboriginal inhabitants of the Echuca/Moama area were the Jodajoda. The Yorta Yorta was a language group, the members of which it occupied the area around Echuca to Cobram and south to Shepparton. They were alternatively known as the Bangarang (Bangerang). The present-day Aboriginal inhabitants of traditional Yorta Yorta land refer to themselves as the Yorta Yorta Nation.
Early European exploration in the Echuca/Moama region
The Murray and Campaspe rivers have been of major importance to the development of the Echuca-Moama region. The area came to the attention of European colonists in the late 1830s as pastoralists drove cattle and sheep inland along these major rivers in search of grazing land. In early 1838 Hawdon and Bonney passed through Echuca in the vicinity of present-day Radcliffe St, and provided some of the earliest descriptions of the land and Aboriginal inhabitants of Echuca before crossing the Campaspe south of present-day Rotary Park. Charles Sturt followed their route in mid-1838. By 1841, pastoral holdings had been established north along the Campaspe River to its junction with the Murray and on both sides of the Murray River.
1840s - 50s - Pastoralists. John Maiden and the development of Moama
The pastoral boom of the 1840s and early 50s required vast herds of sheep and cattle to be moved overland to markets. The Moama area became known as a desirable place to cross the Murray due to the slope of the riverbanks at this point, and the fact that it was the shortest distance to Melbourne from the Murray. In 1842, James Maiden and his wife were two of the first residents on the NSW side of the Murray, living at Perricoota Station, where Maiden was superintendent. Maiden took full advantage of the huge volume of traffic heading to meat and wool markets in Melbourne by establishing a settlement at present-day Moama.
In 1844 he built a punt across the Murray, soon replaced with a larger one in 1845, one mile east of present-day Moama. In 1846 he established the Junction Inn near his punt, providing accommodation, liquor and stabling for those waiting to cross the river. Maiden became rich from the volume of traffic as well as his cattle dealings. A small settlement, owned largely by Maiden, grew up around the river crossing. In 1846 a mail service to "Maiden's Punt" commenced; John Maiden was at this time punt owner, innkeeper, postmaster and cattle dealer.
In 1851 Maiden's Punt became known officially as Moama. The Bendigo gold rush in the early 1850s increased the demand for meat. Maiden established slaughter yards on Perricoota station, and by 1854, Moama was the largest cattle market outside Melbourne. James Maiden had become owner of Perricoota station and was regarded as a millionaire. However, in the mid 1850s the cattle market crashed, and James Maiden's fortunes (and Moama) entered a period of decline. In 1861 Maiden sold off all his holdings and left the area. The remains of the Junction Inn are located in Chanter St.
1850s - Hopwood and the development of Echuca
During the 1840s, Echuca did not exist. James Maiden held a monopoly over river crossings and his settlement in NSW in Moama. Henry Hopwood arrived near Moama in 1849. He attempted to establish a rival punt and various enterprises on the banks of the Murray but encountered such strong opposition from squatters that in 1852 he was "chased out" of NSW and moved to a pastoral holding across the river in Victoria.
With the Victorian goldfields creating demand for meat and transport, Hopwood competed directly with Maiden for a monopoly over river crossing trade, and was quoted as vowing to "put Moama in the Murray". He proceeded to establish a small settlement on the Victorian side of the river, known for a short time as "Hopwoods ferry" before being surveyed as Echuca in 1854. Between 1854 and 1857 Hopwood established a punt, inn, two stores, two smiths, a doctor and a bakery to cater for travellers and residents. As the cattle market crashed and the fortunes of Maiden and other squatters declined in NSW, Hopwoods influence in Victoria grew. In 1859 he built a pontoon bridge and the grand "Bridge Hotel" to garner the increasing coach traffic from Melbourne. Hopwood remained an influential figure until the development of other transport technologies.
1860s -1880s Echuca - transport, sawmilling and agriculture
The introduction of steamboats in 1853 and the completion of the Melbourne-Echuca railway line in 1864 saw Echuca became a major transport and sawmilling centre. Both steamers and railroads required wood in the form of fuel or sleepers, and so the logging of redgum forests surrounding Echuca-Moama also became a major source of employment. The settlement of Echuca spread to Echuca East, where most sawmilling was concentrated, and south along the major highways. There was also commercial and residential expansion along the railway line.
By 1872 the Port of Echuca was the centre of a trade network involving the transport of wool and other goods by steamer and then by train to markets. After this time, however, the spread of railway construction across Victoria eroded the commercial viability of river transport. In 1875 construction began on the iron rail and road bridge which crosses the Murray today. The Shinbone Alley settlement, home to many of the construction workers, flourished in the Banyule Forest east of the bridge. The bridge was complete in 1878, but remained unopened until the 1879 "Bridge Riot" when residents opened the bridge themselves. The steamer trade declined slowly from this time onwards.
Between 1877 and 1881 the profitable redgum sawmilling industry in Echuca declined drastically. In an attempt to regulate the massive deforestation of redgum forests, the Victorian government introduced a heavy tax on redgum in 1877. By 1878, 1000 people were unemployed in Echuca, and although the tax was repealed in 1881, most of the redgum trade had already been lost to mills in NSW which were not subject to the tax. This had a large impact on the settlements of Echuca East, which were closely tied to the sawmilling industry. In 1881 the Murray River Sawmills company was formed when several sawmillers banded together to keep their industry going. A sawmill still operates in Echuca today under the same name and on the same site. Logging of redgum has continued ever since although at substantially reduced levels.
The 1860s saw the establishment of market gardening as an industry in the Echuca - Moama area. The first Chinese market gardeners arrived in Echuca in 1865, and in 1887 there were 10 gardens supplying the Echuca area with fresh vegetables as well as growing tomatoes for the tomato processing industry. Land selectors also took up land to the south and west of Echuca during the 1870s.
Developments occurred more slowly across the river at Moama. In 1870 the settlement was completely inundated by a huge flood, and most of its 40 buildings were swept away. However the town was rebuilt, and the population increased around the settlement due to the subdivision of pastoral properties under Land Selection Acts, and the opening of the Deniliquin-Moama railway line in 1875.
1880s to World War 1
In 1881 the population of Echuca was 4789, and Moama 700. Both centres declined slightly over the next 3 decades as a result of economic and technological changes. In addition to the decline of the port and sawmilling industries, the economic depression of the 1890s reduced the volume of goods passing through Echuca. Established trades such as blacksmith, wheelwright, coachbuilder and saddler all declined in importance with increasing popularity of motorised transport after 1910. The loss of a large number of males from the population from 1914 onwards meant that the river transport and sawmilling industries would never be revived.
However, agriculture and dairying in the surrounding district took on greater importance with the subdivision of land for farm allotments. In 1894, Echuca Village was established under the Victorian government's Village Settlement Scheme, which was designed to ease poverty caused by the depression. Settlers were given the opportunity to acquire freehold land if conditions regarding payment and land usage were met. Despite individual failures, the village persisted and by the 1920s had become a productive farming area. In 1906 closer settlement schemes brought many small farmers to the districts south and west of Echuca. Chinese market gardeners continued to flourish in the area, and production of fruit and vegetables peaked in the period prior to WWI.
The interwar period - continued agricultural development
Echuca-Moama began to revive economically in the 1920s after returned soldiers arrived to take up farming or open businesses. Dairying continued to develop south and west of Echuca. The population north-west of Moama increased with the opening of a railway line to Balranald. Echuca remained a commercial centre throughout the depression of the 1930s, when rabbiting became a major source of support for many families. Market gardening was continued by Spanish immigrants and a few remaining Chinese gardeners, despite the White Australia Policy that resulted in a decline in the number of Chinese immigrants permitted to enter Australia.
Post World War 2 - manufacturing and tourism
During World War II Echuca East was revived economically with the construction of an ordnance factory and housing for workers. This continued post WW2 when the factory was bought by the United Bearing Corporation. After WW2, returned soldiers again boosted the economy through house construction, establishing businesses or farms. Agricultural and dairy industries continued to support a flour mill, butter factory and tomato processing plant.
The Port of Echuca wharf was partly demolished in 1944, but with increasing development and modernisation away from the old Echuca district in the 1950s and 1960s, some residents developed an appreciation of Echuca's history. Plans to restore the Port of Echuca were developed in the 1960s and completed in 1974. From the mid-1970s to the present, tourism has become a major industry in Echuca-Moama. The restoration of steamboats as part of the tourism industry continued in Echuca, and in Moama landscape and restoration works were undertaken at Horseshoe Lagoon and the wharf. The economic boom of the 1980s saw continued building and commercial developments in both Echuca and Moama.
Description
The Moama Historic Precinct includes the Echuca Road/Rail bridge and the Echuca Wharf facing it downstream. The area was once the site of Chinese market gardens, houses, a saw mill, a thriving ship building business and one of the busiest boat slips on the Murray River.
The land is now open red gum forest with minimal use, but there are still remains of the boat slip and associated machinery and the hulks of two large river barges lie nearby.
Heritage listing
Moama Historic Precinct was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.
The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.
The Moama Historic precinct, including the Echuca Rail/Road bridge and the Echuca Wharf demonstrates pivotal technological changes in the transportation of Australia's produce.

The 654th Tank Destroyer Battalion codename: Highroad was a tank destroyer battalion of the United States Army active during the Second World War. They landed at Omaha Beach on July 11, 1944. The Battalion was activated on 15 December 1941 at Fort Benning, Georgia.
History
The battalion was activated on 15 December 1941 at Fort Benning, Georgia, from personnel of the 4th Provisional Antitank Battalion, 4th Motorized Division (cadre from the 3rd Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment, and 4th Motorized Division Artillery). It was sent to England and equipped with the M10 tank destroyer. The 654th landed at Omaha Beach on 11 July 1944 to fight in the Normandy campaign and was sent into combat on the next day near Fallot. In August, it fought near Mortain during Operation Cobra, the Allied breakout from Normandy. It then advanced across France towards Nancy, fighting along the Siegfried Line and crossing the Saar River in early December. After the German counteroffensive in the Battle of the Bulge began, the battalion was deployed to the Ardennes sector on 21 December. In January 1945, after the counterattack was repulsed, the 654th moved back south to the Metz area. It returned to Belgium in February to receive the upgunned M36 tank destroyer. The battalion was sent back into combat in the Western Allied invasion of Germany, fighting in the offensive across the Roer River and crossing the Rhine on 24 March. It advanced into Germany to Tangerhütte, where it remained until assuming military government duties in early May after the German surrender. In Europe, the battalion was attached to the 5th Infantry Division, the 30th Infantry Division, the 35th Infantry Division, and the 75th Infantry Division. Returning to the United States, the battalion was inactivated at Camp Patrick Henry, Virginia, on 13 November 1945.

Alliance of International Doctors (AID, Uluslararası Doktorlar Derneği in Turkish) is an organization established by a group of volunteer doctors, pharmacists, dentists, and nurses in Istanbul in 2011. AID provides medical assistance to the people in the regions affected by disasters and poverty. The president of the organization is Dr. Mevlit Yurtseven.
Activities
Emergency medical relief
AID delivers medicine and hygiene items and deploys medical teams to the regions affected by natural disasters, war and violence. AID medical teams provided primary health care to the 2015 earthquake victims in Nepal. AID worked in the Philippines following Typhoon Haiyan as well as in the camps for internally displaced persons in Arakan, Myanmar, in 2013. AID sent a surgical team to Gaza during the attack in 2012. AID has been conducting health screenings, hygiene kit distribution and vaccinations for the Syrians affected by the Syrian Civil War. AID provided primary health care to the Syrian refugees from Kobane following the mass influx in September 2014.
Permanent and preventive health services
AID provided primary health care to Somali refugees in Kenya's Dadaab Refugee Camp between August 2011 and July 2012. AID volunteers implemented mosquito net distribution projects in Kenya and Uganda for malaria prevention, and established a mother-and-child health center in Uganda. AID carried out circumcision projects in some of the Balkan countries, Tunisia, and Bangladesh for orphans and underprivileged children.
AID collaborates with IHH, the Islamic Development Bank, Turkish International Cooperation and Development Agency, and Niger Ministry of Health for a cataract project in Niamey, Niger. An ophthalmology department has been established at Lamorde Hospital of Abdou Moumouni University for the project, which targets to perform 30,000 free-of-charge cataract surgeries in five years and to transfer skills to the local personnel. AID is responsible for the human resources and for providing and maintaining the medical equipment and consumables. AID will collaborate with other organizations working on prevention of blindness during the project. The department will be handed over to the Niger authorities in 2019.
Health Education
AID is providing health education services in coordination with local organizations in different regions.
Psychological Rehabilitation
AID conducts psychological support programs to help the victims of natural disasters and wars as well as orphans and their families cope with the trauma and the loss they had experienced, and to reduce the negative impacts of these experiences on them. AID is providing psychosocial support to Syrian refugee women and children in Istanbul including psychotherapy since 2014.

Romy Golan is an American art historian and professor in the Ph.D. program in art history at The Graduate from Center, CUNY. Her research focuses on modern European art, particularly French and Italian painting of the interwar and postwar period.
Education and career
Golan completed her Ph.D. at the Courtauld Institute of Art, London in 1989. Before joining the faculty of The Graduate from Center in 1998, Golan taught at Vassar College (1987–2002) and Yale University (1993–1998).
Golan's first book, Modernity and Nostalgia: Art and Politics in France between the Wars (1995) posits a number of reversals between avant-garde and rearguard. In a challenge to traditional scholarship on interwar France, Golan argued that neo-traditional belle peinture and modernist painting, cosmopolitanism and xenophobia, in fact often shared the same stage.
In Muralnomad: The Paradox of Wall Painting, Europe 1927-1957 (2009), Golan explored the transmediality of the mural image. The book looks at mural paintings, including works by Claude Monet, Mario Sironi, and Pablo Picasso, that were not truly convinced that they belonged on walls. Installed in unorthodox manners, these public works manifested an ambivalence about their charged ideological identity.
Her most recent book is Flashback, Eclipse. The Political Imaginary of Italian Art in the 1960s (Zone Books, 2021). Structured by two forms of non-linear and decidedly non-presentist forms of temporality, the flashback and the eclipse, this book argues that Italian art of the 1960s reimagined Italian (and European) history, but in oblique form. The reimagining occurred as modernism in the country was formerly aligned with Italian fascism.
Golan's curatorial work includes Encounters with the 1930s at the Museo Reina Sofia in 2012 and Avigdor Stematsky's Late Works at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in 2008. She has also contributed catalogue essays to exhibitions including Le Paris de Dufy at the Musée de Montmartre in 2021, Charlotte Perriand: Inventing a New World at the Fondation Louis Vuitton, Paris in 2019, and Postwar: Art between the Pacific and the Atlantic, 1945–1965 at the Haus der Kunst, Munich in 2016.

Margaret B. Freeman (1899 – 24 May 1980) was an American art historian who was the head curator of The Cloisters, a branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art dedicated to medieval art and architecture, from 1955 to 1965. She studied medieval tapestries as well as the use of plants in medieval art.
Early life and education
Margaret Beam Freeman was born in 1899 in West Orange, New Jersey. She attended Wellesley College before receiving her master's degree from Columbia University.
Career
After receiving her master's degree, Freeman worked as a research assistant at The Newark Museum of Art. After parting with the museum in 1925, she taught at Dana Hall School in Wellesley, Massachusetts. In 1928, Freeman was hired as the first lecturer at the original site for The Cloisters, a branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she gave lectures on Egyptian and medieval art. While researching the history and symbolism of medieval plants, Freeman aided James J. Rorimer in planning the gardens at the museum's permanent building, which opened in 1938. Her research on the Cloisters' medieval gardens culminated in the publishing of Herbs for the Mediaeval Household (1943), a book on early medieval illustrations of plants within the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collections.
In 1940, Freeman became an assistant curator at The Cloisters, then was promoted again to associate curator after Rorimer was called to serve in World War II. From 1943 until Rorimer's return, Freeman acted as head curator of The Cloisters, a position she would attain in 1955 after Rorimer became director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She retired in 1965, but remained associated with the Cloisters as a curator emeritus until her death.
Following her retirement, Freeman published two books on textiles exhibited at the Cloisters. The first book, The St. Martin Embroideries (1968), analyzed a series of embroideries illustrating the life of Martin of Tours, a French saint who served in the Roman military before converting to Christianity and becoming a monk. The second book, The Unicorn Tapestries (1976), analyzed The Hunt of the Unicorn, a series of seven tapestries illustrating a group of noblemen in pursuit of a unicorn.

The 1972–73 Northern Rugby Football League season was the 78th season of rugby league football played in England. It would also be the last season whereby the British championship was decided by a play-off system until Super League III in 1998. Dewsbury were crowned champions after defeating Leeds in the Final. The 1972–73 season was also punctuated by the 1972 Rugby League World Cup which was played in France in October and November. At the end of this season the league re-formed into two divisions. The top 16 in the championship would form Division 1 and the bottom 14 Division 2.
Rule changes
Number of tackles:
The four-tackle rule was altered and a new limit of six tackles was introduced. The four-tackle rules had been blamed for making the game seem "disjointed". A scrum was formed at the end of a completed set of the tackles.
Timekeeping:
Timekeepers were given responsibility, rather than referees, for controlling time in matches. They signalled using a hooter siren system.
Season summary
Salford's David Watkins set the record for most goals (including drop goals) in a season with 221. Also, on 19 August 1972, Watkins started his record scoring streak which lasted until 25 April 1974. He totalled 929 points from 41 tries and 403 goals in 92 consecutive matches for one club.
1972-73 also saw the Wigan club celebrate its centenary, having been formed as Wigan F.C. on 21 November 1872. During the season they played a special Centenary Celebration match against an "Australians" side.
Challenge Cup Winners: Featherstone Rovers (33-14 v Bradford Northern)

Final
The 1973 Final was to be the last time a play-off system would be used to determine the British champions until 1998's Super League season. The match was played on 19 May 1973 at Bradford's Odsal Stadium between the previous season's champions, Leeds and first-time finalists, Dewsbury. Dewsbury had suffered a county cup record defeat 36–9 at the hands of Leeds in the Yorkshire County Cup Final earlier in the season. Also Leeds had finished 3rd on the ladder and Dewsbury 8th. However, Dewsbury opened up a 12–4 lead by the interval with tries by the hooker Mike Stephenson and Allan Agar and two goals and a drop-goal from the boot of centre Nigel Stephenson. Leeds captain Alan Hardisty was sent off for the first time in his career for a high tackle on John Bates.
A second try from Mike Stephenson on 44 minutes extended Dewsbury's lead and though Leeds hit back with tries by Graham Eccles, Phil Cookson and Les Dyl, it was not to be with Nigel Stephenson converting his own try to complete a resounding 22-13 success. Leading journalist Jack Winstanley wrote at the time: "Dewsbury's win sprung from a superb team effort that paid ample tribute to the coaching and inspiration of (coach) Tommy Smales. They bewildered a jaded Leeds outfit with a series of scissors moves and dummy passes that might have looked grossly over-elaborate had they not worked to such perfection." The Harry Sunderland Trophy for man-of-the-match went to Mike Stephenson. Greg Ashcroft, Jeff Grayshon and Alan Bates also played in the champion Dewsbury side.
Challenge Cup
The 1973 Challenge Cup Final was won by Featherstone Rovers who beat Bradford Northern 33–14 at Wembley Saturday 12 May 1973 before a crowd of 72,395. Featherstone Rovers' Great Britain scrum half-back, Steve Nash put in a man-of-the-match performance to win the Lance Todd Trophy. Cyril Kellett scored 8-conversions for Featherstone Rovers, the most in a Challenge Cup Final (equalled by Iestyn Harris in 1999).
League Cup
This was the second season of the League Cup, which was known as the Players No.6 Trophy for sponsorship reasons. Leeds won the trophy by beating Salford 12-7 in the final. The match was played at Fartown, Huddersfield. The attendance was 10,102 and receipts were £4563.

Walter Raleigh Willock Gilbert, known as Raleigh Gilbert (28 February 1936 – c. February 1998) was a British horse racing commentator active for 40 years.
Early life
Born in Devon and educated at Sherborne School, Gilbert rode as an amateur while living in Kenya in the mid-1950s, and began his journalistic career as racing correspondent for the East African Field and Farm in 1956 before returning to Britain and writing for the Sunday Post in Scotland.
Commentary career
Gilbert began his career as a racecourse commentator in 1958, and eventually became the first person to commentate at every racecourse in the UK.
In the early 1970s he worked briefly for the BBC, commentating on the 1971 Grand National for BBC Television, but the dominance of Peter O'Sullevan and Julian Wilson on TV and Peter Bromley and Michael Seth-Smith on radio blocked his way, and in January 1972 he joined ITV as a commentator. From that year until the end of 1980 he was one of the commercial channel's two main commentators, along with John Penney - both were heard almost every Saturday on The ITV Seven (part of World of Sport) because ITV habitually covered two meetings every week. Although he never covered The Derby or Oaks for ITV (these were always the province of Penney), he commentated on many other major races, including the 1,000 Guineas, 2,000 Guineas, St. Leger, Irish Derby, Irish Oaks and Eclipse Stakes.
He also covered greyhound racing and polo for ITV, and continued to give racecourse commentaries on meetings not covered by ITV, such as Royal Ascot and the Cheltenham Festival. In common with a number of other racecallers, he provided radio voice-overs and mock commentaries for fictional television series.
From the beginning of 1981 onwards, Graham Goode became ITV's number one commentator, and Gilbert now covered fewer major races. His TV work declined further when the number of meetings covered by commercial television declined considerably from January 1986 onwards, but he was still heard quite often on ITV and later Channel 4 through the late 1980s and early 1990s, often commentating on the earlier stages of major races at Newmarket where two commentators were deemed necessary. His course commentaries continued, and he was a founder commentator with SIS in 1987, covering the Chester Cup on the day the service (which provided betting shops with live pictures of races) began. His final broadcast on Channel 4 was in January 1996 - at the end of his involvement with the channel he was only used as a betting and results reader.
However, he continued as a racecourse commentator (also heard on SIS and The Racing Channel) though he was due to soon retire at the time of his death. A week before he was found dead in his flat in London, he had missed a commentating assignment (at Wolverhampton on 21 February) for the first time in his career.

Thomas Day Thacher (September 10, 1881 – November 12, 1950) was a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the 21st Solicitor General of the United States and a Judge of the New York Court of Appeals.
Education and career
Born on September 10, 1881, in Tenafly, New Jersey, Thacher was the son of Thomas Thacher, a prominent New York City, New York attorney. He attended the Taft School and Phillips Academy, both in Andover, Connecticut. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1904 from Yale University where he was a member of Skull and Bones, and after attending Yale Law School, read law in 1906. He entered private practice in New York City from 1906 to 1907, with his father's law firm of Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett. Thacher remained with the firm and was made a partner in 1914. He was an Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1907 to 1910. While in this position, Thacher was recognized for his work in prosecuting customs fraud. He returned to private practice in New York City from 1910 to 1917. In 1911 he helped found the New York Young Republican Club. He was a Major for the American Red Cross Commission to Russia from 1917 to 1918. He again returned to private practice in New York City from 1918 to 1925.
Federal judicial service
Thacher was nominated by President Calvin Coolidge on January 9, 1925, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York vacated by Judge Learned Hand. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on January 19, 1925, and received his commission on January 21, 1925. His service terminated on April 10, 1930, due to his resignation.
Accomplishments while judge
Thacher was instrumental in investigating the operation of the bankruptcy laws in New York City. His reports to President Herbert Hoover were the basis for amendments to the law that extended the control of the courts over bankruptcy proceedings and speeded up the settlement process, thereby reducing any opportunities for abuses.
Later career
Thacher served as the 21st Solicitor General of the United States from March 1930 to May 1933. He returned to private practice in New York City from 1933 to 1943. He helped create the movement that made possible the election of Fiorello H. La Guardia as Mayor of New York City. La Guardia appointed Thacher to serve as the leader on the commission to write a new city charter and to the city's Corporation Counsel in 1943. He was a Judge of the New York Court of Appeals from 1943 to 1948, appointed to that post by Governor of New York Thomas E. Dewey.
Other service and family
Thacher served as a fellow of the Yale Corporation from 1931 to 1949, President of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York from 1933 to 1935, and was a member of numerous social clubs. He first married Eunice Booth Burall, and had three children. After Eunice's death in 1943, Thacher married Eleanor M. Lloyd on July 20, 1945.
Death
Thacher died of a coronary thrombosis on November 12, 1950, at his home in New York City. He was interred in Brookside Cemetery in Englewood, New Jersey.

She studied at the Alfajiri Jesuit School and later graduated with a degree in International Relations from the Université officielle de Bukavu (fr). From a young age, Namwezi knew that she wanted to be a journalist, but she was told by many people that it was not a job for women – gender discrimination is rife in the DRC. However she was determined and she began producing radio programs at the age of 16 when she joined the Association des Femmes des Media du Sud Kivu (AFEM) of the Democratic Republic of Congo. At the time, the DRC was at war and Namwezi reported stories of former child soldiers and mass rape. After 10 years with the AFEM, she was promoted to coordinator.

The Australian TV Guide was the first online television schedule guide published in Australia, and one of the first online electronic program guides in the world.
Created in 1994 by Professor Lesley Goldschlager of Monash University and his internet company Sofcom, a pioneering producer of online content in Australia in the 1990s, the Australian TV Guide was the first publication in Australia to provide internet users with a local and searchable online television guide.
It was initially supported by all major Australian television networks, except for the Seven Network, which came on board in later years. The first guides produced only covered the major capital cities of Australia. In November 1999, Sofcom introduced schedules for regional Australia.
The Australian TV Guide was supported by online advertising and syndication of its listings, providing content to portal sites such as Yahoo!, Bigpond and Looksmart.
In 2003, the Australian TV Guide was acquired by eBroadcast Pty Limited and later syndicated to other television sites such as OurGuide and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. It also introduced pay TV listings into its program guide, including daily schedules for Foxtel, Fetch TV and TransACT.
In 2014 eBroadcast Pty Limited expanded into the United States and later into Canada and the United Kingdom with a spin-off site called On TV Tonight, producing electronic program guides for international channels and audiences outside of Australia.

Heart's Cry () was a Japanese Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. In a racing career which lasted from January 2004 until November 2006 he ran nineteen times and won five races. In his first two seasons he was placed in many important races including the Tokyo Yushun, Takarazuka Kinen and Japan Cup before recording a 16/1 upset victory over the Japanese Horse of the Year Deep Impact in the Arima Kinen at Nakayama Racecourse in December 2005. In the following year Heart's Cry proved himself in international competition when winning the Dubai Sheema Classic in the United Arab Emirates and finishing third in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in Britain. After his retirement from racing he became a successful breeding stallion.
Background
Heart's Cry is a bay horse with a narrow white blaze and a white sock on his left hind leg, bred by the Yoshida family's Shadai Farm. He was sired by Sunday Silence, who won the 1989 Kentucky Derby, before retiring to stud in Japan where he was champion sire on thirteen consecutive occasions. His dam Irish Dance was a successful racemare who won twice at Group Three level. The horse was named after a number from the show Riverdance.
Racing career
2004: three-year-old season
Heart's Cry began his racing career by winning a ten furlong race at Kyoto Racecourse on 5 January 2004. A month later he was moved up to Group Three level and finished third in the Kisaragi Sho at the same course. He then won a ten furlong race at Hanshin Racecourse before finishing unplaced in the Satsuki Sho, the first leg of the Japanese Triple Crown. In May Heart's Cry won his first important race when he took the Group Two Kyoto Shimbun Hai, a trial race for the Tokyo Yushun (Japanese Derby), beating Suzuka Mambo by half a length. In the Tokyo Yushun four weeks later, Heart's Cry finished second of the eighteen runners, one and a half lengths behind the winner King Kamehameha.
Heart's Cry returned after a summer break to finish third to King Kamehama in the Kobe Shimbun Hai, but then finished unplaced in the Kikuka Sho (Japanese St Leger), Japan Cup and Arima Kinen.
2005: four-year-old season
In his first five starts as a four-year-old, Heart's Cry ran well without winning. In Spring he finished second in the Group Two Osaka Hai and then ran fifth of the eighteen runners behind Suzuka Mambo in the two mile Tenno Sho. In June he finished strongly to take second place, a neck behind Sweep Tosho in the Takarazuka Kinen, beating major winners such as Zenno Rob Roy and Tap Dance City. He was then off the course for more than four months.
Heart's Cry returned in October to finish sixth in the Autumn Tenno Sho, in which he was ridden for the first time by Christophe Lemaire, before running in the Japan Cup a month later. Held up in the early stages, he was still fourteenth of the eighteen runners turning into the straight but then finished strongly and failed by a nose to catch the British runner Alkaased who won in a record time of 2:22.1. The beaten runners included Zenno Rob Roy, Ouija Board, Warrsan, Bago and Better Talk Now. On 25 December, Heart's Cry was one of sixteen runners invited to contest the Arima Kinen. The colt had gone ten races and nineteen months since his last win and started at odds of 16.1/1 while the undefeated three-year-old champion Deep Impact was made the 3/10 favourite. Lemaire rode the horse close to the lead before moving to the front in the straight and holding off the late challenge of Deep Impact to win by half a length.
2006: five-year-old season
In 2006, Heart's Cry was campaigned internationally. In March he was sent to Dubai to contest the Dubai Sheema Classic at Nad Al Sheba. Ridden by Lemaire he contested the lead from the start, tactics which surprised his trainer Kojiro Hashiguchi. He went clear of the field in the straight and won by four and a quarter length from Collier Hill with the multiple Group One winners Ouija Board and Alexander Goldrun in fourth and fifth. In the August 2006 edition of the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings, Heart's Cry was ranked the equal second best horse in the world, a pound behind Makybe Diva and equal with Electrocutionist and David Junior.
Four months after his run in Dubai, Heart's Cry appeared at Ascot Racecourse in England for Britain's most prestigious all-aged race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. Lemaire claimed to be full of confidence before the race and Heart's Cry's participation attracted a large Japanese media contingent. Starting the 3/1 second favourite, he took the lead in the straight but was overtaken in the final furlong and finished third behind Hurricane Run and Electrocutionist. After his race at Ascot, Heart's Cry did not run again until the Japan Cup on 29 November. He started the 5.8/1 second favourite but ran disappointingly, finishing tenth of the eleven runners behind Deep Impact. After the race the Japan Racing Association announced that the horse had developed breathing problems which may have affected his performance, and his retirement was announced in early December.
Stud record
Heart's Cry was retired to become a stallion at his owners' Shadai Stallion Station on Hokkaido. He sired 35 individual groups or graded race winners, ten of them at the highest level. He was retired from stud duties in 2021 at the age of 20.

Football Club Dilettante Lottogiaveno (formerly Football Club Giaveno) is an Italian association football club located in Giaveno, Piedmont. It currently plays in Serie D. Its colors are red and blue.
History
The club was founded in 1968 with the name of U.S. Giaveno. Giaveno spent a long time in the regional Piedmont leagues, and wouldn't gain promotion from the Terza Categoria until the 1980s. When the team finally promoted, they succeeded in a double promotion, gaining promotion to the Prima Categoria.
In 1986 the football club merged with U.S. Coazze, giving the club a new name; A.C. Giaveno Coazze. The small club succeeded to conquer the championship of Prima Categoria at the first attempt, they went on to win the Promozione in order to pass into the hunt for the Eccellenza championship. Giaveno achieved Eccellenza victory the following season.
Giaveno first competed in Serie D during the 1989–90 season, and the successive season finished at sixth place in the championship. The following season the club were not as fortunate and were relegated; they only gained promotion back to Serie D during the 2002–03 season when they also changed denomination to F.C. Giaveno.
In 2007, after a sponsorship deal with Lotto Sport Italia, the club changed denomination to F.C.D. Lottogiaveno.
