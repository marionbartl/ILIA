Ames, Iowa -- Drawing hundreds of backers two days before Iowa begins the presidential nominating process, Ted Cruz made an appeal Saturday to Republicans as someone who has consistently stood for conservative principles.
The U.S. senator from Texas joked that he'd been told he couldn't win because elites in Washington, D.C. despise him.
“I kind of thought that was the whole point of the campaign,” he told the crowd packing a large ballroom at the Gateway Hotel.
“If you think Washington is fundamentally broken, that there is bipartisan corruption … (stopping) that is what this campaign is all about,” he said.
Cruz is second behind real estate mogul Donald Trump in Iowa, according to a polling average calculated by RealClearPolitics.com. The site lists Trump with 31.4%, Cruz with 24.8% and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida with 14.4%.
Monday's caucus will decide who has the momentum heading into New Hampshire, which holds the first primary in the country a week later. Candidates from both parties have flooded Iowa for a final weekend of campaigning here.
Hundreds lined up to attend the Cruz event, waiting by tables filled with campaign shirts, pocket copies of the U.S. Constitution and a Cruz coloring and activity book for children.
As he's waged his anti-Washington campaign, Cruz has won backing from prominent conservatives. He was introduced Saturday by radio host Glenn Beck, U.S. Rep. Steve King of Iowa and Bob Vander Plaats, the chief executive officer of Iowa's influential Family Leader.
Beck said he hadn't endorsed anyone before, but decided to publicly back Cruz after he'd proved himself.
“He has done everything that he said he would,” Beck said.
Cruz promised on his first day in office he would rescind “illegal and unconstitutional” executive orders issued by President Barack Obama; open a criminal investigation of Planned Parenthood; end attacks on religious liberty; cancel the Iran nuclear deal; and begin moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
David Johnson of nearby Ankeny came out for Cruz because Cruz has stuck by his guns. He plans to support him in Monday's caucus.
“He stood up for limited-government conservative principles from day one of him getting in the door,” Johnson said.

Smiley Smiley can now be seen as a cast in Gothenburg, Sweden (2011) Species Alligator mississippiensis (American alligator) Sex Female
Smiley (Swedish: Smilet) was an American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) that lived in captivity in the Maritime Museum of Gothenburg, Sweden.[1] Smiley arrived in Gothenburg from the United States in 1924, at approximately the age of two, and died on 9 February 1987.[1][2] She received the name "Smiley" in 1970 when the newspaper Expressen asked readers for appropriate names for the alligator. At the time of her death at the age of 65, she held the record of being the oldest living alligator in captivity, an honor that landed her a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records.[1] (There are, however, records of alligators that have lived longer since her death). At the time of her death Smiley weighed 75 kilograms (165 lb) and measured 265 centimetres (8.69 ft), which is small for North American alligators (males can grow to a length and weight double that). Only after her death and necropsy did doctor establish that Smiley was a female.[3]
Smiley died after it was decided to turn down the heat in her pond to save money. As a result of the lower temperature, the alligator fell ill for two weeks.[4]
In 1990, three years after Smiley's death, she was once again put on display, this time as a cast made by taxidermist Erling Haack for the Gothenburg Natural History Museum.[5] The cast is made out of armored plaster painted with oil paint. The eyes were built with double lenses created by Hendén Optik AB. Smiley's physical remains are preserved in the museum's scientific collection, catalogued as number 17246.[3]
Like many other celebrities who worked and lived in Gothenburg, Smiley has a tram named after her, the M29 859 trams.[3]
We are witnessing an extraordinary moment in the history of global efforts to eliminate extreme poverty and preserve the natural environment. Never before have international development organizations, national governments, the Catholic Church, and other religious and faith-based organizations been so closely aligned in a campaign to address the most daunting challenges facing humanity and the planet.
The surprising convergence of Pope Francis's encyclical on the environment, Laudato Si': On Care for Our Common Home, with his support of the Sustainable Development Goals to “end poverty, fight inequality and injustice, and tackle climate change by 2030,” have presented us with a remarkable moment of opportunity.
This conference, organized by Notre Dame's new Keough School of Global Affairs, brought together students and faculty with leading thinkers from the worlds of development policy and practice, government, the Church, and other religious bodies to reflect on the events of the previous year and chart a way forward.

questioning over espionage charges +
tit-fit-tat naming of diplomatic staff for alleged spy work +
The move prompted Pakistan to withdraw them +
eight officials posted in India's high commission in Islamabad were agents +
ISLAMABAD: Signalling a fresh slide in ties, Pakistan and India may temporarily recall their high commissioners and scale down the size of diplomatic staff in each other's missions in the wake of the latest diplomatic spat over, a media report said on Friday.The latest spat started last week after a staff member of Pakistan's high commission in New Delhi was detained by police for, the Express Tribune reported.The fresh slide in ties may also lead to a 'scaling down' of the strength of diplomatic staff by the two neighbours, the paper said.The tension intensified afterby both sides.Mahmood Akhtar, who was working as a visa officer at the Pakistani high commission, was later expelled from India."However, India, using a statement Delhi police extracted from Akhtar through coercive means, implicated other Pakistani staffers. The identities of at least six such officials were leaked to the media, jeopardising their security.from New Delhi," it said.In what appeared to be a tit-for-tat move, Pakistan on Thursday claimed thatof RAW and IB. The disclosure left New Delhi with no other options but to withdraw the named officials, the paper said.An official with knowledge of the latest developments said that India had breached an 'understanding' by revealing the identities of certain Pakistani officials posted in New Delhi, the paper said.The official said both sides knew that certain officials worked undercover and they did so with the full official knowledge, it said."What India did was unthinkable," the official added, saying the Indian move would have serious implications for the two countries.He said the immediate fallout of this controversy could be the recalling of high commissioners by the two countries for the time being, the paper said.The official said another implication might be 'cutting down' the size of diplomatic staff posted in each other's countries till the situation normalised, it added.

If you've got a passion for all things veg – or have a loved one with a similar inclination – look no further than this latest top 18 list of vegetarian/plant-based restaurants in Hong Kong.
1. Chi Lin Vegetarian
For a Zen experience, this peaceful Buddhist eatery nestled within the magnificent Tang Dynasty-style landscape gardens of Nan Lian is our favourite escape from the hustle and bustle of city life. The décor of this vegetarian restaurant, which is managed by Chi Lin Nunnery, may be simple compared to its surroundings, but the kitchen serves up pristine meat-free Chinese dishes. You can even opt for a sumptuous vegetarian banquet, complete with calming views of the cascading waterfall outside.

Hours: Mon - Fri from 12:00 pm - 9:00 pm, Sat from 11:30 am - 9:00 pm
2. Kung Tak Lam Shanghai Vegetarian Cuisine
This Northern Chinese veggie joint's dishes are completely MSG free, with a heavy reliance on mock meats (which explains the popularity of the restaurant's sweet ‘n' sour “pork”). We've enjoyed many of the healthy, guilt-free dishes on their extensive menu – most notably the Shanghainese cold noodles, tofu dumplings and beautifully presented cold appetiser platters.
10/F, World Trade Centre, 280 Gloucester Road, Causeway Bay (with another branch in Tsim Sha Tsui)
2881 9966
Hours: 11:00am - 11:00 pm daily.
Peggy Chan, owner and founder of GP, shows an enduring commitment to serving local and sustainable plant-based dishes. Her seasonal Asian-inspired menu is both creative and delicious. Grassroots Pantry also offers cooking and environmental workshops and a virtuous catering service. The vegan, gluten-free cinnamon rolls deserve a special thumbs up (anything with almond condensed milk does), in the same way the truffle pasta, deconstructed blueberry cheesecake and acai bowl do.

Hours: Mon - Sun from 9:00 am - 11:00 pm
$68 buffet say whaaaaat?! Ahimsa Buffet has been hugely popular since it opened its doors as an affordable buffet-only vegetarian in Hong Kong. It serves meat-free, predominantly Asian dishes, at an astonishing price of $68 for 60 minutes during lunch hours and $108 for 90 minutes at night on weekdays and $128 on weekends. Their most popular dishes are dim sum items like Turnip cake and steamed bean curd rolls.

Hours: Mon - Sun from 11:30 am – 3:00 pm & 6:00 pm – 10:00 pm
We think India serves some of the tastiest vegetarian cuisine in the world, and Branto is an oldie-but-goodie representative of this country's fine meat-free fare. The basic décor is nothing to write home about, but the food most certainly is. Unlike much Indian cuisine around town, Branto's dishes are spicily authentic (and cheap as chips too). Highlights are the Bombay-style puri snacks utilising small rounds of deep-fried unleavened bread, dosas (thin, crispy rice-flour pancakes with various fillings) and thalis – a little bit of everything on a big metal plate.

6. Sangeetha Vegetarian Restaurant
Heralding from Chennai, this chain seems to be everything but a chain. Although it has seen a worldwide fan base quickly adopt big flavours, the warm service comes as though from a tiny Bombay local. The East TST branch is owned by a family whose brother had tasted this very chain's food in Dubai and was craving a worthy alternative in Hong Kong. Our favourites are the flavoursome palak mushroom curry (spinach and mushrooms in delicious ways you did not think possible), the homemade Indian sweets (try the barfi) the paper dosa which rivals the HK - Macau in length.

Isoya offers fixed-price lunch and dinner sets, the latter of which features a daily keiseki according to what the chef deems best for the day.

We consider this the top table of vegetarian dim sum. In a land of overly salty, strangely textured, nutrient lacking meat-substitutes, the refined lot at Lock Cha have reinvented this Sunday favourite in a way that stands aside and lets the vegetables shine.

Broadband provider found to have put 21,000 subscribers' data at risk by allowing ‘rogue' staff at Indian contractor access to it
TalkTalk has been fined £100,000 by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) after the telecoms giant was found to have placed personal data from 21,000 customers at risk.
An ICO investigation found the company breached data protection laws after staff from an IT firm working with TalkTalk were able to access large amounts of customer data through an online company portal.
According to the investigation, “rogue” staff at Indian firm Wipro, who resolved high-level complaints and network problems on TalkTalk's behalf, used the portal to gain unauthorised access to customer data – including names, addresses and phone numbers.
Information commissioner Elizabeth Denham said: “TalkTalk may consider themselves to be the victims here. But the real victims are the 21,000 people whose information was open to abuse by the malicious actions of a small number of people. TalkTalk should have known better and it should have put its customers first.”
The investigation was launched after TalkTalk received complaints from customers who were receiving what they described as scam phone calls. However, the ICO said it did not find direct evidence of a link between the compromised information and the scam call complaints.
According to the investigation, 40 employees at Wipro had access to the data of between 25,000 and 50,000 TalkTalk customers, and three accounts linked to the firm were used to gain unlawful access to the data.
In a statement, a TalkTalk spokesman said: “We notified the ICO in 2014 of our suspicions that a small number of employees at one of our third-party suppliers were abusing their access to non-financial customer data.
“We informed our customers at the time and launched a thorough investigation, which has led to us withdrawing all customer service operations from India. We continue to take our customers' data and privacy incredibly seriously, and while there is no evidence that any of the data was passed on to third parties, we apologise to those affected by this incident.”
The ICO investigation said account holders could log into the portal from any internet-enabled devices and carry out broad searches that enabled them to view up to 500 customer records at a time.
The investigation said this level of access was “unjustifiably wide-ranging” and placed data at risk.
The incident is unrelated to the 2015 cyberattack on the telecoms giant when personal details of more than 150,000 customers were compromised, as well as partial financial information related to more than 15,000 customer accounts.
For that incident, the company was fined £400,000 for the security failings that allowed the attack to take place. The amount the ICO can fine companies for serious breach of data protection obligations is capped at £500,000.
When Toronto developers, designers and dignitaries talk of the nearly completed, on-time, on-budget Pan Am Games athletes' village, their stature grows an inch. Their eyes brighten. Their patter accelerates.
But there's something left unsaid, little to no talk of how this may play into a 2028 Summer Olympics bid. Toronto's Economic Development Committee took a pass last year on a 2024 bid, so 2028 is the next option open.
“There are some things that are starting to come up. In other words, if the Pan Am Games athletes' village is a big success, then I think people will want to talk to us,” said Bruce Kuwabara of KPMB Architects, one of the two lead architects of the Pan Am village, which will become the new Canary District neighbourhood on the eastern end of Toronto's downtown.

After: Mr. Lester at the Pan Am village in Toronto on Friday. The athletes' village will become condos, rental apartments and student accommodation when the Games are over this summer. (Kevin Van Paassen for The Globe and Mail)
“If it's not a big success, we won't hear from anybody,” he added with clipped laugh.
“This is my own personal speculation,” said Peter Clewes of architectsAlliance, the other lead designer. “I think the whole idea of the Pan Am bid was a way to demonstrate Toronto's ability to host a major sporting event, such as the Olympics.
“There have been a series of attempts in the past [to get the Olympics], and Toronto has not been successful. It has not even been close. So far, the Pan Am Games, in terms of the development side of the facilities, have gone off with virtually no hitches. It's on time. It's on budget. It's a very Toronto, business-focused initiative, in contrast to what Vancouver did.”
The Games will run July 10-26, with the Parapan Am Games for athletes with disabilities running Aug. 7-15. The village's development team doesn't shy away from contrasting their build to the financially mired construction of the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic Games' village.
Following the Toronto games, the athletes' accommodations will be turned into condos, rental apartments and a residence for George Brown College students, joining the introduction of other apartments blocks, shops and offices in the new Canary District neighbourhood.

From the start, the winning Pan Am bid centred on creating housing in that community that would sell well in the current pre-sale market. “We knew that any kind of approach and design and thinking on this would be based on how to make the most economical, cost-effective response in the [request for proposals],” Mr. Clewes said.
In Vancouver, site developer Millennium Development Corp. brought in a number of different architects and based the design choices on ambitious sustainability criteria and what might sell later in the market, Mr. Clewes said. On the other hand, in Toronto, although the Pan Am village has been built to a high LEED Gold standard of environmental efficiency, the focus was primarily on what would sell now in the current market, Mr. Clewes said.
“Our approach was what is selling rapidly in the marketplace now. Let's not take any risks. It's a really business-focused approach,” he said. The aim was “strategically focused market housing” geared largely to the pre-sale market and tailoring construction to today's condo pricing.
Currently, the Canary District Condos building, built in the first phase of construction, is nearly 90 per cent sold. Canary Park Condos, built in the following phase, is 50 per cent sold.
Mr. Kuwabara added that Vancouver's higher emphasis on low-energy, sustainable design helped to push the pre-sale price of that housing excessively high. Although now seen as a thriving section of False Creek, praised for its green construction, the city had to take over the development of the village when Millennium went into financial trouble in the wake of the 2008 economic crisis.

“One of the first things we did was that we went to Vancouver,” said Pan Am village and Canary District co-developer Jason Lester. “We did a field trip, where not only did we meet with the developer, but we also met with the general contractor. We also met with some of the consultants and had some discussions with people within the city and the financing community, as well as anyone we could think of that was peripherally involved with Vancouver.”
The takeaway, he felt, was that the Pan Am village and Canary District construction had to be more of a unified effort with the architects, builders and backers from conception. Mr. Lester's firm Dream Unlimited Corp. (formerly Dundee Realty) is the co-developer alongside Kilmer Van Nostrand Co. Ltd., under the joint venture umbrella name Dundee Kilmer Development Ltd.
“Believe it or not, the hardest part of this project so far was the short period of time that we had to do the actual design, come up with the concept, come up with the strategy and how to execute it, and then obviously the actual procurement,” Mr. Lester said.
The overall plan for the West Donlands area had long been designed by Waterfront Toronto, the body that oversees the lakeshore revitalization. The walkways and local Corktown Commons park were also already designed, along with height and setback specifications for the residential buildings. The designers and developers had to come up with the actual building plans.

After Infrastructure Ontario then issued its request for proposals for the athletes' village, “we had to get a good idea of what the [construction] price was going to be, come up with a strategy and come up with all the financial partners in a period of about six months,” Mr. Lester said. “We had a few hundred people working on that bid. That's when people were pulling all-nighters.”
Yet the aim wasn't to maximize profit, he said. It was to win the bid and keep construction within budget, as well as add some breathing room to the new neighbourhood. For instance, Mr. Lester said the plan could have added “another 1,000 units or a few hundred thousand square feet on each one of these building blocks.”
He noted that “because we wanted to balance design and schedule risk, we actually built out less than what a typical developer would do. Developers always think, How can I maximize the density? Here was a very different, very constrained objective that was counterintuitive to most developers, and to architects for that matter.”
The waterfront area, from the Canary District to Queen's Quay and blocks east to the mouth of the Don River, is being redeveloped, lot by lot, by various designers and developers. Mr. Lester noted that his firm is involved with the development of more than 1,000 apartment units in the Canary District and another 800 in the neighbouring Distillery District, as well as about 900 units on the other side of the Don River.
“Some are just at the planning and approval stages, and some of them are in the pre-construction, marketing stage,” Mr. Lester said, noting though that both sides of the Don River will have a density of units that is lower than much of the downtown.
KPMB's Mr. Kuwabara said, “Our whole concept was that we're not creating buildings. We're creating a neighbourhood, a neighbourhood for athletes and a neighbourhood for the people who are actually going to live there.”

By the numbers
The developers and overseers of the Pan Am Games athletes' village wanted to keep the numbers in check and on budget. Still, the numbers show the large size of the village and what it entails.
35 – Acreage of Canary District.
6 – Number of new buildings to be used by athletes and team officials: five for housing – George Brown Residence building, Canary District Condos, Canary Park Condos and two rental buildings – plus the new Cooper Koo Family YMCA to serve as a treatment facility and other functions for athletes.
$514-million – What Infrastructure Ontario is paying for the build.
7,100 – Pan Am Games athletes and team officials will make themselves at home in the village.
3,200 – Parapan Am Games athletes and officials will also attend.
810 – Condos and townhouses are included in the development, 100 of which will be designated affordable housing.
253 – Affordable rental apartments.
18 – Acres in new Corktown Commons Park.

No, North Dakota Police Aren't Deploying Drones With Tasers and Tear Gas
Earlier this week, a Daily Beast article sparked a barrage of news reports that gave the impression that police departments in North Dakota were gearing up to send out quadcopters mounted with tasers, tear gas spray, and nonlethal firearms.
“New law permits North Dakota cop drones to fire beanbag rounds from the sky,” read a headline on Ars Technica; “Some Cops Are Now Allowed to Taser and Tear Gas People From Drones,” reads another by Gizmodo.
In reality, the state government gave no such sanction to the police, who themselves have no intention of equipping their drones with weapons. The official drone policy of the Grand Fork County Sheriff's Office (GFSO) prohibits the “deployment of any type of projectile, chemical agent, or electrical current weapon.”

The North Dakota Legislature couldn't have legalized the use of weaponized drones because technically, it was already legal. And not just in North Dakota, but in all states that don't explicitly outlaw the practice, since most don't have any laws on drones yet.
“Most aspects of policing, including the use of new technologies, do not have to be specially legalized,” according to Seth Stoughton, an ex-police officer and assistant professor of law at the University of South Carolina with a specialization in police regulation.
“Assuming an agency has the resources to do something and that the agency is willing to do something (as a matter of policy), they can do it unless state law says they can't,” commented Stoughton via email.
Playing Catch Up With Technology
The confusion arose out of a new law in North Dakota that restricts how surveillance drones can be used by law enforcement. The law requires police to obtain a warrant, with few exceptions, before using drones for surveillance purposes and outlawed the outfitting of drones with lethal weapons.

There had been initial proposals in the state legislature to restrict police drones from being equipped with less than lethal force, but such language was not included in the final legislation, fueling the rumor that the state has authorized the police to weaponize their drones.
“The assertion that North Dakota has a law that permits weaponized drones is completely inaccurate,” said Alan Frazier, a professor at the University of Dakota and a drone supervisor for the Grand Fork Sheriff's Office in North Dakota. “The focus and intent of North Dakota Century Code 29-29.4 is a requirement for police to obtain a search warrant before conducting surveillance with an unmanned aircraft. There are only 15 states that have addressed any type of UAS [Unmanned aircraft systems] legislation, it's a void there. Does it mean that those 35 states tacitly approve the use of weaponized drones? Of course not!”
The rapid emergence of drones as a cheap, pervasive gadget has caught legislators flat-footed, and the laws are only starting to catch up with technology. In July, after a video of a gun being shot from a drone went viral, the Connecticut police blankly said that the activity didn't break any state laws, according to Fox Connecticut.
However, police departments haven't jumped on the opportunity to affix their drones with weapons, out of both safety concerns, and because the technology isn't readily available.
“Equipping the aircraft with weapons of any type is strongly discouraged.” reads a 2012 guideline from the International Association of Chiefs of Police. “Given the current state of the technology, the ability to effectively deploy weapons from a small [unmanned aircraft] is doubtful.”
Discount Helicopters
However, drones have already proven an invaluable aid to police as an extra set of eyes. Last September, North Dakota police apprehended four men who fled into a cornfield after being pulled over for a DUI, all with the help of a drone, according to Police Magazine. In June, Wisconsin police used a drone to find a robbery suspect, according to NBC.
Drones are especially useful to smaller police departments that can't access helicopters for manhunts.
“Our only aerial asset is and only will be drones,” said Frazier, who estimates that a single helicopter would cost $1.8 million, compared to a mere $30,000 for a drone system. “We could never afford a helicopter.”
Part of the uncertainty surrounding the potential application of police drones can be blamed on the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA), which is tasked with regulating the new technology, but has failed to come up with detailed guidelines in a timely manner.
“The lack of clear guidance and best practices has led to confusion among the law enforcement community regarding about what law enforcement is allowed to do when they encounter a UAS,” Richard Beary, president of the IACP, told the House Committee on Homeland Security in March.
This has forced state governments to come up with their own regulations. In North Dakota, the use of surveillance drones without a warrant is forbidden except for the patrol of the national border, surveying environmental catastrophes, university research, and during exigent circumstances, such as manhunts for a thief or murderer on the run.
In some places, the fear that police drones could encroach upon our privacy has spawned legislation that would restrict even the latter. In September, the California state Legislature passed a bill that would require a warrant whenever the police utilized a surveillance drone, with environmental disasters as the sole exemption, but Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed the bill, citing the exemptions as “too narrow,” presumably with exigent circumstances in mind.
The lack of a clear and uniform federal guideline has cast shadows on police drone operations. The Daily Beast report insinuates that the GFSO had been running covert drone missions, since it reported only 21 missions in the last three years, but a file from the FAA indicates that there had been 401 drone operations.
However, the latter figure likely includes practice flights that the office had been conducting on open ranges, not surprising since the first police drone was flown in North Dakota in 2013.
“A ‘flight' is a single takeoff and landing,” Frazier said. “The vast majority of flights the GFSO reported to the FAA were training flights over our GFSO outdoor shooting range, which is located in a sparsely populated portion of the county.”
Although Amoeba Music will remain in its Hollywood home for the duration of its lease, landlord GPI Companies is nonetheless moving forward with plans for a future redevelopment of the property at 6400 Sunset Boulevard.
Yesterday, the Brentwood-based real estate firm filed plans with the City of Los Angeles to redevelop the property at 6400 Sunset Boulevard as a mixed-use complex. A case filing from the Department of City Planning indicates that the proposed development would feature 232 residential units above 7,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space..
Earlier this month, LAist drove Angelenos into a frenzy when it published a conceptual rendering by Shimahara Illustrations which depicted an high-rise tower on the current Amoeba site. However, it is unclear if the image represents CGI's exact plans for the property. A representative of the company told LAist via an e-mailed statement that they had not submitted an application to the City at that point in time.
Rumors about the future of the property first began percolating late last year, when Amoeba's parent company sold the .77-acre property for $34 million.
The project, which requests zone and height district changes, will not begin construction until after the end of Amoeba's lease, per an earlier statement from the company.
The property sits directly across the street from a Jack-in-the-Box restaurant which is expected to make way for an Art Deco hotel tower.
Jonny May will miss England's summer tour of Australia and the Olympic Sevens because of a knee injury.
Sportsmail understands the Gloucester winger has no chance of an international return this summer, having already been ruled out for the duration of the club season.
Eddie Jones singled out the 26-year-old in his Sportsmail column as England's player to watch at the World Cup, praising his ability to beat defenders with his speed.

If fit, May's lighting pace would make him an ideal candidate for Team GB's campaign in Rio, but the latest prognosis suggests he will not be fit until September.
While May will play no part of the three-Test southern hemisphere tour, Saracens hooker Jamie George is expected to recover from a bicep injury suffered during the Six Nations.
Mark McCall is hoping the 25-year-old will be fit to face Worcester at the start of May, while the Sarries director of rugby is also tipping in-form full-back Alex Goode for a more prominent England role.
‘Everybody would agree that Alex is playing better now than he's ever played,' said McCall. ‘He's worked phenomenally hard at his game and to improve some of the athletic things.
‘Eddie Jones sat in a room with myself and Alex and said what he has to do to get in the team. He's playing the best rugby of his life and he can only do so much and someone will have to pick him eventually. For us he's been amazing.'
Goode is likely to start in Saturday's Champions Cup semi-final against Wasps at the Madejski Stadium, which will be the north London club's 20th knock-out fixture in six years.
Eddie Jones singled out the 26-year-old in his Sportsmail column as England's player to watch at World Cup
‘I remember losing to Clermont five years ago when it was men against boys,' said McCall. ‘We were absolutely bullied off the park. A lot has changed at our club in the five years.'
Saracens have never won Europe's elite competition, despite being ever-present in the knock-out stages in recent seasons, and centre Brad Barritt believes it is time to lose the ‘nearly men' tag.
‘We have definitely spoken about this season being our time,' said Barritt. ‘We have paid our dues, we have learnt our lessons and it is kind of down to that in this European-style rugby.
Red River Women's Clinic, the only abortion clinic in the state, seeks to combat law that they say aims to close it down
Lawyers for the only abortion clinic in North Dakota launched a legal bid on Wednesday to try and combat a new law that critics say is aimed at closing it down and leaving the state without any abortion providers.
The law is one of a raft of anti-abortion measures due to take effect in North Dakota that have already made it one of the most hostile states in the US for abortion. The rule mandates that all doctors performing abortions must have admitting privileges in a local hospital – something difficult to do as they generally come from out of state.
The only abortion centre in North Dakota is the Red River Women's Clinic in Fargo and the court bid is being brought on its behalf by the Center for Reproductive Rights. "We are going to ensure that women's rights are protected with the full force of the law. And we are going to keep the full range of reproductive healthcare safe, legal and accessible to all women," said CRR president Nancy Northup.
North Dakota has recently been at the forefront of a renewed push by anti-abortion activists and politicians across the US. Instead of focusing on the legality of abortion itself, campaigners have instead concentrated on tightening rules and regulations to such an extent that it makes it difficult for clinics to continue operating.
According to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks developments in reproductive health services in the US, there have been some 694 new provisions – 93 of which have been approved – on issues of women's reproductive rights in the first three months of 2013 alone. In North Dakota the new laws have included one of the toughest pieces of anti-abortion legislation in the country, which would ban the procedure after a fetal heartbeat is detected – about six weeks.
Staff at the Red River clinic have already started trying to comply with the law requiring their doctors getting admitting privileges but have run across problems. Of the three local hospitals close to Fargo, indications are so far that local policies on abortion care or the number of patients a doctor must admit will make the law difficult to comply with.
Red River staff have said that the law could force the clinic to close if the court bid is unsuccessful and they say that would be a disaster for local women.
"Without our clinic, women in North Dakota and many surrounding states would be forced to travel hundreds of miles to other states just to get a legal medical procedure," said Tammi Kromenaker, the clinic's director.
A similar law on local admitting privileges brought onto the books in Mississippi last year has been temporarily blocked after a CRR suit was lodged in that state.
Microsoft's using the Xbox brand as its catch-all for everything gaming, dedicated consoles seem to be losing ground to mobile devices, and what the heck do you even name the system after Xbox One? Xbox Two? Don't be ridiculous. Add all that up and you may get concerned about Microsoft's future in dedicated gaming hardware, but Xbox boss Phil Spencer is certain that the company has at least, erm, one more Xbox left in it.
"I fully expect that you'll see another console from us," Spencer told The Verge. "Our best customers are Xbox console customers, and I want to keep those people engaged both on the Xbox One and anything we might do in the future. I'm 100 percent committed to that."
Microsoft's contributions to games began long before it established the Xbox brand in 2001, publishing influential PC series like Age of Empires and Microsoft Flight Simulator (not to mention Minesweeper and Solitaire). Since then, it has folded more and more of its entertainment projects into the Xbox brand, though not all of them - like Xbox Music, now Groove, and Xbox Entertainment Studios, now closed - stuck.
Microsoft is pushing back toward PC gaming 14 years after the arrival of Xbox with projects like Fable Legends and Halo Wars 2 doubling up on Windows 10. But Spencer pledges that consoles will remain an essential part of the experience. "I don't want to dilute what the Xbox console customer feels," Spencer said. "I want to expand what we're able to do for more customers."

A suspect taken into custody by Baltimore police in connection with an attempted murder was able to conceal a "high-caliber" handgun and fatally shot himself Tuesday afternoon inside the Southwestern District police station, police said.
Police said they were investigating how the man was in possession of the weapon despite being held for hours at the station in the 400 block of Font Hill Ave. The shooting occurred in a bathroom as the district's officers were in a nearby room for daily roll call.
"Our policy is clear: whenever we transport an individual to the station, it's imperative that for the officers' safety and the safety of the individual that we pat them down and make sure they have no weapons," said Deputy Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez, who heads the agency's professional standards and accountability bureau. "This individual was a dangerous individual, and anything short of a thorough search would not be acceptable."
The presence of a gun inside the station posed an immediate risk to officers and others, Rodriguez acknowledged.
"I am very grateful that this individual elected to use that weapon on himself and not engage any of the other officers or civilians inside of the police station," he said.
The man was identified late Tuesday as Tyree Woodson. Authorities said he was 38 years old and was being sought on an attempted-murder and weapons charge, and had himself been shot in recent days. He was on crutches and was wearing a type of "low-cut walking brace," a police official confirmed.
Rodriguez repeatedly said the suspect was "dangerous" and was affiliated with a gang, though he declined to identify the gang. Rodriguez said he did not know whether officers failed to search the man. "We need to find out exactly how this occurred, and we will," he said.
City Council Vice President Edward Reisinger said he was "at a loss for words" about the police station suicide and would be contacting the police commissioner.
City Councilman Brandon Scott, the vice chair of the council's public safety committee, called the incident "unacceptable."
"It's clear that not enough was being done to protect not only the officers but the civilians that work in the district," Scott said.
The incident was not the first time someone was able to get a non-police firearm inside a station. In March 2012, a loaded .22-caliber handgun was found by an officer as he was placing a suspect in a holding cell in the Southeastern District station. Police have not disclosed any findings of that investigation.
Rodriguez, a 30-year veteran who joined the city force after a career in Los Angeles, said that "unfortunately, there are examples where weapons are found — in holding cells, in the back of police cars.
"What that tells every officer is, 'You can't be complacent.'"
It is also not the only case to raise questions about procedures in secure facilities. Last fall, someone was able to swipe drugs from a counter in the department's evidence control room in headquarters. And last month, police said a gun that had been seized off the streets and was supposed to be destroyed was found inside the home of a recently retired commander arrested in a domestic-violence case.
On Tuesday, officers from the regional Warrant Apprehension Task Force, which is led by the city force, made contact with the suspect at 10:50 a.m. and took him into custody, Rodriguez said. Police had him in a holding cell and officers were searching his home, where they recovered a "high-powered weapon."
At around 2:45 p.m., the man asked to go to the bathroom and was escorted there, Rodriguez said.
"The individual went into one of our bathroom stalls, at which time a round was fired from within the stall," he said. "Our immediate findings based on evidence, based on blood spatter, based on trajectory, it appears that this was a self-inflicted wound by a weapon that did not belong to the Police Department. It appears to be a weapon that he brought into this environment."
Police said they had requested the assistance of the state's attorney's office and had assigned investigators from their Force Investigation Team, which handles high-profile cases typically involving use of force.
At the district police station, crime scene tape marked off the entrances to the rear parking lot, though officers appeared to be moving freely in and out of the building. Later, a van from the chief medical examiner's office arrived.
Police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts visited the scene but did not address reporters.
Scott said the incident showed that the agency's facilities are in poor shape. For example, the Southwestern District was built in 1957.
While police headquarters has a front entrance metal detector, the district stations do not. Some of the stations do not use their front entrances, although the lobby of the Northwestern District station reopened recently after community-funded renovations.
Elsewhere, officers, suspects and the general public all enter through the back of the buildings.
"The facilities themselves are in such disarray, we don't have the same protections that other jurisdictions have," Scott said.

Wasting Money Making Money
John W. Poole/NPR
On today's Planet Money, we visit an underground vault that's full of money nobody wants.
The money — bags and bags of dollar coins — is the result of a 2005 law that requires the U.S. Mint to print a series of coins bearing the likeness of each U.S. president.
The problem is, people don't really like dollar coins. And there aren't enough people who are fired up about, say, Rutherford B. Hayes, to make much of a difference.
So more than 1 billion dollar coins are now sitting, unwanted, in Federal Reserve vaults around the country. By the time the program wraps up in 2016, the Fed will be sitting on 2 billion unwanted coins, according to the Fed's own estimates.
The total cost to manufacture those unwanted coins: $600 million.
For more, see the Fed's 2010 report to Congress on the program, and the letter the Fed wrote back in 2005 warning about potential problems with the program.

BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Community Health Systems Inc (CYH.N), one of the biggest U.S. hospital groups, said on Monday it was the victim of a cyberattack from China, resulting in the theft of Social Security numbers and other personal data belonging to 4.5 million patients.

Security experts said the hacking group, known as “APT 18,” may have links to the Chinese government.
“APT 18” typically targets companies in the aerospace and defense, construction and engineering, technology, financial services and healthcare industry, said Charles Carmakal, managing director with FireEye Inc's (FEYE.O) Mandiant forensics unit, which led the investigation of the attack on Community Health in April and June.
“They have fairly advanced techniques for breaking into organizations as well as maintaining access for fairly long periods of times without getting detected,” he said.
The information stolen from Community Health included patient names, addresses, birth dates, telephone numbers and Social Security numbers of people who were referred or received services from doctors affiliated with the hospital group in the last five years, the company said in a regulatory filing.
The stolen data did not include medical or clinical information, credit card numbers, or any intellectual property such as data on medical device development, said Community Health, which has 206 hospitals in 29 states.
The attack is the largest of its type involving patient information since a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services website started tracking such breaches in 2009. The previous record, an attack on a Montana Department of Public Health server, was disclosed in June and affected about 1 million people.
Chinese hacking groups are known for seeking intellectual property, such as product design, or information that might be of use in business or political negotiations.
Social Security numbers and other personal data are typically stolen by cybercriminals to sell on underground exchanges for use by others in identity theft.
Over the past six months Mandiant has seen a spike in cyberattacks on healthcare providers, although this was the first case it had seen in which a sophisticated Chinese group has stolen personal data, according to Carmakal. Mandiant monitors about 20 hacking groups in China.
NEW SCRUTINY
Cybersecurity has come under increased scrutiny at healthcare providers this year, both by law enforcement and attackers.
The FBI warned the industry in April that its protections were lax compared with other sectors, making it vulnerable to hackers looking for details that could be used to access bank accounts or obtain prescriptions.
Mandiant has tracked “APT 18” for four years. When asked if the hackers were linked to the Chinese government, Carmakal said it was “a possibility” but declined to elaborate.
Another cybersecurity firm, CrowdStrike, which has also been monitoring “APT 18” for about four years, said it believes the hackers are either backed by Beijing or work directly for the government, based on the targets they have chosen.
CrowdStrike Chief Technology Officer Dmitri Alperovitch said his firm has seen “APT 18” targeting human rights groups and chemical companies.
“They are of above average skill” among Chinese hackers, said Alperovitch, whose company dubbed the group “Dynamite Panda.”
The issue of Chinese state-sponsored hacking is highly sensitive. Tensions between Washington and Beijing have grown since May, when a U.S. grand jury indicted five Chinese military officers on charges they hacked into American companies for sensitive manufacturing secrets. China has denied the charges.
FBI spokesman Joshua Campbell said his agency was investigating the Community Health case, but declined to elaborate.
The Department of Homeland Security said it believed the incident was isolated, although it shared technical details about the attack with other healthcare providers. An agency official told Reuters it was too soon to say who was behind the attack.
Community Health said it has removed malicious software used by the attackers from its systems and completed other remediation steps. It is now notifying patients and regulatory agencies, as required by law.
The company said it is insured against such losses and does not at this time expect a material adverse effect on financial results. Community Health's stock rose 66 cents, or 1.3 percent, to close at $51.66 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.
MTN has called for collaboration between mobile network operators in South Africa, and Over the Top (OTT) players.
OTT content refers to delivery of audio, video, and other media over the Internet without a multiple-system operator being involved in the control or distribution of the content – which can include free services like WhatsApp or Skype.
According to MTN South Africa CEO, Ahmad Farroukh, operators cannot be in complete control of the internet ecosystem while a broadband pipe that lacks appealing content and applications means little to end users.
Addressing delegates at the 17th edition of AfricaCom, in Cape Town, he said mobile network operators and OTT players can either fight off each other, or work in partnership to define access and structure a fair deal for both parties.
“On one hand, we need to stress that there should be no free ride for OTT players, mobile network operators will protect their customer base and revenue streams. Rules of engagement will have to be defined between operators and OTT players,” said Farroukh.
He suggested strategies where operators, for example, charge for value added services and quality of service. “Those that want a premium service will be willing to pay a premium,” he said.
He said that operators need to avoid being forced into the role of providing a “dumb pipe”, investing and providing the infrastructure, but allowing OTT app providers to own the customer and make money in the future.
“Mobile network operators have made substantial capital investment in licensing and spectrum, acquiring and building their customer base and investing in building trusted brands. Operators have been catalysts and economies enablers and have contributed significantly to the fiscal budgets of many economies – all of this not to be shared for free,” said Farroukh.
He pointed out that instant messaging platforms for content, as well as current and enhanced future OTT voice, need mobile super broadband availability. If the current ecosystem does not change; operators will lag behind in providing capacity for this access and then the game plan will change completely.
OTT, sooner or later, will be charging for their services – their current revenues streams predict that, MTN noted.
Farroukh said that if mobile network operators do not get it right with OTT, they will become like the incumbent fixed networks that they themselves, the mobile operators, neutralized along the years.
He said that operators' strategies are likely to contain a combination of their own OTT services and partnerships with third parties.
“Rules of engagement will have to be defined between operators and OTT players. Mobile network operators and OTT players should work together for their mutual benefit and for the benefit of their shared stakeholder – the end user,” Farroukh said.

While The Walking Dead fans are still reeling from Beth's brutal death in Sunday's midseason finale, AMC is making big moves on the TWD spinoff series. Actor Cliff Curtis — best known to TV viewers for his roles in Trauma, Gang Related, and Missing — has been cast as Sean Cabrera, the character who will act as the companion series' version of TWD leader Rick Grimes.
New Zealand native Curtis, 46, also has an eclectic movie résumé, including Three Kings, Bringing Out the Dead, The Insider, Training Day, Whale Rider, Live Free or Die Hard, Push, The Last Airbender, and Blow, in which he played Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar.
Related: Take a Bite Out of Our 'Walking Dead' Recaps
The spinoff series, which will be set in the same postapocalyptic world Rick Grimes and friends are maneuvering through, albeit in a different location, has no official title yet, but The Hollywood Reporter and Deadline report that Curtis's Sean is a divorced teacher who is "a good man trying to do right by everyone in his life."
AMC will not confirm character or storyline details (or the show's working title, Cobalt), but The Hollywood Reporter reports that Sean has a son with his ex-wife, Andrea, and that his female counterpart in the series is a character named Nancy Tomkins, a guidance counselor at the school where Sean was a teacher.
The Nancy role has not yet been cast, but her children have: British actor Frank Dillane (Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and In the Heart of the Sea) will play Nick, who has dealt with drug problems, and Australian actress Alycia Debnam Carey will play Ashley, described as Nancy's "ambitious" daughter. Carey also had a role in Galyntine, the Greg Nicotero-directed sci-fi drama pilot that AMC passed on earlier this year.
Related: 'The Walking Dead' Showrunner Scott Gimple on the Finale's Big Death and the Return of You-Know-Who
TVLine.com reported in September that the Cobalt cast will also include Sean's son Cody, a rebel "known as the angriest kid in town," and a 40-something "somewhat wilted flower child" named Andrea Chapman, who is still reeling from a bad marriage (and who sounds a little like a mash-up of TWD characters Carol and Andrea).
Other speculation about the spinoff includes the suggestion that the story will be set in the early days of the apocalypse, before walkers overran the world.
Does that mean there's a chance Sean's group and Rick's group could meet up eventually?
The companion series pilot, co-written and executive produced by TWD universe creator Robert Kirkman and former Sons of Anarchy (and current Marco Polo) producer Dave Erickson, will also count TWD executive producers Gale Anne Hurd and David Alpert as executive producers, with Erickson as the showrunner.

It would be absurd to suggest that women's votes will be taken away or that this would solve the political problems that vex us. While I don't think any class of people should be disenfranchised, I have little hope that voting will make things better.
Voting is not under siege in America, but many other rights are. In America, people are imprisoned for using even very mild drugs, tortured by our own government, and forced to bail out reckless financial companies.
I believe that politics is way too intense. That's why I'm a libertarian. Politics gets people angry, destroys relationships, and polarizes peoples' vision: the world is us versus them; good people versus the other. Politics is about interfering with other people's lives without their consent. That's probably why, in the past, libertarians have made little progress in the political sphere. Thus, I advocate focusing energy elsewhere, onto peaceful projects that some consider utopian.
Man shoots woman, then apparently kills himself in Burnside
A northwest Indiana man shot a woman before apparently killing himself after a domestic argument Wednesday morning in the South Side Burnside neighborhood, police said.
A 27-year-old man and a 38-year-old woman were involved in “an apparent domestic dispute” at 10:14 a.m. in the 9100 block of South Cottage Grove, according to Chicago Police.
The man, identified as Christopher A. Sharpe Jr. of Merrillville, shot the woman multiple times, then apparently shot himself in the head, according to police and the Cook County medical examiner's office.
He was pronounced dead at the scene, according to the medical examiner's office. Autopsy results were pending further investigation.
The woman was taken to Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn in serious condition, police said.
A joint team of astronomers from the USA and Germany presented a study where they analyzed an unusual comet P/2013 P5. This object orbits within the main asteroid belt and its most prominent feature is that it has in total six tails made of space dust. The paper outlining the results of the study has been recently published at arXiv.org.
The astronomers analyzed data acquired by the Hubble Space Telescope. P/2013 P5 has been spotted on August 27, 2013. Interestingly enough, this celestial body has an asteroid-like orbit, although its appearance is more similar to a typical comet, so the authors of the paper classified P/2013 P5 as an active asteroid, or the main-belt comet (MBC).
The astronomers made two separate observations on September 10 and 23, 2013, using WFC3 camera to determine the basic properties and characteristics of P/2013 P5 and obtained 12 unique images of the comet. Five exposures of 348 seconds and one of 233 seconds were obtained during each observation. Later these images were combined for separate observation orbits.
The composite images for both observation dates clearly showed a structured, multiple tail system of P/2013 P5. The team noted that the differences in morphological features of those images were dramatic despite a relatively short (approximately two-week-long) interval between observation dates employed for this study. Both images contain a centrally condensed nucleus (marked as N in the image), although most of the other features have changed in both brightness and position, so it is difficult to make correlations between these observations. The tails of the object are marked as A-F in both panels of the image above.
The study also states that comet Tail A changed the least between the observations, considering its direction, length and brightness. Differences between position angle and and projected orbital velocity vector allow suggesting that Tail A may contain larger, slower and probably older particles compared to other tails. Tails B, C and D became wider and faded in surface brightness. Meanwhile, Tail E has grown in length and brightness between two observations, indicating that fresh material is currently being fed into the P/2013 P5.
The team concludes that it is unlikely for P/2013 P5 to be a comet captured from the Kuiper belt or Oort cloud comet reservoirs, as numerical simulations performed more than a decade ago have already dismissed a possibility for such an event to happen in a modern Solar system. Another assumption is that a potential source of dust could have originated due to some impact in the asteroid belt, although this theory could not be supported by the observed spread and fading characteristics of the tails.
According to the authors, the remaining and most viable hypothesis is that P/2013 P5 generates the trail of dust due to the rotational mass-shedding, presumably from torques imposed by solar radiation. However, this assumption should be verified by additional numerical simulations.

Physics 3333 / CFB 3333 Noahs Flood
Noah and the Flood (Genesis:6-9)
Sun Goes Down in Flames - The Jammal Ark Hoax from the Talk.Origins Archive
Video
Prof. Scalise has said clearly that religion and science are separate authorities and should always be kept that way. Science has nothing to say about religious beliefs and religion doesn't contribute to science. That said, there are a few religious claims that ARE subject to scientific analysis. Today we focus on the Flood and the story of Noah from Genesis.
We are NOT debunking the Torah, Bible, or Quran. We are NOT debunking the story of Noah. We are debunking the claims of a small group of people who claim that every word in the holy books is literally true.
First of all, we note that the Genesis story is not original; there are three VERY similar flood stories that are 1000 years older. The similarities to the Noah story are quite striking. The first is the Atrahasis Epic. The second is a Sumerian creation story called The Eridu Genesis which contains a flood story. The next flood story is from the epic of Gilgamesh, which dates to somewhere shortly after 2000 BCE. Gilgamesh was apparently a real king of Uruk around 2600 BCE. This great epic contains the flood story as told to Gilgamesh by Utnapishtim. Here there is even more similarity to the Genesis story. Some references we found suggest that Noah is the same character as Utnapishtim.
Interpretations
In this modern world there are people who insist that the Flood story is litertally true, being a strictly factual account of the Flood. That claim is subject to analysis, as it is a claim of a physical event. We can study that claim.
We can list the claims to study.
Noah was to take samples of "every living of all flesh" on the Ark. Rain fell for "forty days and forty nights." Rain fell until "all the high hills under the whole heaven were covered." The water receded in 150 days. Noah released all of the creatures he had carried in the ark.
The literalists claim that Noah had several of EVERY species of animal, bird, etc. on the ark. We examined what this really implies, based on current knowledge of life on Earth.
Mammals: 4,629 species
Reptiles: more than 6,500 species
Birds: some 70,000 species
Beetles: 300,000 species (that's right - 300,000!)
Maybe rain did fall for 40 days and nights, at least where Noah was. How about planetwide? We found some data about the distribution of Earth's water. The values are in cubic kilometers (km3).
Oceans: 1,370,000,000
Cryosphere (ice): 29,000,000
Groundwater: 9,500,000
Lakes: 125,000
Soil: 65,000
Atmosphere: 13,000
Rivers: 1,700
Earth radius: 6378 km.
Earth surface area: 511,185,932 km2. (Simple geometry)
Now the claim is that ALL mountains on Earth were covered. That must include Everest, which is approximately 8.86 km. high. The claim is, therefore, that Earth was covered with water to a depth of 8.86 km. This amounts to a water volume of roughly 4,500,000,000 km3, which is about 3.25 times the total amount of water in the oceans today! And - the atmosphere contains only 13,000 km3. That's tiny compared to the total. Where does all that extra water come from? And where does it go when the flood recedes? If you postulate that is now in the Earth, it would occupy a cube about 1,650 km. on a side. That's just over 1,000 miles per side, or 1/8 of Earth's radius! That would show up FAST in seismic studies, and no such reservoir has been seen.
The story says that the water receded in 150 days. That's approximately 30,000,000 km3 per day! That's a LOT of water to dump. Here we have to work an assumption. Suppose there was a "drain" hole 10 km square (about 6.2 miles on a side). Again, simple calculations work. The product of hole area, water velocity and time will give the volume of water going through the hole. The volume per day we have, the postulated hole area is 100 km2, there are 86,400 seconds in a day. We will solve for the water velocity, which turns out to be about 3.5 km/sec! That's just over 2 miles per second, or 7,200 miles per hour! Not likely.
The last part of the story to analyze is the return of the creatures to Earth. Think about this. What does Noah have to do? He has to return penguins to Antarctica, koalas, platypuses, wallabies and kangaroos to Australia, bison to North America, polar bears to the Arctic, reindeer to Lapland, tigers to India, pandas to China, and so on. And just how does he do this? His large boat is now grounded.
There's one more consideration - rainfall rate. Assuming the impossible - that the atmosphere could actually rain like that - how fast would the rain have to fall to make 8.8 km is 40 days? That's easy. Forty days times 24 hours per day is 960 hours. Divide 8,800 meters (8.8 km) by 960 and you find a rainfall rate of about 9 meters per hour! That's 28.8 feet per hour! We think that 6 INCHES per hour is a really heavy rain. Rain at that rate would sink any boat you could name.
The calculations are easy; you can try them yourself. The point is that these difficulties cannot be overcome in any reasonable way. The only way to deal with it is to claim that "God did it," which is not scientific. The "God did it" claim is a non-hypothetical truth, which cannot be tested. At that point you leave science behind.
So What Happened?
So what did happen? Those ancient stories very likely refer to an actual flood event, but not a planetwide one. Many cultures have flood stories for the simple reason that many early civilizations lived near rivers, and those who live near rivers WILL get flooded. There are two prime suspects for the ancient flood. One is a local river flood in the Mesopotamian Valley about 2,900 BCE and the flooding of the Black Sea about 7,500 years ago. Look at a page from The Institute for Biblical and Scientific Studies. For the Black Sea possibility, read In Search of Noah's Flood. This is recent work and is VERY interesting.
Six Flood Arguments Creationists Can't Answer by Robert J. Schadewald
Wrap-up
What we are claiming is that the extension of the Flood story to a planetwide inundation is not viable. The story is much more likely to describe some spectacular local flood event long ago.
Opponents of federal gun control won a victory in the Senate Wednesday. But without a doubt, Congress will pass some sort of gun-control legislation. And that act will certainly violate the Constitution.
Our founding document does not delegate firearm-regulating power to Congress or the president. No clause in the Constitution empowers the federal government to ban any type of gun or magazine, create a gun registry or implement a national system of background checks, and the Second Amendment actively restricts federal power in this area. It prevents the federal government from infringing on the right of people to keep and bear arms — even in the course of exercising otherwise legitimate federal powers. So although the feds have the power to regulate interstate commerce, they do not have the power to infringe on our Second Amendment rights in the process.
But the federal government long ago abandoned any pretext of constitutional restraint.
That elevates what happened in Kansas this week to the highest level of importance.
On Tuesday, Governor Sam Brownback signed the Second Amendment Protection Act, nullifying a wide range of federal attacks on the right to keep and bear arms in Kansas. Here's the law's text:
“Any act, law, treaty, order, rule or regulation of the government of the United States which violates the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States is null, void and unenforceable in the state of Kansas.”
In other words, the law prohibits state and local agents in Kansas from participating in any federal gun-control measures restricting the individual right to keep and bear arms as understood when Kansas became a state in 1861.
The new law also makes it illegal for any federal agent to enforce any law, treaty, order, rule or regulation regarding firearms manufactured, owned and remaining within Kansas' borders. Violators could face felony charges. State prosecutors will serve federal agents violating the law with a complaint and summons.
In essence, Sam Brownback just told Barack Obama and his federal minions, “Bring it on!”
As Judge Andrew Napolitano recently pointed out, widespread noncompliance can make federal gun-control laws “nearly impossible to enforce.” Mass noncompliance with an unconstitutional federal act stands as both constitutionally sound and effective. In fact, the Northern states' noncompliance with the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was so effective, South Carolina listed nullification of the act in its Declaration of Causes of Secession.
The new Kansas law stands as the strongest and most sweeping defense of the right to keep and bear arms in the entire country so far.
Note that this bold defense of the Second Amendment did not come from Washington, D.C. — indeed, no bold defense of the Second Amendment ever will.
James Madison envisioned state action as a check on unconstitutional power before the Constitution was even ratified. He laid out the blueprint in Federalist No. 46.
“Should an unwarrantable measure of the federal government be unpopular in particular States, which would seldom fail to be the case, or even a warrantable measure be so, which may sometimes be the case, the means of opposition to it are powerful and at hand. The disquietude of the people; their repugnance and, perhaps refusal to cooperate with officers of the Union, the frowns of the executive magistracy of the State; the embarrassment created by legislative devices, which would often be added on such occasions, would oppose, in any State, very serious impediments; and were the sentiments of several adjoining States happen to be in Union, would present obstructions which the federal government would hardly be willing to encounter.” (Emphasis added)
Madison makes an important point: One state can create issues for the feds. If multiple states refuse to comply with unconstitutional federal actions, they can stop D.C. in its tracks.
Other states need to follow the Sunflower State's lead.

The first light image from Sofia, NASA's flying telescope, shows heat radiating from Jupiter. A recent visual-wavelength picture of approximately the same side of Jupiter is shown for comparison.
Infrared images of Jupiter and the galaxy M82 are the first pictures from NASA's flying telescope, which took to the skies late last week.
The Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, or SOFIA, is a modified Boeing 747 jet with a hole in its side to make room for a diameter reflecting telescope 100 inches in diameter. The May 26 flight lasted six hours and reached 35,000 feet.
A composite image of Jupiter shows the planet's heat, trapped since the its formation, pouring out of Jupiter through holes in its clouds. (The image at left is a usual visual-wavelength picture for comparison.)
The "Faint Object infraRed Camera for the Sofia Telescope," or Forcast instrument, took only minutes to capture that image. It would have taken hours to do so with ground-based telescopes, because water vapor in the atmosphere blocks their view.
Sofia flies above 99 percent of the obstructing water vapor, which allows it to receive about 80 percent of the infrared light visible to the orbiting observatories. It's actually more powerful than the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes, because it can see light ranging from ultraviolet to the far infrared.
NASA officials celebrated the flight, saying it marked the beginning of a 20-year mission of astronomical science and discovery. NASA's previous flying telescope, the Kuiper, lasted about that long and discovered the rings of Uranus, among other accomplishments.
Sofia will study the compounds present in planet-forming disks around young stars, among other missions.
Scientists from NASA and its partner, the German Space Agency, will jointly operate the 17-ton telescope from inside the plane's cabin. The jet will fly about 500 miles per hour between 41,000 and 45,000 feet, and the autopilot and telescope computers will communicate with one another so astronomers can track a single object throughout the flight.
An unspeakable tragedy has taken place in the aftermath of Sunday's Steelers - Cowboys game.
On Wednesday, it was reported that a Steelers fan died after an altercation with a Cowboys fan following Dallas' 35-30 victory over Pittsburgh at Heinz Field.
Here's the report of what happened, via ComplexSports.com:
"A Pittsburgh man was found dead at his home on Monday morning, just hours after he allegedly got into an altercation with a Cowboys fan following the Dallas/Pittsburgh game at Heinz Field on Sunday afternoon. According to police, William Laughlin, 44, suffered an injury to his head as he was leaving the stadium after he was reportedly punched by the Cowboys fan."
The Steelers will try to get a must-win against the rival Browns! Take a second to sign up for our FREE Steelers newsletter!
While the Steelers have yet to release a statement on the situation, Jim Sacco, the vice president of stadium operations for Heinz Field, released the following statement about the altercation on Monday:
"Heinz Field Management has become aware that the City of Pittsburgh Police are investigating the death of a fan who attended the game at Heinz Field on Sunday. Regrettably, the individual fan apparently died at home last evening.
"Heinz Field Management will not release any further information given the ongoing Police investigation. That is all the information we have available at this time."
According to ComplexSports, the Cowboys fan has not yet been identified, as investigators are currently reviewing surveillance footage from the stadium. The investigation is being handled by the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Major Crimes Unit.
Rebecca Vilkomerson of Jewish Voice for Peace was named one of 50 most influential Jews in the world by Jerusalem Post this week, in a list that featured no leader of a U.S. liberal Zionist organization.
The Israel Anti-Boycott Act was rolled out in Congress this summer by leading advocates for Israel, backed by the Israel lobby group AIPAC; but it is having trouble gaining Democratic support. “Democrats remain non-committal about anti-BDS bill,” Aaron Magid reports at Jewish Insider. Senators Dan Murphy (CT) and Tammy Duckworth (IL) and Rep. Joe Kennedy (MA) are all dithering about the legislation.
Their misgivings follow NY Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand's celebrated withdrawal of her support for the bill, which the ACLU says threatens free speech with criminal penalties.
The reason for the politicians' vacillation is obvious. The progressive Democratic base cares about Palestinian human rights, and progressives are generally not opposed to Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions as a means of persuading Israel to abide by international law; polling shows a majority of Democrats support economic sanctions to counter Israel's settlement construction. Other polls show that young Democrats, blacks and Hispanics have more sympathy for Palestine than Israel.
Palestinian solidarity has surely been fostered inside the party base by resistance to Trump's anti-immigrant/refugee policies, by the arrival of Black Lives Matter (which calls out “apartheid” in Palestine), and by the Women's March, led by BDS supporter Linda Sarsour.
The marvel is that the BDS groundswell is occurring without any coverage by the mainstream press. The media is refusing to do the fundamental job of telling people what Palestinians are asking for– equal rights– Michael Brown writes at EI. It is no wonder that CNN and MSNBC have avoided hosting honest discussions of BDS: a Time Warner executive has written speeches for Netanyahu and a Comcast exec has raised money for the Israeli Defense Forces (as I regularly point out).
Still BDS remains a dividing line inside the Democratic Party. The progressive candidate in the race for the Democratic nomination to be Illinois governor, Daniel Biss, dumped his running mate because he supports BDS two weeks ago. The former running mate didn't cave. The Democratic Party platform committee came out against BDS in 2016 even though some Bernie Sanders surrogates supported BDS. And leaked emails showed that the Hillary Clinton braintrust spent way much too much time organizing opposition against BDS during her campaign, even while they were ignoring Wisconsin. Clinton was trying to please Haim Saban and other donors; and donor relations surely explain Biss's swandive too.
Journalists avoid this story because the Democratic establishment fears the potential of this issue to divide the party– to split Clintonites from Sandersites and undermine the party's ability to take on Trump. This is why Josh Marshall of TPM has slagged BDS supporters as anti-Semites. “Truly the last thing the Democratic Party needs right now is a toxic internecine fight over Israel,” he has written.
That fear on the part of party leaders is not a new one. The battle over Palestinian human rights has been put off again and again inside the Democratic Party since the 1960s, and always with the claim on the establishment's part that the solidarity activists are radicals and troublemakers, who need to get out of the road in a hurry (think about Andrew Young, Jimmy Carter, Cynthia McKinney, Cornel West, etc).
Yet in those 50 years, we have seen countless other once-marginal progressive questions enter the mainstream and gain establishment approval, from women's rights to same-sex marriage to the embrace of transgender rights. It is lost on none of us that the BDS call went out 12 years ago at a time when the transgender issue was not central to Democratic Party politics; yet BDS remains off-limits, even as party leaders endorse the boycott of North Carolina over transgender peoples' access to bathrooms of their choice. The hypocrisy is glaring.
I believe that this division cannot be papered over any longer, and that Palestinian human rights will at last be taken up by major political figures.
Why the optimism? Too much has changed in the political landscape. The rightwing convergence of Netanyahu and Trump has had the effect of politicizing Israel support at last in the U.S. mainstream– Republicans back Likud, Democrats back liberal Zionists. The growing demands by people of color to be represented in the U.S. establishment signal that voices like Linda Sarsour and Keith Ellison will become less and less marginal. The Democratic Party is being challenged to take a stand against Islamophobia. And meanwhile, it is clear that many national security leaders, including lately Gen. H.R. McMaster, have read the book The Israel Lobby, and don't like the message.
As always I focus on the Jewish community because I think it has the most influence over the politics of Israel and Palestine; and there too change is upon us. Last June's celebrations of 50 years of permanent occupation demonstrated to American liberals something that was obvious to Palestinians years ago: Israel has no intention of allowing the creation of a Palestinian state. Liberal Zionists are in crisis over their failure to save “the good Israel”, and are looking for a way forward. Many of them will end up supporting BDS.
This week the Jerusalem Post listed Rebecca Vilkomerson of Jewish Voice for Peace as one of the 50 most influential Jews in the world. Vilkomerson supports BDS; and there were no liberal Zionist leaders on that list. Though AIPAC was there, and the ADL too. Meantime, young Jews in IfNotNow are taking on the Jewish establishment, asking why “you never told me” about the occupation. Yes, these are still embryonic trends. But even some big Jewish donors are balking at funding Israel. The Jewish monolith on Israel is cracking, and that will give everyone else permission to dissent, including politicians.
The NBA's official play-by-play log of Tuesday's game between the Toronto Raptors and New Orleans Pelicans will tell you that Kyle Lowry drained a 21-foot game-winning step-back jump shot with four seconds remaining - good for his 32nd and 33rd points of the night.
In other words, it tells you that an All-NBA star beat a losing team as part of an impressive individual performance - none of which raises any eyebrows.
What it doesn't tell you is that the Pelicans defended a broken Raptors possession about as well as they possibly could have - a reminder that plays, games, and ultimately seasons are defined by results that don't always reflect the processes that precede them.
Here's the story of Lowry's unlikely dagger:
The Raptors inbound the ball with 29.4 seconds remaining in overtime and the score tied at 106. The first thing that jumps out in rewatching the play is that E'Twaun Moore gets away with a foul while trying to deny Lowry the ball, as he grabs and holds onto the Raptors' star point guard in front of an official.
In any event, Toronto gets the ball to Lowry, and the fun begins.
In the first screengrab below, you see Terrence Ross in the corner, motioning to Raptors teammate Patrick Patterson, while Terrence Jones - guarding Patterson - tries to get the attention of Pelicans teammate Solomon Hill, who's guarding Ross.
In the second screengrab, you'll notice that Patterson is motioning back to Ross, while Hill (No. 44) has picked up on whatever Jones was calling for.
Ross and Patterson's confusion is the first sign of the dysfunction that threatens to derail what could be Toronto's final possession.
Patterson: "Just miscommunication on the offensive set. Coach drew up a play in the huddle, we came out of the huddle and were supposed to run it, but there was miscommunication. Guys weren't in the right spot at the right time."
Dwane Casey: "There are a lot of things we have to clean up - execution down the stretch, who's supposed to screen, who's supposed to go where. We got discombobulated. Usually DeMar (DeRozan)'s in there. We didn't execute the play properly."
Meanwhile, Jones and Hill have decided to execute a brilliant defensive switch away from the ball, as Hill will now guard Patterson while Jones covers Ross.
The two Pelicans correctly anticipate Patterson eventually setting a high screen for Lowry. Rather than that future screen switching Lowry's defender from Moore to Jones (a big man), the Jones-Hill pre-switch now ensures Hill will get the chance to eventually switch onto Lowry, giving New Orleans a better perimeter defender.
In the two screengrabs below, you first see Patterson - with Hill trailing him - coming to set the screen, and then leaving the scene - with Moore on him and Hill on Lowry - after the offensive screen and defensive switch have been executed.
With only five seconds on the shot clock and no other options created by the possession, Lowry attacks Hill, who does a fantastic job seemingly taking away every inch of space he can without fouling, as the following three screengrabs attest.
That last screengrab, in particular, is stunning when you remember that Lowry would go on to sink the go-ahead bucket. Hill is seven inches taller, and with his arms outstretched, it appears as though an optical illusion is needed just for Lowry to get a clean shot off, let alone make it.
Hill: "I let him get to his left hand, and he made the shot. There wasn't anything impossible about it. He did it all night. I gave him an opportunity to get to his favorite hand. The step-back move is one of his favorite moves - something he's done in the past."
Lowry: "It was a shot I wanted to get to, and I made it over him."
Hill: "I think that was bad defense on my end."
Hill, of course, was being far too modest and hard on himself. Lowry connected on a 21-foot, off-balance step-back jumper with a good defender draped all over him as the shot clock expired, leaving him a couple rows deep into the crowd by the time the ball finished its descent through the basket.
Lowry may have wanted to go left before releasing a jumper, but surely this wasn't the look he had in mind, as he admitted there was little more Hill could've done.
Lowry: "Great defense ... it was a tough shot. I just made it. The only thing he could've done better was block it. He didn't, but I give him a lot of credit for that defensive effort."
Hill and the Pelicans will be the first to tell you there are no moral victories, as in the end, the history books will simply remember this play as a successful offensive trip for the victorious Raptors, a failed defensive stand for New Orleans, and a clutch bucket by a perennial All-Star.
Basketball, like life, can be cruelly unfair.
Police say a loaded handgun in a Florida woman's purse accidentally discharged when she dropped it in a St. Petersberg's Starbucks on Saturday. The bullet from 51-year-old Pamela Beck's gun struck her friend, 38-year-old Amie Peterson, above the knee. The wound was not serious and Peterson was released from the hospital late Saturday night.
Beck, who does not have a concealed weapon permit, told police that the gold-plated .25 caliber semi-automatic pistol had been given to her by her father a year ago, for protection, and that she had forgotten that she placed the gun in a spare purse. Before leaving for the Tyrone Square Mall in which the Starbucks was located, she switched purses to the spare one.
St. Petersburg Police spokesman Mike Puetz said that her purse “hit the ground hard” and the gun fired.
Starbucks, which has been criticized in the past for its refusal to ban armed customers, released this statement:
“At Starbucks, the safety and security of our partners who are our employees and customers is our top priority. We are aware of the accident that took place and are thankful that nobody was seriously injured.”
Police consider the shooting accidental, but have referred the case to the Pinellas County State Attorney's Office because Beck lacked a concealed carry permit. Prosecutors are still deciding whether to press charges.
This is just the latest in a string of accidental shootings. In June alone, a 13-year-old Nevada girl was accidentally shot by a friend and a Texas boy shot his 13-year-old stepsister while making his AK-47 “safe.”

2015 has been an incredible year so far for anyone remotely interested in shoegaze, psych rock, noise or combinations of all three. While Ride's reunion has (rightly) grabbed most of the headlines, many of those inspired by the Oxford four-piece have been responsible for some of this year's finest releases.
Many of them are celebrated in this column, Echodrone's Five, Fever Dream's Moyamoya and Swervedriver's I Wasn't Born To Lose You among them. However, first up among these 25 artists who've kickstarted 2015 into a distortion heavy, pedal induced frenzy are Russian quintet Pinkshinyultrablast...
---
Pinkshinyultrablast
St Petersburg's Pinkshinyultrablast have been on Drowned In Sound's radar since releasing the excellent Happy Songs For Happy Zombies EP in 2009. The band signed to Club AC30 in 2014 with long awaited debut LP Everything Else Matters following in February of this year. They've also just embarked on their first ever UK tour which runs until the 16th May culminating in two shows as part of Brighton's Great Escape festival. In the meantime, they've also released a third single off the album in the shape of 'Ravestar Supreme'. Here's the video.
Flyying Colours
Also making their first visit to the UK this month is Pinkshinyultrablast tour buddies and label mates Flyying Colours. Hailing from Melbourne, we first fell in love with them when debut single 'Wavy Gravy' landed in our inboxes a couple of years ago. Imagine if Fleetwood Mac had been on Creation Records in the early nineties and you're probably in a similar ballpark to where Flyying Colours sound emanates from. Their new EP ROYGBIV is out on 11th May. This is 'Running Late', taken from the EP.
False-Heads
Chichester's False-Heads might be new kids on the block. However, judging by the recent Wear And Tear EP, released on Hi4Head Records in March, they're already well versed when it comes to the art of songwriting. Lead track 'Wrap Up' owes as much to Black Sabbath or Pixies as it does Thee Oh Sees or Black Angels, and this diversity shines through each of the EP's four pieces. Watch the video to 'Wrap Up' and see for yourselves.
New Candys
Italian four-piece New Candys have shared stages with the likes of Dead Skeletons, Crystal Stilts and The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion while two of their members also play as part of Lorelle And The Obsolete's live set up. Having released their first album Stars Reach The Abyss back in 2012, they finally got round to putting out the follow-up New Candys As Medicine in March of this year. Produced by former Loop drummer John Wills, it's a psychedelic power trip of an album that demands your attention from its opening bars. They also put out a limited edition 10 inch split single with Kill Your Boyfriend, and here's 'Surf 2', taken from that release.
The Virgance
Essentially the solo project for Colchester-based Nathan Smith, The Virgance released his second album Hako Shrine in January and it's one of the most beautifully constructed albums to grace the stereo this year. Combining elements of ambient post-rock with errant, effects laden melodies, Hako Shrine is something of an experimental journey for its creator and ultimately represents a giant leap forward from its predecessor Lost Continent, released twelve months earlier. Here's the album in full.
Kill West
Argentinian noisemakers Kill West leave little to the imagination regarding their intentions on their self-titled debut EP, the first release for new Brighton label Drone Rock Records. While clearly in thrall to the likes of My Bloody Valentine, Spacemen 3 and A Place To Bury Strangers, there's a furious bite and menace about the likes of 'Lazy Eye' and 'Highway Mind' which suggests they're on a mission of their own making. Ones to watch for the future. This is the EP in all its glory.
The Telescopes
Having released his first record with The Telescopes back in 1988, Stephen Lawrie is something of a veteran when it comes to making music. Nevertheless, his relentless pursuit of pushing things forwards holds no bounds, nor does his prolific output. Last month saw them put out a split single with A Place To Bury Strangers for Fuzz Club Records featuring a cover of The Stooges' 'I Wanna Be Your Dog' (listen below) while their seventh long player is almost ready and scheduled for release in August. With several festival slots already confirmed including Eindhoven Psych Lab in June, they're a formidable live experience not to be missed.
Swervedriver
Also returning with a new album - their first in seventeen years - are fellow Creation stalwarts from back in the day, Swervedriver. Recorded in Melbourne during the summer of 2014, I Wasn't Born To Lose You' bears all the hallmarks of classic Swervedriver records Raise and Mezcal Head_ while reaffirming Adam Franklin as one of the most underrated songwriters and arrangers around. Here's 'Autodidact', the third single to be taken from the album.
Crosa Rosa
Nottingham three-piece Crosa Rosa were only conceived just over a year ago, yet already they've made their presence felt among the city's live music scene. Fusing elements of halcyon era Sub Pop (Superfuzz Bigmuff/Bleach, you get the drift) with psychedelic surges akin to early Spacemen 3 or more recently The Wytches, their new self produced EP Pantophobia is one of the most exciting releases out there at the minute. This is 'Little Leper', the lead track off the record.
Eyre Llew
Also hailing from Nottingham are Eyre Llew, another three-piece of whom big things are expected in the coming months. Having formed in September of last year after playing in other bands, their delicately poised sound is reminiscent of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Her Name Is Calla and Sigur Ros. Their fourth single 'Lunar' came out earlier this year and is arguably the most evocative piece of music to grace the stereo in months.
Crocodiles
Californian noise pop duo Crocodiles release their fifth long player Boys on 11th May. Channelling influences from shoegaze pioneers like The Jesus & Mary Chain through to sun drenched salsa in a similar vein to Calexico, it promises to be their most diversely experimental collection to date. With a UK tour pencilled in for June, their live show is a must-see this summer. In the meantime, here's 'Crybaby Demon', the first single taken from the record.
No Joy
Regular readers of this column may already be familiar with Canadian quartet No Joy. 2013's Wait To Pleasure was one of that year's finest albums, and its successor More Faithful bares all the hallmarks of being among 2015's too. Released on 8th June via Mexican Summer, the band are currently on tour in the UK with Cheatahs. As a taster for the LP, this is 'Moon In My Mouth'.
Sun Colony
Hailing from Topanga Canyon in the Santa Monica Mountains of California, Sun Colony are something of an unknown quantity. However, if the blissed out psych grunge of 'Heavy Sky' is anything to go by, their anonymity will soon be a thing of the past.
Season Of Strangers
Coming from Seattle, one might expect Season Of Strangers to be purveyors of heavy duty, in your face, angst. Which in all honesty couldn't be further from the truth. Instead, their spectral deities and ethereal passages are reminiscent of 4AD luminaries Pale Saints or Lush. Although currently unsigned, we're pretty excited by their three-track demo that's doing the rounds at the minute. Have a listen for yourselves...
zZz
Amsterdam duo zZz have been making their own brand of experimental noise rock for over a decade now. Formed in Amsterdam as far back as 2001, they've quietly gone about their business, releasing two critically acclaimed albums (2005's Sound Of zZz and Running With The Beast four years later). Last month saw them release long awaited third record Juggernaut and having recently toured mainland Europe with A Place To Bury Strangers, the duo's profile has seemingly risen somewhat. Here's 'When I Come Home' taken from the album.
Fever Dream
London-based trio Fever Dream have been kicking up a storm for a while. Having signed to esteemed independent Club AC30 at the tail end of 2014, the band announced the release of eagerly anticipated debut Moyamoya in April of this year. And what an incredible record it is too. Combining their customary noise pop with radiant bursts of sonic exploration, it stands out as one of 2015's most extravagant releases so far. This is 'Serotonin Hit', the first single taken from the album earlier this year.
Love, Hippies & Gangsters
Essentially the solo project of Yiğit Bülbül, Love Hippies & Gangsters first came to our attention in January when the EP Sun Over Babaluma landed unsuspectingly in our inboxes. As mesmerizing and out there as the name suggests, all four tracks on the EP show a different side to Bülbül's creative palette, from forward thinking psychedelia in the vein of the Brian Jonestown Massacre ('This Is What We Want') or Temples ('Through Your Mind') to the abstract experimental noise of 'Got My Coat'. With an album set to be released later in the year, exciting times lay ahead.
Vaadat Charigim
Israeli trio Vaadat Charigim sound like they could have been conceived somewhere around the Thames Valley circa 1990 rather than Tel Aviv from where they originate. 2013's The World Is Well Lost, their debut LP for Burger Records, initially brought them to the attention of a wider audience. While this year's follow-up Sinking As A Stone, also released through the same imprint, is expected to catapult them to even greater heights. This is 'Ein Li Makom' which is taken from the album.
The Away Days
Another band previously featured in this column are Istanbul quintet The Away Days. Having put out a couple of impressive singles last year in the shape of 'Your Colour' and 'Paris', they returned in January with arguably their best 45 to date, 'Best Rebellious', a shimmering beast of a song that recalls Ride at their most potent and The Boo Radleys pre-Wake Up. With a new EP entitled THIS set to be released any day now, Turkish shoegaze might just be the soundtrack to your summer.
Pity Sex
Michigan's Pity Sex have established themselves as a potent force on their native live scene in recent months. Their explosive performances at this year's SXSW didn't go unnoticed either, and later this month they'll be visiting the UK for the first time in support of debut long player Feast Of Love. Expect riffs J Mascis and Thurston Moore would be proud of fused with effects-driven melodies and the occasional wall of noise to boot. This is 'Acid Reflex' off the album, which I'm sure you'll agree hits the spot nicely.
Lorna
Lorna have been around for the best part of two decades having formed towards the back end of the 1990s in their native city of Nottingham. While band members have come and gone, main songwriter Mark Rolfe remains the driving force and they're about to release their sixth album, London's Leaving Me for Minnesota imprint Words On Music. In the meantime, the band put out a limited edition single for Record Store Day and this is 'Wayne Mills', the lead track off the release.
The Blackrays
Hailing from the not so salubrious backwaters of Barnsley, supergroup of sorts The Blackrays look set to be the South Yorkshire mining town's latest exports following in the footsteps of Exit Calm and Pusher. Featuring current and former members of Two Skies and The Underground Youth respectively, debut single 'Here They Come' is out shortly on Fuzz Club Records. In the meantime, here's the video to 'Endless', which features on the b-side of the seven-inch.
Pastel Ghost
Oakland native Vivian Moon might not be a recognisable name to most, but under the guise of Pastel Ghost she's crafted another of 2015's most evocative debuts. ABYSS, released earlier this year on 80s Ladies Records. With influences ranging from Beach House and The Cure to Wild Nothing and Crystal Castles (really!), it's a delightful concoction of pastoral ambience and dance infused dreampop. Here's 'Clouds' from the LP.
SPC ECO
Father and daughter outfit SPC ECO have been regulars on the London underground scene for a few years now. New single 'Feel Me' features Rose Berlin's signature vocal over an industrial backbeat that's part Sisters Of Mercy and part Curve, her old man's former outfit. Meanwhile, fifth long player Dark Matter is out this week and well worth the admission fee.
Echodrone
Celebrating their tenth year in existence, San Francisco's Echodrone wrap up 2015's first instalment of Some Velvet Mixtape courtesy of awesome recent single 'Glacial Place'. Taken from their long awaited and some would say well-overdue debut Five, released earlier this year on Saint Marie Records. Both band and song pretty much do what it says on the tin, creating six and a half minutes of ethereal bliss in the process.

AUSTRALIA has asserted itself as the dominant nation in world sailing with 470 sailors Malcolm Page and Mathew Belcher winning our third gold medal of the regatta.
The pair did it in style before Page confirmed he was closing the book on a superb career which started 32 years ago.
But the Sydney-born sailing legend revealed he was contemplating Olympic retirement four years ago.
He said claiming 470 gold with ex-skipper Nathan Wilmot in Beijing 2008, set the wheels in motion for a premature end to a stellar career.
But when Belcher called a meeting in a coffee shop in Qingdao after Page claimed Olympic gold, he unwittingly set the wheels in motion for an Olympic title defence.
Belcher - a media boat driver at the Beijing Games - was so inspired by Page that he wanted to become his 470 skipper knowing Wilmot was not going to participate at the London Games.
"He proposed to me to do the next four years," Page said. "I said wait, give me three months before I could give you a solid answer because I didn't want the emotion to make it a wrong decision.
"But I knew at the start of the last four year campaign that it was going to be my last Olympic campaign.
"I would love to still stay involved in the team but it just won't be as an athlete.
"So, hopefully you'll see me at another Olympic Games, but it won't be wearing sticky wets.
"I achieved so much more than I've ever expected especially when I decided to do an Olympic campaign."
Earlier, the Aussie crew of Belcher and Page were in a dog fight with the British from the outset in a classic tacking duel.
The Aussies and British were so far ahead of the other crews heading into the final race they were the only crews capable of winning gold. And Australia began with a crucial four-point advantage, meaning they only had to beat the British to win.
But early in the race the British crew of Luke Patience and Stuart Bithell streaked to the lead and the gold medal position.
Charging to the second last mark, both crews tacked more than a dozen times in a bid to gain the crucial edge.
Then, rounding the last mark, disaster struck the British crew when they incurred a penalty and had to turn around.
It proved the decisive moment that handed gold on a platter to Belcher and Page.
They finished second in the race to Croatia but it didn't matter. They only needed to beat the Brits, who finished fourth.
As they crossed the line, the Aussie contingent, including the crew's family, went wild on the shores of Weymouth.
The win made Page Australia's greatest Olympic sailor after he won back-to-back crowns and cemented the sailing team's place as Australia's London Games saviour.
"It's a special feeling it was a really tough battle,'' Page said.
"They brought their A game and we had to work really hard for it.''We came home with what we wanted.''Coming away with the three (gold) locked in is amazing.''
Skipper Belcher jumped on board the 470 after Nathan Wilmot partnered Page in the Beijing 2008 success.
From the start, the Aussie game plan was clear: prevent Great Britain from putting a minimum one boat in between their Antipodeans rival to claim an upset.
Britain tried working with the traffic of other boats out of medal contention but that ploy favoured the ocean-smart Aussies.
It was a fitting finale for Page after he signalled his intent to retire from the Olympics before competing in his third Games campaign.
Page and Belcher's climb to become 2012 Olympic champions from a world ranking 43 to No. 1 in 2010 and being undefeated at Weymouth counted for everything while the British pondered what may have been.
The British crew - close friends of the Australian pair - failed to pull off arguably the sailing shock of the London Games because Page and Belcher shut down every ocean move.
Touchingly, the parents of both crews sat together and embraced as the Aussies clinched gold.
Bithell, 25, said he and Patience had studied Page and Belcher's systems before the medal race after an inspirational talk by Britain's all-time best Olympic sailor Ben Ainslie.
It still wasn't enough to beat Australia.
"We watched a few videos of match races," he said.
"They are two of the best match racers in the world.
"We discussed all the different techniques, the grey areas, the win-win situations, how to sting opponents with penalties. The dark arts."
But the Australians were emphatic in victory.
Hand-picked by revered Australian sailing coach Victor Kovalenko, Belcher was overjoyed by the triumph.
Ukraine-born Kovalenko has now coached Australia's sailors to seven Olympic gold medals, two silvers and four bronze since the Sydney 2000 Games as his consistent 470 stable again proved why he is regarded as the best boss on the planet.
Australia's 470 women's crew Elise Rechichi and Belinda Stowell - gold medallists from different Olympic eras - finished the medal race in eighth position at Weymouth today.
Defending Olympic champion Rechichi relinquished the 470 Beijing crown to New Zealand's 470 crew after Great Britain claimed silver while the Netherlands earned bronze.
After sailing brilliantly during the penultimate races with a fourth and first place the Australians hopes of earning bronze disappeared when the Netherlands powered to fifth place.
Rechichi and 470 Sydney 2000 gold medallist Stowell ended the medal regatta in seventh place before Jo Aleh and Olivia Powrie delivered New Zealand's fourth gold medal of the Games.
"It might have looked easy, but there was a lot going on," Aleh said.
"We'd had a look at the course before the race and decided we were going for the right."
The event will include a keynote address from Rev. Dr. William Barber II, president of the North Carolina NAACP, as well as speeches from local people who have been negatively impacted by the policies being passed in Raleigh for the last several years.
The Jackson County Branch of the NAACP will host more than a dozen like-minded Western North Carolina organizations in Sylva on June 13 for an event called “Mountain Moral Monday.”
“You will hear people testify about how their lives have been impacted,” Barber said. “You have to show the face of it.”
The Moral Monday Movement, a large nonpartisan coalition, actually began organizing 10 years ago as the HK on J (Historic Thousands on Jones Street) Coalition in North Carolina under Barber's leadership. For the last three years, the movement has been focused on fighting legislation passed by the General Assembly and the governor that its organizers claim has negatively impacted the state's most vulnerable citizens.
These issues include the state's refusal to expand Medicaid, cuts to public education, voter suppression laws, labor rights, affordable housing, immigration, environmental concerns, tax reform and more. Barber describes it as an “indigenously-led, state-based, state-government focused, deeply moral, deeply constitutional, anti-racist, anti-poverty, pro-justice, pro-labor, transformative, fusion movement.”
“The movement in North Carolina is about the moral fabric of our society, and we are called by a deeply moral and constitutional vision of what is possible,” Barber said. “We look at public policy through a moral lens of justice for all and through the constitutional principle of governing for the good of the whole. Our work points out how these extremist policies are morally indefensible, constitutionally inconsistent and economically insane.”
This is the first time a Moral Monday Movement event will be held west of Asheville since the protests began in Raleigh more than three years ago. “Forward together, not one step back” has been the mantra of the movement, and its leaders say it has supporters from all walks of life and every end of the political spectrum who have come together to rally against what they call extremist policies.
Thousands of North Carolinians have descended upon the state capitol each Monday legislators have been in session to hold peaceful demonstrations inside and outsie the Legislative Building. More than 1,000 people have willingly been arrested for civil disobedience by General Assembly police.
Barber attributes the success of the movement to the people willing to fight for a better state. He said people are tired of politicians talking about “wedge issues” like abortion, homosexuality and prayer in school and are ready for a deeper discussion about the moral issues that affect people's lives.
“We are challenging the position of the religious right that the preeminent moral issues today are about religion in public schools, abortion and homosexuality with a critique that says the deepest public concerns of our faith traditions deal with how do you treat the poor, those on the margins, the least of these, women, children, workers, immigrants and the sick,” Barber said.
The Jackson County NAACP branch hopes Barber's national recognition and his ability to engage an audience will spur more involvement in the local NAACP efforts.
“He is a figure of national recognition. He is a person that will talk to and be consulted by candidates such as Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. He writes editorials — opinions — for the New York Times, and he has a regular column in The Nation magazine, which was a column that used to be written by Martin Luther King,” said Dr. Enrique Gomez, a Western Carolina University professor and president of the Jackson County NAACP. “There are a lot of people who, in their opinion, think that he has essentially ‘taken the mantel' of the Civil Rights Movement nationwide. So yeah, he is a figure of import.”
Avram Friedman, vice president of the Jackson NAACP, encouraged the public to attend the rally to hear from many of the local coalition partners that will have informational booths set up at the event. Live music at the event will include a performance by nationally acclaimed singer-songwriter David LaMotte. Sylva resident Stella Moore will lead the crowd in singing songs of the Movement. The gathering will begin with the Sounding of the Shofar by Frank Goldsmith of WNC Jews for Justice.
“We want people to understand that they really do have power and the importance of participating in the political process if you want to see change happen,” Friedman said. “Change always happens from the bottom up. People in power will never give it up willingly — they have to feel the pressure from the bottom up.”
Rev. Charles Lee of Liberty Baptist Church will serve as master of ceremonies for the June 13 event in Sylva. Also scheduled to speak are:
• Sylva resident Connie Jean Conklin, who suffers from physical disabilities and has been refused Medicaid due to the refusal of North Carolina's Republican-controlled legislature to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.
• Franklin educator John deVille, who will speak on the effect cuts in public educational funding have had on both teachers and students.
• Other speakers will also address the adverse effects of North Carolina's voter ID law, the elimination of funding for the representation of defendants with limited financial resources in federal criminal courts, and the reduction of assistance provided by the North Carolina Department of Employment Security.
Since the movement is non-partisan, the Jackson County NAACP asks attendants to refrain from bringing campaign signs or other political materials. For more information, call 828.631.3447 or visit jacksonncnaacp.org.

Sometimes, even for pitchers, the best of moments can come out of left field.
Just two weeks ago, Perth Heat reliever Jorge Marban was focusing on curbing his walks while continuing to assert himself as one of the most reliable arms in the early going of the 2014-15 Australian Baseball League season. Now the former Rangers prospect has a second lease on his baseball life after agreeing to a deal with the Red Sox following three seasons in independent leagues across the U.S. and his first handful of games Down Under.
Marban first caught wind of the ABL while playing for Florence in the independent Frontier League last season. After asking his coaches if they had any connections in Australia -- they didn't -- he was the beneficiary of a late-season transaction that set his course for Perth. The 25-year-old was sent to Southern Maryland of the Atlantic League, and before he even threw a pitch for the club, his new pitching coach put him in touch with Heat manager Steve Fish.
Joining the ABL's reigning champions for the start of the league's fifth season, Marban made a name for himself quickly, not allowing a hit or run through his first five outings. All the while, his manager -- a part-time Boston scout -- was keeping a close eye on the righty.
"After my outing against Canberra [his fifth appearance of the season on November 20], Fish calls me the next day and tells me to show up to the field early," Marban said. "I show up early. I really don't know what's going on because it's not like we've talked about this previously. I'm just running through my head, like, if I've gotten in trouble somewhere or what could be going on.
"He calls me into his office and just said, 'Hey, the Red Sox want to have you play for them next year.' He put the contract out in front of me, and I was just at a loss for words."
The Canberra outing, during which Marban struck out three and walked one over two hitless innings, clinched the deal.
"I'd been struggling with my slider, and in that outing, I showed that I could throw my slider," he said. "[Fish] was like, 'That's all we really needed to see. We like your fastball. We like your split-finger, and now that we see that you can throw your slider, we want you.' I was pretty surprised."
Marban made 35 appearances for Class A Hickory during the 2011 season, his second in the Rangers organization, but found himself out of affiliated ball for the next three seasons, appearing in 122 games for Florence and Southern Maryland during that time.
"I've learned so much throughout those three years in independent ball and developed so much as a pitcher," he said. "That's all I really wanted was one more opportunity, at what I think is the best I've been in my career, to give it one more shot. If things work out, great. If they don't, it's something you can accept with yourself knowing that you were at your best and did what you could."
Through his first month in the ABL, Marban's numbers are among the best in the league. After his five straight scoreless appearances to start the season, the righty has allowed runs in two of his last three but still boasts a 1-0 record, a save and a 2.25 ERA. He's struck out 13 batters and limited opposing hitters to a paltry .081 average. Walks have been Marban's biggest issue with 10 in his 12 innings.
"I got off to a good start," he said. "I felt good out there. I wasn't really overthinking too much. My last few outings, I guess I've put some extra pressure on myself that I don't need. I've struggled a little bit. I've had a problem this year with my walks, but I was just coming out here trying to have fun, trying to get better throwing the ball over the plate. I've been successful doing so, so it's just going back to that mindset to continue and have a great rest of the season."
While the promise of Spring Training in Fort Myers awaits in February, Marban is ready to tend to the business of helping the Heat defend their Claxton Shield while thankful for the circumstances that have given him a long-awaited second chance.
"It is pretty crazy it took going halfway around the world to get an opportunity," he said. "At first when I was here, I was a little homesick because I hadn't been home for a while. I was honestly thinking about going home, but I talked to my family, and they told me to stick it out. Big things happened.
"Thank God I stayed."
In brief
'Stache swagger: Blue Jays import Jack Murphy and his legendary mustache were named the league's Round 5 Player of the Week. Murphy batted .667 (8-for-12) with a home run, double and four RBIs in three contests against Sydney, helping his Canberra Cavalry earn a series split with the Blue Sox. Murphy, who played 53 games for Double-A New Hampshire and Triple-A Buffalo last season, has gained a cult following in Canberra due to his signature facial hair and flair for the dramatic in his three ABL seasons. It marked his first weekly award of the 2014-15 campaign.
Back in blue: After making his Team Australia debut in the IBAF 21U World Cup in Taiwan last month, Twins prospect and Melbourne native Sam Gibbons returned to his hometown Aces in the ABL's Round 5. The 20-year-old right-hander earned a victory in his first start of the season on Sunday, allowing two runs on five hits over seven innings while striking out six to beat Brisbane. Gibbons went 4-5 with a 3.88 ERA in 12 outings for Rookie-level Elizabethton last season.
Comeback trail: Former Rockies top prospect Chin-hui Tsao is attempting a comeback with the Adelaide Bite. Tsao, who came up in the Colorado organization and became the first Taiwanese pitcher in MLB history when he debuted on July 25, 2003, has not pitched in the Major Leagues since 2007 with the Dodgers or in the Minors since 2008 while in the Royals system. Tsao was embroiled in a game-fixing scandal in his native Taiwan in 2009 while pitching with the Brother Elephants of the Chinese Professional Baseball League. A report last week from The [Adelaide] Advertiser said the 33-year-old hit 95 miles per hour on radar guns in a recent showing for scouts that led to his signing with the Bite.
Information theory — the discipline that gave us digital communication and data compression — also put cryptography on a secure mathematical foundation. Since 1948, when the paper that created information theory first appeared, most information-theoretic analyses of secure schemes have depended on a common assumption.
Unfortunately, as a group of researchers at MIT and the National University of Ireland (NUI) at Maynooth demonstrated in a paper presented at the recent International Symposium on Information Theory (view PDF), that assumption is false. In a follow-up paper being presented this fall at the Asilomar Conference on Signals and Systems, the same team shows that, as a consequence, the wireless card readers used in many keyless-entry systems may not be as secure as previously thought.
In information theory, the concept of information is intimately entwined with that of entropy. Two digital files might contain the same amount of information, but if one is shorter, it has more entropy. If a compression algorithm — such as WinZip or gzip — worked perfectly, the compressed file would have the maximum possible entropy. That means that it would have the same number of 0s and 1s, and the way in which they were distributed would be totally unpredictable. In information-theoretic parlance, it would be perfectly uniform.
Traditionally, information-theoretic analyses of secure schemes have assumed that the source files are perfectly uniform. In practice, they rarely are, but they're close enough that it appeared that the standard mathematical analyses still held.
“We thought we'd establish that the basic premise that everyone was using was fair and reasonable,” says Ken Duffy, one of the researchers at NUI. “And it turns out that it's not.” On both papers, Duffy is joined by his student Mark Christiansen; Muriel Médard, a professor of electrical engineering at MIT; and her student Flávio du Pin Calmon.
The problem, Médard explains, is that information-theoretic analyses of secure systems have generally used the wrong notion of entropy. They relied on so-called Shannon entropy, named after the founder of information theory, Claude Shannon, who taught at MIT from 1956 to 1978.
Shannon entropy is based on the average probability that a given string of bits will occur in a particular type of digital file. In a general-purpose communications system, that's the right type of entropy to use, because the characteristics of the data traffic will quickly converge to the statistical averages. Although Shannon's seminal 1948 paper dealt with cryptography, it was primarily concerned with communication, and it used the same measure of entropy in both discussions.
But in cryptography, the real concern isn't with the average case but with the worst case. A codebreaker needs only one reliable correlation between the encrypted and unencrypted versions of a file in order to begin to deduce further correlations. In the years since Shannon's paper, information theorists have developed other notions of entropy, some of which give greater weight to improbable outcomes. Those, it turns out, offer a more accurate picture of the problem of codebreaking.
When Médard, Duffy and their students used these alternate measures of entropy, they found that slight deviations from perfect uniformity in source files, which seemed trivial in the light of Shannon entropy, suddenly loomed much larger. The upshot is that a computer turned loose to simply guess correlations between the encrypted and unencrypted versions of a file would make headway much faster than previously expected.
“It's still exponentially hard, but it's exponentially easier than we thought,” Duffy says. One implication is that an attacker who simply relied on the frequencies with which letters occur in English words could probably guess a user-selected password much more quickly than was previously thought. “Attackers often use graphics processors to distribute the problem,” Duffy says. “You'd be surprised at how quickly you can guess stuff.”
In their Asilomar paper, the researchers apply the same type of mathematical analysis in a slightly different way. They consider the case in which an attacker is, from a distance, able to make a “noisy” measurement of the password stored on a credit card with an embedded chip or a key card used in a keyless-entry system.
“Noise” is the engineer's term for anything that degrades an electromagnetic signal — such as physical obstructions, out-of-phase reflections or other electromagnetic interference. Noise comes in lots of different varieties: The familiar white noise of sleep aids is one, but so is pink noise, black noise and more exotic-sounding types of noise, such as power-law noise or Poisson noise.
In this case, rather than prior knowledge about the statistical frequency of the symbols used in a password, the attacker has prior knowledge about the probable noise characteristics of the environment: Phase noise with one set of parameters is more probable than phase noise with another set of parameters, which in turn is more probable than Brownian noise, and so on. Armed with these statistics, an attacker could infer the password stored on the card much more rapidly than was previously thought.
“Some of the approximations that we're used to making, they make perfect sense in the context of traditional communication,” says Matthieu Bloch, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. “You design your system in a framework, and then you test it. But for crypto, you're actually trying to prove that it's robust to things you cannot test. So you have to be sure that your assumptions make sense from the beginning. And I think that going back to the assumptions is something people don't do often enough.”
Bloch doubts that the failure of the uniformity assumption means that cryptographic systems in wide use today are fundamentally insecure. “My guess is that it will show that some of them are slightly less secure than we had hoped, but usually in the process, we'll also figure out a way of patching them,” he says. The MIT and NUI researchers' work, he says, “is very constructive, because it's essentially saying, ‘Hey, we have to be careful.' But it also provides a methodology to go back and reanalyze all these things.”
Ukraine has detained Russia's military attache to Kiev on suspicion of spying and ordered the diplomat to leave the country, as the former Soviet republic wrestles with a pro-Russian armed uprising in the east.
The unnamed diplomat was detained on Wednesday while undertaking "intelligence activities", according to reports.
Ukraine accuses Russia of orchestrating the fall of towns and cities across its industrial east to pro-Russian separatists over the past month, spearheaded by well-organised gunmen in masks and military fatigues.
Ukraine's pro-Western leaders have conceded they were "helpless" to counter the fall of government buildings and police stations to the separatists in the Donbass coal and steel belt of eastern Ukraine , source of around a third of the country's industrial output.
Having seized key buildings in the capital of the easternmost province, Luhansk, on Tuesday, gunmen took control at dawn on Wednesday in the nearby towns of Horlivka and Alchevsk.
The International Monetary Fund overnight threw a $17 billion (£10 billion) lifeline to the recession-wracked country, whose president has admitted that authorities are powerless to prevent pro-Russian militants overrunning the east of the country.
The Washington-based IMF said that $3.2 billion would be available immediately, as the West tries to shore up the government in Kiev which has put its armed forces on "full combat alert" amid fears of a Russian invasion.
As tensions remained high, Ukraine staged a military drill in the government quarter in central Kiev early on Thursday, involving some 10 armoured personnel carriers and soldiers armed with Kalashnikov rifles.

Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, said "urgent action was necessary" to prop up the Ukrainian economy, which the fund predicts will shrink by 5 per cent this year, as the crisis takes its toll on industry and consumers.
The immediate deployment of aid may also help Kiev pay a bill to Russian state-owned gas firm Gazprom the company calculates at $3.5 billion.
Russia has threatened to turn off the taps to Ukraine – and by extension to several European countries – if the bill is not paid in full, amid the worst East-West showdown since the Cold War.
Talks were due to take place Friday in Warsaw between the European Union, Russia and Kiev over the gas dispute.
The IMF aid comes with strings attached, include slashing fuel subsidies, reducing endemic corruption and capping salary increases.
The package is part of a total rescue plan worth some $27 billion from Western powers for the former Soviet republic.
The deal was approved by the IMF's 24-member board, including a representative from Russia, which the West accuses of fomenting unrest in the eastern regions of the country to destabilise its neighbour.
The lifeline came as the country's interim president admitted the police was "helpless" after pro-Russian separatists tightened their grip on towns and cities in the east, spearheaded by armed men Kiev suspects are sent by the Kremlin.
On Wednesday, rebels stormed the town hall and police offices in the city of Gorlovka, adding to the dozen locations they control in the restive eastern regions.
Pro-Russian militants also seized the council building in the city of Alchevsk without encountering resistance.
The interior ministry said on Thursday that between 30 and 50 of its law enforcement officers were being held in the flashpoint city of Slavyansk, where militants are also detaining seven European monitors from the OSCE.
Interim president Oleksander Turchynov placed his forces on "full combat alert" in the face of what he called a "real threat" of Russia starting a war against the former Soviet republic.
He said the priority now was to stop the spread of what he called "terrorism," seemingly admitting much of the east was already lost.
Rebels in the east have vowed to hold a "referendum" on independence on May 11, two weeks before a nationwide presidential vote that US vice-president Joe Biden has described as "maybe the most important election in Ukrainian history".
Russia's president Vladimir Putin has denied his forces are operating in eastern Ukraine but Moscow has an estimated 40,000 troops parked on the border.
House Majority Whip Steve Scalise has been readmitted to the intensive care unit at MedStar Washington Hospital and is in serious condition, amid concerns of infection, the hospital said Wednesday night.
"Congressman Steve Scalise has been readmitted to the Intensive Care Unit at MedStar Washington Hospital Center due to new concerns for infection," the hospital said in an update. "His condition is listed as serious."
Update from @MedStarWHC on the condition of Majority Whip Steve Scalise: pic.twitter.com/YnEDhiX4gO — Rep. Steve Scalise (@SteveScalise) July 6, 2017
Scalise, who arrived at the hospital in critical condition after a gunshot wound to the hip at a congressional baseball practice in June, had been transferred out of the ICU on June 22 and downgraded to fair condition. Serious is the condition in between critical -- the worst state -- and fair, in medical terms.
The hospital said it would provide more details about Scalise's condition on Thursday.
Scalise, two members of the U.S. Capitol Police, a current GOP staffer and a lobbyist were injured in early June when a gunman opened fire on a GOP practice for a congressional baseball game. The other victims have since been released from the hospital, but doctors have said Scalise would take weeks to recover and be rehabilitated.
When he arrived at the hospital, Scalise was in "imminent risk of death," one doctor said.

A memo from Yale Law School's Veterans Legal Services Clinic finds that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs had the authority to protect veterans from institutions that use deceptive recruiting practices by denying GI Bill funds to those colleges. But the VA and other state approving agencies have failed to do so.
"Although the VA is responsible for overseeing education benefits for veterans, it has been slow to join other agencies in addressing deceptive practices, drawing criticism from congressional and veterans' leaders," said the memo.
The memo prompted Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, to call on the VA to act against deceptive recruitment by predatory colleges.
“The VA has a clear moral and legal obligation to identify fraudulent behavior at schools that enroll veterans,” said Blumenthal. “The VA should also partner with the Federal Trade Commission and other agencies to crack down on predatory for-profit schools so that veterans do not waste their hard-earned benefits on worthless degrees.”
Image caption The decision to privatise maintenance of Britain's nuclear weapons on the Clyde was made last year
Private contractors are to take over the maintenance of Britain's nuclear weapons on the Clyde.
The Ministry of Defence has signed a contract which will see 149 workers transfer to an alliance of companies, looking after Trident and Polaris weapons systems.
There are also to be 39 Royal Navy secondments.
They work at the Royal Navy Armament Depot at Coulport and the Strategic Weapon Support Building at Faslane.
Both facilities are part of HM Naval Base Clyde.
The consortium, known as ABL Alliance, is made up of companies that already work on defence contracts, led by AWE, along with Babcock and Lockheed Martin.
The decision to privatise the work was reached in May last year, when the MoD "decided the most effective way to sustain the workforce in the future was to use an experienced supplier within the private sector".
'Safety record'
The deal is a 15-year contract to outsource weapons support at Coulport and Faslane.
The jobs are in industrial and technical grades, warehousing and logistical support, along with supervisors and managers.
The MoD says it will continue to own the bases, and oversee security and activities at Coulport and Faslane, which will continue to be subject to the same safety regulation.
A spokesman said: "HM Naval Base Clyde has an excellent safety record and we are determined to maintain the highest standards of safety.
"The MoD will continue to own the Naval Base sites, including Coulport, and Naval Base Commander Clyde will retain overall responsibility for security and for the activities carried out at Coulport and the SWSB.
"The site will also continue to be a MoD Nuclear Authorised site, so will be subject to regulation by the Defence Nuclear Safety Regulator, the Office of Nuclear Regulation and other regulatory bodies."
A pronoun guideline document offered by Bard College encourages students to use the gender-neutral “Ze, Zim, Zir” pronouns.
Bard College's “Pronoun FAQ” document instructs students on how to approach their transgender and gender non-binary peers.
“To create a gender-inclusive environment for faculty, staff, students, and visitors, Bard College encourages all members of the campus community to indicate the pronouns they use for themselves, if desired, in classes, residence halls, workplaces, electronic communications, and other settings, and strongly encourages community members to respect pronoun usage,” the document reads.
The document encourages Bard College community members to use gender-neutral terms like “folks” or “all people” instead of gender-specific language like “guys” or “gals.” Such specific language only serves to isolate those they may not identify by gender-specific terms, the document argues.
“A pronoun is a word used to refer to an individual or group instead of using their name (grammatically speaking, pronouns are used as a substitute for a noun or a noun phrase). Pronouns can be in the first-person singular (I, me) or plural (we, us); second-person singular or plural (you); and the third-person singular (e.g., she/her, he/him, they/them, ze/hir) or plural (they/them). Some people go by just one set of pronouns, others use more than one set,” it continues.
The document explains the concept of non-binary pronouns and how they help individuals who identify outside of the “gender binary” feel more comfortable. The gender binary, according to the document, is a social system that encourages everyone to act according to a narrow set of male/female behaviors and expressions.
The International Space Station, which will mark its 16th year in orbit this year, cost an estimated $150 billion to build and maintain (with $75 billion invested by the US alone), but private companies have only spent $14,505 on research performed in the station's orbital laboratory.
That meager amount will exacerbate the challenge of funding the station's operations in the years ahead. The number emerged from an audit of the ISS program by the inspector general at NASA, the US space agency.
The audit found that NASA is likely low-balling the cost estimates for keeping the ISS aloft and fully functioning, as it transitions to relying on the private sector to transport astronauts and cargo to the station. Given the costs, it is key to maximize the benefits—and one of the challenges is that the Center for Advancement of Science in Space, the organization in charge of managing the laboratory onboard ISS since 2011, has had minimal success in recruiting private firms to perform research in micro-gravity conditions.
Despite offering financial incentives, CASIS has attracted very little interest—just the $14,505 mentioned above, along with unfulfilled pledges for $8.2 million in funding. The audit identifies several reasons for this, including advances that make it possible to perform experiments on things like protein crystallization in earthbound labs. But the biggest obstacle is that NASA initially said that it would own both the patents and the data related to any research on the station, a major buzz-kill for companies interested in applied research.
In 2012, the NASA relinquished its claim on patents, but reserved the rights to research data. The move didn't prove effective at spurring more research. Last year, NASA asked Congress to change the law governing space research to make clear that users of the laboratory retain full rights to the results of their research. “These revisions would help to alleviate commercial stakeholders' concerns over data rights, which in turn may increase commercial utilization of the ISS,” the audit notes, but no bill has been introduced to make this change, and Congressional leaders have said it will not take up space legislation until next year.
There is at least some good news: Utilization of research space on the station and the time spent on research by astronauts has been on an upward trend, with 80.7% of the lab space utilized and 44.3 hours of research performed per week during the most recently completed mission.
The tranquility of my Saturday morning was disrupted — and that's putting it mildly — when I read on Glenn Reynolds' popular right-wing “Instapundit” blog that we can learn important “Lessons About Iran From Hitler.” To know that we have yet another New Hitler in our midst is alarming indeed. Reynolds' link takes one to an even more jarring warning about the Persian menace, by David Goldman, that extensively compares the fallen Nazi leader to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and argues that because both figures are maniacal monsters presiding over a dying nation, only a full-scale military attack can stop them. ”However much it costs in Iranian blood and well-being, it's still worth it,” Goldman casually decrees.
Sociopathic calls for aggressive attacks on other nations and cheap invocations of Hitler are not worth commenting on: neocons churn those out reflexively. But what is worth noting is the event Goldman is flagging as proof of Iran's aggressive intentions: “Iran is planning to double its defense budget even though its currency is collapsing,” he warns. A doubling of its defense budget! Who among us can remain calm in the face of such naked militarism?

That Ahmadinejad claims that Iran will increase its military budget for next year by 127% was widely reported this week. For a variety of reasons relating to Iran's economic difficulties, that plan is quite infeasible — typical Ahmadinejad blustering — but let's assume for the moment that it will actually happen. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) Military Expenditure Database, Iran's total annual military spending is $7 billion; an increase of 127% would take it to $15.8 billion — also known as: less 2% of total U.S. military spending (which was $698 billion for fiscal year 2010). According to Defense News, Iran's official military budget for 2011 is actually $12 billion; an increase of 127% would bring it to $27.2 billion, also known as: less than 4% of U.S. military spending. Taking the largest number possible for Iranian military spending (the one provided by Defense News), behold the frightening, Nazi-like military threat Iran poses:

Thousands of baby boomers aging alone are looking for families to “adopt” them.
“Elder orphans,” or unbefriended adults, are seniors without children, partners or close relatives. Now there's a new Facebook group with more than 5,000 members to help them find support as they age.
Although many members value their independence, most will eventually need care or assistance with basic needs — help that most seniors depend upon family members to provide.
Carol Marak, editor of the website SeniorCare.com, started this new social media initiative.
“How many families are maybe without an older individual, or maybe they have lost their parents or they have lost their grandmother? Of course, it requires a lot of forethought, and even some help with legal matters, but I think adopting is an option,” Marak told WBUR's Here and Now.
As the massive baby boomer population ages, similar support groups for seniors will likely become more common.
About 20 percent of U.S. women reach their 50s without having children, up from ten percent in the 1970s, according to a troubling report on caregiving from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.
One-third of middle-age adults are single as they approach their retirement years, after never marrying, divorce or widowhood.
The Elder Orphans group is restricted to individuals 55 and older who live without a spouse or children.
“Most of the members are very grateful to have found us, and realize that there are so many more like them,” Marack said. “We all share the same grievances, the same hardships and challenges.”
LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- George Harrison's closest friends and family gathered in Hollywood on Tuesday to dedicate the late Beatle's star on the Walk of Fame.
From left, musicians Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne and Paul McCartney join Harrison's relatives for dedication of his star. more photos »
"There's someone here from every important stage of George's life and career," Harrison's widow, Olivia, said.
Harrison, who was 58 when he died of cancer in 2001, becomes the second Beatle with a Hollywood star. John Lennon was the first.
The new star is next to the iconic Hollywood headquarters of Capitol Records, the distributor of much of Harrison's music for the past five decades.
Tuesday's ceremony coincided with the Capitol/EMI announcement that it will release Harrison's first solo greatest hits collection -- "Let it Roll: Songs by George Harrison" -- on June 16.
Actor Tom Hanks said the world changed for him in January 1964 when he heard his first Beatles song.
"That's when we escaped the doldrums and moved on to a brighter, better, more joyful future," Hanks said.
Superstar musicians Paul McCartney, Tom Petty, Joe Walsh and Jeff Lynne attended the star's dedication, but they did not address the crowd.
Scores of Harrison fans showed up for the event, with some traveling from as far as Liverpool, England.
"We all have deep feelings for George, because he was such a deep-feeling person," Olivia Harrison said.
"He was a beautiful, mystical man, living in a material world," she said. "He was funny as the day is long and just as perplexing."
His son, Dhani, 30, joked about his father's star.
"It's good, it's lovely and it's nice and shiny and I'm glad it's not outside of Frederick's of Hollywood," he said.
Harrison was just 15 when schoolmate Paul McCartney asked him to join his and John Lennon's band, the Quarrymen. The band evolved into the Beatles and the rest is history.
Harrison played lead guitar and sang for the Beatles. Songs penned by Harrison included "Taxman," "While My Guitar Gently Weeps," "Something" and "Here Comes the Sun."
Harrison was a pioneer of what has since become a tradition of rock stars supporting charitable causes with their music. In 1971, he helped organize the star-studded "Concert for Bangladesh" at New York's Madison Square Garden.
In addition to his post-Beatles solo career, Harrison played with several groups -- most notably the Traveling Wilburys, alongside Petty, Lynne, Roy Orbison and Bob Dylan.

The bustle of a vegetable market with its farm-fresh veggies and fruits have been romanticised in books, cookery shows, and travel guides. So much so that the image created makes you want to experience the energy of the ‘sabzi mandi' (vegetable market). However, for Sharath Loganathan, IIM-Kozhikode alumnus and co-founder of Ninjacart, a visit to the market was an eye-opener to the darker side of the much romanticised experience. He was appalled at the amount of vegetables and fruits that were being dumped as waste. Recalling that experience Sharath said-
“When we went to the market, we discovered that the market was in total chaos. A lot of vegetables were lying as waste, and people trampled over them.”
Team Ninjacart
It is hard to put a figure to how much food is lost and wasted in India today due to lack of adequate infrastructure; however, a 2011 report by a UN body, FAO, puts wastage of fruits and vegetables as high as 45 percent of produce (post-harvest to distribution) for developing Asian countries like India. In India, where over 58 percent of the rural households depend on agriculture as their principal means of livelihood, such wastage proves to be expensive.
Thirukumaran Nagaranjan, also an IIM-Kozhikode alumnus and co-founder of Ninjacart, who was accompanying Sharath, realised another glaring flaw in the system. He told us-
“Inefficiencies could be seen in almost every aspect. There were a lot of middlemen involved, there was no price transparency whatsoever. The produce of the farmers exchanged a lot of hands before reaching the eventual consumer, which resulted in farmers hardly making any money in this whole scenario. We felt this is a market which has huge potential, has tremendous scope of development and is literally untapped. We almost instantly realised there is a lot of value addition that can be done in this space by bringing technological and operational efficiencies.”
And thus was born Ninjacart, an online platform through which retailers and merchants can source fruits and vegetables directly from the farmers. Ninjacart has successfully done away with middlemen, commission agents and auction agents present in “mandis”. This startup also provides an efficient price discovery platform to the farmers. Since Ninjacart ensures that the produce reaches their clients effectively via an efficient and technologically driven supply chain, they have struck a win-win situation. Kartheeswaran KK, an IIM-Ahmedabad alumnus and one of the six co-founders of Ninjacart, explains-
“Technology is involved at every single step in Ninjacart. All the operations at Ninjacart are carried out and monitored using technology. All the information of planning, sales, and warehouse operations is stored in the system. We have an in-house Enterprise Resource Planning and Management System. Every item and and activity is tracked almost in real time. For managing all these platforms we have a web-interface and various mobile applications.”
Pickup Process at Ninjacart
Though Ninjacart started its operation in May 2015 as a hyper-local grocery delivery company, after six months of operation, the co-founders including Ashutosh Vikram, IIM-Kozhikode alumnus, Sachin P Jose, with over three years of experience in UI/UX and Vasudevan Chinnathambi, SOIL alumnus, Sharath, Thirukumaran and Kartheeswaran, felt that the backend supply chain of fruits and vegetables was broken and inefficient. So, by December 2015, the company pivoted the model to become a full-fledged Business To Business (B2B) marketplace, changing the way kirana stores and supermarkets source their supply. Ashutosh says,
“As of June 2016, we had a customer base of over 400 retail stores and restaurants in Bangalore. Our average monthly tonnage is about 1.4k tons and monthly revenue of around Rs 4 crore.”
Bangalore-based Farmily, co-founded by Karthik Natarajan; Farm Taaza, founded by Silicon Valley veterans; and Gurgaon- based fresh2all, founded by Purnima Rao, are some other players in the B2B fresh produce supply chain. According to Vasudevan, Ninjacart is the only player in this space that delivers quality goods in a span as short as eight hours.
Ninjacart, which is funded by Accel Partners, Qualcomm Ventures, M&S Partners (Singapore) and Zop Smart, has two distribution centres – one near Hoskote and another in Jigani. The startup has many collection centres across villages surrounding Bangalore. Ninjacart currently serves Whitefield, Marathalli, Bellandur, Indiranagar, HAL, HSR, Koramangala, BTM, Madiwala, and Bannerghatta road, all in Bangalore.
Ninjacart with farmers
Every stakeholder who is a part of the Ninjacart ecosystem benefits.
The farmers (suppliers) are able to sell their produce at a better price than the market without being exploited by the middleman through a one point sale. The farmers receive their payment immediately via a bank transfer. The farmers are also spared from dealing with the uncertainties of price, associated with selling in markets. Ninjacart procures all the produce through a fair grading procedure. Ninjacart sends their vehicles along with crates to farmer locations to bring goods to their collection centers, free of cost.
Shopkeepers and restaurants (customers) get fresh and good quality vegetables and fruits at their doorstep at competitive prices without having to visit the market very early in the morning.
Ninjacart also holds seminars to educate farmers on the working of the market and fair pricing. Sachin explained to us how “Rythu abhivrudhi karyakrama” (Farmer Development Programme) works-
“We educate the farmers about the exact market prices and how we bring transparency in the whole process. We also discuss good varieties of seeds and suggest best practices that a few farmers follow to get good yield.”
Ninjacart Farmer Training Programme
When one is determined to disrupt a market and bring efficiencies, others firmly established in the system become uncomfortable. In the case of Ninjacart, it is the age-old market mandi commission agents and local transport middlemen who regularly attempt at disturbing operations. The team frequently receives threatening phone calls to stop operations. But, thanks to Ninjacart's dedicated field team and farmers, this startup is rapidly spreading its roots. In the coming months, Ninjacart plans to expand their distribution throughout Bangalore and expand to Chennai and Hyderabad.
Darebin resident Maria Poletti is disappointed. Credit:Meredith O'Shea How could this happen? Because the government handballed the fine print of how it would apply to local councils to sort out, but retained the ability to approve or knock back their proposals. Key interest groups - first-home buyers, downsizers, long-term residents, urban planners, small developers and real estate agents - are already sceptical about the supposed benefits of Plan Melbourne, it is emerging. How might the dwellings around you be developed? What will it mean for your amenity and streetscapes? What will it mean for the value of your property or your future choices? This week, we trawl through the inner and middle ring suburbs. We meet those celebrating the new scheme, and others warning that the champagne promises may be a little premature; that Plan Melbourne may turn out to be yet another big planning headache. AS the secretary of the Beaumaris Conservation Society, Chris Sutton has been fighting local inappropriate development for years.
He is delighted his south-eastern suburb has been given the protection of the Neighbourhood Residential Zone (NRZ) and that battles at VCAT over future developments may be over. The NRZ in Bayside restricts development to two per lot, with a mandatory height limit of two storeys. Mr Sutton would also like to see minimum lot sizes restricted to 400 square metres, as well as supporting controls to ensure future dual occupancy development respects neighbourhood character. ''But it's a start, and the zones will evolve over time.'' His local council will be hoping this resident satisfaction is replicated across much of the electorate: the City of Bayside has requested 83 per cent of its suburbs be allocated to the highest protection NRZ, and is waiting to hear if the Planning Minister has approved. The council has been working for years on a housing policy that would ensure that development would not ''destroy'' the neighbourhood character of this historic area of Melbourne. Chris Sutton, of Beaumaris, is pleased with how the suburb is being protected. Credit:Paul Jeffers ''We believe that the distinctive neighbourhoods of Bayside are worth protecting, not just for the people who live there but for all Melburnians,'' says Bayside mayor Laurence Evans.
Bayside Council has planned for another 7500 dwellings to be built in its municipality by 2031, which is 1000 more than it was originally allocated, he says, and a reasonable share of the 165,000 that is expected to be absorbed by the whole of the southern region by 2031, he argues. ''You can't really compare Bayside to huge municipalities like Cardinia and Casey that have the capacity to absorb a lot more new dwellings than we do,'' he says. Another wealthy municipality that has carved out a high proportion of its suburbs to the most protected zone is inner-eastern Boroondara, with 76 per cent of its residential land allocated to the NRZ. Mayor Coral Ross says the figure is justified because the heritage, neighbourhood character and gardens of the leafy eastern suburbs are integral to the city's reputation as the world's most liveable city. She says there are ''ample opportunities to accommodate additional population in appropriate locations without wrecking the character valued by generations''. But it's a protection that's been unequally applied. In inner-northern Darebin, resident Maria Poletti is frustrated that just 36 per cent of the municipality is to be protected under the NRZ. As a member of the Darebin Appropriate Development Association, Ms Poletti has been campaigning for years to protect the streets around her home in Preston from a rash of apartment developments. ''They've been knocking down lovely old family homes and putting up one and two-bedroom apartment developments that are completely changing the character of our suburbs.'' Ms Poletti says she had hoped that the new planning reforms would have protected her area from future development. ''The minister said he believed in protecting family homes and backyards, and said that 50 per cent of the suburbs would be protected under the new reforms.'' However, when it became clear that Glen Eira and Boroondara were going to get around 80 per cent of their suburbs protected, she began to suspect council areas such as Darebin would be getting a lot less. ''It's just been really frustrating that the rules seem to have been changed and the character of our suburbs are going to be further eroded by development.'' Among those who would love to be able to buy one of those family homes in Preston are Emily Krisenthal, an associate university lecturer, and Stuart Harris, a high school teacher. The couple is currently renting a home with a big back yard, which would easily sell for $650,000. That's a price well out of their home-buying budget. If they wanted to stay in Preston, they know a more likely option would be one of the two-bedroom units Ms Poletti is objecting to. They are looking further afield in Thomastown, Lalor and even Beechworth - although they fear what that would mean for their employment. ''It's hard thinking we'd have to think about starting a family in a place without any yard. But we really love Preston and after five years we're really starting to feel at home in our neighbourhood.''
Meanwhile in Box Hill in the City of Whitehorse, resident David Harris has been watching house after house in the streets around his 1950s weatherboard home falling to bulldozers, to be replaced by new project homes and higher density developments. It's a trend that is likely to accelerate now his area has been zoned General Residential (GRZ), which allows medium density development of up to three storeys. Mr Harris says he's not anti-development per se, but he's frustrated that the houses - among the tens of thousands built in the middle ring of suburbia to cope with the flood of new residents after World War II - have been described as ''obsolete'' by some urban planners. He suspects that is more a matter of fashion than design, quality or efficiency. They are not valued as highly as the Californian bungalows and Edwardians in other parts of the suburb, but 1950s houses ''are practical, cheap to run and homely'', Mr Harris says. ''In an age of excess, it seems those qualities are regarded as obsolete.'' What concerns Mr Harris even more is the developments replacing the modest weatherboards. ''What we have at the moment are greedy speculators squeezing the most out of what they can get. It's the same as in the 1960s when they were building flats on large blocks in places like Thornbury. Residents objected to them at the time and 50 years on you can see how right they were.'' Even those satisfied by a high level of protection afforded their streetscapes by an NRZ may have a shock in store, some experts say.
While higher-density developments of three and four storeys can be built in specific areas, especially around neighbourhood shopping centres and railway stations, in many suburbs there are now strict restrictions on what can be built in suburban streets. The development of three-per-lot villa units or townhouses in the suburban street - common in many suburbs in recent decades - is likely to be a thing of the past, and those that currently exist are likely to skyrocket in price. That's likely to affect a growing group of residents that would have liked to stay in their suburb, but not in the big family home they currently own - the downsizers. Smaller homes suitable for older people wanting to downsize are as rare as hen's teeth in municipalities like Boroondara and Bayside. In North Balwyn, a three-bedroom villa unit sold recently for $1,220,000, fought over by four bidders, all of them locals wanting to scale down, says agent Julian Tonkin of Jellis Craig. ''There's a big demand for these kinds of properties from local people wanting to downsize, but those kinds of developments in North Balwyn are really rare so competition is pretty fierce,'' he says. Spiralling land values, plus the uncertainty over whether such developments will be financially viable for developers, are likely to quash further supply, he says. An ageing population in Bayside is also increasingly desperate for such accommodation, says buyers' agent Kristen Hatt. ''There are lots of older people in Bayside who would like to be able to move out and move into a smaller dwelling. They want a unit with two bedrooms and a study, a bit of a yard and a double garage.'' But she fears that the new zones mean developers won't be able to build those kinds of developments. The mayor of Bayside says older people who want to downsize will be well catered for in the General Residential Zones around the railway stations and shopping centres in the municipality. ''They'll be able to live in apartments and townhouses around those activity centres where they'll have easy access to train stations and shops and other facilities,'' he says. However, Ms Hatt says that living in an apartment would not be their first choice for her clients: ''They don't like the idea of dealing with body corporates and lifts, of having no yard and of living so close to neighbours they don't know.''
In the south-eastern municipality of Glen Eira, where 78 per cent of the residential area has been locked up in the NRZ, Elsternwick resident Murray Mehmet, says he fears the new zoning rules will further restrict his opportunities to find suitable local accommodation when he wants to downsize. In his early 60s, he says the kinds of developments being built are not suitable. ''People like me who are living in large period homes, they want to downsize to something of good quality and with a bit of style, and in a good location. But there seems to be a real mismatch between what is being developed and what the demand is from people in the suburb. Most of it seems to be built for investors, and it's of a really low quality.'' In Glen Eira, the GRZ that allows moderate density is restricted to ribbon developments along the main arterial roads such as Kooyong and Inkerman roads. Mr Mehmet says he believes higher density development should be allowed a block or so back from those roads, that would enable multi-unit developments to be more appealing to potential downsizers. Elsternwick, with good infrastructure, transport and facilities, would be an ideal location for more European-style medium-density development, Mr Mehmet says. ''We don't want those ugly six-packs, but you can have well-designed developments that don't detract from the area, but in fact make the streetscape more interesting.'' Even in outer suburban Knox, where nearly 30 per cent of residential areas may be allocated to the NRZ, Nawzat Baroun-Agob, a registered builder, says it could become even more difficult to carry out the small-scale developments he and his wife Baydaa Kokab have been building for the past decade. ''It's really going to affect subdividing because there's demand in the established areas to have more properties like units or houses there,'' he said. ''With the Bush [Suburban zones], it was hard before, and they're going to make it much harder.''
Mr Baroun-Agob said the proposed zones by the council meant some properties were no longer able to be subdivided, while homes on larger blocks that can be would continue to increase in value. Small developers aren't the only ones to feel the brunt of the restrictions: they may even counterintuitively devalue properties, Jellis Craig agent Julian Tonkin says, especially for those that have clearly reached the end of their usable life, but that will be too expensive to redevelop as townhouses under the new rules. As developers are excluded from suburbs like Brighton and Camberwell, they will move their operations to middle-ring suburbs such as Oakleigh, Box Hill and Glen Waverley. However, the moderate developments encouraged under the GRZ could impact the value of property in those areas, says property valuer Greville Pabst, of WBP Property Group. ''Over time, the character [of those areas] will change, and when that happens, I don't think they're going to be desirable places necessarily to live in,'' he says. Planning consultant Colleen Peterson says that's not necessarily the case - if developments are built sensitively to fit in with the character of the community. ''It is entirely possible to build high quality medium density housing that is responsive to its suburban environment and to neighbourhood character.''
Planner Rob Milner believes Australia needs to look more to Europe as a guide for how to create higher density suburbs that have a strong sense ofcommunity. ''In Australia we are wedded to this idea of low density suburbs, but what that will inevitably mean is that we're going to end up with what is more like Asian style cities, with their huge apartment towers, rather than well-designed smaller-scale apartment developments throughout the suburbs.''

Here's a question that, six or seven months ago, would have sounded absolutely absurd: Would Dallas actually use Tony Romo in a "mop-up" game at the end of the season?
The scenario: Dallas continues to roll and clinches their first-round bye. There is a game against the Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field to close out the season which is otherwise meaningless and head coach Jason Garrett wants to rest his starters.
Romo is obviously next in line to take snaps behind Dak Prescott. The team also has Mark Sanchez.
What makes the most sense? There is a lot to consider...
Scenario 1: Play Romo because he needs live reps: The Dallas Cowboys have the best record in football but are not unbeatable. Prescott is on an incredible run, but sooner or later, every rookie gets figured out by defensive coordinators and goes through an adjustment process. The great ones adjust quickly. Let's pretend Dallas is struggling mightily against a good defensive line in the playoffs and Garrett, along with offensive coordinator Scott Linehan, decide that reverting back to a two-minute version of Dallas' offense circa 2014 would be more effective.
The only problem is, Romo has not prepared as a starter once this season and has not taken any live snaps.
Owner Jerry Jones seemed to get on this Monday when asked about the situation.
"I want to do what gives us the best chance to have Tony contribute to a championship," Jones said Tuesday on 105.3 The Fan in Dallas, via the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. "I do want Tony to be ready to go in case that Dak should have an issue, health wise. That gives us strength going into the playoffs.
"Not from the standpoint of necessarily protecting Dak ... but from the standpoint of having Tony the readiest to come in and play would be my quick assessment."
Romo simply cannot be ready unless he has at least one start under his belt, though this scenario obviously comes with some risks. Dallas wanted to get out ahead of Romo's return this season so as not to make Prescott feel like someone was lurking over his shoulder. If Romo performs well in mop-up duty, it could create just that.
Scenario 2: Let Prescott finish the season to maximize his reps and risk him getting hurt: Just like Romo needs time with the first-string offense, so does Prescott. He's been light years ahead of his rookie counterparts thanks to an incredible work ethic and understanding of the game. But in this stage of quarterback development, every experience is new. Every twist in the game plan and scenario is different than it was a week ago or a month ago. Dallas may decide that Prescott is still too green to take a week off.
Scenario 3: Start Mark Sanchez in any mop-up situation to avoid insulting Romo: Perhaps there is a concern over optics. While Romo doesn't seem like the kind of person who would get upset over starting in a meaningless end-of-season game, Dallas may fear that it will look disrespectful to their franchise quarterback. Romo has already handled the situation with aplomb and Dallas is treating him like franchise royalty. Franchise royalty, however, does not expose itself behind a group of second and third-string offensive linemen against a blitz-happy Jim Schwartz in the season finale.
WASHINGTON—After piling the last of his Campaign for Liberty signs in the back of a beat-up Ford truck Thursday, Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) once again abandoned his candidacy for president and rode on out toward the low western sun, but not before vowing to come back to Washington "when [the country] is ready." "When the river swirls and the wind blows, and when uncontrollable inflation forces us to revert to the gold standard, and the Federal Reserve bank is exposed as the unconstitutional, neofascist cabal it really is, you'll see me coming over that hill," said Paul, leaving a dusty cowboy hat and a stack of "no" votes on his seat in the House of Representatives. "But don't you fret, America. If you ever feel like your government is getting too big or too intrusive, just give a little whistle, and there I'll be. I'll be there quicker'n you can spit." Although no one has seen or heard from the Texas congressman since Thursday, sources report the Ron Paul for President campaign has gained an additional $2.3 million in contributions since his disappearance.

Photo to painting adobe Photoshop CC
Photo to painting adobe Photoshop CC. In this Photoshop tutorial, in theory, we look at the process of creating the painting “The intention Seductive» ( «Seductive Intent»). The lesson is designed to have advanced Photoshop users.
Start with simple elements; If the composition is not obtained in the early stages, then as the addition of new parts it will improve. Do not be afraid to erase and repaint, you can always revert to the original version. Take small breaks in the work, as your eyes tend to tire and get used to mistakes.
In this tutorial, I used a photo from Concept Art. At the beginning of the work necessary to make a sketch of our photos. Below is an example of the techniques I used to keep proportions.
HOME |ABOUT US | CONTACT US | REQUEST A QUOTE | FREE TRIAL
“Guide” system.
To get the right proportions, I use the so-called ” Guide ” (markings). To begin, we open our image. Using the line marking ” the Ctrl + the R “, to highlight the most important parts of the image. For example, I marked out her face on main parts: the left eye, right eye, nose, ear, and the same goes for the hands, torso, legs, etc. The more carefully you divide the image, the easier it will be to make the right proportion.
Now, please be patient. Marking up our image, save it as ” ref.psd ” and once again as the ” cg.psd “. Delete the picture with ” cg.psd “, only to leave marks on the white background. Now open ” ref.psd “, for convenience align both windows and start to do a sketch on a blank canvas – ” cg.psd ” (sketch create a new layer). I always start to sketch a face, zooming to 200% . For difficult areas (hands, face) always choose the zoom as much as possible.
Now that the sketch is ready, we proceed to its coloring. Create a new layer beneath the thumbnail. It is best to set the opacity of the layer thumbnail in the 50% . Select the color palette. I chose the darker shades for the skin and the background. If you already have experience in creating such images, then use their palette skin. In this case, it is desirable to take 3 or 4 colors (two medium tone, one primary and one shadow) that is sufficient.
Next, distribute the colors within the meaning of the picture, as you see fit, only Make sure that you pick the right color. The possible use of some of the background colors on the main figure combines elements of the foreground to the background.
Working with layers.
In order that would not get confused, group all the layers into folders, for example all the layers of our figure in the group of ” girl ” and the same with the background.
Mix colors.
Now that we have set the color, you can start to mix them. For this I use a brush with 50% of the stiffness and 50% transparency, anti-aliasing to get the color, repeat the process to achieve the desired result.
Detailing.
Let us further detail; it is necessary to identify those parts that are the focus falls (in this case a person). Soften shades transitions. Details such as the clothing items are added on separate layers.
Color and light.
Now we need to combine our song, it needs to show some color with the background on the skin of our girls (make a new layer with the blending mode of the Color (Color) and the layer opacity 10 – 20% ). Do not be afraid to use color to avoid monotony. At this stage, I detailed the drawing table and said light source, but note that the light enters the left of our composition all three main object of the picture: table, figure, background. Is trying to properly distribute the light in the picture and achieve realistic effects.
For realistic skin girl using turquoise in the place to which falls the main focus (use low transparency 3 – 5% ).
Clarification.
Now that our picture is almost ready, pay attention to the small missing items. Do not be afraid of anything, still better late than never. Show your work friends, ask them to say what is missing, if need be, add missing elements.
Adding noise.
For more spectacular paintings, add noise (noise), which will provide relief:
Create a new layer and fill it with: RGB 128 ; Now the Filter> the Noise> the Add noise (Filter> Noise> Add Noise) and put 400%; Set the mode mixing layer on Overlay (overlap) and transparency 3 – 10%.
That's all.
An illegal immigrant faces life in prison after he was convicted on Monday of murdering a family of five with a hammer in a sanctuary city while committing robbery and burglary.
Vietnamese national Binh Thai Luc, 41, was facing eviction for not paying his rent when he murdered the family in 2012, shortly after he lost money earlier in the evening at a casino.
The San Francisco Chronicle reports:
The victims' bludgeoned bodies were found covered in blood and household cleaning products in various rooms of the row house on Howth Street, which had been flooded with water. The damage was so severe and the scene so chaotic that investigators didn't initially know if they were dealing with a quintuple murder or a murder-suicide. Prosecutors said Luc used a hammer to commit one of the worst mass homicides in modern San Francisco history, though the weapon was never found.
“This was a very gruesome, brutal murder, and we're pleased we're getting some accountability for the family and for the community,” District Attorney George Gascón said.
Luc was supposed to be deported in 2006 when he was released from prison after serving nearly a decade for “robbery and assault with a deadly weapon for the 1996-armed robbery of a Chinese restaurant in San Jose,” the Daily Mail stated.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said that they were never provided with documents from the Vietnamese government needed to process his removal from the U.S., and as a result he was released back into the community in 2006.
Both San Francisco and San Jose (located in Santa Clara County) are sanctuary cities, meaning they do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities to remove illegal aliens from their areas of jurisdiction.
Luc's conviction has received little attention from the major national news organizations — CNN completely ignored it on their website — and it's easy to understand why when the case is dissected:
Image copyright AP Image caption The Chong Chon Gang was found to be carrying arms and munitions under bags of sugar
A North Korea shipping company has been renaming and reflagging its vessels so it can evade an arms embargo, a UN report has said.
North Korea is subject to strict sanctions because of its nuclear weapons programme.
The sanctions were extended to Ocean Maritime Management (OMM) last year after one of its ships was found to be importing weapons from Cuba.
The UN Security Council is to discuss the report on Thursday.
The report, from a panel of experts monitoring the sanctions, said OMM had renamed 13 of its 14 ships, and transferred their ownership to shell companies, which meant they were effectively erased from the blacklist database.
"These changes are likely a strategy to evade assets freezes by member states," said the report, quoted by AFP news agency. The company has operations in at least 10 countries.
The report also said that despite the sanctions, North Korea was continuing to "attempt to procure or transfer items relating to its nuclear and missile programmes".
Under United Nations sanctions, North Korea is banned from weapons exports and the import of all but small arms.
But in July 2013, the North Korea vessel Chong Chon Gang was stopped in Panama on suspicion of carrying drugs.
Police found undeclared Cuban military cargo hidden on board, hidden under bags of sugar in its hold.
The authorities in Havana admitted being behind the stash, saying they were Soviet-era arms from Cuba headed for repair in North Korea.
The UN's North Korea sanctions committee said at the time that OMM had "played a key role in arranging the shipment of the concealed cargo of arms".
Reality Leigh Winner should be released from jail pending her trial in the National Security Agency leak investigation because new information has surfaced that weakens the government's case for keeping her behind bars, her attorneys are arguing in new court papers.
Winner, 25, the first accused leaker to be prosecuted by the Trump administration, is scheduled to ask for her release at a hearing in Augusta at 10 a.m. Friday. The former Air Force linguist has pleaded not guilty to a charge of leaking an NSA report about Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election to The Intercept, an online news publication. She worked as a federal contractor in Augusta.
In arguing for her to be kept in the Lincoln County Jail in Lincolnton, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Solari told a judge Winner was recorded in a jailhouse phone call discussing some “documents” — plural — raising concerns she might have gathered other top-secret information beyond the NSA report she is accused of leaking. Solari said she was also overheard directing the transfer of $30,000 from her savings account to her mother's account because the court had taken away her free appointed counsel.
But in an email to Winner's attorneys on June 29, Solari said Winner could be heard in the recording telling her mom she “leaked a document,” singular. And in another recorded phone call, Solari said, Winner asked her mom to transfer her money because of fears authorities “might freeze it.” Winner's attorneys said she was afraid she would not be able to pay her bills if her account were frozen.
“I proffered information about the other jail calls based upon verbal summaries I was provided by the FBI just before the hearing,” Solari wrote. “Now that I have heard the recordings myself, I'd like to clarify some of the information for the court and counsel.”
In arguing for Winner's continued detention on June 8, Solari also told a judge that Winner at one point improperly plugged a flash drive into a top-secret computer — in a sort of test run — while she was still in the Air Force last year. Winner's attorneys pointed out she has not been charged with any additional crimes, though federal authorities have presumably completed their investigation of that incident.
Winner's attorneys are also citing other cases in which accused leakers have been allowed to remain free pending their trials, including retired Gen. David Petraeus, who resigned as CIA director in 2012 before pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified materials. Further, Winner's attorneys said, Winner has no prior criminal convictions, and she could be held behind bars far longer than the court had initially contemplated because her trial date has been postponed from Oct. 23 to March 19.
A spokesman for the federal prosecutors in the case did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday.
If the judge were to free Winner pending trial, her attorneys said, the court could require Winner to reside at her home in Augusta, not travel beyond Richmond County without permission, regularly keep in contact with a pretrial services officer and have her parents post their property as bond. She wants to return to teaching yoga and spin classes as well as volunteering in a local animal shelter, court records show.
Meanwhile, her attorneys are raising concerns about her health behind bars. They said Winner, who keeps a vegan diet, has developed “gastrointestinal issues” in the Lincoln County Jail.
“Ms. Winner's continued detention,” her court filing says, “is manifestly unjust, contrary to law, and not in accordance with the presumption of liberty.”

Pepe Mel is already battling to save his job as West Brom boss after just six weeks in charge.
The former Real Betis coach is yet to win in six Premier League games, which has left Albion in a huge relegation fight.
And the 50-year-old Spaniard, who was only appointed on January 13, is now under intense pressure, with senior players having misgivings about his tactics and communication skills.
The Baggies face a crunch home game against Manchester United at The Hawthorns on Saturday March 8.
A heavy defeat for 17th-placed Albion in that one could spell the end for Mel as tough chairman Jeremy Peace is desperate to avoid the drop, but he is likely to be given until the following game, Swansea away, on March 15 to turn around the club's plight.
Keith Downing and Dean Kiely are tailor-made replacements after a successful caretaker spell earlier this term following Steve Clarke's sacking in December.
Several first-team players are already believed to want the pair, who are currently the assistant head coach and goalkeeping coach respectively, back in charge ASAP.
If Mel is axed, he would not be the first quick casualty this season as Fulham sacked Rene Meulensteen after only 75 days in charge.
Mel has currently been in charge for 44 days.
The Spaniard's bold new era of passing football and high-tempo pressing to win back possession is yet to convince the Baggies' dressing room.
Mel is a likeable man, but he arrived in January without in-depth knowledge of the English Premier League and many of the Albion players simply do not rate him.
MirrorSport understands there is also growing resentment in the squad building towards the expanding influence of Mel's training ground interpreter, Dave McDonough.
Spanish-speaking McDonough is officially West Brom's director of technical performance and scouting. His statistical analysis of Steve Clarke's reign in the 2013 calendar year – when Albion won just seven League games - encouraged chairman Jeremy Peace to pull the trigger in December.
Albion stars now view McDonough as Peace's mole and are anxious about saying anything in front of him.
McDonough's role has increased as Mel does not not speak fluent English, souses him to translate on the training ground and in the dressing room.
But McDonough is not popular - Albion's stars also blame him for a string of questionable signings such as ex-Sunderland midfielder Stephane Sessegnon, who has not fitted into the dressing room.
While popular striker Shane Long was sold in January to Hull, where he has already scored twice.
Albion finished eighth last season relying on a consistent core of players including Gareth McAuley, Jonas Olsson, Steven Reid, Ben Foster, Liam Ridgewell, Chris Brunt, Claudio Yacob, James Morrison and Youssouf Mulumbu.
Chelsea loanee Romelu Lukaku was also pivotal with 17 League goals but did not return to The Hawthorns - it was a massive blow when he opted for Everton instead.
The Baggies could soon be another striker down soon if Anelka – currently engaged in an FA disciplinary hearing – is banned for his 'quenelle' gesture.
Neither Anelka nor any of Albion's other new signings - £6million Sessegnon, Diego Lugano, Victor Anichebe and Morgan Amalfitano - have established themselves as regulars in the side.
And the loyal long-term members of the dressing room have questioned the new recruits' commitment and attitude.
The loss of capable and respected sporting and technical director Dan Ashworth to the FA in September 2012 as director of elite development was a huge blow from which Albion have never recovered.
His replacement, Richard Garlick, is a rookie, which has enabled McDonough to step into the vacuum and create a powerbase close to the chairman, who has an office at the training ground.
McDonough, who previously worked at Liverpool under Rafa Benitez, pushed hard for Mel to replace Clarke and recommended several other Spanish coaches, too.
Now, after Mel's struggles and the failure of summer signings to make a significant impact, a review of Albion's scouting set-up is being pondered.
Changes are likely behind the scenes but Mel himself could go if Albion fail to win in either of their next two games.
Mel faces a growing groundswell of opinion in the dressing room that assistants Downing and Kiely should be restored to the helm.
The pair is both very popular with players and distinguished themselves with a four-game unbeaten run over Christmas as caretakers after Clarke was dismissed.
But it would be a major U-turn and an embarrassment to Peace if he has to axe Mel so soon and restore Downing and Kiely.
It is a growing possibility though, as Peace cannot afford relegation with the club's wage bill currently running at a record high.
Albion used to be known as a model club and a blueprint for others as they established themselves in the top-flight on the cheap, but their credibility in the game, as well as their Premier League status, is now on the line.
West Brom have declined the opportunity to comment.
China got access to all emails, contact databases and other documents stored on Parliament's computers.
A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Canberra declined to ­comment.
One participant said they were “surprised at the extent of the compromise and did not immediately comprehend why information on personal relationships and domestic politics would have been so useful to the Chinese".
Intelligence agencies believe China will use the information for several ­purposes. By seeing who communicates with whom and how frequently, China will be able to map the relationships in domestic Australian politics in detail. It will also reveal many of the personal relationships of Australia's present and future leaders.
The parliamentary network is unclassified, which means it isn't used for secret communication, so the information is likely to include a huge amount of mundane messages about the day-to-day life of politics, long lists of email addresses and phone numbers, and planning documents.
But it could also include sensitive discussions between MPs about party matters and reveal lobbying by companies, pressure groups and ex-politicians. It is likely include embarrassing gossip about senior figures and their media strategies. A similar breach of the Japanese parliament's computer network, also attributed to China, occurred later in 2011, according to international media reports.
A cabinet minister said there was shock and anger in response to the hacking and dissatisfaction from both sides of politics that the parliamentary communications system was insecure.
Sources said the Australian Signals Directorate carried out “vulnerability testing", or authorised hacking, of the parliamentary network in 2010, prior to the detection of the Chinese breach. The probes found the network had very weak security and could be overcome by a low-level hacker.

After the compromise became public, a defence official met a senior Chinese diplomat and said the Chinese regime could not have done more to ostracise both sides of politics. The diplomat denied knowledge of the breach.
The original media reports said the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation tipped off the Australia Security ­Intelligence Organisation about the security breach.
However, senior sources say the Australian Signals Directorate, then called the Defence Signal Directorate, was aware of the breach and had assigned a “tiger team" of 10 experts to fight off the Chinese intruders and rebuild the network's defences, which are said to be much more secure now.
Administration of parliament's computer systems is the responsibility of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Bronwyn Bishop, and president of the Senate John Hogg , whose spokespeople declined to comment. The attorney-general at the time, Robert McClelland , and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop , also declined to comment.

A judge has temporarily exempted three mental health professionals from a California law that prohibits them from attempting to change the sexual orientation of minors, while another judge has refused to block the law from taking effect.
Ordained minister and family therapist Donald Welch, psychiatrist Anthony Duk, and therapist-in-training Aaron Bitzer filed suit against the law, which is set to go into effect the beginning of 2013, because it allegedly violated their free speech rights.
In granting the plaintiffs their request to block the law, U.S. District Judge William Shubb ruled on Monday that prohibiting so-called reparative or ex-gay therapy “lacks content and viewpoint neutrality” in violation of the First Amendment.
“SB 1172 draws a line in the sand governing a therapy session and the moment that the mental health provider's speech ‘seek[s] to change an individual's sexual orientation,' including a patient's behavior, gender expression, or sexual or romantic attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same sex, the mental health provider can no longer speak,” he wrote in his order.
The California legislature approved legislation in August to prohibit mental health providers from practicing reparative on minors. California Assembly Speaker John A. Perez described reparative therapy as an “abusive practice in the guise of therapy.” California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) called reparative therapy “quackery” and signed the bill into law in September.
LGBT rights advocates were upset by the ruling, but took solace in the fact that it only applied to three individuals.
“The judge stressed that he was willing to issue the ruling in part because it is temporary and applies only to three individuals. We are confident that as the case progresses, it will be clear to the court that this law is fundamentally no different than many other laws that regulate health care professionals to protect patients,” said Shannon Minter, the legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights.
In a separate ruling, U.S. District Judge Kimberly J. Mueller on Tuesday refused to block the law from taking effect, noting that California lawmakers had prohibited a practice “deemed unproven and potentially harmful to minors by ten professional associations of mental health experts.”
Equality California Executive Director John O'Connor said he was “extremely pleased that the court's decision will allow the law to go into effect on January 1, 2013 as planned, and young people in this state will no longer have to fear that they can be subjected to these dangerous practices by licensed therapists.”

Some 34 high-rise buildings in 17 local authorities across the UK have failed fire cladding safety tests in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster, the British government has said.
The announcement came as around 3,000 residents of the Chalcots Estate in Camden, north London, face weeks in temporary accommodation after four tower blocks were evacuated.
Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said testing of potentially combustible cladding "is running around the clock".
"So far the cladding from 34 high-rise buildings, in 17 local authority areas, has failed the combustibility test," he added.
Manchester, Camden, Plymouth, Hounslow, Portsmouth, Barnet and Brent were named as having buildings that had failed tests by Mr Javid.
But in the statement he stressed "cladding itself is not dangerous" and that a failure in testing does not necessarily mean a building will be evacuated.
"The decision by Camden Council to evacuate four of the five towers on the Chalcots Estate was because the failed testing of the external cladding was compounded by multiple other fire safety failures which the fire inspection team found within the buildings," he said.
Mr Javid praised the "calm and stoicism" which residents showed when asked to leave their homes at short notice yesterday, in what he called a "distressing experience".
Earlier, British Prime Minister Theresa May said the government is making sure Camden Council can do "what is necessary" to ensure the 3,000 people evacuated have somewhere to stay, and work is done to make the buildings safe.
She added: "We are making sure that the authority has the ability to do what is necessary to ensure people have somewhere to stay and that the work is done so that those tower blocks will become safe for them to return to in future."
Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn received a warm welcome when he attended the Glastonbury festival in England today.
Addressing the crowds, he said: "Not so long ago we saw Grenfell Tower, a towering inferno in the middle of the richest borough in the country.
"People living in poverty, living in danger, in a place that simply went up in smoke. Not one of those people should have died. That fire was wholly and totally preventable."
He said tenants who tried to raise safety concerns were "utterly ignored because they were tenants, because they were poor people, because they were working class".
ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- Buffalo Bills running back LeSean McCoy, who is listed as questionable with a hamstring injury for Sunday's game against the Dolphins, traveled with the team to Miami, a source told ESPN's Jeff Darlington.
McCoy had returned to practice on a limited basis Friday, and coach Rex Ryan said the Bills had yet to rule him out for Sunday's game.
"We'll see how it goes," said Ryan, adding McCoy will "probably" be a game-time decision. "We'll be smart with him, but he looked pretty good [Friday]."
McCoy, speaking Friday for the first time since suffering the injury in practice Wednesday, also considered himself a game-time decision.
"I just felt all right," McCoy said of his return to practice Friday. "I didn't do a lot of reps today. Just was real limited, just seeing how I feel."
LeSean McCoy practiced on a limited basis Friday, and Bills coach Rex Ryan said the running back would "probably" be a game-time decision for Sunday's game against the Dolphins. Bill Streicher/USA TODAY Sports
A well-placed source told ESPN's Josina Anderson on Thursday that McCoy will not play against the Dolphins. McCoy has a history of hamstring injuries.
McCoy confirmed that he injured his left hamstring in Wednesday's practice. He also hurt his left hamstring in a training camp practice in August 2015, an injury that lingered into the regular season and eventually caused him to miss two games in October.
However, McCoy said his injury this week was "not nearly as bad as [last year]. So that's a good thing."
Given McCoy's experience with his injury last season, offensive coordinator Anthony Lynn said Thursday that he wants his top running back to be cautious and not play at less than 100 percent, potentially risking reinjury.
In addition to McCoy being listed as questionable, the Bills listed wide receiver Robert Woods (foot) and defensive tackle Marcell Dareus (hamstring) as doubtful on their injury report after neither practiced this week.
If the Bills are without McCoy, the team is expected to start Mike Gillislee at running back. Marquise Goodwin and Justin Hunter would be expected to take the majority of snaps at receiver if Woods cannot play.
Dareus has yet to play this season because of a four-game suspension and the hamstring injury that has kept him out of the past two games.
Information from ESPN's Jeff Darlington was used in this report.
Today, Qassim Abdul-Zahra and Diaa Hadid wrote a story for the Associated Press that describes growing cross-border collaboration between al-Qa'ida in Iraq (AQI) and Jabhat al-Nusrah, or al-Nusrah Front, in Syria. An Iraqi government spokesperson is quoted as describing the border area as “a nest of terrorist cells,” while an anonymous Jordanian counterterrorism official stated that the two groups were working, “with all possible means, including weapons, fighters and training." This is not a new development. In December, the State Department claimed that the al-Nusrah Front was merely an extension of AQI, and was thus labeled a “Foreign Terrorist Organization.”
What was new in Abdul-Zahra and Hadid's reporting was the following passage:
"Two Iraqi intelligence officials said the cooperation reflected in the attack on the wounded Syrian troops prompted the Baghdad government to request U.S. drone strikes against the fighters. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the subject. A U.S. official confirmed that elements within Iraq's government had inquired about drone strikes. But the official said the United States was waiting to respond until the Iraqi leadership's top level makes a formal request, which hasn't happened."
It is a positive sign that President Obama has (apparently) decided not to authorize drone strikes in Iraq, and that his administration insisted on a formal request from Baghdad before considering such a significant policy change. Intervening on behalf of another country to protect its borders is not something that the United States should rush into, even if the targeted individuals are suspected of belonging to a State Department-designated terrorist organization.
In March, the Wall Street Journal reported that the CIA had increased its covert training and support efforts to enhance Iraq's Counterterrorism Service forces that are focused on AQI or al-Nusrah militants that threaten western Iraq. A senior Obama administration official stated: "This relationship is focused on supporting the Iraqis to deal with terrorist threats within their borders, and not about ramping up unilateral operations." Training and advising another state's security forces is a normal component of military to military cooperation, but conducting kinetic operations for them could quickly draw the United States into creating additional enemies out of what are domestic and regionally-focused terrorist groups. The CIA already serves as the counterterrorism air force of Yemen, and, occasionally, Pakistan. It should not further expand this chore to Iraq.
President Obama should also ask himself if the United States wants to open up a fifth front in its campaign of non-battlefield targeted killings, outside of Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and The Philippines. (Mark Mazzetti has reported that there was at least one U.S. drone strike in The Philippines in 2006, which attempted to kill Umar Patek. Mazzetti's must-read book—The Way of the Knife: The CIA, a Secret Army, and a War at the Ends of the Earth—comes out next week, which could have some additional details.) In addition, the U.S. military recently began flying unarmed (so far) Predator surveillance drones from an airstrip in Niamey, Niger. Moreover, as Congress debates updating the long-defunct Authorization for the Use of Military Force resolution that it passed days after September 11, 2001, it should consider seriously what legal authorities that the president should have to respond to random requests from foreign government for drone strikes.
HOUSTON, May 28 (Reuters) - A one-year delay on new deepwater projects stemming from the Gulf of Mexico well rupture could cut world oil supply by 500,000 barrels per day between 2013 to 2017, Bernstein Research said in a note to clients on Friday.
“Although this may seem small in a global context, such a situation would decrease OPEC spare capacity, especially in the second half of the decade, which would lead to an increase in the oil price,” the firm wrote.
Still, it is unclear if this is a likely scenario, Bernstein wrote.
The world consumes more than 80 million barrels per day of crude oil.
On Thursday, the U.S. government extended a moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits to six months and announced a safety crackdown that includes the temporary suspension of exploratory drilling on 33 rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. [ID:nLDE64R00P]
Bernstein said delays and new regulatory costs could boost the marginal costs of new deepwater production by about 10 percent.
The moratorium extension will have “a huge near term negative impact to the Gulf Coast deepwater oil service industry,” Bernstein said.
The drilling ban was put in place after a BP Plc (BP.L) (BP.N) well ruptured in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20. The accident sank the Deepwater Horizon rig, killed 11 workers and is estimated to be the largest oil spill in U.S. history.
New deepwater regulations are likely and the hit from the U.S. drilling moratorium will affect drilling worldwide, Bernstein said.
It is “highly likely” that deepwater rigs will have to adopt global standards to work in basins around the world, the firm said. (Reporting by Anna Driver in Houston; editing by Jim Marshall)

”If you take out Saddam, Saddam's regime, I guarantee you that it will have enormous positive reverberations on the region,” Mr. Netanyahu said then. “And I think that people sitting right next door in Iran, young people, and many others, will say the time of such regimes, of such despots is gone.”
In the same testimony, the American-educated Israeli leader, who had already served a term as prime minister and would become foreign minister later that year, suggested that Iran was so ripe for revolt that just seeing American television shows could do the trick — even if he had some trouble recalling the name of one of the programs he proposed using as a weapon. Mr. Netanyahu recalled that he had once advised senior officials at the Central Intelligence Agency “that if you want to advance regime change in Iran, you don't have to go through the C.I.A. cloak-and-dagger stuff — what you want to do is take very large, very strong transponders and just beam ‘Melrose Place' and ‘Beverly Hills 2050' and all that into Tehran and into Iran, because that is subversive stuff. They watch it — the young kids watch it, the young people. They want to have the same nice clothes and the same houses and swimming pools and so on.”
At another point, Mr. Netanyahu suggested that the war in Afghanistan had already discredited predictions that a U.S. invasion of Iraq could “produce a counterreaction in the Arab world,” and inspire tens of thousands of zealots “outraged by America's action” to stream into the country and take up arms.
Video of the testimony also shows that Mr. Netanyahu's longtime adviser, Ron Dermer, sat directly behind him that day. Mr. Dermer, a former Republican political operative now serving as Israel's ambassador in Washington, is blamed by some Democrats for injecting partisanship into the relations between the two countries by orchestrating the prime minister's address to Congress without consulting either the White House or the State Department.
After Mr. Kerry's comments on Wednesday, critics, including staunch defenders of Mr. Netanyahu, pointed out that the secretary, who was a senator from Massachusetts at the time, had himself voted to authorize the use of force against Iraq on Oct. 11, 2002.
Former Liberal MP Ross Cameron has unleashed a bizarre rant defending US presidential hopeful Donald Trump off the back of his tape scandal.
Mr Cameron appeared on Sky News' Paul Murray Live after Mr Trump faced off against his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton wearing a 'Make America Great Again' cap and the Republican's campaign shirt.
Not making a secret of who he supported, the political commentator explained why he thought Mr Trump was good for women after a 2005 recording emerged of him boasting about how being a 'star' meant he could get away with 'anything' when trying to bed women.
Former Liberal MP Ross Cameron has unleashed a bizarre rant defending US presidential hopeful Donald Trump off the back of his tape scandal
Mr Cameron said Mr Trump was 'a victory for women' drawing surprised reactions from his fellow panellists Janine Perrett and Graham Richardson.
'Now the Trump conversation, what it tells you is that in the private moment at the end of the day when the bloke is sitting down with his mates, the thing that his mind turns to is the female of the species,' Mr Cameron said.
'The female is the celestial body around which the male orbits, she is the wiki to which the male will always in the end return.
'She is the dominant figure in human history. The rise and fall of civilisations may be renamed "Who Gets The Girl".'
Like Mr Trump, Mr Cameron is no stranger to political scandal.
The former MP's career came to end in 2004 after he failed to be re-elected for the federal seat of Parramatta after the extremely religious and right-wing father-of-four confessed to the Good Weekend he had cheated on his wife, Genevieve.
'I have been an unfaithful husband,' Mr Cameron said at the time.
'If my constituents want to vote for a great family man, they should probably vote for the other guy.'

Earlier this week, Mr Trump was heard bragging about his attempts to seduce a married woman in a recording made on an Access Hollywood set after he was newly wed to his current wife, Melania.
'I moved on her and I failed. I'll admit it. I did try and f*** her. She was married', Mr Trump said.
'And I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, "I'll show you where they have some nice furniture".'
The Republican nominee is later heard bragging about how his celebrity status allows him to do 'anything' to women.
'You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful - I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait,' he boasted.
Meanwhile Mr Cameron has courted controversy over his views that Hillary Clinton (pictured) has dementia
'And when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the p***y. You can do anything.'
The tape sparked Mr Trump's Republican colleagues to call for him to step down.
Meanwhile Mr Cameron has courted controversy over his views that former secretary of state Clinton has dementia.
The political commentator said a number of things, including her collapse during the 9/11 memorial service, led him to believe she had the condition that deteriorates the functionality of the brain.
'Her inability to have her two eyes moving in the same direction. All of these individual bits of data you have to treat them as either coincidental… or else as part of a pattern,' Mr Cameron said.

Training camp has come and gone, but three more weeks of the preseason remain.
In today's mailbag, we assess the state of this team, and what we've learned so far.
Thanks, as always, for taking part in the mailbag, and keep the questions coming. E-mail me at mike.jones@washpost.com with the subject line “Mailbag question,” and we'll do it all over again next week.
Here we go!
In light of last year's deficiencies in the run game, I expected a lot more in the first preseason game. You would expect improvement and even an emphasis on the run right from the start. Where is the problem? Talent, offensive line or blocking schemes? Can we win more than nine games without a solid run game?
– Tim Chumley
You're not alone in your disappointment in what you saw last week against the Falcons. Everyone within the organization wanted to see better ground production out of the first two units. The very next practice, Gruden had the offense run 12 straight run plays as they try to get this thing right.
[Steinberg: Redskins see a breakout star. NFL needs convincing.]
I wouldn't panic just yet if I were you. That first offensive series could've played out very differently. Remember, Matt Jones ripped off a 12-yard run, and it got called back because of holding on Morgan Moses. But that hold didn't have an impact on the run. So, say Jones picked up a first down there, and then came a pass, and another run, and maybe another. It's hard to say. It's true that Jones's other carries were far from impressive, and Keith Marshall didn't look good either. But it's still early.

I believe the Redskins have the talent to produce better results. Shawn Lauvao is still working his way back into form, and should provide a boost. And Jones has worked hard to prepare his body and mind for this load. It could just take a few more weeks to get things fine-tuned.
Can the Redskins win more than nine games without a dominant rushing attack? It's not impossible, but it's hard to do. The Patriots ranked 30th in rushing last season and won 12 games. But they have Tom Brady. Washington ranked 20th and won nine games. Outside of New England, none of the teams that ranked behind the Redskins in rushing owned winning records. And only Pittsburgh (16th) and Denver (17th) were in the bottom half of the league in rushing and managed winning records. And, of course, both Pittsburgh and Denver had great quarterbacks and good defenses. So, for the Redskins to win more than nine games despite only having an average rushing attack (or worse), the passing game has to be on point, and the defense must improve and consistently stop the run, get after the quarterback, force turnovers and set up the offense with good field position.
What's the reasoning behind the decision to experiment with the running back committee instead of starting Matt Jones? Has Jones underperformed in camp? Has Marshall outperformed Matt Jones? Or do they just really like our group of running backs?
– Cole Walmsley, Northern Va.
Matt Jones is going to be the workhorse back. At least that's the plan. But the coaches believe it's smart to have a back to sprinkle in here and there to help spell Jones, keep him fresh, and the keep the defense off-balance. Jones has worked hard all offseason, and running backs coach Randy Jordan and Jay Gruden have both praised him for how he has carried himself, and for the improvement they have seen in the way he approaches the game. Even after the ineffective bite-sized performance in the preseason opener, they continued to express confidence in Jones and his abilities.
[Jones and Thompson say they're ready to carry the load]
So, whether it's Chris Thompson, Keith Marshall, Rob Kelley or someone else, that back will just be used to help lighten the load here and there.
Scot McCloughan came out said Ty Nsekhe could start on half the teams in the NFL and was one of the top five offensive linemen on the team. Pretty high praise, but if so, why are we not seeing him at one of the biggest question marks on the team, left guard? It's not as if Long or Lauvao are running away with the position or have ever been more than serviceable anyway.
– Steve Pruitt
I like Nsekhe, and I do think he could start somewhere. I think he could get the job done at left tackle if Trent Williams got hurt. But there's a drop-off. Is Nsekhe equal to Morgan Moses? To me, yes. But, Bill Callahan knows a lot more about evaluating offensive linemen than I do. Is he really among the top five offensive linemen in the room? Eh, I think McCloughan may have gotten a little carried away. Or, maybe in certain categories (size, athleticism).
[GM: Nsekhe would start for half the NFL's teams]
Remember, the Redskins needed a right tackle last year, so they tried Brandon Scherff there, then moved him inside and tried Morgan Moses there, and Moses settled right in and had a good first year as a starter. Nsekhe never challenged for the job. And when Callahan was moving other guys around to get them some experience at other positions in case of an emergency, Nsekhe never took a snap at guard. Former backup tackle Tom Compton did line up at guard last year. And this year, guard Arie Kouandjio has taken a couple snaps at left guard on the third unit. If Nsekhe had the skillset to play guard, Callahan would put him there.
It seems the Redskins are very deep at wide receiver and like the talent there. Obviously, there aren't going to be enough roster spots available. Do you see us keeping an unusually high number of receivers on the practice squad, considering Jackson and/or Garcon may not be back next year?
– Rob Conn
I'm not sure what you consider “unusually high,” but I wouldn't expect any more than two.
Redskins safety Will Blackmon breaks up a pass intended for wide receiver Maurice Harris on the first day of training camp. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)
They already have a number of young prospects behind Pierre Garcon and DeSean Jackson. Jamison Crowder, Josh Doctson, Ryan Grant and Rashad Ross will be waiting to take over next year if Jackson and/or Garcon aren't still here. So, that will make for a fierce competition for Maurice Harris, Valdez Showers, Dez Stewart, Kendal Thompson, T.J. Thorpe and Jarvis Turner.
Do you feel the Redskins should give Ray Rice a chance at running back since they seem to have some weakness in that area?
– Ernest Hatfield
I don't think it's a good idea. This team doesn't need any more controversy. I'm sure Rice will probably never make the same mistake again, but it's just a distraction this team doesn't need. And even taking Rice's background out of the equation, he already had started to decline. His final year in Baltimore, he averaged only 3.1 yards per carry. The Redskins are better suited going with a younger, more versatile guy.
I've been a Redskin fan since 1954. I've often wondered what happens to a player's pay when he is placed in IR. I'm sure there are contract variances regarding injured reserve compensation, but are there any standards?
– Jim Seeley
It depends on how the contract is worded, but most of them have a base salary that's guaranteed for injury, so the player would get that money, but they would miss out on those game bonuses or other performance incentives.
Others prove more costly. In the case of Junior Galette's contract in 2015, the pass rusher signed for $745,000, but his contract was structured in a way that when he got hurt, his salary dropped to $413,000, meaning he lost $332,000 because he got hurt.There are some contracts where the entire salary is guaranteed for injury. That fifth-year option that the Redskins picked up on Robert Griffin III's contract in the offseason of 2015, which would have enabled them to retain his services this season if they wanted? All $16.3 million of that salary would have come to Griffin had he gotten hurt.
Please explain the lack of performance from Stephen Paea. I know he was dealing with turf toe last year but he didn't stand out before that. I think he even got replaced before he went down with injury. At this point, he is replaceable. Can you give any insight as to what's going on with him?
– Josh Edney
People at Redskins Park are asking themselves the exact same thing. Paea, for whatever reason, hasn't managed to stand out with any kind of consistency. He hasn't found a way to climb back up the depth chart. I don't know if he's just not a fit for this defense, or what. Last year, he entered camp as the starting left end, but a week into the regular season, he lost his job to Chris Baker, then he was hurt for the final five games.

After one game last year, when Paea had one of his better outings, I asked what led to the success, and he said he was used differently that game, in an alignment more similar to how the Bears used him. He had more one-on-one matchups that game (where Washington used more four-man fronts), and was shooting a different gap than when lined up as a 3-4 end. What I don't get is this year, Paea has been used primarily in nickel packages, so that means as a defensive tackle in a four-man front, which he prefers, and he still hasn't managed consistent production. Paea spent the bulk of training camp working with the second and third units, barely seeing the field with the first unit even as a substitute.
Email a Redskins question to mike.jones@washpost.com, with the subject “Mailbag question,” and it might be answered next Tuesday.

Neil Berkeley's documentary Harmontown, about Community creator and show runner Dan Harmon, premieres tomorrow night at the SXSW Film Festival.
Halfway through shooting, the subject of my new movie turned to me and said, "Ya know, it occurred to me last night that I'm not changing. I've experienced some things but those are just accumulations. I'm 40 years old ... I'm not gonna change. So you don't have a story. What are you gonna do?" My first thought was, "you asshole." I had met this guy a month earlier, agreed to shoot his tour for a documentary and here we are in a parking lot in Kansas City and he's telling me that he's not going on a journey. Beyond that, only minutes before, he announced to the world that not only is he not the hero but, in fact, he is the villain of this story. We had four more days of shooting left and I only had half a story.
I've quickly learned that that's the problem with telling a person's story right in the middle of them actually going through it. From what I can tell Dan has accepted calls, crossed thresholds, battled dragons and now he's gotten everything he's ever wanted in life and according to Joseph Campbell he's about to pay a heavy price. I'm not going to say that it's going to be bad ratings, heavy drinking or this movie that are going to finally send him into the low point of his journey but if story circles are real then he's about to find out that (point metaphor)...
But then again maybe not. Dan makes a very real, very honest point when he looks into the camera and admits to me that he's all changed out. Good or bad this is who he's going to be and as long as he's honest about that to his friends and fans we're all allowed to decide whether we want this person in our lives. You see, people's lives don't follow structure and we don't go on a journey. We don't cross thresholds, we don't meet goddesses and we don't return to our villages with elixir. We may occasionally be heroes and sometimes villains but mostly we're just people ... Truth is we're mostly extras.
So that's where I found myself six months into the editing process ... Lost in a non-story with a non-hero/villain trying to find an ending. Then Dan gave me video he had recorded during one of the final days of the tour.
Several days after our conversation in the parking lot Dan went to the bus by himself late at night to drink and get things off his chest. He sat alone in the bathroom with a cup of vodka and a lipstick camera hanging from his ear. I wish this movie could be three hours long because it's possibly 45 minutes of the most fascinating dialog I've ever heard. Dan dives deep below the surface of the bottom of the well and admits to every flaw, every false-hood and every fractured aspect of his role in the relationships with the people he loves the most. He looks himself in the eye and tells himself that he's not the hero, he's gotten everything he's ever wanted and the fans need to know that he's not who they think he is. Most importantly, he realizes that that's no way to live and he admits to wanting to want to change ... To grow up.
Harmontown is a portrait. It's not an expose or an exploration. Dan is incredibly aware of all his flaws so there's nothing he could see on screen that would cause a sea change. It's meant to show the world who this person is and what he does but most importantly its meant to show why anyone would pay attention. Dan does speak to a group of people that find his honesty and his openness refreshing. He gathers them into a community and empowers these people who aren't normally asked to be powerful. From the minute I met them at Meltdown Comics in Hollywood I have been fascinated by them, and telling that story has been my goal. Dan's ultimate message is for everyone to be honest with one another so any movie about him or anything he does that doesn't meet that expectation will have fallen short. I think Harmontown measures up to that expectation, and for me, it's an incredibly fun/sad, dark/humorous, non-story about a non-hero, maybe-villain worth telling.
So, about those undefeated Arizona Cardinals...
I actually picked the Rams to win this one, so I am not exactly shocked by the outcome. While I don't think this answers many questions about the Cardinals, it does tell us that the St. Louis Rams are going to be a force to reckon with at home. While the Redskins, Seahawks and Cardinals are not exactly top of the line teams, I think we can safely say the Rams are going to be a tough team this season in the Edward Jones Dome.
The Rams third home win improves them to 3-2 overall and they now sit a half game back of the 49ers. If the 49ers beat the Bills on Sunday, we will have a tie for first with the Rams a game back. The Seahawks travel to Carolina to face the Panthers, which will be a tough one for them. Of course, given how the season has gone we can't really underestimate anybody in the NFC West.
As for the Cardinals? Well, I think most people were hesitant to equate them with the Falcons and Texans. The key for them will be how they bounce back, or even if they bounce back. They host Buffalo next week, but then have a three-game stretch heading into their bye that could make or break their season. The Cardinals travel to Minnesota, host the 49ers and then travel to Green Bay. I suppose the post-bye stretch could be the difference-maker if they drop most of that three-game stretch, but either way they need to rebound if they are going to stay in the NFC West race.
The 49ers travel to Arizona for Monday Night Football at the end of the month, have their bye week and then host the St. Louis Rams in Week 10. The 49ers travel to St. Louis on December 2, so we'll have to wait and see if the Rams can maintain this strong home run.
Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and thank you Alison for that kind introduction.
Great to be here at Newton Prep School this morning.
And good morning to you all, ladies and gentlemen.
It's a real pleasure to see so many of you here. It's only just over a week after International Women's Day, so I'm glad that empowering women, the theme of today's conference, to succeed at the highest level is still top of the agenda for so many.
Certainly, it's remained at the forefront of the government's priorities over recent years.
There have been so many steps forward for women - and our successes over the last few years have been vital in helping women to succeed:
there are more women in work than ever before
of those women, more are in full-time work than ever before
we've cut tax for 11.9 million women…and we're introducing tax-free childcare, and we're offering more free hours of childcare, to more children
A huge leap in the right direction.
But to focus solely on these headline level successes would be doing a disservice to all those hard-working women that we know are still disadvantaged because of their gender.
Of course, as Education Secretary and also as Minister for Women and Equalities, I would have a particular interest in teaching. But I think it's a profession that does deserve scrutiny. It's certainly one with an interesting history.
Looking back over the last couple of centuries in the UK, teaching has at times been a very gendered profession. From the first formal schools for boys, run by schoolmasters and religious leaders, to the Victorian-era village schools run by schoolma'ams and headmistresses, we've changed our mind plenty of times over the years on who we think can best educate our children.
I'm glad that we're now lucky enough to benefit from a fantastic profession full of talented teachers and leaders, both male and female, and all equally capable of leading, teaching, nurturing, and inspiring the citizens of tomorrow.
And that's why I love my job, because it is all about the future. Working with young people and securing the future of our country.
But that being said - recent data shows that disparity does still exist. The vast majority of our teachers - 75% - are female. That rises to nearly 90% in primary schools. But only 66% of our headteachers are female - meaning there's a much lower progression rate for women than for men.
Specifically, at secondary school, where the majority of teachers are female, the majority of headteachers - almost two-thirds - are male. And at primary school, where men make up just over 10% of teachers, almost 3 in 10 headteachers are male. So we see that progression to leadership positions and the top jobs doesn't reflect the number of people joining the profession and working as classroom teachers.
And for those women who do break down barriers and overcome hurdles to reach the top positions, the issues don't end at the door to the headteacher's office. Because the gender pay gap for teachers - seen throughout all levels of the profession - only widens with seniority.
So there are clearly 2 problems for women here. A lower proportion of female teachers move through to leadership positions than their male counterparts. And the median salary for women teachers and headteachers is less than for male teachers and headteachers.
We know that there are a number of factors at play here, including: school size, age of teachers, length of contract and also the geography where the school is located. We have a duty to make sure that gender isn't one of these factors; that it has absolutely no role in determining how much teachers or school leaders get paid.
A key part of this government's plan for education is ensuring there is strong leadership in schools to ensure the best outcomes for pupils. Strong leadership must, of course, be diverse. That's why my department promotes talent management in schools to increase the diversity of the leadership population, and we work closely with schools, academies and teaching school alliances.
One cause of the current pay gap is the structure of our existing workforce, including the distribution of male and female teachers across different schools. We know that female leadership teachers are more likely to work in primary schools than secondary schools, and primary schools are often smaller, leading to lower salaries.
We also know that the historic system of automatic pay progression contributed to pay differences. Female teachers, much more likely to take parental leave or career breaks, were disadvantaged, whilst their male counterparts, working without breaks, continued to accrue automatic pay increases. I just don't think this is fair. A woman who's taken a year, or even a few years, out to have children and raise a family certainly isn't less capable as a teacher who hasn't had this time away from the classroom. We need to do much more to support these talented women who have so much to offer, and want to return to the workplace later on in life.
That's why I'm pleased that our recent reforms to teachers' pay should mitigate this often unfair salary discrepancy.
Automatic progression has been abolished. And so has the requirement for schools to match teachers' previous salaries when recruiting. Both of these changes mean that schools now have the freedom to pay higher salaries if they choose - the salaries that they feel match a teacher's experience, performance, and potential, rather than the years they've spent teaching.
I'm also pleased that the National College for Teaching and Leadership continues to fund a wide range of local and national programmes to address the under-representation of BME and female leaders in schools. The programme currently being funded is the Leadership Equality and Diversity Fund - helping 30 school-led partnerships to deliver equality and diversity projects. I'm delighted that the fund will continue into this year and that it's now open for applications until mid-April. I would urge everyone here today to consider putting their school forward and applying over the coming month.
My department also funds the Future Leaders Trust, helping to develop the skills of high-potential aspiring headteachers who want to work in some of the most challenging schools in the country. Fifteen percent of current participants on the High Potential Leaders programme are from a black and minority ethnic background and at least 50% of the participants are female.
Women like Dr Jane Keeley, headteacher at Haggerston School, which was declared ‘good' by Ofsted in 2013 after Jane's 3 years of hard work as headteacher to turn the school around. Jane describes the Future Leaders programme as ‘a breath of fresh air' - without it, she's sure she never would have become a head.
Or like Nadia Paczuska, assistant headteacher of Barham Primary School, and soon to be taking up her first headship having benefitted from the bespoke coaching and high-quality training that the future leaders programme offers.
Both women, with huge amounts of talent, have plenty to offer their schools. Role models to their staff and pupils alike.
And women representative of their dedicated colleagues all over the country - some of whom I've had the great privilege of meeting myself.
Carol Hannaford, for example, headteacher at Plymouth's Stoke Damerel Community College.
Sarah Bailey at ARK Little Ridge Primary Academy in Hastings…Or Erica Mason, acting headteacher at Whitefield Infant School in Pendle.
Certainly not professionals I'd want to see held back by fewer opportunities or unfair pay.
It's for women like Jane, Nadia, Carol, Sarah and Erica, that we all have a duty to fund the right projects, develop the right policy, ask the right questions.
Because to make sure that tomorrow's leaders are empowered to go for the top jobs and demand a competitive salary, I want them to be confident that they'll be considered on an equal footing with their male counterparts.
The women I've mentioned - and their colleagues around the country - are crucial role models. They inspire the next generation of women in classrooms. Just last week I spoke to students in Plymouth who told me they aspired to become doctors, midwives, and teachers. So much of that is down to the teaching and leadership in their school.
It's clear to me that gender has absolutely nothing to do with a teacher's ability to innovate, inspire, or encourage.
Thank you so much for inviting me to be here. I'm looking forward to taking your questions now.
We are going to have to make the argument again – and again and again. No matter how many times we appear to have won the day, the tireless lobbies whose own career interests, or ideological fervour, or political power are under threat simply wear us down.So here we go: politicians are not superior beings, okay? They are not more morally righteous, or in possession of better judgement, than the majority of the electorate, right? That is something on which we are likely to agree. In fact, it is something with which roughly 99 per cent of the population would probably agree.
So why are so many of us apparently prepared to accept that a politician's decision about how our money should be spent, or our schools should be run, or our hospitals should be administered is inherently virtuous? Whereas, decisions about those things made by private individuals – whether as providers or consumers – are automatically wicked.
The whole ridiculous thing cropped up again last week when Liz Truss was forced to defend the idea of “free schools”. What an absurd thing to have to defend: in a free country, what should schools be other than “free”? Un-free? No, the opposite of “free” in this case is “government-owned and run” which is the equivalent in the perverse terms of the Left, and their special-interest front groups, to “without taint”. That is, the taint of individual choice, personal initiative, and self-determination – all of which are deeply sinister because some people are better at them than others. Therefore they are socially divisive and lead to inequality.
In other words, the very fact of some parents having the desire and determination to create a school which they believe will suit their children better than the state-operated ones, constitutes a form of political injustice because some other parents do not have the desire and the determination to do the same. Put like that, doesn't it sound stupid? And more than stupid, it sounds totalitarian: you have no right to be more conscientious and ambitious for your children than anyone else because that, in itself, is a kind of privilege.
Believe it or not there are people who actually say this: if all parents are not similarly equipped with the capacity and the fortitude to invent, or even actively to seek out, a school they believe will suit their offspring, then no parents should be permitted to do so. (The same argument is applied to parental choice as to the more radical “free schools” concept: the freedom to choose is pernicious because only some parents will make good use of it.)
But The Argument which must be repeated ad infinitum is not just about parents and schools. It is about the larger question of government power and the public services. How on earth has it come to pass that “choice” and “diversity” are such dangerous ideas that political parties are afraid to be associated with them? (Or, at least, treat them like live grenades?) Now that most British consumers can shop with demonic cleverness – comparing the online prices of electronic goods and holidays with ferocious expertise – how can the denial of choice and variety in the most important areas of all, education and health, still be a sacred principle, never to be defiled by the unpredictable whims of those on the receiving end? And even more bizarrely, why does a nation which bows to no other in its contempt for politicians and bureaucrats seem to accept that their edicts on the content of schooling and the practice of medicine must be preferred even to those of the professionals who practise them?
Now this brings us to an interesting point. The most influential enemies of free schools and of academies (which are, in the end, likely to be a more important phenomenon in the process of breaking the government monopoly on education) are the teaching unions. Their campaigning and concerted resistance has consistently forced every reform of state education that favours parental choice onto the back foot. (See earlier reference to Liz Truss's travails over the past week.) Yet, it is their case that teachers should have the right to decide how to teach. So what if we were to get on to the front foot and agree?
Fine, we might say, you can choose how (and even what) you want to teach in your particular school, if parents can choose whether or not to accept what you are offering. If teachers must be able to exercise their own judgment, why shouldn't parent? The teaching lobby would then presumably be forced to say explicitly that they always know what is best for all children – which is something they only hint at now with their condemnations of “pushy parents”. (Some politicians on the Right have actually taken to joining in that condemnation – which is absolutely shameful.)
If the dogmatic teachers' spokesmen were not prepared to consider this trade-off, wouldn't it weaken their public position? After all, they must assume that there is a large group of parents who would opt for the permissive, progressive, anti-testing philosophy that they espouse. If not, does that mean they know better than everybody else?
Maybe we have been repeating the old arguments for too long. Instead of reiterating the obvious truths – that diversity of provision raises standards, protects freedom and encourages personal responsibility through the power of choice – perhaps we should go on the offensive.
Instead of talking encouragingly about “independent” providers – a word which is associated in the context of education with the private sector and can thus be caricatured as privatisation – perhaps we should make a more aggressive case against allowing schools to remain in the evil grip of politicians. (This might seem an odd thing for a politician to say but Michael Gove has shown himself to be quite unafraid of uttering uncomfortable truths.) When the enemies of reform claim that they want to improve all schools at exactly the same pace and in exactly the same way, rather than encouraging difference (or “inequality”), we might say with unblinking ferocity that enforced uniformity is authoritarian, conformist and destructive of achievement.
It may be time for an unflinching, unapologetic stand: why shouldn't governments provide the funding for public services without owning and administering them? What is this belief that the state is the sole purveyor of social goodness but a piece of old-fashioned Marxist claptrap? Of course, parents, communities and organisations should be allowed to set up schools. The proper role for government is to monitor their performance: to examine their results and to make that information publicly available.
The head of Ofsted, Sir Michael Wilshaw, is certainly on the right track here with his call for a return to national testing. If there are enough teachers and parents who believe that test performance is unimportant, they can set up their own schools too. Good luck to them.
Sorry, but the bleak news keeps coming. Friday, another white cop got away with another murder of a black man, the third such travesty in about a month. Ray Tensing's second hung jury came in the Cincinnati killing of Samuel DuBose during a traffic stop ( does this sound familiar?), which was caught on Tensing's body camera. What wasn't caught: The Confederate flag t-shirt Tensing was wearing under his uniform, or his record of pulling over more African-Americans - 83.5% of his tickets - than any other cop on the force, or the biased make-up of the jury.
Last month, Betty Jo Shelby, another white cop, was similarly found not guilty of first-degree manslaughter after gunning down Terence Crutcher in Oklahoma after his car broke down; Crutcher was unarmed with his hands in the air, but Shelby still thought he was a scary black guy. Shelby was even allowed to return to work, though Tulsa's police chief said he wasn't sure she would because it might feel "too dangerous."
Tensing at least got fired. So did Jeronimo Yanez, bafflingly acquitted days before Tensing's mistrial of first-degree manslaughter for the death of Philando Castile. After that verdict, troubling facts emerged. Investigators were found to have scoured Castile's and girlfriend Diamond Reynold's social media history - but not Yanez' - looking for criminal activity or other dirt to re-victimize the victims; and damning, newly released dashcam video of the shooting showed a panicked Yanez screaming at a totally compliant Castile in what was widely seen as an execution. At subsequent protests and town halls to "mourn the loss of Mr. Phil," black community members expressed anger and frustration in the face of ongoing violence by police, and the sense after so long that, "Help is not coming."
Perhaps most disturbing is video that emerged of a distraught Diamond Reynolds and her four-year-old daughter being held in the back of a squad car moments after Philando's shooting. Reynolds has long shown extraordinary strength, insisting to all who would listen, "I need justice." Now, in handcuffs behind her back - why is this woman in handcuffs?!? - Reynolds alternates between furious grief and the singular composure she displayed in her own video of the shooting, complete with painstakingly remembering to call her partner's killer "sir." Reynolds' shell-shocked daughter likewise veers between calmly trying to comfort her mother and her own horror. As Reynolds struggles with the handcuffs, the girl shouts in terror, “No, please, no! I don't want you to get shooted!” After her mother tries to quiet her, the girl pleads, “I don't want it to be like this anymore.” Reynolds' righteous retort: "Tell that to the police."

A digital Big Brother is coming to work, for better or worse.
Advanced technological tools are beginning to make it possible to measure and monitor employees as never before, with the promise of fundamentally changing how we work — along with raising concerns about privacy and the specter of unchecked surveillance in the workplace.
Through these new means, companies have found, for example, that workers are more productive if they have more social interaction. So a bank's call center introduced a shared 15-minute coffee break, and a pharmaceutical company replaced coffee makers used by a few marketing workers with a larger cafe area. The result? Increased sales and less turnover.
Yet the prospect of fine-grained, digital monitoring of workers' behavior worries privacy advocates. Companies, they say, have few legal obligations other than informing employees. “Whether this kind of monitoring is effective or not, it's a concern,” said Lee Tien, a senior staff lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation in San Francisco.
When Jim Sullivan began working as a waiter at a Dallas restaurant a few years ago, he was being watched — not by the prying eyes of a human boss, but by intelligent software.
The Dubs went back to the formula that works and picked up a 110-100 win over the visiting Magic on Monday night. The win was the seventh straight for the Warriors, who took control of what was a tie game at the half in the third quarter and cruised to the victory.

Kevin Durant stuffed the stat sheet with a game-high, 21 points, seven rebounds and eight assists, while Draymond Green added 20 points on a night in which the Dubs were without Stephen Curry. Veteran guard Shaun Livingston filled in admirably for the two-time MVP, totaling 16 points and six assists. With the win, the Dubs improve to 11-3 on the season, tying them with Houston for the best record in the Western Conference.
THIRD QUARTER'S THE CHARM
The Dubs did it again. Tied at 56-56 at the break, the Dubs surged ahead in the third quarter and led by as many as 15 points in the period. The Dubs out-scored Orlando 32-19 in the quarter, which was actually slightly less than their average of 32.6 points per third quarter this season. The Dubs are now an overall plus-88 in the third quarter over the last seven games – all wins.
LIVINGSTON STEPS UP
Making his first start of the year, Livingston stepped right up into a productive role for the Dubs. He shot 6-for-12 from the field for a season-high 16 points in 20 minutes, and his plus-16 was the second best on the team, behind Draymond's Green plus-25.
DEFENSIVE EFFORT
The Warriors weren't nearly as effective blocking shots or forcing turnovers as they have been for the majority of the season, but they still produced a tremendous defensive effort, especially as the game wore on. The Dubs limited Orlando to 38 percent shooting (24-for-64) over the second, third and fourth quarters, and the Warriors made sure the Magic had few second chance opportunities. David West proved to be a monster on the boards, securing 11 rebounds in 14 minutes, and the Warriors as a team out-rebounded the Magic 50-35.

STEPH SITS OUT
Stephen Curry missed his first game of the season, leaving him tied with Guy Rodgers with 587 games played (regular season only), 10th most in franchise history. Curry suffered a right thigh contusion in Saturday's win over Philadelphia and will have four full days off before the Dubs' next game. “If it was a playoff game he would play, but he's pretty sore,” Head Coach Steve Kerr said prior to the game. “We've got two days before our next game so this gives us the chance to really get him healthy and right. He didn't do anything yesterday or today. He's just been getting treatment. It's a no-brainer to rest him.”

Following Monday's game, the Dubs will embark on a four-game road trip that will take them through Thanksgiving. The trip opens Thursday in Boston and continues through Philadelphia, Brooklyn and Oklahoma City before the team comes home to host the Bulls on Friday, November 24. Find Tickets
Taj Patterson - Facebook
The New York City Police Department is coming under scrutiny for quickly shutting down an investigation into the beating of a gay art student at the hands of a group of Hasidic Jews shouting anti-gay slurs.
According to the New York Daily News, 25-year-old Taj Patterson was assaulted in December of 2013 by a group of five men, leaving him with a broken eye socket and a torn retina blinding him in one eye.
Police reports state that Patterson was accused of damaging cars in the Williamsburg neighborhood before he was set upon the men who held him down and punched and kicked him before fleeing when a passing bus driver stopped and began taking photos.
In an interview, the driver explained, “One of his eyes was closed and so swollen. He was saying, ‘My eye. I can't see.'”
Despite statements from witnesses who saw the beating — as well as a license plate number of a car belonging to one of the assailants — the investigation was shut down within 24 hours, with case marked: ” final, no arrests, CLOSED.”
Police only reopened the case after Patterson's mother badgered them to find the culprits, leading them to arrest the men.
According to police, the men are part of the Williamsburg Safety Patrol, a Hasidic volunteer neighborhood watch group whose members carry walkie talkies and sometimes cruise the neighborhood in cars outfitted to look like law enforcement vehicles. Police state that the men are supposed to notify them if they see a crime and occasionally make a citizen's arrest. How ever the group — also known as the Shomrin — has also been accused of vigilantism, focusing their attacks on black and Latino people.
The Williamsburg Safety Patrol condemned the attack and initially denied the men were part of their group but suggested that one or two might have been involved.
Abraham Winkler, 39, Mayer Herskovic, 21, and Pinchas Braver, 19, are all facing felony charges including gang assault, false imprisonment and assault. Charges against the other two men have been dropped.
Hello everyone! It's me again, with another Orange Season update. Check out what's new:
New Areas:
The old Desert Area was replaced by a new Summer Area, accessed through a new cave on the beach. Eustace and Muriel live in this new area now, on their very own farm. To go further into the summer area, you'll need to give Eustace some fruits in exchange for permission to use his bridge. Across the bridge, there's an area where you can plant summer crops regardless of the current season.
The Winter Mountains now have one extra area, where you can plant winter crops at any time.
In the back of the Ancient Ruins, there's a new area where you can plant spring crops regardless of the current season.
There's no Fall Area yet, it will be added in the next big update.
Daily Tasks:
In the center of Orange Town, there's now a signboard where villagers may post item requests. Those requests are generated randomly, based on some patterns. You need to deliver the requested items on the same day, or you miss the chance (there's no penalty if you miss it). Successfully completing a daily task will increase your friendship with the requester.
In this version, there are 7 patterns of daily tasks, for the following villagers: Viktor, Phi, Bonnie, Annie, Benjamin, Chloe, Devin

Metallica is still doing press for its 3D movie, Through The Never, which is basically a bomb at this point. He is in the UK promoting the movie, and spoke with MTV over there and brought up the idea of a potential mega tour with Green Day and U2, which they briefly discussed over dinner.
"U2 came to San Francisco two summers ago and we ended up having a lot to drink with them and Green Day following a dinner. I was told in the wee morning hours following this outing that members of U2, Green Day and Metallica agreed to tour together. We haven't talked about it since, but speaking for myself I'd be very up for that."
So they all got drunk and shot the shit and joked about touring together. Metallica are friends with Green Day, filling in for them last year when Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong had to go into rehab, but would anybody be excited at the prospect of this tour?
All three bands are headliners in their own right, so what would the order be? And ticket prices? I'm guessing just the service fees alone will be enough to cover a year's worth of underground metal shows.

Abba Abraham told of a man of Scetis who was a scribe and did not eat bread. A brother came to beg him to copy a book. The old man whose spirit was engaged in contemplation, wrote, omitting some phrases and with no punctuation. The brother, taking the book and wishing to punctuate it, noticed that words were missing. So he said to the old man, ‘Abba, there are some phrases missing.' The old man said to him, ‘Go, and practice first that which is written, then come back and I will write the rest.'
—–Sayings of the Desert
I fed you with milk, not solid food, for you were not ready for solid food. Even now you are still not ready, for you are still of the flesh. For as long as there is jealousy and quarrelling among you, are you not of the flesh, and behaving according to human inclinations?
—–1 Corinthians 3:2-3
In my office there are many books, some I have read, and some I have not read. Within my collection are books that I have not read since my seminary days. Somehow I am comforted by the clutter of words that surround me and forget that a book is no good unless it is read. The Abba and Paul hit this subject head on.
If we do not use what we have, how can more be of any use to us? Most of us, like the Corinthians and the brother of the story are crying out for fullness and never use what we already possess. We have to begin our spiritual journey by applying the knowledge we possess to our pilgrimage .As we are nourished by the milk we have been given, we then push forth to a higher plain of knowledge. Our spiritual passage begins with the life messages that God has given to us and our application of them. Far too many times we get well ahead of ourselves and begin drowning in an overload of spiritual information with the false illusion that more is better. Only later we discover that we have wasted precious time for blessing by coveting more that we can apply.
Prayer
Lord help me to absorb with diligence and humility all that you have revealed to me. May I spend my days trying to grow into the Christian that you created. This day I give to you what I know and understand, and I will wait with patience for what is to come. Amen

Eight music publishing organizations on Wednesday sued file-sharing site LimeWire for copyright infringement "on a massive scale."
The publishing houses sued under the umbrella of the National Music Publishers' Association (NMPA), of which they are members. They include EMI, Sony/ATV, Universal Music, Warner/Chappell Music, Bug Music, MPL Music Publishing, Peermusic, and The Richmond Organization.
The group is suing LimeWire, its chief executive Mark Gorton, COO and CTO Greg Bildson, and the M.J.G. LimeWire Family Limited Partnership for knowingly facilitating copyright infringement through its Web application.
The suit comes weeks after a Manhattan federal judge ruled in favor of 13 record labels and the Recording Industry Association of American (RIAA), which also sued LimeWire for copyright infringement.
The RIAA wanted the site shut down immediately, but the judge said on June 8 that LimeWire could remain open for at least another two weeks. At the time, LimeWire said a permanent injunction "could hold back the creation of new digital-music technologies that LimeWire is in the process of developing,"
The NMPA said its suit is being filed "as a related case" to the RIAA's complaint.
"The pervasive online infringement facilitated by LimeWire and others like them has consequences for everyone in the music chain," NMPA president and CEO David Israelite said in a statement.
"Operations like LimeWire must understand the songs that make their illegal venture lucrative don't appear out of thin air. Behind every song is a vast network of people  a songwriter, a publisher, a performer, a record label," Israelite continued. "They have robbed every individual in that chain by selling their site as an access point for music and then refusing to properly license the music."
LimeWire said it welcomes the NMPA at the negotiating table.
"We definitely want publishers at the table," LimeWire said in a statement. "We have had many promising meetings with labels, publishers, songwriters and artists alike about our new music service and a business model that will compensate the entire industry. Publishers are absolutely a part of that solution, and we're hopeful that this action will serve as a catalyst to help us get to there."
“I love you so much, that I'm going to get the government involved so that you can't leave”. That's how the younger generation cynically refer to marriage today. The difference in attitude, between my generation and the current one is mind-boggling when it comes to dating, love and marriage.
We grew up on unhealthy doses of Mills and Boons and fantasies about the kind of love and romance, that are well… err… found mostly in books and movies. We couldn't wait to meet prince charming and have a fairy tale wedding and life.
Nowadays, it seems no wants to get married. Not the younger generation, not those that are out of bad marriages (once bitten, twice shy), and not those who say they “escaped” ever being married and now seem to enjoy the company of younger girls in their mid-life crisis way too much to ever think of getting married. “why get married?” seems to be the new debate. If it's about money, women and men now work and earn equally, there's no need to marry for reasons of dependency. If it's about sex, it's freely available and taboos on premarital sex are being rapidly done away with. If it's about the need for children, they say, “we can have them without getting married, even get a surrogate if we're too consumed with our work, or simply adopt”! They see the legality of marriage as a “trap to commit and stay forever unhappy if it doesn't work”, because “divorce is expensive, painful and a familial and legal nightmare”.
In our generation, we bought homes and furniture to last many generations, now they buy furniture to last as long as their home rentals. The same headspace of “buy into vs rent” clearly holds good even for relationships today. I guess every generation marches to the beat of its own drummer, and perhaps it's time to either review the institution of marriage or revise the court systems so that it allows couples to divorce without dragging them decades of court dates and expensive lawyers. It was once said that the only reason for divorce, was marriage.
Now it seems it's the reason for no marriage at all. Me? Call me old fashioned or out of touch with changing realities, but I'm just a hopeless romantic. I still believe in “happily ever after”, and walking hand in hand into my sunset years with someone who will be happy to share his rocking chair with me. I may not have got it wrong the first time, but I'm not going to let the government scare me into not taking second chances. Some dreams are worth the risk!
I have been working for the past couple of years. However, now, I can't get myself to come to work on an everyday basis. I have thought about freelancing but the remuneration from it won't run my house. I have a two-year-old daughter as well and am a single parent. But this wish of not working is definitely depressing me. What should I do?
If you are a single parent the one thing you should focus on is your income source. Thank it, bless it, give it your 100% and outperform. It enables you to get better care, education and lifestyle for your child. In this scenario, your daughter, your work and “me time”, are all equally important. It gets easier as they go to full time school. There's nothing to be depressed about. You have a job, lovely child and a super life ahead. If you stay vibrant, life will be so.
I used to date a girl in college and we were very serious about each other. Unfortunately, because of opposing families, we had to break it off and went on to marry other people. 10 years later we happened to run into each other and over time rekindled our relationship. We both realised that we are in loveless marriages and want to be with each other. However, our respective spouses are unwilling to give us divorces. She has two small children while I have none. What should we do?
First thing, if you are in a loveless marriage, please don't have children and subject them to such an environment. Exit your marriage, even if it means a long process, as it's never too late for either of you to find befitting companionship with someone else. Leave because you are unhappy, not because of someone else. Because if you fall out of love with her, then you have gone from the frying pan into the fire. As for her, she will have to weigh all factors and take a very serious life decision, as it involves children.
I have been divorced since a year now and my family is pressurising me to settle down again. They keep setting me up with men in the hope that I will get married and move out. I am more or less financially independent. I am not ready to get into another relationship at this point in my life and want to concentrate on myself. How do I convince my family to stop hounding me?
No harm checking out who all they send your way. I always say, keep yourself open to all possibilities. I've been divorced 14 years, met many people, dated a few but always had ample time for my work, my kids, my friends, travel and pampering. Meeting them doesn't have to mean taking it forward. Best case scenario, you will experience love, worst case scenario, you will have made a friend. Also, every relationship doesn't have to translate into marriage, and if it does, it will only be because you want it to.
The Samsung Chromebook Pro is finally going to be a real device. Lost in the hubbub of Google I/O Friday, Samsung quietly dropped a press release pegging the device for a May 28 release date.
With the Chromebook Pixel off the market, the all-aluminum, touch-and-pen enabled, Android app-packing Samsung "Chromebook" models were immediately looked to as the flagships of the Chromebook universe. Samsung announced the ARM-powered Chromebook Plus and Intel-powered Chromebook Pro at CES in January, and the Plus saw a reasonable release date the next month. Review units for the faster, Intel-powered Chromebook Pro went out in February, too, but the actual release date remained a mystery.
Now it's May, and almost five months after the announcement, the Chromebook Pro will finally hit the streets. The reason for the delay is the Android apps on Chrome OS feature. It has been around as a "beta" for some time, but wrapping things up apparently took much longer than Google expected. According to a report from The Verge , the Android on Chrome OS beta will continue into the summer. And while the Chromebook Pro's Android container will be running Android 7.0, it still won't support window resizing at launch.
The Plus made it to market because the ARM-based device better matches what typical Android hardware looks like. A tiny handful of Intel-based Android phones is released every year, but apparently Chrome OS made things a little more complicated. The Intel Chromebook actually had worse Android performance than the ARM one, despite packing a faster processor. With more time to cook, hopefully the bugs have been worked out.
The Chromebook Pro will be available for purchase at BestBuy.com, Amazon.com, Samsung.com, and the ShopSamsung app for $549.99.
Police are searching for a suspect after a woman was grabbed from behind and nearly sexually assaulted Sunday.
Around 2:30 a.m. Sunday, police said a 27-year-old woman was walking along the Key Bridge when she noticed a man walking towards her. As the two passed each other, police said the man grabbed her from behind and pulled her of the sidewalk towards the grass area near the George Washington Memorial Parkway.
According to police, the man then covered her mouth and tried to put his hands under her shorts. The woman was able to escape and flee the area.
Now police are looking for the suspect described as a white male, in his late 20's to early 30's, approximately 5'8” to 5'10” with a medium build. Police said he has fair skin, dirty blonde hair and was clean shaven at the time of the incident.
The suspect was last seen wearing a dark t-shirt with tan shorts or pants. He was also last seen fleeing the area on foot along the Key Bridge towards D.C.
Detectives from the Special Victim's Unit are actively investigating this incident. If anyone has information on the identity of this individual or details surrounding this incident, please contact Detective R. Icolari of the Arlington County Police Department's Special Victim's Unit at 703.228.4240 or at Ricolari@arlingtonva.us. To report information anonymously, contact the Arlington County Crime Solvers at 866.411.TIPS (8477).
The Russian government has revealed that a vast quantity of high-quality diamonds rests beneath a Siberian impact crater, numbering in the "trillions of carats".
The Popigai crater, 100km-wide and located in the isolated north of the country, was formed roughly 35.7 million years ago by the impact of an asteroid estimated to be between five and eight kilometres wide. Its collision created a wealth of impact diamonds -- which form when an existing diamond seam is hit by a large falling body -- in such quantities that could, it is claimed, supply the world diamond market for the next 3,000 years.
According to the Christian Science Monitor, Nikolai Pokhilenko, the director of the Novosibirsk Institute of Geology and Mineralogy, has said that these diamonds are "twice as hard" as normal diamonds, making them ideal for industrial and scientific use. He also claimed that the supply under Popigai is ten times the size of the rest of the world's reserves, potentially holding trillions of carats. A carat -- defined as 200mg -- is the standard measurement of weight for precious gems and minerals.

The Popigai crater is the world's fourth-largest asteroid impact crater known so far, after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater" title="Chicxulub crater" data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card">Chicxulub</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudbury_Basin" title="Sudbury Basin" data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card">Sudbury</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vredefort_crater" title="Vredefort crater" data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card">Vredefort</a> craters.
The Soviet government reportedly discovered the deposits in the 1970s on a scientific expedition, but decided to keep the information secret so as not to disturb world markets and lower the value of their already-profitable Mirny mine further east, which at its height was producing ten million carats of diamonds per year.

The mine, now closed due to falling yields, is currently the second-largest excavated hole in the world, and helicopters are forbidden from flying over it in case downward air flow sucks them in. The Soviet Union had also invested large sums in manufacturing high-quality diamonds, and wanted to see a return on their research.
For over a century since the discovery of diamonds in the British colonies of southern Africa, the de Beers corporation had sustained an effective monopoly over world diamond prices by controlling roughly 80 percent of the world's supply. That monopoly
broke down in 2000 as countries like Russia and Australia began discovering and producing their own vast reserves, leading to de Beers' share dropping to around 45 percent. If the Russian source under Popigai is as big as reported, then the world diamond industry will be in for further changes -- especially if their quality is as high as is claimed.
The Senate has confirmed James Comey as the new director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation by a 93 to 1 margin.
Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) had placed a hold on Comey's nomination over questions about the bureau's use of drones on U.S. soil and the policies surrounding that use. After receiving a response to his concerns from the FBI detailing the "limited" use of surveillance drones, Paul released his hold.
"The FBI today responded to my questions on domestic use of surveillance drones by saying that they don't necessarily need a warrant to deploy this technology. I disagree with this interpretation. However, given the fact that they did respond to my concerns over drone use on U.S. soil, I have decided to release my hold on the pending FBI director nominee," Paul said in a statement explaining his decision.
The Kentucky senator had deemed previous responses to his questions insufficient. He was the only senator to vote against Comey's confirmation; two senators voted "present."
“It is a shame that such an important and highly qualified nominee to lead the FBI had to wait an unprecedented 38 days to be confirmed, but I am glad that Senators finally came together to ensure that the FBI has a confirmed leader at the helm,” said Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), who presided over Comey's confirmation hearings.
Comey, 52, a former senior Justice Department official, will replace Robert S. Mueller III, who is leaving the agency after a dozen years.
Comey was at the center of some of the most bruising debates over counterterrorism during the Bush administration and established a reputation as a fierce defender of the law and the integrity of the Justice Department regardless of the political pressures of the moment.
He left the Justice Department in 2005 and served as a senior vice president and general counsel at the defense contractor Lockheed Martin until 2010. In June 2010, Comey joined Bridgewater Associates, a Connecticut-based hedge fund with $75 billion in investments for clients including universities and foreign governments.
Comey left the hedge fund in January and has been teaching national security law at Columbia Law School in New York.

“Since I was a kid, I wanted to learn a musical instrument. But due to the financial conditions at home, I could not take it up. It was only after my marriage, and with the complete support of my wife, I started to learn the guitar,” he says, adding, “I do not know how to read and write, and I believe that my wife is my gift from God. Today I have six guitars, a Yamaha keyboard and a drum kit and all of this was possible only because of my wife's support.”
“Amit Sinha, one of my regular customers' who works in an MNC opposite my auto stand in Siripuram happened to use my service for the first time in 2010. After I told him about my interest in music during our first chat, the next time when I had met him, almost after a month, he gifted me my first guitar, which he got directly from the manufacturer in Kolkata. Learning that guitars cost almost 50 per cent less if bought from the factory, with his help I got all my guitars. He was very supportive and said that he would pay for the guitar and I would pay him back in instalments. The same with my drum kit; I still pay Rs 125 every month for the drums.”
“I had to give up music for almost a year when my wife had to be hospitalised due to some health complications. It was then that my wife insisted that I get the keyboard imported from the US with my savings,” he adds.
On how he learnt to play the guitar, Sai says, “I started learning from David, a bass guitarist, but soon had to stop. My daughter and son are both going to some of the best schools in the city and to make sure that their education is not disturbed; I drive the auto almost throughout the day to repay the loans for their education. But, whenever I am home, I practice the notes given to me by David.”
“I want my daughter to become a chartered accountant and my son to become one of the best drummers in the country,” he adds.
Listing a few of his favourite artistes, Sai says, “Bryan Adams is my favourite. But I also love Pink Floyd, Elton John, Police, Maroon 5, AC DC, Scorpions, Creed, U2, Bob Marley, Eagles, Red Hot Chilli Peppers; I have the entire collection of these artistes. There is not one song that I would have missed in my collection. When I watched VH1, my wife would write down the song's name and one of my customers, who is also a good friend, would download them for me.”
Talking about his future plans in music, Sai says, “With the hope of performing on a stage like MTV Unplugged or Coke Studio, I started to grow my hair to get the rock star look. My dream is to be part of A.R. Rahman's team and one day I am hoping to perform in Los Angeles with Slash.”

What do you get when you mix a Canadian with a New Yorker, both with mad love for the show ‘How I Met Your Mother'? A no-brainer of a theme for a big birthday bash! Challenge accepted!
I can't even begin to tell you how much fun this party was to plan for my husband Kevin's 35th birthday. ‘How I Met Your Mother' is our favorite show and if you're a fan, you'll get it. It's smart and funny and everything you want a sitcom to be. Just brilliant! One of the best parts of planning was that another party guru friend, Jenny of Craft That Party is also a huge fan and contributed some of the greatest details you'll see. It was great to bounce ideas off her and she put up with all my crazy requests, so…thanks so much Jenny! We're like ‘bros' now…
If you're a fan of the show, you'll appreciate the innate detail and obsessive thought that went into everything, from the specific placement of the Ted peg doll, standing atop a pile of Architectural Digests, separate from his coupled friends, to the iconic New York coffee cups (bet they've never been used this way before!) and chinese takeout boxes, the use of little red hearts (on the paper and ribbon) to portray a big part of what this show is about and the symbolism of the one yellow plate on the photo wall backdrop Speaking of which, that wall is made of paper plates. The iconic paper plate backdrop was originated by Piggy Bank Parties and I'm so glad I finally got to use it for one of my parties. It made for a great photo wall.
The main design element was the black and white checkered pattern, just like the NYC taxicabs. It started on the invites and carried through to all the printed items, awesomely designed by Renee Nicole Designs, and was also used on the fabric runner, favor tablecloth and yes, that's checkered duck tape wrapped around the wreath and centerpiece cans. True story. I also used yellow, red and blue as accent colors for the yellow umbrella, blue french horn and red intervention sign and tied it into all the other party details.
Every food item and detail is a reference from the show and there are so many details that I'd probably have to split this post up quite a bit to explain, so I'll just let the photos do the talking. I love that through my Instagram sneaks, I got a few followers to become fans of the show. New fans, I hope you're loving it as much as we do!
Some of the details include:
*the infamous yellow umbrella as part of the dessert table backdrop
*amazing sketch of NYC skyline by Craft That Party as part of the dessert table backdrop
*realistic peg dolls of the 5 main characters (Craft That Party)
*yellow drink umbrellas (Craft That Party)
*the Playbook and a stack of Architectural Digests held desserts on the dessert table
*iconic NY coffee cups
*chinese takeout containers
*pineapple guest favors
*pie chart about ‘Why we love Kevin'
*the Intervention sign
*and oh yeah, a real goat. that kind of made the party legen…well, you know the rest.
Desserts:
‘Best Burger in New York cupcakes':…seriously cute
“Pineapple cake pops”: by Dream Cakes (so delicious!)
‘HIMYM cookies': by The Cookie Jar (red cowboy boots, blue french horns, yellow umbrellas and suit jackets with ducky ties)
‘Marshmallows and Lily Pads': (i had to…for those who don't know the show, this is what two of the characters call each other. These were homemade rum vanilla marshmallows sitting on top of green apple fruit leather by LGTPS.)
Food:
‘Ted's Superbowl Wings'
‘Eating a Sandwich': a giant 6′ hero (or sub, depending on where you're from) for the times in college they were ‘eating a sandwich')
”Goat' cheese salad': served in chinese takeout containers
Drinks:
Since my husband is Canadian, I had to go with Canadian beer, but we also had wine and scotch (both relevant to the show) and the beer sat on a cigar box. Water bottles were wrapped with labels saying ‘haaaaave…you met Kevin'?
We had guests fill out cards that said:
How I met Kevin:
Things I learned from my mother:
Why Kevin is awesome:
The GOAT was definitely a highlight! His name was Cupcake and he was so sweet. I'm not sure who enjoyed him more, the kids or the adults! Disclaimer: No animals were harmed in the having of this party!
Everyone took photos by the checkered wall with little bubble quote signs with sayings from the show. One detail that might not come across in photos is: on the wall when you enter the house, there were 2 little signs ‘Legen' and ‘wait for it'….and on the back patio door was ‘dary'. You'll only get that if you watch the show.
As a parting favor, each family took home, what else? A pineapple…
For more pics, see the gallery on my website or LOTS more photos on my One Stone Events facebook page.
It was so much fun not only incorporating details from our favorite show into the party, but being able to pay homage to where my husband and I both come from (hence, the giant Canadian flag backdrop on the food table). A good time was had by all and I'm pretty sure the birthday boy felt loved. He was SO deserving of this great celebration. We were especially thankful for the Canadians who flew in just for this special occasion!
So, if I haven't convinced you to be a fan by now, what are you waiting for? It's the best show ever! Start watching…now. You have time to catch up before the final season starts in the fall.
And for all you other superfans out there, if you plan to throw a HIMYM bash, I hope to be a source of fun inspiration for you!
So tell me, are you a HIMYM fan? Have you ever had a party based on a show?

Wikimedia Commons Yesterday on "Meet the Press," Bob Woodward of the Washington Post displayed documents that outline a "Grand Bargain" the White House offered during debt ceiling negotiations in 2011.
The document in question appears to have been drafted by White House Legislative Affairs Director Rob Nabors, and includes the annotation 'Post Gang of 6' which suggests it was created as Supercommittee talks broke down.
Woodward describes the three-page document as "confidential" and points out Obama's apparent willingness to take on sacred cows such as Medicare and Social Security. Specifically, the president was open to increasing the minimum age for Medicare recipients.
Obama's proposal called for:
Caps on discretionary spending;
Extension of the payroll tax cut;
Increase in the debt ceiling;
A sequestration mechanism if deficit reduction is not achieved;
Reduction in spending on Medicare and non-Medicare health programs;
Changes to Social Security taxes and benefits; and
Tax reform through simplification and elimination of loopholes.
It's often said that now is the hardest time to be a photographer – the challenge of being commercially successful is greater than ever and the internet provides photo editors with all the free images they could ever need – so where does an emerging photographer fit in? And with the digital revolution meaning that you no longer need to spend hours in a darkroom, is it still worthwhile to study photography? As someone who is just starting out in their photography career, this is difficult to hear. And actually, I disagree. I think now is the most exciting time to be a photographer.
It may be cliched to say that I have always been into photography, but I have. Prior to studying photography formally I would travel to cities around the world to capture different environments. I had great ideas but as I was the only viewer, I was never sure if my work was technically or aesthetically good. Would my images be compelling enough outside of my darkroom?
When I moved to London I thought that I should study something that would make my family proud, so I went to Middlesex University to do a business degree. However, I quickly realised that I could never commit to the course so changed to photography after just a few weeks. I am now a photography masters student and think that formal education of the subject is important. The training has given me confidence to make cohesive stories out of the pictures I shoot and the frequent critiques you receive are invaluable.

Of course there are self-taught photographers working for National Geographic who have never had a lesson, but I think studying the subject broadens your horizons. It gives you access to a wide network of materials and people and provides a stimulus to keep shooting. For me, it has made my approach to photography both disciplined and organised.
It has also made me aware of the challenges ahead. The outside world is tough when you have to face commercial clients and send work out endlessly to magazines for publication. As a new photographer you are up against people who have been in the business for years with much stronger portfolios and yet even they are struggling to get work published. How do I get my portfolio noticed and make it stand out from the crowd?
When my series of shots from Afghanistan were published in News Week two years ago, it was a one-off thing. My photos suited their words and they simply needed a photo essay to illustrate them. So then how do you get your work published as an emerging photographer? Students tend to produce personal projects, often about their past relationships, and although they can be amazing, why would a commercial client be interested? It's not work that can be published on a daily basis and, ultimately, you need to work out what will make you money.

Magazines don't have an open brief, their next edition could be about Storm Sandy and if you don't have those images the editors won't be interested – you have to fit their brief, not the other way around. I feel magazines often just need pictorial material – they don't necessarily care who you are as a photographer – so you have to second guess what they want and stay ahead of the game. Another challenge is that selling an image involves much more than presenting just a good picture – a strong portfolio is no longer enough. A curator or photo editor wants to know if you have won awards, been published or exhibited elsewhere, and multimedia elements are often expected of your work. So how do you get noticed in such a competitive field?

I think entering competitions needs to be a daily part of the photographer's life. Winning the Student Focus competition at the Sony World Photography awards has given me exposure I could only dream of. On the back of the win, Middlesex University gave me a scholarship to do my photography MA. Without the Student Focus title I would be just another graduate photographer, with it I hope I am on route to becoming a commercially successful photographer.
Asef Ali Mohammad, aged 27, is the winner of the 2012 Sony World Photography awards Student Focus competition. As part of his prize, Middlesex University, where Asef studies, was presented with €35,000 of Sony digital imaging equipment for its photography department. Asef was born in Afghanistan and educated in Pakistan before moving to the UK in 2002.
Entries for the 2013 Sony World Photography awards Student Focus competition are open until 30 November 2012. To find out more go to: worldphoto.org
The potentially devastating effects of ocean acidification on coral reefs are well reported. However, the methods used to evaluate the potential harm are often focused on individual species, viewed in isolation. According to an international research team led by Peter J. Edmunds of California State University, Northridge, this simplistic approach neglects broad-scale inter-species and inter-population dynamics that may have unforeseen consequences for ecosystems.
"Most studies address the effects of ocean acidification on single species of corals and calcified algae in tanks," write the team members in an article for the journal BioScience. This approach, they argue, will be inadequate for evaluating the emergent properties of acidification-afflicted reef ecosystems. Answering the wider question of whether reefs will grow or dissolve "requires a consideration of scaling effects."
Differences across scales--from organisms to populations, to communities and ecosystems--have "particularly strong implications for coral reefs," say the authors. At the narrow scale, species-specific responses to acidification are highly variable, a result of corals' varied protective tissue layers, differing skeletal solubilities, and numerous other factors. Such differences have far-reaching implications at broader scales. For instance, differently responding symbiotic genotypes (zooxanthellae) could have major effects on a reef's community structure--and, ultimately, on the health of the reef as a whole.
To address these neglected dynamics, the authors propose an approach that combines empirical evidence with traditional biological scaling models and computer simulations to achieve a broader understanding of acidification effects. Only by synthesizing theory and existing empirical practices, they say, will it be possible to ascertain "how the population-level impacts of ocean acidification sum to community- and ecosystem-level impacts."
Despite the promise of their work, the authors caution that "we should not expect a 'grand unifying theory' of the effects of ocean acidification on coral reefs to emerge." Rather, they report that the best hope for unraveling the complex web of ocean acidification effects lies in the deployment of a diverse "suite of complementary modeling approaches."
Peter J. Edmunds will appear on the podcast BioScience Talks on 11 May 2016.

UPDATE: 6:27 p.m. — It looks like clinching a berth might be a little less complicated this weekend. Turns out if Seattle beats the Red Bulls, there is no scenario where the Rapids AND Whitecaps can pass the Sounders.
Colorado and Vancouver still have two games against each other, meaning there wouldn't be enough points to go around.
So a Seattle win and a Dallas loss should be enough to do it.
* * *
A lot of pieces have to fall in place, but Sounders FC can clinch a playoff berth this weekend. Here is the scenario:
— Sounders FC beats New York at home Sunday.
— FC Dallas loses to Columbus at home Sunday.
— Vancouver loses to Real Salt Lake at home Saturday.
If those results happen, Seattle would 53 points, a total that FC Dallas and Chivas USA (already eliminated) would not be able to reach even if they win out.
The Whitecaps and Earthquakes could also reach 53 points by winning the rest of their games, but the Sounders would hold the head-to-head tiebreaker of most wins. Seattle would have 16 wins and Vancouver/San Jose would have a maximum of 15 wins possible.
In another scenario, two more Sounders win clinch a playoff berth regardless of other results. But that, of course, can't happen this weekend.
Either way, it seems a pretty sure bet Seattle will make it 5-for-5 in terms of qualifying for postseason.
Distributed technology is on the rise – as the world grows more densely interconnected and more authoritarian, technologies that remove centralized choke points grow more important, both for practical and political reasons. Centralized services are vulnerable to both scale failure, as our demands on them explode – and, more fundamentally, they're vulnerable to despots and oligarchs who would like to control our ability to live, spend, and communicate.
On this site, we talk primarily about the blockchain-based decentralized technologies, notably Bitcoin. Today, though, we're going to make a brief departure to talk about an exciting development in the decentralized web, a service that recently went into alpha called “Project Maelstrom” from BitTorrent.
The idea is simple: in a traditional client-server web architecture, the sort that essentially all webpages are hosted on today, work in a fairly straightforward fashion. If you want to view a site, you send a message over the internet backbone to a server hosting the site. The server is a specific computer or collection of computers, in some cases rented from a cloud hosting services. The server sends you a series of packets, which your browser renders as the web page. The way Maelstrom works is a little different: instead of a specific server hosting Maelstrom sites, the sites are hosted by everyone who's recently visited them, via the BitTorrent protocol. Instead of having IP addresses, you have torrent trackers that identify the file you're looking for. No centralized servers mean that websites get faster under load, not slower. It also means that websites simply can't be taken down, period, ever, except maybe through lack of interest.
This is new technology, and technical questions remain: can the overhead be reduced enough to make loading crowd-hosted pages load quickly? Beyond that, there's a question of interactivity. The traditional BitTorrent protocol will work fine for simple HTML pages, but technologies that can power more sophisticated, interactive web pages (like Reddit) still need to be developed. There's also the issue of DNS resolution, needed to turn incomprehensible torrent tracker information into human-readable URLs. Something like Namecoin may be appropriate, but the issue of price-setting remains challenging.
For now, the service remains in a very limited alpha. Eventually, BitTorrent-powered web pages might provide the infrastructure for the next generation of Bitcoin sites, marketplaces, and communities. The future of the web is decentralized, and I can't wait to see it.
Internet Explorer 6 and Windows XP are giving their farewell error warnings.
Screencap from Windows XP.
There are a lot of metaphors one could use to describe the decade plus longevity of Windows XP, Microsoft Office 2003, and Internet Explorer 6. But I'm gonna go with lichen. These software gems were hardy, reliable, unobtrusive, and enduring as wave after wave of technological progress crashed over the jagged rocks they clung to.
What, you don't like my metaphor? Microsoft has been working to kill these services, and they just keep holding on. It's apt! But I guess we can also call them zombies, if you insist.
But today Microsoft released seven security updates for Windows XP and four for Microsoft Office 2003. The company made it clear (if it wasn't already) that this is the end of the line. The operating system and Office suite will no longer be supported, which means using them will run major security risks. It's finally happening.
Though a death isn't usually pleasant, this day of Microsoft funerals feels long overdue, especially for IE 6. By 2001, when Microsoft released IE 6, the browser was so dominant that Microsoft didn't work hard to innovate. The company didn't release bug fixes in a timely way, it didn't attempt to compete by adding features that were available in Firefox and other new-generation browsers, and it didn't always follow agreed-upon Web standards. These things weren't that noticeable when generations of IE were dominating the game, but in the five years it took Microsoft to release IE 7, the brand's influence had been significantly eroded. Web developers in particular are thrilled to let IE 6 fade away.
As a developer, I'm more excited about today's demise of #IE6 rather than the end of #WindowsXP. Now if only #IE8 can go take a flying leap. — Joey Kincer (@kinless) April 8, 2014
And while XP and Office 2003 didn't do anything wrong in particular—in fact, they were innovative in their day—they stuck around much longer than software usually does and just couldn't function normally toward the end.
But wait—they're still fighting from beyond the grave! Windows XP market share is still at almost 28 percent. That's after years of Microsoft efforts to get people to switch. And Office 2003 has been going strong, too. IE 6's market share is still 4.4 percent worldwide, and it's purportedly 22.2 percent in China, though those numbers might not be reliable.
No matter what Microsoft does, it seems like XP and IE 6 zombies will be roaming around for a while. Be safe out there, everyone.
ASTRONOMICALLY HUGE NEWS DAY: Yes, you read the heading correctly. This December will mark the tenth and final Doomtree Blowout.
Before the rumors ever have a chance of flying around, let's make one thing clear: This in no way marks the end of Doomtree. When we all met up earlier this year to start planning the big Blowout X, we got to thinking about how incredibly lame and boring the idea of ever throwing a Blowout 11 sounded (let alone a Blowout 18). We've been talking for awhile now about wanting to switch things up a bit and challenge ourselves to create new traditions moving forward. With the retrospective Every Single Day book out this past summer and a brand-new crew album on the horizon early next year, this just seemed like the perfect time to put an exclamation point on the last decade of awesomeness and close out an important chapter before gearing up for a truly insane 2015. So that's pretty much that in a nutshell. Now for the glorious details.
12/6-12/13. Saturday to Saturday. 10 events in 8 days. Every hour on the hour we'll be announcing the details of each unique day's schedule. For our first show we'll be taking it over the river to St. Paul and kicking things off at the newly renovated Turf Club!
Keep coming back every hour for new details on all eight days! Huge shouts to our sponsors at The Current, Vita.mn, and Surly. Equally huge shouts to the great organizations that we'll be donating a portion of all Blowout sales to: Southside Family Nurturing Center, Animal Humane Society, Hope Community Center, Domestic Abuse Project, and Kicker Project. Sign up for the Doomtree Mailing List HERE to get a shot at ticket pre-sales this Thursday. Otherwise, the public on-sale starts at noon this Friday, and a bunch of us will be at The Depot at 4:30 on Friday selling tickets hand to hand.
10:00am UPDATE: Sunday is Surly Doomtree Day! We're keeping the details on this one pretty close to the chest for now, but here's the gist. For those that don't know, Surly is a local beer company that has been killing the game for quite awhile now. We hung out with these guys a lot over the summer and realized how similar the Doomtree and Surly build-it-from-the-ground-up stories are, so we decided to use one of the Blowout days to showcase and bring together our two different worlds of music and beer. Full details coming soon. Stay tuned!
11:00am UPDATE: Monday 12/8 we'll be rocking a super small and intimate show at Icehouse! This night will be a big showcase of all the different musical endeavors our individual members get into when we're not working on a new crew record. Side projects, tomfoolery, and tons of friends. Anybody's guess really. Going to be insane.
12:00pm UPDATE: Doomtree loves the kids! On Tuesday 12/9 we're christening it Kids Day. Members of Doomtree will be visiting various schools throughout the Twin Cities in the morning and afternoon; reading books to pre-schoolers, teaching workshops with junior high kids, and writing raps with the big high schoolers. Then at night we take it back to the Triple Rock for a huge all ages show. A show for the (all) ages if you will. Dad jokes!
1:00pm UPDATE: This is a special one. Wednesday 12/10 marks the exact ten-year anniversary of the very first Doomtree Blowout (to the date!). So it only made sense to take things back to the Varsity Theater where everything began. It's real sentimental for us right now. Our friends at TPT will also be filming this event for a special episode of their Lowertown Line show. TEN YEARS! Crazed.
2:00pm UPDATE: Now it's time to bring it all back home to First Avenue, our favorite venue in the entire world and the prime location of every Blowout since our second one. Thursday 12/11 will be an 18+ show in the First Avenue Mainroom. It will be guaranteed NUTZ.
3:00pm UPDATE: Day 7 of the #LastBlowoutEver will be an epic doubleheader. We'll start things off at The Current at noon for a live taping, performance, and interview in the acclaimed UBS Forum (more details on how to score passes to that event coming real soon). Then we take things right back to First Ave for our second 18+ show over there before Saturday's final event. Maaaaaaan this is gonna a fun week.
4:00pm UPDATE: THE GRAND FINALE! Our tenth and final event will conclude with the last night in a three-night stand at First Avenue. In my opinion the Doomtree Blowout and First Ave are pretty much synonymous with each other at this point. We basically grew up at this venue. I couldn't imagine closing out the #LastBlowoutEver anywhere else. This one's for the grown folks. 21+ and I'm sure plenty rowdy. Going out with one hell of a bang.
BAM! So there you have it. 10 events in 8 days. The last Doomtree Blowout ever. Thanks for following along all day to the hour by hour announcements. If you've already signed up for the Doomtree Mailing List, expect an email shortly with special pre-sale ticket information. Otherwise tickets will officially go on sale to the public at 12:00pm CST on Friday. If you're in the Twin Cities, come on down to The Depot at 4:30pm on Friday and buy your tickets directly from us. We'll have 50 “ALL IN” passes that will grant you access to all of the ticketed events, if you're looking to make a real week out of it (must be 21+, only available in person at The Depot). So excited to have all this news out into the world. Here's a quick rundown just in case your head is spinning like mine right now.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Gabe Newell discusses Valve's Steam Box console plans with the BBC's Daniel Emery
Valve expects to offer prototypes of its upcoming video games console for testing within four months time.
The firm's chief executive Gabe Newell revealed the news to the BBC ahead of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta) Games Awards.
Valve's online PC games store Steam has already proven highly popular and analysts suggest the console, called Steam Box, could have a big impact.
Mr Newell is being honoured with an Academy Fellowship at the event.
He was less forthcoming about whether his firm was actively working on new sequels to its hit science fiction franchises Half Life and Portal.
Portal 2 - a puzzle based game involving a prisoner trying to escape test chambers controlled by a homicidal computer - won the best game and two other awards at last year's Baftas.
Steam Box
Valve's Steam platform - which promotes titles by other developers as well as its own - has over 50 million registered accounts with software for the Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems.
Image caption Mr Newell would not be drawn on whether Half Life 3 was a planned launch title for the Steam Box
Its upcoming Steam Box hardware is designed to make it easy to access the service via living room televisions posing a challenge to Nintendo's Wii U, the upcoming Sony PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's next Xbox.
"We're working with partners trying to nail down how fast we can make it," Mr Newell told the BBC.
"We'll be giving out some prototypes to customers to gauge their reactions, I guess, in the next three to four months.
"There are noise issues and heat issues and being able to [deal with] that while still offering a powerful enough gaming experience is the challenge in building it."
He added that his company had still to finalise how the console's controller would work as it continued to explore the possibility of including sensors to measure the gamers' body states.
"If you think of a game like Left For Dead - which was trying to put you into a sort of horror movie - if you don't change the experience of what the player is actually feeling then it stops being a horror game," Mr Newell explained.
"So you need to actually be able to directly measure how aroused the player is - what their heart rate is, things like that - in order to offer them a new experience each time they play."
Undeclared price
Image caption Portal 2 has won several awards including three prizes at last year's Baftas
One industry analyst said Valve's effort to transform itself from a games creator to an online marketplace was impressive, but added that it was still too soon to know if the Steam Box would be a success.
"I don't have any doubt they will put forth an impressive machine and it's pretty clear that at launch they will have a significant game catalogue," said Lewis Ward from IDC.
"But the surrounding app ecosystem is unlikely to match other consoles which have Netflix, video conferencing tie-ins and other non-gaming aspects.
"And we still don't know the price - Valve will be unable to subsidise its console in the same way the other manufacturers do, so that remains a major unknown."
Former President Obama on Thursday mourned longtime Pittsburgh Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney, who died Thursday at 84.
In a statement Thursday, Obama said Rooney was a great friend of his.
"But more importantly, he was a great friend to the people of Pittsburgh, a model citizen, and someone who represented the United States with dignity and grace on the world stage," Obama said in the statement.
The former president said he knew Rooney would do a "wonderful job" when he named him to the post of U.S. ambassador to Ireland.

"But naturally, he surpassed my high expectations, and I know the people of Ireland think fondly of him today," he said.
"And I know the people of Pittsburgh, who loved him not only for the Super Bowl championships he brought as the owner of the Steelers, but for his generosity of spirit, mourn his passing today."
The Steelers confirmed Rooney's death on Twitter.
The Boston School Committee voted unanimously Wednesday night to approve a new systemwide schedule that will allow most teenagers in the district to sleep in a bit next year.
Under the new framework, most high schools will start at or after 8 a.m. Presently, about half of the district's public schools start class at or before 7:30 a.m. And whenever possible, younger children will be dismissed before 4 p.m., in part to prevent them from running out of steam late in the day — or walking home in the dark.
Exceptions will be made for schools enrolling many students with autism or medical conditions. Schools and families will be notified of the precise changes to the schedule as early as Thursday morning.
Switching up high schoolers' schedules has been a district priority for some time, due in large part to a growing convergence of sleep science and educational activism.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends teens get between eight to 10 hours of sleep each night, but most get fewer than that. Many sleep researchers, like Wendy Troxel, have blamed what they call an "epidemic" of teenage sleep deprivation on high-school schedules, arguing they aren't built around students' internal clocks.
“Adolescent biology is unique compared to any other stage of life," Troxel, a senior behavioral scientist at the RAND Corporation, said. "Their sleep-wake biology is shifted by about two hours.”
She likened teenage sleep patterns to being permanently jet-lagged. Troxel and others believes that early start times don't just rob students of the benefits — like better mood and memory — that come with a good night's rest. They can trigger or exacerbate the problems associated with adolescent learners: irritability, distraction, even anxiety and depression.
Troxel has argued that high school classes should start at 8:30 a.m or later. But she told WBUR that schedule changes like the one passed in Boston are steps in the right direction.
To arrive at a systemwide plan for next school year's start times, the district's operations team turned to the same MIT engineers who plotted this year's bus routes (with mixed early results). The engineers developed another algorithm that has churned through — the district announced with pride — 1.8 octodecillion possible school-day schedules, whittling them down to a few ahead of Wednesday's meeting.
The district still has not released a full picture of how the systemwide plan will work. But whatever happens next will look like a flip of this year's schedule. Buses will drop young children — who are often wide awake at 6 a.m. — at school earlier, while older students keep dreaming.
Several other Massachusetts districts, notably Monomoy School Districts on Cape Cod, have been trying out a similar schedule of late. More than a dozen districts in-state have responded to activism from groups like Start School Later.
There weren't many criticisms presented by the public or school committee members before the unanimous vote. Some said they have heard from some older students who warned against starting school too late, citing work and childcare responsibilities in the afternoon.
Jessica Tang, president of the Boston Teachers' Union, says most of the educators she knows are in support of more high-quality learning time with more wakeful students. But she added that some teachers do worry about juggling their own childcare and commutes under the new schedule.
Earlier this year, Boston polled teachers, families and staff, letting them rank 11 possible start times ranging from 7:30 a.m. to 9 a.m. The thousands of responses didn't square perfectly with sleep science.
Families and teachers of elementary students tended to cluster around later start times — as late at 8:30 a.m. At high schools, stakeholders aimed for 8 a.m. or earlier. Few respondents of any group, other than some families of high school students, expressed much interest at 9 a.m. or later start times.
But Mary Hamaker, who leads the Start School Later initiative in Massachusetts, explains those poll results as a sign of predictable wariness of something new and disruptive. She and others hope that the new schedule in Boston will win over even the most reluctant as its benefits become clearer.
The significance of the change remains to be seen. What is clear is that, as of next fall, the times — they are a-changing.
President Bush changed the way he talked about Iran in August: He stopped making explicit assertions about the existence of an Iranian nuclear weapons program.
On Monday, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a new national intelligence estimate in which the nation's 16 intelligence agencies concluded that Iran suspended its nuclear weapons program four years ago -- a dramatic rejection of an earlier set of findings.
Bush yesterday said he was only briefed about the new estimate last week.
But a close examination of his word choice over the past year suggests that he learned something around August that got him to stop making claims that were apparently no longer supported by American intelligence.
Instead of directly condemning Iranian leaders for pursuing nuclear weapons, he started more vaguely accusing them of seeking the knowledge necessary to make such a weapon.
Even as he did that, however, he and the vice president accelerated their rhetorical efforts to persuade the public that the nuclear threat posed by Iran was grave and urgent. Bush went so far in late August and October as to warn of the potential for a nuclear holocaust.
Indeed, a careful parsing of Bush's words indicates that, while not saying anything that could later prove to be demonstrably false, Bush left his listeners with what he likely knew was a fundamentally false impression. And he did so in the pursuit of a more muscular and possibly even military approach to a Middle Eastern country.
It's an oddly familiar pattern of deception.
Bush's Changing Words
A survey of Bush's remarks about Iran's nuclear ambitions in 2007 suggests that a shift took place somewhere between August 6 and August 9. There wasn't a change in his overall message, just his carefully chosen words.
Here's Bush on Jan. 26: "As you know, the Iranians, for example, think they want to have a nuclear weapon. And we've convinced other nations to join us to send a clear message, through the United Nations, that that's unacceptable behavior."
On March 31: "Our position is that we would hope that nations would be very careful in dealing with Iran, particularly since Iran is trying to develop a nuclear weapon, and a major threat to world peace is if the Iranians had a nuclear weapon. . . .
"We respect the history of Iran, we respect the rich traditions of Iran. We, however, are deeply concerned about an Iranian government that is in violation of international accords in their attempt to develop a nuclear weapon."
Storm clouds are gathering.
Yesterday I wrote a piece noting how recent issues of the Marvel comic X-Force had crossed over with the world of Strikeforce Morituri, the eighties Marvel series by Peter B Gillis and Brent Anderson.
It was a clear intentional crossover. The world they visited had the same dimensional number as that of Strikeforce Morituri, as noted in the Official Marvel Handbook.
The concept of an alien invasion and people being given superpowers to fight back, that will kill them in a year was right there.
Even if the motto was a little different. But why not be more explicit? And why change the line?
In 2003, The Sci-Fi Channel announced they were to make a TV series out of the comic. Then in June Waterman Entertainment optioned the series for a movie, with the initial plan being to start production in December 2011.
At which point, Marvel Comics registered a number of trademarks for Strikeforce Morituri as well as for ‘We Who Are About To Die' Strikeforce Morituri. They started doing that in July 2011, a few days after the Waterman Entertainment announcement, and and have continued to apply for further trademark applications, the most recent at the end of last year for digital comics.
Then in January 2012, Marvel released Strikeforce: Morituri – We Who Are About To Die #1, reprinting issue 1 of Strikeforce: Morituri ahead of a new collection of the series, a rather unusual move. Almost if it were done purely for trademark reasons.
It looks like it was.
Connor Cochran chose to talk to Bleeding Cool. He told me (my bolding),
I represent Peter Gillis, Strikeforce's creator, on this matter. It is Peter's legal position that he never signed any contracts with Marvel for Strikeforce and therefore he and Marvel are equal co-owners of the property. (Marvel's co-ownership is because artist Brent Anderson and Peter were co-creators of the book, and Brent was under contract with Marvel at the time.) Peter has been trying to settle this issue with Marvel definitively going back at least as far as 2002, but no agreement has yet been reached. Hard to say when that may finally happen, but obviously we'll take whatever legal steps are necessary to protect Peter's share of rights in his creation. This recent copyright filing by Marvel is being looked at now by lawyers for Peter's side and will be addressed appropriately. In 2002, Marvel Comics and the Sci-Fi Channel announced a miniseries adaptation of STRIKEFORCE: MORITURI to be called A THOUSAND DAYS. When Peter Gillis heard about this, he sent Marvel a letter pointing out that he had never signed a contract on the book, so they did not own it and the Sci-Fi Channel deal could not go forward. Marvel responded with an extreme lowball rights offer and a letter saying that Peter ought to accept it, because if he didn't the project would never happen and he would see nothing at all from the property. Peter held steadfast to his position, at which point Marvel claimed that he HAD signed a contract with them. As “proof” they offered up one of the standard character rights assignments documents that Marvel used to make its freelancers sign back in the ‘80s whenever they wrote an issue of an established title like Spider-Man or THE AVENGERS. Peter had signed quite a few of these when he wrote books like CAPTAIN AMERICA and DOCTOR STRANGE. Now someone at Marvel took the signature page from one of those, attached it to a new blank contract, and penciled in “Strikeforce Morituri” where the name of the created villain or supporting character would normally have been typed. The result was pretty laughable (the typeface on the sig page didn't match that of the rest of the document, for example) and Peter once again insisted that he had never signed his rights away. Nothing much happened after that. Peter hired legal counsel, Marvel reiterated its claim of total ownership, and the Sci-Fi miniseries project was dropped. Prior to Marvel's acquisition by Disney, Peter brought me on to manage his business affairs. My legal research established that Peter and Marvel were in fact co-owners with equal rights to the property because of the Brent Anderson situation. I brought this to Marvel's attention and they repeated their claim of complete ownership. More recently, in 2011 Waterman Entertainment optioned STRIKEFORCE from Peter and announced plans to make a feature out of it. Waterman apparently felt that they could work out some kind of deal with Marvel to acknowledge the shared rights situation and then move forward. Nothing ever happened with that, however, and the option lapsed. It is worth noting that the timing of the STRIKEFORCE reprint makes it appear that it might have been a response to the Waterman effort. (Because of the co-ownership of the rights, Peter's position is that he is owed half the income from that reprint, another matter we'll have to get into.) Where things now stand is that we are preparing to reach out once more to Disney/Marvel to see if things can be settled peaceably, since that seems so obviously the better path. If our effort fails, we'll let the appropriate court decide the matter. This is all driven by Disney's ownership, the immense success of the films, and the possible problems with character ownership cause by years of sloppy recordkeeping, the bankruptcies, etc. They are moving to regularize and solidify their claims. We're doing the same. In the end I'm confident that Peter Gillis's co-ownership will be validated, one way or another
To the courtrooms men, for this is war!
We who are about to settle…

There may be one more episode left of Breaking Bad, but Anna Gunn appears to have already put Skyler White behind her.
Wearing a floor-length Romona Keveza gown, Gunn, 45, showed off a very different look when she took home the Emmy for best supporting actress on Sunday for her portrayal of a teacher-turned-meth-kingpin's wife on the AMC series.
“I was actually ill while I was filming the show and it affected my weight,” Gunn told PEOPLE at the Governors Ball after the awards ceremony. “They gave me cortisone and I puffed up and gained weight. Now I'm better, thank God.”
Though she declined to disclose further details as to what she suffered from, the now healthy actress added, “I'm doing fine, thankfully. I'm feeling really good.”
As for staying in shape, she credits her figure to her two daughters, who received a shout-out in her acceptance speech.
“I run around after two kids!” she said. “And I do Pilates.”
Halon was introduced in the 1960s as a form of gaseous fire suppression, and it also has a history of use as a refrigerant . In a halon system, pressurized tanks of the gas are connected to a series of pipes and nozzles. When a fire is detected, the gas is released. The halon gas interferes with the oxidation reaction between the fuel and the oxygen in the room which drives the fire, shutting the fire down. Other gaseous fire suppression systems work slightly differently, doing things like forcing the oxygen out of the room so that the fire cannot continue to be burned.
A halon system is a type of gaseous fire suppression system which operates with halon gas . In the 1980s, halon was recognized as an ozone -depleting compound, and production of additional halon was largely banned. Today, installation of new halon systems is only allowed when people can demonstrate that they absolutely must have a halon system. Older existing systems are perfectly legal, although many governments encourage people to consider decommissioning their halon systems and replacing them with a safer system, if possible.
Halon systems were designed to be used in settings in which fire suppression might be necessary, but people wanted to avoid damage to expensive electronics and components. Such systems were widely used in the military, especially on aircraft, and some nations continue to allow halon systems on military aircraft because the halon system is the most suitable fire suppression system for that application. Halon systems were also used in server rooms and other facilities which contain expensive or delicate materials.
The primary problem with halon is that it depletes ozone. Every time a halon system is activated, halon is released into the environment, where it works its way into the atmosphere. Halon is also not very healthy for people to be around. While it will not suffocate people like some gaseous fire suppression systems, it can cause health problems, especially if people are exposed to it for prolonged periods. This is why alarms sound when halon systems activate, to alert people to the fact that they need to leave the area to avoid health risks.
Companies which specialize in maintenance of halon systems are still in business in several regions. They can recharge systems after a gas discharge and perform other maintenance tasks to keep existing systems working smoothly. Many such companies can also decommission a halon system and install an acceptable alternative. Since fire suppression systems are always evolving, it's worth consulting a fire suppression specialist every few years to see if a halon system is still necessary.
Lawyers for Michael Stone, twice convicted of the hammer murders of Lin Russell and her daughter Megan, say they have obtained evidence of a prison confession from Levi Bellfield that he carried out the murder. Paul Bacon, solicitor for Mr Stone, told a press conference that Bellfield's alleged confession contains factors that are not in the public domain. "We have now received evidence of a full confession by Levi Bellfield," Mr Bacon said. "He has admitted the Russell murders." "In the confession, Bellfield describes how he came across Lin Russell and her two children, how he attacked them with a hammer and he explains his motivation for the killing. The confession is detailed and has a number of facts which are not in the public domain." The confession was made "not just once" to a fellow prisoner by Bellfield, the legal team claim and is "detailed and includes diagrams". It came about following a two-part BBC documentary aired in May which saw a panel of independent experts re-examine the evidence and suggest another suspect, the lawyers said.
The legal team have also discovered new forensic evidence backing their case, Mr Bacon said. After a review of the case papers, they have also found an independent witness "who saw Levi Bellfield close to the scene of the murders about the time they were committed." The legal team have now sent the new material to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC). The legal team are requesting that it is referred to the Court of Appeal quickly and that a new investigation is carried out by an independent police force from Kent Police who investigated the case previously. Mr Bacon added: "The Russell murders by Levi Bellfield fits perfectly with his modus operandi. He is a man known to attack and murder women, his weapon of choice is a hammer." Michael Stone is serving three life sentences for bludgeoning Lin Russell and her daughter Megan, six, to death in an attack near Chillenden in Kent in 1996 in which her other daughter, Josie, nine, suffered severe head injuries and the family's dog, Lucy, was killed. Mr Stone, who has fought a protracted legal battle to clear his name, was also convicted via prison confessional evidence. Damian Daley, who helped convict Stone, has since been jailed for murder. He said Stone confessed to the hammer murders through a heating pipe into the next cell at Canterbury Prison.

It is not the first time Stone's legal representatives have pointed the finger at Bellfield - in 2011, his solicitor, Paul Bacon, claimed Milly's killer was a better match for the e-fit of the suspect issued during the police manhunt. Mr Stone's sister Barbara, who attended the press conference, said that she and her brother "hopeful". "It is the biggest hope that my brother's had for a long time," Ms Stone said. "He has been in prison for 20 years and that's 20 years too long for someone who hasn't committed a crime." Stone was told in 2006 that he must spend a minimum of 25 years behind bars over the attack on Dr Russell, 45, and her daughters as they walked home from a swimming gala along a country lane in July 1996. Josie survived her injuries and went on to carve out a new life as an artist, growing up with her father, Dr Shaun Russell, in Wales.

Bellfield, who now calls himself Yusuf Rahim, is serving a whole-life tariff after being found guilty of abducting and killing Milly Dowler following a trial at the Old Bailey. He was jailed in 2011. The 13-year-old was snatched from the street while on her way home from school in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002. Josie Russell and the family of Milly Dowler have been informed about the new accusations, Mr Stone's barrister Michael McDonald said. He was already in jail for the murders of Amelie Delagrange and Marsha McDonnell, and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, when he went on trial accused of killing Milly. In 2008 he had been given a whole-life term for murdering Ms McDonnell, 19, in 2003, and murdering Ms Delagrange, 22, and attempting to murder Ms Sheedy, 18, in 2004.

We hammered out the beats of the movie and took it to the heads of our company, producers Penney Finkelman Cox and Sandra Rabins. Penney and Sandy are veteran producers, very hip and in tune with what studio buyers are looking for. And so their initial reaction to the pitch was more or less what we found to be the standard reaction: They liked it… but they didn't know quite what to make of it. It was the same thing we heard at every studio we pitched it to: "What's the tone of the film? How do we market it? Is it a horror movie? Is it comedy-horror? Is it an action flick with horror elements? We like it… we just don't get it." It sounds funny now, 10 years later, where just about everybody on Earth has seen or heard of the movie. There are snakes. On a plane. That's the movie. What's not to get?
GIAMMARCO: “National Public Relations Advisors was a proprietary front company for the O.S.S. [the Office of Strategic Services, the early-40s forebear to the Central Intelligence Agency]. It was similar to the Robert Mullen public-relations company in Washington, from which intelligence operatives have been given cover I.D. and credentials, both domestically and abroad, for assignments. This document suggests that Harry's intelligence activities were still in full swing.”
V-E Day had already been celebrated a month earlier, but Saltzman's overseas travels continue. An associate named Roy M. Cohen (no, not Roy Cohn of McCarthyite fame) is asking to have his and Saltzman's visas expedited so that they can travel to France to help “hasten the resumption of normal trade relations between France and the United States.”
GIAMMARCO: “The psy-ops program under C. D. Jackson in North Africa was now being fully expanded across Europe. Harry would become a key component, and it was around this point that he might have first crossed paths with Ian Fleming, who was serving in British naval intelligence. During the war, British intelligence secretly held whole floors of offices at a number of hotels, including the Dorchester and the Landmark. An enlisted man of limited salary could hardly afford to be living in a five-star hotel. But intelligence officers and assets could come and go within these hotels without suspicion.”
GIAMMARCO: “The key line is that Harry is working for C. D. Jackson in the ‘North African theater of war.' C. D. Jackson was a notorious propagandist who controlled psychological operations in the North African operation for O.W.I., known as P.W.B., or Psychological Warfare Branch. The P.W.B. produced everything from fake radio broadcasts, books, newspapers (real and fraudulent), documents, and films to fake events staged for newsreels, for which Harry's film talents would have been fully utilized.”
GIAMMARCO: “False birthplaces are standard procedure in intelligence filing systems. The misleading files help protect against any moles within an intelligence agency who may access the dossiers of agents stationed behind enemy lines. The ‘real' files are often kept compartmented within special operating sections, with access restricted to only a very select few.”
The Canadian-born Saltzman, having already served his native land as a member of the Royal Canadian Air Force, becomes a U.S. citizen in 1939. His oath form curiously mis-identifies his place of birth as “St. Johns, N.B.,” meaning the city of Saint John in New Brunswick; Saltzman was in fact born in Sherbrooke, Quebec. David Giammarco suspects that U.S. intelligence agents were already preparing him at this time for work in the field.
The title sequence to every James Bond movie from Dr. No to Live and Let Die begins with the credit “Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli present.” Over time, Broccoli, who died in 1996 and was known as Cubby, has come to be the more famous Bond producer. But it was Saltzman who, in 1961, originally secured the Bond-movie option from 007's creator, the novelist Ian Fleming.
The Canadian-born Saltzman was a curious choice for Fleming to do a deal with—a respected but (prior to Bond) small-time producer best known for low-budget, black-and-white film adaptations of the John Osborne plays Look Back in Anger and The Entertainer. Why, you might wonder, would Fleming have entrusted his life's work to this guy rather than, say, some deep-pocketed Technicolor specialist? A few years ago, two of Saltzman's children, Hilary and Steven, gained startling insight into the Saltzman-Fleming relationship when Hilary inadvertently stumbled upon her father's wartime files, as kept by the U.S. State Department.
Some background: In 2003, Hilary Saltzman was relocating from Los Angeles to Quebec and needed to get her Canadian-citizenship papers in order. In so doing, she hit a snag: the Canadian government required documentation on how and when her father, who died in 1994, had become a U.S. citizen. As I report in my article in the October issue of V.F., “The Birth of Bond,” Hilary's seemingly benign request to pull her father's citizenship documents set off alarms at the State Department. The reason? Harry Saltzman, shortly after taking the Oath of Allegiance in 1939, became a high-ranking U.S. intelligence officer, his wartime activities classified. Even when Hilary finally managed to procure the papers she needed—after a protracted bureaucratic process that entailed getting a sign-off from the department's then top man, Colin Powell—the documents she received remained heavily redacted. “One has to deduce,” says Steven Saltzman, “given the fact that the Secretary of State had to authorize the release of what were 60-year-old records, that Harry's role, even today, is sensitive.”
For Hilary, the experience of reading all these cables and letters, many of them written by Robert E. Sherwood, the overseas director of the Office of War Information during World War II, cleared up a lot of things about her mysterious, circumspect dad that hadn't previously made sense. “Finally, I understood what my father had done in the war. Finally, I understood his fascination with the spy genre of films,” she says. Ian Fleming had himself been an intelligence officer on the British side, and, says Hilary, “I really strongly believe that he and my father shared some similar experiences. Even though they couldn't publicize it, I really think Ian felt that this series was safe in my father's hands.”
In my article, I say it's “possible, even probable,” that Saltzman and Fleming, for all their common wartime experience, didn't actually meet until 1961. However, David Giammarco, a Bond expert and the author of the 2002 book For Your Eyes Only: Behind the Scenes of the James Bond Films, believes that it's likely that Saltzman and Fleming crossed paths during World War II. While researching his book, Giammarco spoke to retired intelligence officers from both the U.S. and Britain, some of whom, he says, “seemed to feel that Ian and Harry had a prior relationship” well before 1961—though there is no smoking-gun document or photograph that puts the two men together in the same place during the war.
Wherever the truth lies, the documents released to Hilary Saltzman, not to mention the degree to which their contents remain heavily redacted, illustrate, in Giammarco's words, “the high level of espionage work that Harry carried out.”
This slide show, exclusive to V.F., shows some of the un-redacted Harry Saltzman documents from Hilary's collection, along with commentary from Giammarco.

If you're a big corporate sponsor, like, say, American Express, and you're seeking a director to oversee Thursday night's Web broadcast of a performance by Arcade Fire at Madison Square Garden (which will be streamed live on YouTube), you could presumably have your choice of talent, from up-and-coming music-video auteurs to established Hollywood hotshots.
So why turn to Terry Gilliam, the highly unpredictable Monty Python alum whose feature films include “Brazil” and “The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus,” and who dislikes indie rock almost as much as he despises the Internet? Even Mr. Gilliam himself wasn't sure, though he says he's a huge Arcade Fire fan.
ArtsBeat spoke recently with Mr. Gilliam — apparently not too long after he'd been roused from bed — about this unusual project that we all hope turns out better for him than “The Man Who Killed Don Quixote.” These are excerpts from that conversation.
Q.
How are you?
A.
I'm just awake, barely awake. As long as you keep talking, I'll keep my eyes open.
Q.
I hope this doesn't affect your process Thursday night, when you're frantically choosing from among all your camera options.
A.
Maybe I'll just be sleeping. I want the entire community of the people watching it making the choices. Can we do that? Can they be tweeting in what cameras they'd like to be watching? Then we could have some sort of machinery that collates all the votes, and it could work by that. The Web is about community, not about hierarchy and fascistic directors and things like that. I'm just a beginner in this world. I'm a complete novice. I hate the Web, to be honest about it.
Q.
So how did this all come about, then?
A.
You mean [laughs] how the finger of God pointed down at me and said, ‘You are the chosen one'? ‘Help these young people out, save their careers,' that sort of thing? Well, it was as long ago as two weeks ago when my agent was approached, saying they were doing a show at Madison Square Garden. They wondered if I could get involved with no time at all, which means there's very little I can do. It's all their work — I'm just trying to make sure that it gets somehow seen on the Web accurately. I'm not a director — let's put it that way — in this instance. I'm just a follower. [Laughs.]
Q.
Are you a big indie-rock guy?
A.
No! I mean, most of it's [bad]. I just happen to like Arcade Fire. The world of indie is such a funny thing now. I think everybody's in it. Otherwise you're just the dependent rock world. I think half the indie bands are owned by some big company. So it's a complete lie. I don't know why Canada produces some rather interesting work. Arcade Fire, Sunset Rubdown, Wolf Parade — these are my favorites.
Q.
See, you do know your indie rock.
A.
Just a very limited group … up there, singing to the northern boundaries of America.
Q.
In your filmmaking career, have you ever directed a music video or a concert film before?
A.
No, that's what's interesting about this, I've always avoided it. My good friends, people like George Harrison and Sting, I said no to. I was trying to concentrate on my film work. Now I guess it's old-dogs-learning-new-tricks time in my life.
Q.
So what was different about Arcade Fire?
A.
I saw them about three years ago in London at Brixton Academy, and that was before they had as much of a show as they have together now. Then I came to Montreal some days ago and was at a show there, where they were playing at a festival. They had four of the world's biggest trucks there, for all the gear they carry around. I said: “Whoa. An upcoming indie-rock band is not what I used to think an indie-rock band was.” [Laughs.]
Q.
What about the Montreal show stood out for you?
A.
When a new song was played up in Montreal, you could see the audience was very quiet. From the band's point of view, it must have felt like, Ooh — they don't like it. But in fact, they were just listening very respectfully, trying to take in this material. I've always reacted to their music because it really feels like these are personal stories being told. Each of us comes away with our own interpretation. It's a poetry that doesn't provide the answers but it certainly opens up possibilities in the way you perceive things.
Q.
How do you film something like this, that's so elaborate, and has all these potential interpretations?
A.
These shows, there's a machine, in a sense, that runs them. I've never done multicamera work, so I'm just advising people: Look at the video work they've got up on the screen; it's raw and it's overexposed, and almost the antithesis of what I do when I make a film. So let's use that, and basically throw away the slick stuff that's normally done at, say, a Britney Spears concert. Let's just be true to what the band wants to do.
Q.
So what kind of equipment will you have at your disposal for the Web broadcast?
A.
I don't know. Just the same old. Some people and some cameras. [laughs] There's nothing magical about any of this stuff. There's some very professional people who'll be doing what they do well, and I'll probably try to stay out of everybody's way. And if it's good, I'll take credit for everything, and if it's bad, nothing to do with me.
Q.
Did you watch any of the classic concert films in preparation for this?
A.
Nope. [Laughs hysterically.] It's an absolute disgrace. I'm just a hanger-on. I'm a secret groupie. This is the only way I could get close to a band I admire. I'm really just a hanger-on, is what I am. I'm sucking up knowledge for who knows what we do in the future. I'm getting old. I've got to create a new career. It's just nice being with a young band who are — “pure” is a reasonable word to use, because there's a real integrity about them.
Q.
So what will your agenda be like on the day of?
A.
I'm going to go over there around 3 o'clock and say hi, and talk, hang out. There's a documentary crew of sorts, following me around, meeting them and all, which they might use that stuff as an opening before the show. The idea was somehow to show me blending, meeting, conspiring, bumping into a young band, to see what happens. It's wonderful. I'm just behaving completely irresponsibly.
Q.
After everything you've been through, you're still O.K. being in front of the camera?
A.
You've seen “Lost in La Mancha,” I hope. If there's going to be a documentary crew following me around, I never censor anything — that's the whole point of it, it seems to me. I've never understood why people allow themselves to be documented and then censor all the interesting bits. I saw a couple feet of what they shot and I looked like an absolute fool. [Laughs.]
Q.
And you're all right with that?
A.
I'll have to sort that out when I get back to London and learn to walk properly. I've got a lot of work to do, to lower the self-contempt level. It's kind of shocking to see how I've aged. That's just vanity and ego speaking.
Q.
Have you decided what you'll do next, when you've finished this assignment? Or do you want to see where the inspiration takes you?
A.
I've got lots of things in there, and all of them are just all possibilities. I've always made the mistake of talking about my possibilities as reality, and invariably I'm wrong. So I don't talk about it anymore. I'm getting better at keeping my mouth shut, because I've made a fool of myself too many times in the past.
Court to look at mutual fund fees
"It's very significant because mutual funds are now the investment vehicle of choice for most American investors. They're the vehicle for planning for our retirements," said James Cox, a Duke University law professor.
Fees have become a highly charged subject in recent years as Americans have come to rely on 401(k) plans to finance retirement, and they've taken on greater relevance as the stock market has tumbled during the financial crisis.
At issue is the legal standard that small investors must meet to bring lawsuits against fund companies. The court will consider whether a ruling last year sets too high a bar for investors to challenge the annual levies.
The court agreed to hear a case in which individual investors have accused their fund company of charging excessive fees.
On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court said it would take on the contentious issue.
NEW YORK — Critics have long complained that mutual fund fees are too high, wrongfully enriching Wall Street at the expense of ordinary Americans.
Critics say the fund industry reaps big profits by not passing along economies of scale achieved through decades of growth.
As proof, the critics say, investment firms charge much higher fees to individual mutual fund investors than to pension funds and other institutional investors for essentially the same services.
The court decided to review a case in which three investors sued Harris Associates, which manages the Oakmark funds.
The investors alleged that Oakmark's average fees as a percentage of assets rose from 1993 to 2003 even though the company's assets under management jumped 40-fold to more than $11.7 billion.
Critics say that -- unlike industries such as manufacturing, which must hire workers and buy extra raw materials to service new customers -- mutual fund companies incur few additional costs when adding investors.
Thus, the levies charged to newcomers "represent almost pure profit" to fund managers, the investors said in their suit.
"We think the issue is important to a broad group of investors and we're gratified the court has taken the case," said David C. Frederick, the suing investors' attorney.
Average fund fees have declined slowly over the last decade, to 1.24% of assets last year from 1.34% in 1998, according to Morningstar Inc.
An Oakmark spokesman did not return a phone call seeking comment.
"This is an important case for the mutual fund industry and fund boards," said Rachel McTague, a spokeswoman for the Investment Company Institute, the fund industry's main trade group. "We will certainly continue to follow it closely."
The case the high court agreed to hear is an appeal of a ruling last year that made it more difficult for individual investors to challenge fund fees.
Until that ruling, courts relied on a 1982 legal standard known as Gartenberg, which itself sets high hurdles for plaintiffs to prevail in fee-related cases.
Last year's ruling laid down even tougher standards, which some experts said would make it virtually impossible for investors to bring fee cases.
The 21-year-old Russian prospect Nikolay Goldobin is vying for a spot on the Vancouver Canucks and might even have the potential to show signs of former top-liner and compatriot Alex Mogilny.
Give him time, said Dave Babych.
“When he has it in front of the net or in another scoring position, he knows what to do with it,” said the retired Canucks defenceman, noting the style breaks down simply: If you get open, the centreman will feed you the puck. “He reminds me of Mogilny.”

“He seems like one of those opportunists who wait for that. Coaches aren't maybe that patient with guys who have that type of talent,” Babych told SN 650 today.
After talking with player agent Igor Larionov, who represents Goldobin, Babych said the young skater has a lot more to show. “If Igor endorses him, and I think the world of Igor … I would listen.”
Not that Babych sees this happening any time soon, but if Goldobin was to play an entire season alongside the Sedins, “I bet he puts up a 40 spot.”
Defiance of Prohibition Comes to a Head in New Hampshire Trial
On March 26 in Keene, NH, when prominent marijuana legalization advocate Rich Paul goes on trial, we will be seeing a new willingness to stand up to the bigots who run the machinery of Prohibition. Like Martin Luther King before him, Mr. Paul will not plea bargain; thereby refusing to concede he is doing anything wrong, and at the same time demonstrating he will not crumble under the threat of jail.
The civilly disobedient boys and girls of Keene have been remarkably defiant in their effort to live as if they were free, regardless of the consequences. Of course the government hates defiance, and loves to dish out consequences. When it comes to the Drug War, New Hampshire is surprisingly primitive and harsh. However, in one area of human rights, NH is light years ahead of other states, in that it allows jury nullification to be argued during trials.
The trial is at Cheshire Superior Court, 12 Court St. Currently, pre-trial motions are scheduled for Tuesday March 26, at 10 AM, with jury selection over the following week or two.
Article continues after ad Advertisement
This trial seems destined to be a media circus, and a watershed event in the struggle against the Drug War.
For those with Facebook, an event page is here with up to date info on any changes. There is also a donation page here.
Defenders of Mr. Paul are urging all legalization supporters to make an effort to attend the trial, or the picket line outside the courthouse. They point out that the bravest among us in the fight for a better world, need to know they have our backing in the personal struggle they wage on our behalf.

Mike Nudelman/Business Insider Real men eat meat.
At least that's the stereotype that has been passed down since our days as hunter-gatherers — when men (the hunters) would go off to kill wild animals, while women (the gatherers) would hang around collecting fruits, nuts, and berries.
"Meat seems associated with strength and power, two features generally attributed to males," write the authors of a 2012 study published in the Journal of Consumer Research that examined why male consumers avoid vegetarian options.
In another study, published in the journal Psychology of Men and Masculinity, researchers linked eating meat with "manhood, power, and virility" and found that men were more likely than women to "endorse pro-meat attitudes" and believed it was "human destiny to eat meat."
But times are changing.
A growing number of male business executives and political leaders, including former President Bill Clinton and Newark Mayor Cory Booker, are breaking gender expectations and embracing the vegetarian or vegan lifestyle.
It's a trend — first pinpointed in a 2010 Businessweek article titled "The Rise of the Power Vegans" — that parallels mounting public awareness about the damaging effects of meat consumption on health and the environment. For some, the welfare of factory-farmed animals is also a concern. Conversely, "chick foods" like kale and soy products are growing in popularity.
In the United States, vegetarians are still rare: Only 5% of American adults say they are vegetarian, according to a 2012 Gallup study, and just 2% of people consider themselves vegan — people who don't eat any ingredients that come from an animal, including eggs, milk, and honey.
While the percentage of vegetarians has remained the same over the last decade, this pattern may slowly change as tofu and salads became more fashionable among America's male movers and shakers.
A freight train derailed Friday afternoon near Elk Grove in Sacramento County, sending 22 train cars into the Cosumnes River near Highway 99, according to the Cosumnes Fire Department. The Union Pacific train was headed from Tracy to Roseville when it derailed about 12:45 p.m. near Dillard Road. Three people were on board the train, but no one was injured. “Absolutely apologize for the disruption; but again, thankfully there were no injuries, no hazardous material involved and so, we'll get this cleaned up as quick as possible,” the Union Pacific Railroad spokesman Justin Jacobs said. The train was carrying food products. A hazmat crew was originally called to the scene as a precaution, but that crew had left. Near the train derailment is a levee break, but it is unclear if that caused the derailment. The cause of the derailment is under investigation. Union Pacific has been doing inspections in this area because of the recent inclement weather. "They inspect the rail to ensure that everything is as it's supposed to be. Safe for the trains to travel down." Jacobs said. "What happened in this incident will come out in the investigation." The investigation has been halted for the night because of rising water and a lack of sunlight. Cleanup and repairs will resume in the morning. Union Pacific said 20-30 trains use this line per day, including Amtrak. Trains will be rerouted until the lines are reopened. Stay with KCRA for updates.

TEHRAN, Iran — Thanks to Iran, Egypt is free.
That's the claim that both the Iranian leadership and the opposition are making today, the 32nd anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenie have said that the protest movement that brought about the downfall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak — who ruled Egypt, often violently, for more than three decades — reflected the same spirit that first sparked the Iranian revolution in 1979.
“The echoes of the Islamic Revolution are being heard,” Khamenie said. “It is an earthquake and defeat for the U.S. policy. After years of struggle, the Iranian people see their voice is being heard loudly in other places in the Islamic world."
Meanwhile, Iran's opposition movement connected the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt to its own attempts to rise up against the regime of Ahmadinejad in 2009, when tens of thousands took to the streets to demand fresh elections.
“Undoubtedly, the starting point of what we are witnessing in the streets of Tunis, Sanaa, Cairo, Alexandria and Suez should be seen in the (Iranian) protests,” said Mir Hossein Mousavi, the defeated presidential candidate and leader of the opposition.
The post-election protests in 2009 were crushed by a violent crackdown by Iran's security forces, which arrested many of the opposition leaders.
On Friday, Egyptian flags were placed beside Iranian ones throughout Tehran's Azadi Square, where Ahmadinejad gave his usual speech to mark the occasion, and were at various points hoisted in the air by zealous schoolchildren, who seemed to make up a bulk of the crowd.
Unlike his political rivals, Ahmadinejad did not go as far as to take credit for the mass protests in Egypt, but he did spend a good deal of time professing his support for those seeking to topple the Mubarak regime, advising them, “It's your right to be free. It's your right to exercise your will and sovereignty ... and choose the type of government and the rulers.”
Ahmadinejad also used the opportunity to question America's military presence in the Middle East.
“The bases of bullying powers around the world will be eradicated, and occupations around the world and the region will soon come to an end," he said.
In his 57-minute speech, Ahmadinejad also hailed Iran's advances in science and technology, promising, among other things, that Iran would send a live animal into space within a year, and Iranian astronauts into orbit within 10 years.
He reiterated the success of his administration's subsidy plan, unveiled in December, which seeks to rid Iran of its bloated subsidy system that has cost the Iranian economy tens of billions of dollars per year since the early 1980s.
Despite Ahmadinejad's predictably fiery words, the atmosphere of today's event was far different than last year's, when a massive security presence on the streets of Tehran all but ensured that opposition forces could not co-opt the day as they had with previous holidays on the Iranian calendar.
Regime sympathizers had also been bused in from outside of Tehran, creating an impressive display of support for the state — a move an Egyptian might have expected from their former president.
Absent from Friday's celebration were all diplomats of the European Union posted in Iran, who boycotted the proceedings to protest the execution of Dutch national Zahra Bahrami, an Iranian-born woman who was arrested during protests last year and later sentenced, dubiously, to death for possession of cocaine.
Also not in attendance were the leaders of Iran's opposition movement, most notably Mehdi Karroubi, who is reportedly under house arrest until after Feb. 14, the date for which he and Mir Hossein Mousavi had requested a permit for a march “to declare solidarity” with popular movements in the region.
Although the request was unsurprisingly denied, some believe the Iranian opposition might still try to seize the date as an opportunity to renew their protest movement, which has been publicly dormant, in part due to a crackdown by Iran's security forces, for more than a year.
The Phillies have reached agreement with Cuban pitcher Miguel Alfredo Gonzalez on a six-year deal, $48MM deal, Jeff Passan of Yahoo! Sports reports. With bonuses, Gonzalez's contract could be worth as much as $59MM. MLB.com's Jesse Sanchez reported that Gonzalez's contract includes a vesting option for 2019, and Passan noted that the vesting option is worth $11MM.
Passan notes that, with the option, Gonzalez's deal would be bigger than the $56MM the Rangers gave Yu Darvish, and the guaranteed portion is already much more than the $42MM Yasiel Puig received from the Dodgers. The Red Sox were the other main contender for Gonzalez, who is represented by Jaime Torres.
Yesterday, it looked likely that Gonzalez would be making a decision soon, so the timing of the signing wasn't a surprise. Gonzalez fled Cuba this year, first to El Salvador and then to Mexico. Since he is over 23 and has played more than three seasons in a Cuban professional league, he is not subject to the international bonus pool system that limits bonuses that can be given to Dominican and Venezuelan players.
Gonzalez throws a mid-90s fastball, along with a curveball, splitter and changeup. In a scouting report for Baseball America, Ben Badler notes that Gonzalez's curveball is his weakest pitch and that his splitter and changeup are just "a tick above average." Scouts who like Gonzalez rate him as about a No. 3 starter in the big leagues, Badler says, while others think he might be a back-of-the-rotation starter or low-leverage reliever.
Badler says, however, that scouts mostly agree Gonzalez is a Major League talent. The 26-year-old is also fairly widely perceived as being big-league ready, or close to it, despite having not pitched much in the past two years after being suspended from the Cuban national team for trying to defect. Passan also notes that one factor in the Phillies' decision to sign Gonzalez is that they will soon be negotiating a new TV deal — they're getting a big-league pitcher, and they'll have plenty of money with which to pay him.
Beyond that, it isn't yet absolutely clear how Gonzalez fits into the Phillies' long-term plans, although, as Ken Rosenthal of FOX Sports writes, the Phillies' additional starting pitching depth might allow them to deal another starter, possibly Cliff Lee.
Islamic militants took to other sites to spread sick posters in celebration
Twitter reacted rapidly to remove posts by Islamic militants glorifying the terrorist truck attack in Nice, after previously facing criticism for its handling of extremist propaganda.
In a rare round of praise for the company watchdog groups said it acted swiftly to delete Tweets praising the massacre within minutes.
Instead pro-attack supporters were forced to flood other sites such as secure messaging app Telegram to post sickening posters revelling in the deaths.
Violence in recent months has posed challenges to social media groups, yet Twitter 'moved with swiftness we have not seen before to erase pro-attack tweets within minutes,' according to a statement by Counter Extremism Project.
In a rare round of praise for Twitter watchdog groups said it acted swiftly to delete Tweets praising the Nice truck massacre within minutes
ISIS killer Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel drove a truck through crowds of people watching fireworks on France's Bastille Day, leaving 84 dead.
The watchdog organisation stated over 50 Twitter accounts used the hashtag Nice in Arabic to praise the attack on the Promenade des Anglais in the port city.
Yet although 'it was the first time Twitter has reacted so efficiently,' said the counter-extremism group, in other online locations such as Telegram ISIS celebrated the carnage.
Fanatics uploaded sick posters to glorify the bloodbath. One showed the Eiffel Tower in flames and a knife-wielding jihadi alongside a message in Arabic.
Another stated the terrorists were heading to Berlin next, and one poster read 'Orlando was just the beginning', referring to the gunman who massacred 49 people in a Florida nightclub last month.
On Twitter many accounts appeared almost immediately after events in Nice , in a pattern similar to what was seen during the Paris and Brussels attacks.
Fanatics took to other sites to upload sick posters to glorify the bloodbath. One showed the Eiffel Tower in flames and a knife-wielding jihadi alongside a message in Arabic
Through unofficial channels ISIS supporters posted disgusting images revelling in deaths from the attack
Sick: One of the pro-attack images superimposed the head of French president François Hollande onto a man being grabbed by the throat by apparent ISIS fighters
Islamic state militants were not deterred from celebrating the attacks on the site, and made attempts to update their tactics.
During the massacre, pro-attack supporters were advised by the group to use the same hashtags used to sympathise with the victims, such as #PrayForNice, #NiceAttack and #Nice, so their tweets gained a wider audience.
But the company took robust action to respond with unusual alacrity, according to Rabbi Abraham Cooper, head of the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Digital Terrorism and Hate project, reports the Independent.
In a statement Twitter did not disclose information about the accounts it suspended, but said it bans terrorism on the website.
Facebook has also increased efforts to remove content that violates its terms of service, but also strives to be open to users trying to post important information.
The unfolding military coup in Turkey was at its early stages marked by social media restrictions, but the crackdown has now begun to ease.
One poster read 'Orlando was just the beginning', referring to the gunman who massacred 49 people in a Florida nightclub last month
In further pro-attack posters terrorists supporters claimed that they are heading to Berlin next
Many citizens were able to record live-stream videos of their situations and post tweets.
Both organisations played a significant role during the Arab Spring, where the capability to share uncensored and accurate information contributed to the overthrow of powerful dictatorships.
Facebook and Twitter continue to face the challenge of distinguishing between graphic images posted to glorify attacks, and those shared to document the events.
Facebook's 'community standards' explicitly ban 'terrorism' and related content promoting violence.
Pro-attack supporters used hashtags sympathising with victims such as #PrayForNice to gain wider audience
But Twitter reacted 'efficiently' to remove pro-attack posts according to Counter Extremism Project
But its graphic image policy is more nuanced and relies on users to report objectionable material to a team of human editors.
In a blog post last week about updated guidelines the company said: 'One of the most sensitive situations involves people sharing violent or graphic images of events taking place in the real world.
'In those situations, context and degree are everything. For instance, if a person witnessed a shooting, and used Facebook Live to raise awareness or find the shooter, we would allow it.
'However, if someone shared the same video to mock the victim or celebrate the shooting, we would remove the video.'

SEGA has announced Alien: Isolation's Survivor Mode will receive six months of DLC support.
Described by the game's Creative Lead Al Hope as "the game in its purest form", Survivor Mode pits player not only against the alien but the clock, too. You can find out more about the origin of the mode and what it involves in the video below:
Exit Theatre Mode
When Alien: Isolation is released next month will come with one playable map (Basement), but from October 28th the first of five expansion packs will roll out for purchase. The first drop will contain three additional maps, each with specific objects and challenges, a new playable character and will vary the enemy types (on top of the alien itself, of course). In the coming months, four more expansions will be released, each containing a new character, new maps, and a variety of challenges.
Players will be able to pick up an Alien: Isolation Season Pass, which will grant access to all five Survivor Mode expansions and offer a 25% discount. And SEGA has said all of this DLC will be released by March 2015.

Daniel is IGN's Games Editor over in London. He sometimes writes about movies, too. You can be part of the world's most embarrassing cult by following him on IGN and Twitter.
Following the scanned images that debuted yesterday, Empire has debuted high-quality versions of the X-Men: Apocalypse concept art which you can check out in the gallery below. In addition, they spoke with director Bryan Singer, who talked about the size of the upcoming sequel.
“It's a big monster of a movie,” ?he tells the outlet. “The stakes are so high and global and the villain ?is so mythic. It's definitely an X-Men movie, but it really feels different.”
Singer also spoke about the inclusion of the “young X-Men” that will appear in the film such as Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Storm, saying:
“They're as much a part ?of the movie as our main cast. Scott is not yet the squeaky-clean leader. Storm is ?a troubled character who is going down the wrong path in life. And Jean is complex, interesting and not fully mature. It's fun to see someone struggling with their powers when you know one day they'll become the most powerful person in the world.”
James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, and Nicholas Hoult will lead the cast of X-Men: Apocalypse, which will also see the return of Rose Byrne as Moira MacTaggert, Evan Peters as Quicksilver, Lucas Till as Havok and newcomers Alexandra Shipp as Storm, Sophie Turner Jean Grey, Ben Hardy as Angel, Tye Sheridan as Cyclops and Olivia Munn as Psylocke. Oscar Isaac is also starring as the film's title antagonist with Simon Kinberg scripting from a treatment by Mike Dougherty, Dan Harris and Kinberg.
Said to be the conclusion of a trilogy started with X-Men: First Class and continued with X-Men: Days of Future Past, the Bryan Singer directed X-Men: Apocalypse is set for release on May 27, 2016.

Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon has revealed the first game was very nearly a licensed Jean-Claude Van Damme title, with the Muscles from Brussels' likeness used in initial demos.
Speaking to Gamespot, Boon explained Van Damme sadly wasn't game for the team to let his likeness be used in the long-term, but that's certainly what they were aiming for in the early days.
"The first day was us mocking up a bit of a demo using Jean-Claude Van Damme images from Bloodsport," Boon said. "We hadn't had anybody come into the studio to record, so we were trying to convince Van Damme to let us do a licensed Van Damme game.
"We went into the movie and found an image of him getting into a stance and stripped out the background and put it into the game and mocked things up. We were kind of getting used to the new digitized technology, too, so that's what I remember, trying to setup a demo to try to convince Jean Claude Van Damme to let us do a game based on him."
Boon also reflected upon society's increased tolerance for violence in games, but made it clear there is definitely a line he and the team are never going to cross.
"Every game, we have these brainstorming meetings, and...somebody will suggest something and it's more of a gut feeling that, you know, that's a little too far," he said. "I think every single game, [there are] those discussions where, you know, everyone's trying to push the envelope, but there's always a line that you never want to cross."
Earlier today Boon revealed Tremor was brought back due to fan demand, with anyone wanting to play as him needing to pick him up via the game's Kombat Pack.

I took the next step this past Saturday in becoming a volunteer at the Albuquerque Aquarium (see previous post My First Day as a Public Aquarium Volunteer). It was Earth day so the aquarium was packed full of people. The staff and volunteers were running in all directions getting their displays ready for all the visitors. For earth day, the aquarium setup stations around the aquarium with volunteers manning each station. Each station contained information about conservation and the theme for the event was “Our Actions Matter”. I was assigned to work in the Shark and Ray Encounter for my first volunteer training shift where I shadowed two other experienced volunteers. They did a great job of showing me the ropes.
Touchpool Rules
We told all of the guests that came to the touchpool exhibit that they could only use two fingers to contact the animals. This helps decrease any stress to the animals because it keeps little fingers from trying to grab or poke at them. 325 guests came through the exhibit that day and all of them respected the rules. Here's a picture of the sign that is posted around the exhibit:
The Sharks
There are two sharks that are kept in the Share and Ray Encounter exhibit—The brown banded bamboo shark and white spotted bamboo shark. The sharks spent most of the time in the back of the tank and out of reach except for one brown banded bamboo shark. He swam right to the side when the guests arrived and seemed to enjoy the free back scratch.
In the past, the exhibit also displayed shark eggs—also known as mermaid purses. The program was a little too successful though and the aquarium ended up with more sharks than they needed so they suspended raising baby sharks for now. The experienced volunteer that I was shadowing had a picture of one of the baby sharks from the past exhibit that was still inside of its egg. The aquarists had clipped over the outer layer of the egg casing so you could see the shark inside. Here's the photo she sent me:
The Stingrays
There are also two species of stingray in the exhibit—The Southern Stingray and much smaller Atlantic Stingray (shown in the picture above). The Southern Stingrays loved the attention of the visitors. One in particular would slide up the walls of the tank near visitors and splash to get their attention practically begging for a free back rub. That stingray did this over and over again the entire time the exhibit was open.
Educational Tools
I was given two educational props to use to help teach the visitors about the animals. One was the clipped stingers from the stringrays in a small box and the other was a preserved shark fin.
Some of the younger guests that visited the exhibit were too shy or to small to reach the animals so they could touch the shark fin instead to see what they felt like. My co-volunteer also had stingray teeth to show people how sting rays eat. I regret that I don't have a good picture of these props, but you'll just have to come to the aquarium to see them. Here's a photo of me with my props:
Frequently asked questions
Guests asked many questions while I was there and I did my best to answer. Some of these answers we gave were simplified for the younger guests.
Will the shark bite me?
The sharks are only bite things that they think are food and want to eat. Humans are not on their menu and they won't bite you.
What about sharks attacking people in the wild?
Those shark attacks are a case of mistaken identity. People are clumsy swimmers compared to most sea creatures so the shark confuses all that splashing around with an injured animal such as a sea lion or seal. The shark attacks only happen when the sharks mistake humans for their regular food.
Will the Stringray sting me?
The stingrays in the aquarium all have their stingers trimmed off. The stinger is like a finger-nail in that it constantly grows back and it doesn't hurt the animals at all to trim them off.
Are the stingrays venomous?
Stringrays are venomous, but since all of the stingrays in the touchpool have their stingers clipped off they are completely harmless.
Will the stingray bite me?
The stingray's mouth is located underneath their body towards the middle. It would be difficult to even get your hands near the stingrays mouth in the exhibit and the stingrays are not interested in eating people so they will not bite you.
Isn't this the fish that killed Steve Irwin?
Yes, Steve Irwin was killed by a stingray but it was a different type than the kind found in the touchpool. Steve Irwin was killed by a bull stingray because he accidentally startled the ray. Stingrays are generally docile creatures and only attack when provoked or startled.
I'm still learning and I'm sure my answers will evolve as I learn more about the animals in the exhibit. I'm scheduled for another shift in the Shark and Ray Encounter in a week and I'm looking forward to it.
'It looked like a snake!' Chinese man finds 19-inch long EARTHWORM in his backyard (and now plans to raise it himself)
An earthworm measuring half a metre in length has stunned neighbours after being found in the gutter outside a house.
Li Zhiwei, a worker from the Forestry Bureau of Binchuan County, was putting some dates out to dry in his backyard when he spotted the massive invertebrate.
'It looked like a snake. I looked carefully and found it was actually a huge earthworm.' he said.

According to www.kplctv.com , b iologists intend to study the soil-dweller to determine its classification and understand why it has been able to grow so long in a built-up area.
An earthworm's size is closely related to its environment. They tend to grow longer during humid seasons if they absorb the right nutrition and have no natural enemies.
Depending on the species, an adult earthworm grow to anything from 10mm long and 1mm wide to 3m long and more than 25mm across.

Perhaps that hen might have been ready to choose a cage over the perils of canines on the range, and, obviously, my family's model of chicken-farming was horrendously inefficient and no model for the future. But the other extreme of jamming chickens into small cages is a nightmare for the animals — and the salmonella outbreak underscores that it can be a health hazard to humans as well.
Inspections of Iowa poultry farms linked to the salmonella outbreak have prompted headlines about infestations with maggots and rodents. But the larger truth is: industrial agriculture is itself unhealthy.
Repeated studies have found that cramming hens into small cages results in more eggs with salmonella than in cage-free operations. As a trade journal, World Poultry, acknowledged in May: “salmonella thrives in cage housing.”

Industrial operations — essentially factories of meat and eggs — excel at manufacturing cheap food for the supermarket. But there is evidence that this model is economically viable only because it passes on health costs to the public — in the form of occasional salmonella, antibiotic -resistant diseases, polluted waters, food poisoning and possibly certain cancers. That's why the president's cancer panel this year recommended that consumers turn to organic food if possible — a stunning condemnation of our food system.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a study in 2005 suggesting that in 2000 there were about 182,000 cases of egg-caused salmonella in the United States , including 70 deaths. That means that even without an outbreak in the news, eggs with salmonella kill more than one American a week.
“We keep finding excuses to keep this rickety industrial system together when the threat is very clear,” said Robert P. Martin, the executive director of the Pew Commission on Industrial Farm Animal Production. “It's really a matter of when, not if, these serious outbreaks occur.”

About 95 percent of American egg-laying hens are still raised in small battery cages, which are bacterial breeding grounds and notoriously difficult to disinfect. Hens are crammed together, each getting less space than a letter-size sheet of paper. The tips of their beaks are often sheared off so they won't peck each other to death.
They are sometimes fed bits of “spent hen meal” — ground up chickens. That's right. We encourage them to be cannibals.

Industrial farms also routinely feed animals low doses of antimicrobials because growers think these help animals gain weight. One study found that 70 percent of antibiotics in the United States are used in this way — even though this can lead to antibiotic-resistant infections in humans.
“Food safety has received very little attention since Upton Sinclair ,” notes Ellen Silbergeld, an expert on environmental health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who is deeply concerned about antibiotic overuse. “The massive economic reorganization of agriculture has proceeded with little recognition of its potential impacts on these aspects of food. Cheapness is all.”
But as Professor Silbergeld notes, unsafe foods are cheap only in a shortsighted way. The Pew commission found that industrial production produces hogs that at first sight are cheaper by six cents per pound. Add in pollution and health costs and that industrial pork becomes more expensive by 12 cents per pound.
Largely for humanitarian reasons, Europe already is moving toward a ban on battery cages. In 2008, California approved a similar ban, and other states are expected to follow.
So let's hope this salmonella outbreak is a wake-up call. Commercial farming can't return to a time when chickens wandered unfenced and were prey to foxes (and Irish setters). But we can overhaul our agriculture system so that it is both safer and more humane — starting with a move toward cage-free eggs.
We are asking that the Vale of Glamorgan Council, as directed by the Active Travel (Wales) Act 2013 which states that "each local authority must have regard to the needs of walkers and cyclists" (including young children), provide a 3m wide, two-way, segregated cycleway to link Barry Island with Barry Water Front, and onwards to Dinas Powys and Sully - extending to Cosmeston Lakes and Penarth.
Not only will the cycleway provide a safe route for family leisure cycling, it will enable families, including children, to cycle in safety and comfort to and between destinations such as Barry Island, Cosmeston Lakes, etc.
The development of a new road to Barry Island was a rare opportunity to provide excellent infrastructure for walking and cycling that makes active travel part of a family experience and day out with minimal disruption and no cost. The failure to provide a cycleway for families needs to be rectified urgently - to the highest standards, e.g. the new London Cycling Design Standards.
The cycleway will also provide an alternative to visiting Barry Island by car, and contributing to the excessive demand on the car parks and local roads...
Active Travel (Wales) Act 2013.
The Active Travel (Wales) Act 2013 states that "Welsh Ministers and each local authority must have regard to the needs of walkers and cyclists" - this includes young children who cycle...
The Act requires the Vale of Glamorgan council to "take reasonable steps to enhance the provision made for walkers and cyclists." and be proactive in "securing new active travel routes and related facilities and improvements in existing active travel routes and related facilities."
The situation today:
Children and their families are expected to cycle in heavy traffic to Barry island? Or, must they travel by car?

The Chicago Sun-Times and its sister suburban papers have eliminated their photography staff and will ask the papers' reporters to provide more photography and video for their stories.
Managers at Sun-Times Media Holdings LLC, the Wrapports LLC unit that owns the papers, told the photographers in a meeting this morning that it was cutting their jobs, according to people familiar with the situation. The number of full-time workers affected is about 20, but including part-time employees, it could be closer to 30, they said.
While the company, which has been trying to revive profits, still will hire professional freelance photographers for coverage, it will increasingly rely on reporters to take photos and video to accompany their stories, the sources said.

Sun-Times Media is further reducing the media company's head count as the newspapers, like the entire industry, struggle to adjust to reduced advertising and subscriber revenue. With the onslaught of online and mobile alternatives in recent years, old-line newspapers have lost advertisers and subscribers to those new rivals.
It's not uncommon for magazines to forgo staff photographers in favor of freelance and wire services. But it is unusual among daily newspapers. Newspapers and other online publications increasingly have coupled their news and information with videos.
The company didn't comment immediately on the number of jobs cut but provided a statement:
"The Sun-Times business is changing rapidly and our audiences are consistently seeking more video content with their news. We have made great progress in meeting this demand and are focused on bolstering our reporting capabilities with video and other multimedia elements. The Chicago Sun-Times continues to evolve with our digitally savvy customers, and as a result, we have had to restructure the way we manage multimedia, including photography, across the network."
The Chicago Newspaper Guild, the union that represents the photographers, immediately said it would consider taking action against the company over the cuts. It's in negotiations on a new contract for the reporters, photographers and other workers it represents. Before the cuts, it had about 150 members at the company.
“We will be looking into all of our options, legal and nonlegal,” said Craig Rosenbaum, executive director of the union. “We think this is a terrible move for the paper and community.”
The union said in a statement that it would try to build public pressure in the hopes of persuading the company to reverse course.
Chicago-based Wrapports, led by Chicago millionaire Michael Ferro, bought the Sun-Times and its 40 suburban affiliates in December 2011 and expanded the enterprise in the past year with purchases, such as the Chicago Reader, and launches, like Splash, a society tabloid.
Before Mr. Ferro's group buying the chain of newspapers and installing new management, including Wrapports CEO Tim Knight and Sun-Times Editor-in-Chief Jim Kirk, the company had run through a number of different owners and managers over the past two decades, including others who restructured and reduced costs in an attempt to buoy profits at the company.
Some of the dismissed Sun-Times photographers, who gathered at the Billy Goat Tavern below Michigan Avenue to commiserate, said they had managed to escape a number of previous rounds of job cuts. Some were partly relieved to finally exit the cost-cutting atmosphere and said they wouldn't try to get a job in the media industry again.
“I survived 16 layoffs and now I don't have to worry about losing my job anymore,” said Matt Marton, one of the photographers at the bar.
The photographers said there were clues the cuts were coming, like the company's call yesterday to identify all of their equipment and a security guard standing outside the room where they were called to a meeting today. Mr. Kirk spent two minutes explaining that because of dramatic changes in the industry, the company had to make the hard choice to cut their jobs, they said.
Among those cut was Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer John White, who won the award in 1982 for his consistently outstanding work.
Many also lamented the decline of photojournalism and their company's willingness to have employees who aren't professional photographers providing material for the papers.
“This wasn't about product, it's about the investors,” said Rob Hart, another photographer in the group who is also an adjunct professor at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications.
As papers try to evolve into lower-cost operations tapping new technology, newspapers like the Sun-Times group are experimenting with new ways of gathering content and distributing it.
After the papers' suburban offices were closed earlier this year, some reporters started using mobile computer kits to do their reporting from their cars. Reporters were told last week that they needed to start taking more photos and videos to accompany their reporting, the photographers said.
The Sun-Times outsourced its printing in 2011 and its distribution of papers even earlier.
The newspaper chain has a broad base of freelance photographers to supplement its staff contributions.
“It's not common, but it's not unprecedented either,” said Kenny Irby, founder of the photojournalism program at the St. Petersburg, Fla.-based Poynter Institute, noting that the New York daily Newsday also cut a staff of about 20 photographers in 2008 and then asked them to reapply for their jobs. Mr. Knight was the publisher at Newsday when those cuts happened.
“This is part of an ongoing trend that has been happening for the last 10 years or so in American newsrooms, with the downsizing and devaluing of professional photojournalism,” Mr. Irby said.
When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sauntered up to the world stage yesterday, he asserted that his views about Iranian President Hassan Rouhani were “facts,” which are “stubborn things.”
But a British diplomat writing in LobeLog casts considerable doubt on one of Netanyahu's central claims: that Rouhani himself wrote that he duped the West while negotiating with them over Iran's nuclear energy program. The assertion is part of the prime minister's drive to convince the U.S. that Iran's willingness to talk is a cover for furthering a nuclear weapons program.
Here's what Netanyahu said about Rouhani's book yesterday:
You know why Rohani thinks he can get away with this? I mean, this is a ruse. It's a ploy. Why does Rohani think he – thinks he can get away with it? Because – because he's gotten away with it before, because his strategy of talking a lot and doing little has worked for him in the past. He even brags about this. Here's what he said in his 2011 book about his time as Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, and I quote: “While we were talking to the Europeans in Tehran, we were installing equipment in Isfahan.” Now, for those of you who don't know, the Isfahan facility is an indispensable part of Iran's nuclear weapons program. That's where uranium ore called yellowcake is converted into an enrichable form. Rohani boasted, and I quote, “By creating a calm environment – a calm environment – we were able to complete the work in Isfahan.” He fooled the world once. Now he thinks he can fool it again. You see, Rohani thinks he can have his yellowcake and eat it too.
Netanyahu is referring to talks between Iran and Europe in 2003 over Iran's enrichment of uranium. His telling of how they went down–ostensibly based on Rouhani's own words–is misleading at best. Here's what Peter Jenkins, the UK Ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency at the time of the 2003 negotiations, has to say:
The agreement that British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and his French and German counterparts (the E3) reached with Rouhani on 21 October 2003 specified that Iran would suspend “all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities as defined by the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency]”. The E3 hoped that Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the IAEA, would produce a definition of enrichment that would stop work at the Uranium Conversion Facility (UCF) at Isfahan, which was due to start converting uranium ore (yellowcake) into uranium hexafluoride, the feed material for centrifuge enrichment, in the course of 2004. Instead, ElBaradei defined enrichment as the operation and/or testing of centrifuges; the installation of centrifuges; the introduction or use of material in any facility capable of isotopic separation; and the construction, testing or operation of any isotopic separation facility. In doing so, ElBaradei opened the way for Iran to complete, hot test and start up production at the UCF without breaching the Tehran agreement with the E3. Iran also continued to manufacture, assemble and test centrifuge machines — while honouring its commitment to suspend the activities specified by ElBaradei… As soon as the E3 could, they set about trying to renegotiate the Tehran agreement to close these loop-holes; but it was only in November 2004, in Paris, that they finally got Iranian agreement to extend the suspension to “all enrichment related activities, and specifically the manufacture and import of gas centrifuges and their components; the assembly, installation, testing or operation of gas centrifuges; and all tests or production of any uranium conversion installation”. It follows that Rouhani is entitled to claim that the agreement he negotiated in October 2003 allowed Iran to complete and start up the UCF. This achievement, however, stemmed from ElBaradei's judgement that a narrow definition of enrichment would be more accurate than a broad definition. The achievement was not the result of trickery or deceit.
Facts are indeed “stubborn things,” as Netanyahu said at the UN yesterday. He should stop trying to bend them to suit his narrative.
Katie Perrior, who quit as Downing Street communications director in April, earned less than successor and predecessor
Woman in key No 10 role paid £15,000 less than men for same job
Ministers are not serious about the gender pay gap, equality campaigners have said, after it emerged that the only female Downing Street communications director since 2010 was paid £15,000 less than men for the same role.
A Cabinet Office list of salaries for special advisers and other senior appointees in government released on Friday showed Robbie Gibb, the former BBC journalist hired to the role in July, makes £140,000 a year.
This contrasts with the £125,000 salary of Katie Perrior, who took the same job in 2016 but quit two months before the election in June, later saying she found Theresa May's then chiefs of staff, Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy, “rude, abusive and childish” in their approach.
The other two holders of the role since the 2010 election, both men, were also paid £140,000, earlier records of pay for political appointees show.
Andy Coulson took the job after David Cameron became prime minister, but quit in 2011 when he became embroiled in the legal fallout of phone-hacking cases at the News of the World, which he had previously edited.
For the rest of Cameron's time in No 10, the role, which is primarily strategic and involves less day-to-day contact with reporters, was held by another former BBC employee, Craig Oliver.
In October, May launched a fresh push to tackle the gender pay gap, saying more companies should publish details of the differentials in pay between male and female staff, including smaller businesses.
May also obliged the BBC to reveal the salaries of top earners, which showed significant discrepancies between male and female employees.

Sophie Walker, the leader of the Women's Equality party, said the lower pay awarded to Perrior for doing the same job was “proof that the government is not serious about tackling the gender pay gap and the imbalance of power between men and women”.
“You couldn't make it up. Having pressed the BBC to publish its own pay gap, Theresa May has now imported that inequality into Downing Street,” she said.
“The prioritisation of men at the cost of women is mirrored in the prime minister's ongoing support for Damian Green, who continues to be at her right hand despite being investigated for sexual harassment.
“Companies told that they must publish their own pay gap before April will be looking at the government today and think ‘why bother?'”
A Downing Street spokesman said: “We strive to set pay at appropriate levels and it is based on a range of factors, including the recipients' previous salary.”
Across all current political appointees, women were paid on average 1.6% more than men overall, he said.
The figures show Gibb is at the top level of political appointees, making the same as May's chief of staff, the former Conservative MP Gavin Barwell.
A similar list published at the end of 2016 showed Perrior was the fourth-highest-earning political appointee at Downing Street. Hill and Timothy both earned £140,000, as did May's then director of policy, John Godfrey.
The data comes from a Brookings Institute paper dealing with the nature of opposition to immigration reform and a sub-section from E. J. Dionne and William Galston on political polarization and the media, all of which is interesting — but not quite as interesting as the results of this survey. The most-trusted name in news for all Americans is, unsurprisingly, Fox News, which also has the highest ratings by far in the industry. Broadcast news — the three networks — come in a close second, with CNN a more distant third place. However, the “honor” of being the least-trusted name in news, in practically every demographic, is MSNBC, a subsidiary of NBC News — which ranks below Jon Stewart among all but Democrats.
Here's the chart that lays out the bad news for Comcast, in answer to the polling question: “Which of the following television news sources do you trust the most to provide accurate information about politics and current events?”
Almost as many liberals and Democrats identify Fox as their most trusted news source as MSNBC; with liberals, it's presumably in the margin of error. That's certainly the case among Democrats with Jon Stewart. It looks like a toss-up between which version of comedy they want to experience.
Interestingly, though, the area of most consensus is still the venerable broadcast-news programs. Clearly, Republicans and conservatives favor Fox, but broadcast news gets the most even distribution of trust on partisan and ideological grounds. The alphabets get a little more trust from Republicans than independents, who spread their trust rather evenly between the broadcast networks, CNN, and public television — although the plurality chooses Fox first. In contrast, MSNBC is a fringe choice in all demographics, and comes in next to last even among its target demos of Democrats and liberals.
Dionne and Galston note that jobs and the economy dominate the priorities of all groups in their analysis, and that immigration reform — the central focus of the lengthy Brookings effort — isn't really a big priority for Americans:
There is a paradox in our politics at the moment. It is obvious that our political system is deeply polarized and that the political parties advocate very different approaches to core issues such as health care and the economy. Yet at the same time, Americans across partisan, ideological, and demographic lines largely agree on the relative importance of the challenges we face. The people as a whole see the acceleration of job creation as the top priority, with reducing the budget deficit and health care costs also scoring high. Enacting immigration reform and addressing climate change trail far behind, while dealing with moral breakdown occupies a middle position. When we turn to subgroups, some surprising results emerge. For example when asked to rate particular issues as the highest, high or lower priority, only 36% of Hispanics regard immi- gration reform as the highest priority, compared to 62% who list jobs as the highest priority and 49% who cite health care costs. In fact, there are few differences over priorities across racial and ethnic lines. By substantial margins, whites, African-Americans, and Hispanics care most about job creation and least about immigration and climate change. All three groups rank moral breakdown fourth on the list of six. Whites and men as a whole care more about the deficit than about health care costs, while the reverse is the case for African-Americans and women. One might have expected issues such as climate change and immigration reform to score high among young adults. Not so: only 22% gave a “highest priority” rating to climate change and even fewer (17%) to immigration reform. Only 29% of self-described liberals view climate change as the highest priority issue, and only 22% put immigration reform in that category.
What would make for an interesting research paper would be to compare the air time accorded to these priorities by each of these media outlets. I'd hypothesize based on casual observation that MSNBC probably spends a highly disproportionate amount of time on low-priority issues like climate change and immigration reform, while the more trusted outlets actually report on issues about which Americans across all demographics care — jobs, the economy, and the disastrous effects of ObamaCare. That could be one reason why those outlets gain more trust in dealing with breaking news than MSNBC does in any context.
Zero just doesn't add up anymore.
That's what Mayor Joe Fontana admitted Thursday as council finalized the 2013 budget and he abandoned after two years his key campaign promise: to deliver four straight tax freezes.
Instead, council approved a budget that includes a tax hike of about 1.2%, or $30 for the average London homeowner.
Acknowledging some taxpayers may be irked, Fontana called it a case of aiming for a goal and falling short.
“I don't know (if people will feel) deceived. I've tried. But I'm also practical and realistic,” he told reporters. “The city . . . needs a lot more oxygen than I ever realized. I've tried.”
A Fontana-led council majority pushed through tax freezes in 2011 and '12.
The appetite for another tax freeze wasn't there for the nasty cuts required to do so this year, with politicians rejecting belt-tightening that would have hurt services such as libraries and London Transit.
Though the reins were pulled back on some spending — most notably, police and fire budgets — Fontana doesn't sound like he's interested in pushing for zero again in 2014.
The tax freeze is finished.
In its place, Fontana argued, should be a greater emphasis on economic prosperity and job creation, playing to his other key campaign promise: to create 10,000 jobs over five years.
“Can we still get to zero?” he said to council colleagues as debate began Thursday. “Sure, we could.
“But I guess the question is, should we? I believe at this time it's not the time to go to zero. It's time to pivot to job creation.”
Ditching a campaign promise that's clearly proven unrealistic had Fontana predicting a nasty reaction — he expected critical headlines Friday morning, he said — and some quietly wonder if he simply no longer has the political support to push his agenda ahead.
But one frequent rival, Coun. Nancy Branscombe, gave him full marks for shifting gears. “He wanted to find a balance to get a unanimous vote,” she said.
In the end, the budget was approved 12-3, with Bud Polhill, Dale Henderson and Paul Van Meerbergen opposed.
The difference between the tenor of Thursday night's final budget debate and the same night one year earlier was remarkable.
To fully grasp the dramatic drop in temperature in both the political and public realm, imagine walking out of a sauna and straight into a hockey rink.
The issue that so galled critics last year — diverting $1 million from affordable housing to deliver a tax freeze — was rejected this year. So, too, was a slew of other contentious cuts.
That left council entering Thursday with a 1.2% tax hike on the books, roughly $5.6 million in cuts or new revenue away from a tax freeze.
The needle hardly moved, though an additional $1.1 million was thrown atop the tax hike to help pay for economic-development projects. In response, Fontana pulled an equivalent amount from the 2012 surplus.
That kept the tab at 1.2%.
To call it a debate is misleading — the final budget session was calm and largely cordial, save for a few flare-ups.
When Coun. Matt Brown questioned using a surplus to bankroll the London & Middlesex Housing Corp.'s 2013 budget increase, Fontana was ticked.
He warned he'd resume his push to zero if his effort to find middle ground was met with a push to spend more. Branscombe replied she and others didn't “appreciate the threat.”
A 1.2% tax hike adds $30 to the property tax bill of the average London home, assessed at $202,000.

You know things are going well for a team when former players begin to weigh in on the dirty laundry that's been aired.
An unnamed player sounded off about LaMarr Woodley's weight. Ryan Clark took exception to that, calling that unnamed played a coward. Antonio Brown didn't appreciate it either (and wore a garish hat).
Now it's Ward, who told NFL Network (as reported by Trib Review's Alan Robinson), "Guys start finger-pointing, calling out other guys. That's not the Steeler way. We always had a rule: We are a band of brothers. We've always collectively kept everything in-house. But there was no finger-pointing and calling out each other. That's total disarray, a locker room in disarray."
With all due respect to Ward, other comments in the same interview can paint him as a bitter ex-employee more than an experienced observer.
"I'm a little disappointed I didn't get the opportunity to run around and congratulate the fans and really just thank them for so many great years. I always wanted that. ... I always thought I could play football for another season, if I had been healthy."
To be fair, maybe Ward deserved that. But the team did put him on the field in Week 17 to catch his 1,000th pass - a two-yard loss - amid a reasonably competitive game against Cleveland.
Maybe Ward has earned the right to question the current leadership state of the team. Being a self-proclaimed (and well-supported) "Steeler For Life" doesn't mean he has to be a cheerleader. But it's not like the Steelers were all smiles and sunshine after less-than-successful season when Ward was there.
Leadership isn't all about preventing such issues, it's guiding a group to become stronger because of those issues. So in essence, regardless of the state of the locker room, how they respond to this is going to be more important. And perhaps that's the challenge Ward is giving the current team.

In theory communication between people serves as a way to collaboratively teach, learn, arrive at the truth, or share transcendent experience.Â As some have noticed however, with the wrong motivations language devolves into a form of merely winning arguments.
This speaks to life in general.Â Are we in it to win arguments or to accomplish goals?Â We can see this division clearly in the debate over global warming, which could be a threat that eliminates our species entirely and so in theory deserves our front and center focus.
So many people have argued back and forth whether or not global warming is true or false that they have forgotten why they are even arguing in the first place.Â The real issue that lies hidden under the confusion is the question of protecting the environment.
The global warming debate is merely a â€œproxyâ€ battle. It is a justification that must be proven in order to move on with the actual goal. Those who believe they should be trying to prove global warming are hoping to win in order to justify protecting the environment.Â Merely winning the debate accomplishes nothing.
If we were able to offer a totally different justification, and this allowed humanity to unite on the goal of protecting the environment, would you be willing to drop global warming altogether?Â
If not, you should ask yourself if you are in this debate for the right reasons. Winning the argument without achieving the goal will mean nothing. In theory, any outcome that does not involve achieving the goal is the end of humanity, which leaves us with “by any means necessary.”
As coached by our media, we start to see that phrase in terms of extremism. It points instead to a humbler paradigm: the truth or falsity of global warming is irrelevant. What matters is whether we find some reason, and we probably don't care what, to protect our environment from ourselves.

The story of how Mr. Ayup traded the freedoms of life in America for the quixotic dream of opening Uighur-language schools in Xinjiang is a cautionary tale about the perils of challenging the Chinese state on matters of ethnic identity.
At a time when the authorities are determined to tamp down even the faintest expression of Uighur self-determination, few hold much hope that he will be freed anytime soon. “The government can make sure he rots in jail for years,” said Mamatjan Juma, a childhood friend who now lives in suburban Virginia. “They don't want a brave, influential intellectual like him on the streets.”
Despite the evident risks, friends say Mr. Ayup thought he might succeed by steering clear of politics and carefully following the regulations that govern the establishment of private schools. Soon after returning from the United States, he opened a kindergarten in the Silk Road city of Kashgar. Having quickly achieved full enrollment, he set his sights on Urumqi, where Mandarin-language public schools are producing a generation with limited Uighur proficiency.
Anwar Mamat, 38, a childhood friend who teaches at the University of Nebraska, said Mr. Ayup turned down a three-year scholarship at the University of Kansas to pursue his dream. “A lot of parents are willing to send their kids to a Uighur school, but none are available,” he said. “Abduweli knew the risks, but he was committed to achieving his goals.”
It was not long before Mr. Ayup had become a local celebrity. He appeared on state-run television to offer advice about studying abroad, and his blog posts on Uighur language drew hundreds of thousands of hits. Robert Wilson, an English teacher in New York who was a former student of Mr. Ayup's, said he was far from a radical. “It wasn't that he thought Uighurs shouldn't learn Chinese, it's just that he thought they should also know their own language,” Mr. Wilson said.
But Mr. Ayup soon met official resistance. Last year the authorities forced the cancellation of an event he had organized to mark Nowruz, an ancient pre-Islamic celebration of spring, and in March of 2013, they shut the kindergarten in Kashgar, saying it lacked the proper license.
Faced with bureaucratic intransigence to his proposed school in Urumqi, Mr. Ayup began documenting his odyssey online last spring, a move that most likely angered the authorities. “It was a kind of symbolic activism, to let people know how China was treating the status of the Uighur language,” said Mr. Juma, the childhood friend, who is a senior editor at Radio Free Asia, an American-financed news service.
At 6:30 this morning, New York City fast food workers walked off the job, launching a rare strike against a nearly union-free industry. Organizers expect workers at dozens of stores to join the one-day strike, a bold challenge to an industry whose low wages, limited hours and precarious employment typify a growing portion of the U.S. economy.
New York City workers are organizing at McDonald's, Burger King, Domino's, KFC, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Papa John's. Organizers expect today's strike to include workers from almost all of those chains, with the largest group coming from McDonald's; the company did not respond to a request for comment.

But employees were clear about their reasons for walking out. “They're not paying us enough to survive,” McDonald's worker Raymond Lopez told Salon in a pre-strike interview. Lopez said he decided to join today's strike because “This company has enough money to pay us a reasonable amount for all that we do … they're just not going to give it to us as long as they can get away with it. I think we need to be heard.”
Lopez, a 21-year-old who's been at McDonald's for two years, said he makes $8.75 an hour as a shift manager (organizers say this isn't a supervisory position). He works at McDonald's and at two other jobs – catering and doing leaf work – while paying off student loans, pursuing an acting career, and helping to support his family.
“Everything we do needs to be fast, needs to be perfect,” said Lopez, and “when you're actually there for eight hours smiling like you're on the Miss Universe contest, it's not easy.” He said McDonald's supervisors “make us work off the clock all of the time” and “there is a lot of verbal abuse.” Lopez recalled a supervisor telling him, “Hey, if you don't want me to treat you this way, then give me what I want.'”
New York Communities for Change organizing director Jonathan Westin told Salon the current effort is “the biggest organizing campaign that's happened in the fast food industry.” A team of 40 NYCC organizers have been meeting with workers for months, spearheading efforts to form a new union, the Fast Food Workers Committee. NYCC organizers and fast food workers have been signing up employees on petitions demanding both the chance to organize a union without retaliation and a hefty raise, from near-minimum wages to $15 an hour.
When an NYCC organizer started meeting with McDonald's workers across from his store, said Lopez, “It was a little difficult for me to believe that it was going to be possible” to change McDonald's. “I didn't pay too much attention to it … it took me two or three meetings to start trusting them.” But as the number of workers meeting with NYCC increased, “my faith in this whole deal grew as well.”
Columbia University political scientist Dorian Warren described companies like McDonald's as poster children for the ways that “the nature and organization of work have changed” in the United States: “part-time work, contingent work, the inability to have control over one's schedule … essentially no protections, and even where there's existing protections, they're not enforced … They don't even approach living wage jobs,” and for most workers, “there are absolutely no benefits.”

The Bureau of Labor Statistics pegs “Combined Food Service and Preparation Workers, Including Fast Food” as the lowest-paid job category in NYC. State labor department data show the city's fast food jobs have grown by 55 percent since 2000. Meanwhile, according to a report from the National Employment Law Project, McDonald's profits have increased 130 percent over four years.
University of Pennsylvania sociologist Robin Leidner said Tuesday that an industry norm in which “virtually everyone is part-time” puts workers in a bind: “No one gets enough hours to trigger the legal protections, and to make them eligible for any health benefits … You can't earn enough with one job, but given the unpredictability, it's extremely hard to hold down more than one.” Leidner worked at McDonald's (with the company's agreement) as part of the research for her 1993 book "Fast Food, Fast Talk." She recalled a store manager who “was pretty frank about saying if he had some problem with someone, typically what he'd do is reduce their hours until they got the message. In other words, until they quit.”
Leidner said the jobs are also “very heavily surveilled”: Customers keep workers on their toes, cash registers store instantaneous sales data, managers regulate employees' expressions, and corporate officials pore over individual stores' metrics in search of ways to boost profits.
NYC isn't the only place fast food workers are in revolt. Today's strike follows a founding convention held earlier this month by an linked organization, the Workers Organizing Committee of Chicago. WWOC claims 200-some members in fast food and retail. Its most dramatic actions took place on Black Friday, when workers leafleted and demonstrated at major companies and dropped a banner inside of Macy's (they also joined pickets in support of local Wal-Mart workers). “We're getting all the workers together and we're standing up against CEOs,” said WOCC member Brittany Smith. “Because there are more workers than there are CEOs.” Smith, a college student who recently quit her job at the retail chain Express and took a similar job at Urban Outfitters, said she now makes $8.75 an hour. “Some of the time I luck out and I can eat two meals a day,” she said. “But most of the time, I'm eating one.”

Like FFWC in New York, WOCC is a new independent union made up of workers tied together by a shared city and similarly low wages, not a single employer. Both FFWC and WOCC are backed by unions and labor community groups, and so far aren't recognized by any employers. And they're making the same demands: allow a fair process for unionization and start paying $15 an hour. Organizers say that could be achieved through union contracts with individual companies, or through joint bargaining with several employers at once. Either way, it's a heavy lift.
As workers try to change their industry, will fast food companies retaliate? Organizers say they already have.
Jose Cerillo, a 79-year-old who cleans tables and floors at a New York McDonald's, told Salon he was suspended by the company on Monday after signing up co-workers on the campaign petition. According to Cerillo, management said the punishment was for violating a “no solicitation” policy. “They feel threatened because I'm organizing,” said Cerillo (he was interviewed in Spanish). He said he circulated the petition during break times and outside of work.

Cerillo said he got involved after receiving a phone call from an organizer at home a few months ago. “I was so happy,” he said. Cerillo, who has been working at a series of McDonald's locations since 1996, said he makes $7.40 an hour, 15 cents above minimum wage. “It's just not enough to live.”
Cerillo said many of his co-workers share his frustrations but are hesitant to get involved: Of around 40 other employees at his store, “about three” signed his petition. “They don't want to lose their job,” said Cerillo. But he said he remains eager to keep up the fight: “I feel happy, and I want to fight more … I want to do something worthwhile.”
In recent decades, Warren said Tuesday, even the most effective U.S. unions have “had such a hard time organizing in their core industries,” where they already have members, “that fast food just got left out … no one was really willing to take the risk and invest in fast food organizing.” Warren said research suggests that the industry's demographics – predominantly women and workers of color – could improve prospects for organizing.

On the other hand, Leidner noted that the extremely high turnover and the relatively small number of workers in each store would make organizing that much more difficult.
The structure of the industry will also play a role: most individual stores are franchisees, technically owned by an individual who holds a contract with the national company and pays them fees and a portion of revenue. Any individual franchisee that buckled to pressure to transform conditions or eschew union-busting could have that contract revoked (one exception: establishments in public buildings like convention centers, among the only places you can find a unionized Starbucks). At best, the franchisee relationship could provide organizers with an additional point of leverage, creating unrest in stores that could drive franchisees to press corporate for a resolution, and vice versa. But at worst, the franchisee structure could offer another lever for corporate to crack down on any uprisings while evading any responsibility.
The New York and Chicago campaigns evoke two strategies that have been long debated but infrequently attempted in U.S. labor. First, “minority unionism”: mobilizing workers to take dramatic actions and make demands on management prior to showing support from the majority of employees. Second, “geographic organizing”: collaboration between multiple unions to organize workers at several employers and win public support for raising a region's standards through unionization. This campaign is also the latest example in which community-based organizing groups, which unions have long leaned on to drum up support for workers, are playing a major role in directly organizing workers to win union recognition.
NYCC's Westin told Salon in a pre-strike interview that the goal of this work stoppage is to give expression to workers' “energy and movement” and “anger around how they've been treated,” and “hopefully mobilizing the community, and mobilizing clergy, and mobilizing their fellow workers around them.”

Today's strike also comes one week after non-union Wal-Mart workers escalated their unprecedented strike wave against the retail giant. Lopez said that, while he had already decided to strike, he drew additional inspiration from the Black Friday example. “I thought it was really ballsy for someone to do that,” said Lopez. “Which I admired.” Lopez said his decision to strike “got scary probably a couple days ago, when I realized the seriousness of this.” Despite that fear, he said, “I still believe in what I'm doing, so I'm going to go ahead and do it.”
“I don't know what to expect” from the strike, said Lopez. “It's such a unique thing. A lot of stuff could happen. It's not going to be overnight.”
As California moves toward the legalization of marijuana — next month, voters will decide on Proposition 19, the Regulate, Control and Tax Cannabis Act of 2010 — a key question remains: could the new law produce a whole generation of stoners? Opponents of legalization say, yes, fearing it will lead to a massive increase in pot smoking among youth. But some supporters suggest the opposite: legalizing cannabis could de-glamorize it and ultimately prompt reductions in toking. Who's right?
That question is surprisingly hard to answer, but two recent research reports offer some potentially useful insight. The first, a Rand Corporation report that led to related testimony before the California legislature on Sept. 21, discusses the effects of price changes and taxation on consumption of drugs. (More on Time.com: What's in Your Marijuana? Some Pot Doesn't Rot Your Memory)
A newer report, released Thursday, comes from the new scientist-led International Centre for Science in Drug Policy (ICSDP). It takes a historical look at how U.S. drug policy has affected use, and suggests how to regulate drugs effectively.
One thing the ICSDP report makes clear is that current U.S. drug policy has no effect on marijuana prices or use. While spending on federal drug law enforcement has increased 1,200% and marijuana arrests have risen 150% since 1981, the rate of marijuana use nationwide has bounced around, with no relationship to these efforts.
“No scientific evidence demonstrates an association between the amount of money governments spend on drug law enforcement and rates of drug use,” says Dr. Evan Wood, a professor of medicine at the University of British Columbia, founder of ICSDP and lead author of the report. “And some nations like the U.S., which spend the most have among the highest rates of drug use.” (More on Time.com: 30 Years Since ‘Jimmy's World': The Media and Drugs)
Meanwhile, according to national surveys, high school students continue to report that marijuana is universally available, purity has increased and prices have fallen.
The Rand report forecasts how legalization and taxation of marijuana could affect its market price and overall use in California. Although the public tends to view drug users, and addicts in particular, as too irrational and irresponsible to base their behavior on drug prices, research debunks these notions. Studies on legal drugs, such as alcohol and tobacco, for example, show that taxing them and raising prices can often be quite effective in lowering consumption — even among the heaviest users. “After legalization, we expect a large price drop. That's the biggest takeaway message from this report,” says Beau Kilmer, co-director of the Rand Drug Policy Research Center and lead author of the report. “We expect the price [of marijuana] to drop at least 80%. There are a couple of other figures out there, ours falls in the middle and you can quibble about the details but there's a general agreement that the price will drop.”
The trick is determining how high to set the tax — the price has to be high enough to minimize consumption, but low enough to avoid creating a black market. Kilmer says that the current price for an ounce of good sinsemilla (a type of highly potent marijuana) ranges from $250 to $400. “If that drops down to $50 to $60 an ounce, it would require a really large tax to get [the price back up to that level]. But if the tax is set too high, [we] worry about tax evasion,” he says. (More on Time.com: Is Drug Use Really on the Rise?)
Experts disagree on how much tax evasion occurs under California's tobacco tax regime, with smokers ordering cigarettes by mail to avoid state taxes, for instance. Some put the figure at 1% to 4%, but the agency that administers the state's tobacco taxes has said that the rate is more like 15%. Either way, the majority of cigarette taxes do seem to be paid rather than evaded.
Kilmer notes, however, that if Prop 19 passes, each local jurisdiction can set its own tax rate, which could prompt a “race to the bottom,” as localities compete for a piece of the pie. “Regardless of how you feel about Prop 19, how to stop a race to the bottom is going to be important for everyone. No one wins if we end up with a really low tax rate on a really low price,” Kilmer says. To prevent that, he suggests that the state government could withhold certain types of funding to localities that set marijuana taxes under a certain limit.
But let's say the price of marijuana does end up dropping precipitously. What effect might that have on consumption? Neither report can answer that. “Ultimately, we don't come up with a conclusion at all on a consumption increase,” Kilmer says, explaining that many factors other than price can affect use. So the report considered what would happen if whole population use increased by 100%.
Interestingly, such use rates have already been experienced in the U.S. The highest rates of marijuana use reported in the U.S. were in the late 1970s and early '80s, despite harsh drug laws. At the time 60% of high school seniors reported trying marijuana at least once; by comparison, the rate in 2009 was 42%. And what became of Generation X? The kids seem to have turned out all right.
Other countries that have decriminalized or quasi-legalized marijuana — such as Portugal and Holland — also have not seen social disasters because of their drug laws. In fact, they have benefited from reduced enforcement costs and increased access to addiction treatment.
One study did find that rates of marijuana use among Dutch youth increased when “coffee shops” — cafes where selling and smoking of marijuana are permitted — were proliferating and being widely marketed. But, overall, even those elevated rates of use were no higher than U.S. rates under marijuana prohibition. “It wasn't the decriminalization, it was commercialization that could have caused this,” says Kilmer.
Advertising and commercialization may end up being cause for concern in the U.S. as well, given that medical marijuana ads already seem to be sustaining some newspapers. But, then again, even if Prop 19 passes, marijuana wouldn't be completely legal — it would still be prohibited under federal drug laws, which could put pressure on the Obama Administration to enforce them (though this Wall Street Journal article suggests that supporting legalization measures could be a boon for Democrats — putting similar measures on other states' ballots could draw out some key voters on Election Day).
Many questions remain about what will happen if Proposition 19 passes, but the only result I can unequivocally predict is that drug policy debates will finally become less theoretical — and much more interesting.

Last night Sony held an investor conference to unveil its plans to turn things around, following a terrible fiscal year that's seen the company project a $6.4 billion loss. The plan? Focus on gaming and, more specifically, force the Playstation brand into every phone going.
Sony's new approach has been named ‘One Sony', which is a title designed to show that its looking to narrow its focus and drive its key business areas. Those are digital imaging, mobile and – crucially – gaming.
The plan is to rapidly up the level of downloadable games and improve the reach and use of the PSN store, so as to drive revenue through game sales and subscriptions directly into Sony's pocket. Sounds good, but that's just the start.
Playstation Suite: 5 games we want to see
As part of the plan, Sony intends to dramatically increase the reach of the Playstation Suite. Currently, the only Playstation Suite-certified devices are select Xperia handsets and Sony's tablets, with HTC rumoured to have signed up. But that's not enough.
While no details on specific devices were given, it's understood that Sony will probably look to get the Playstation Suite into as many Android handsets as possible. With gaming now one of the few areas where the iPhone still has a wider choice, we reckon most Android manufacturers will be extremely happy to take on Sony's Playstation branding, even if there's little other than Crash Bandicoot to get excited about for the time being.
Will HTC launch a Playstation Phone?
But you can expect that to change. Once Sony gets the Playstation Suite into every Android handset and tablet going, games will surely start to flood in. Is Sony's redirected focus going to be a boon for Android? Let us know your thoughts below.
Costa Rica's electric grid ran exclusively on renewable energy for 150 days so far this year, the country's power operator said late last week.
Half of those days were achieved in only the last few months.
The Central American nation was powered for 76 straight days on carbon-free electricity from June 16 to Sept. 2, according to the Costa Rica Electricity Institute (ICE).
It's easy to point to Costa Rica's clean energy success as a model for fossil fuel-dependent nations to follow.
However, it's not an example that the big polluters of the world can easily emulate anytime soon.
First, there's Costa Rica's physical size. At just 19,730 square miles, Costa Rica is about twice the size of the state of Vermont, meaning it only needs a handful of large power plants to light up substantial swaths of the country.
Second, there's the matter of the country's rather paltry electricity appetite. This nation of 4.9 million people generated about 10,713 gigawatt-hours of electricity in 2015, according to a July report from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.
The United States, by contrast, generated about 373 times more electricity, with roughly 4 million gigawatt-hours of total generation in 2015, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
And third, Costa Rica is rich in hydroelectric resources. The majority of the nation's clean power comes from its four main hydropower facilities, which are fed by multiple rivers and abundant seasonal rainfall.
Hydropower alone accounted for about 80 percent of Costa Rica's total electricity generation in August, according to National Energy Control Center data cited by ICE.
While dams provide a cleaner source of electricity, they can have large environmental and social consequences, from displacing indigenous communities, disrupting wildlife habitats and turning healthy rivers into stagnant, algae-filled pools.
Geothermal plants provided about 12.6 percent of electricity generation in August. Wind turbines supplied 7.1 percent, while solar power accounted for just 0.01 percent.
Costa Rica's stretch of fossil fuel-free days this year follows its even cleaner results from 2015. Last year, Costa Rica logged 299 total days without burning oil, coal or natural gas for a single megawatt of electricity.
Hydropower, wind, solar, geothermal and biomass accounted for over 98 percent of its total electricity output in 2015, according to the regional economic commission report. Natural gas-fired cogeneration and thermal power plants supplied the remaining 1.8 percent.
Carlos Manuel Obregón, the executive president of ICE, said Costa Rica could enjoy even more months of carbon-free power once ICE's massive Reventazón hydroelectric project comes online this month after six years of construction.
Revantazón is the largest public infrastructure project in Central America after the Panama Canal. The dam's five turbines will have a generating capacity of 305.5 megawatts, enough to power around 525,000 homes.
The project will bring "stable and renewable energy for the benefit of all sectors in the country," Obregón said in the ICE press release.
The cops at Montreal's Station 19 will be back on TV this month. They will be fighting crime on the streets, confronting corruption in police ranks and battling the demons within their own souls, but one thing they won't be doing is speaking French.
The English version of 19-2, which was based on Radio-Canada's French show of the same title and which returns for a third season on Bravo June 20, takes place in a linguistic netherworld where street signs are in French but the language is barely ever spoken.
Producers say the concept is that the characters are francophone and are speaking French, but we hear them in English – the same way the Swedish detective Wallander speaks English on the BBC series based on the Swedish books. For anyone familiar with the joys and challenges of a bilingual city, this requires some powerful suspension of disbelief. A 19-2 episode this season featured an ugly anti-police demonstration where protesters waved signs that said "Pigs" and "Shame" and made liberal use of the traditional Anglo-Saxon expletive. I found it hard not to think, yeah, but those signs and those curses should be in French.

English-language television drama set in Quebec is a rarity and when it does appear it faces a very particular artistic problem that it seldom conquers. The characters on a French-language show can realistically use the occasional English expression or throw a few words of English at some bit player while their larger dramas unfold entirely in French, but their anglophone equivalents walk streets and enter stores that seem weirdly bereft of Quebec's first language.
CBC's This Life, the other English drama currently being shot in Montreal, began last season with a single French word: "Merci!" Torri Higginson's Natalie Lawson – she's a single mother with cancer, a columnist with an English Montreal daily and part of a tight-knit anglophone family – was thanking someone who had held open a hospital door for her. But she didn't use the language with anyone inside the hospital nor with her son's francophone girlfriend. (Actress Naomi Frenette plays that role with a discernible French accent.)
Yes, television drama is often unrealistic: This Life includes some deft observation of contemporary family life, but the women still go to bed with their makeup on and live in perfectly decorated houses. Meanwhile, on 19-2, the cops seem to shoot criminals dead in every other episode. But that's just TV; the lack of linguistic realism seems harder to overlook because it makes these shows, both of them well-conceived and strongly performed, feel unanchored in any particular place. You may see a lot of Montreal on your screen but you never feel transported there since you hear so little of the city.
That's why I am ambivalent about news from the Quebec English-Language Production Council that the genre is experiencing a revival. In a recent press release, that professional association announced that its work with the Canadian Media Fund to direct more money toward anglophone productions is paying off big time: The CMF changed the rules around grants to anglophone minority shows in Quebec in 2013 and has recently allocated $4.5-million to the area for 2016-17. The council reports that a record 40 hours of English television drama will be produced in Quebec next season. As recently as 2011-2012 – before the arrival of 19-2 and Mohawk Girls, set in Kahnawake, Que. – that number was zero, but it has been climbing steadily since the new rules took effect.
Quebec's vibrant and scrappy English artistic community, which may pine for the long-lost days when Montreal was Canada's cultural capital in both languages, struggles to get a fair shake from provincial funding bodies that are more attuned to the needs of their francophone clients while sometimes finding itself overlooked by federal agencies, too. English-language dramas visibly set in Montreal were becoming an endangered species before 19-2 and This Life came along. As far as I can remember the last one would have been The Foundation, a comedy that sadly only lasted a single season on Showcase back in 2009. It was a very black and very smart satire of the philanthropic sector, but it also took place in a city where no one seemed to speak any French.
Of course, you could make a similar criticism of dramas shot in Toronto or Vancouver that never recognize the multilingual realities of those cities. That's why many observers were so excited by the arrival of Blood and Water, the Vancouver police drama that aired on the multicultural station OMNI last year. The show revolves around the murder of the son of a billionaire Chinese real-estate developer; the dialogue is in English, Mandarin and Cantonese with subtitles where necessary. The second half of its first season will be airing this fall.
Seeing the cultural dynamism of any Canadian city reflected that accurately in a television drama is highly unusual but does suggest audiences may be ready for more multilingual TV. The Quebec production council is looking forward to more episodes of 19-2, This Life, Mohawk Girls – as well as two new series to be created for CBC and Bell Media. Maybe one of them will actually sound like Montreal.

Oakland A's catcher George Kottaras was claimed off waivers by the Royals today.
Kottaras was designated for assignment on Jan. 14 to make room for John Jaso, who was trade to the A's to be their everyday catcher.
Kottaras was acquired in July of last season from the Milwaukee Brewers, and was the backup to Derek Norris for most of the second half.
He hit .201 with seven home runs and 34 RBI in 60 games, and played in all five postseason games against the Tigers.
The 29-year old catcher has spent six seasons in the major leagues, splitting time with the Red Sox, Brewers,and A's.
Captain America has another superhero supporter in the upcoming Captain America: Civil War, even if it's just spiritually. During an interview with Chloe Bennet about the upcoming third season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., she divulged which side her character Daisy Johnson, aka the Inhuman Quake, would be on in the fight. While Captain America would get her support (just like Stan Lee), she had pretty good story reasoning for it.
“I think Cap,” she told ComicBook.com when asked about Daisy's pick. “Not just because it's Chris Evans, I think it would be Cap because, I mean, that just makes the most sense. Iron Man is not really for her, you know? I think Daisy's behavior up to this point, and where she's been means she would go with Cap.”
While the idea of accountability certainly falls within Daisy's purview – she was hacking into S.H.I.E.L.D. for that reason, after all, being put under strict control has never been her thing. After being betrayed by Ward and the Hydra agents within S.H.I.E.L.D., it's easy to see how oversight from anyone other than those she knows and trusts directly would put Daisy off. Little is known about how many Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. will interact with Civil War, but history shows it could shake up the show considerably. While Age of Ultron only had a passing connection to the show, it did wind up putting Ward in a considerable position of power, thanks to deaths in the film. Captain America: The Winter Soldier, however, had a huge direct connection to the series, completely changing the landscape, revealing a traitor within the team, and transforming the show from a “freak of the week” style series to the weekly inside look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe they originally promised.
Clarence Thomas is falling into a deep, deep ethical hole, deeper even than the one he dropped into when he failed to disclose his wife's income for 20 years. As more facts come to light, it's obvious he failed to disclose quite a bit, including the $100,000 Citizens United spent on his behalf in 1991 to support his nomination. That would be an in-kind contribution which should have been disclosed as such.
A Time Magazine article from 1991 has the details:
Washington-area television viewers were startled last week to see three familiar senatorial faces pop up on their screens above the words WHO WILL JUDGE THE JUDGE? The follow-up question -- "How many of these liberal Democrats could themselves pass ethical scrutiny?" -- was hardly necessary, since the faces were those of Edward Kennedy, Joseph Biden and Alan Cranston, all scarred veterans of highly publicized scandals, from Chappaquiddick to plagiarized speeches to the Keating Five. The ad, produced by two independent right-wing groups, was intended to bolster Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas' confirmation chances by pointing the finger at three liberal Democrats who seemed likely to oppose him. Not coincidentally, the ad was produced by the same people who launched the 1988 Willie Horton spot that branded Michael Dukakis soft on crime but left George Bush open to charges of racism. Anxious not to be associated with such negative campaigning this time around, Bush quickly labeled the attacks on the Senators "counterproductive." Thomas pronounced them "vicious." His chief Senate supporter, Missouri Republican John Danforth, called them "sleazy" and "scurrilous." Although Bush and chief of staff John Sununu demanded that the ads be pulled, their right-wing sponsors -- L. Brent Bozell III, chairman of the Conservative Victory Committee, and Floyd Brown, chairman of Citizens United -- refused. Calling the campaign a "pre-emptive strike" to counter anticipated anti-Thomas commercials, as well as retaliation for the 1987 spots that helped defeat Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, they vowed to keep running the messages for at least two weeks "until the left agrees to discontinue all its efforts against Judge Thomas." Thus far, that has been a mostly fitful effort at best, but Brown and Bozell appeared to see the flag of revolution rising above it. "Unfortunately," the two men declared in a written statement, "the Administration has no desire to confront the radical left."
So Citizens United pays to produce and air an ad with the stated intention of bullying "the left" into silence over his nomination, and Clarence Thomas fails to disclose that before hearing last year's Citizens United case that corrupted our election process?
Ironically, the case ProtectOurElections is relying on is Caperton v Massey, ruled on by the Supreme Court in 2009. Predictably, Thomas, Scalia, Roberts and Alito dissented.
Applying Caperton to Citizens United, it is clear that Justice Thomas, after having been supported by an effective advertising campaign that reaped millions in free media time, labored under an actual conflict of interest that denied the FEC due process. Justice Thomas owed his spot on the Court to Citizens United Foundation. That fact undermined his ability to put aside his bias in favor of Citizens United. Justice Thomas was required to disclose his relationship with Citizens United and sua
sponte recuse himself from the case. Instead, he hid that relationship and cast the
deciding vote in favor of Citizens United. This corrupted the administration of justice
and violated D.C. Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 8.4—Misconduct, which states in
pertinent part:
“It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:
(a) Violate or attempt to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or
induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another;
(c) Engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation;
(d) Engage in conduct that seriously interferes with the administration of justice; ….”
Seems like Justice Thomas has a really distorted idea of what justice is. Can we impeach him yet?
CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) — All right, all of you who say you're contrarians: Now's the time to see if you really walk the walk, not just talk the talk.
You say that the time to buy is when the blood is running in the streets. Well now would certainly appear to be one of those times. How many of you are stepping up to the plate to buy?
Not many, I am sure.
But there is one group that appears to be doing so. And they have a history of being more right than wrong about the market's direction.
I'm referring to corporate insiders, a group that includes corporate officers, directors, and largest shareholders. You may recall that, three weeks ago, corporate insiders were selling at an abnormally high pace. By one measure, in fact, they were then selling at the fastest pace in the nearly 40 years that insider data had been collected. (Read my July 29 column: “Insiders selling at unusually fast pace.”)
With the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.13% now more than 1,400 points lower, the insiders appear to be shifting back to the buy side in a big way.
Consider an insider indicator calculated by the Vickers Weekly Insider Report, published by Argus Research. This indicator is a ratio of the number of shares that insiders have sold to the number that they have bought.
For insiders transactions last week, according to the latest issue of the Vickers service, which I received late Monday night, this sell-to-buy ratio stood at 1.68-to-1. That's bullish, according to Vickers, since the long-term average level for this ratio is between 2 and 2.5 to 1.
To further put the current level of this ratio into context, consider that in the week ending July 22, this ratio stood at 6.43-to-1. And among those companies whose stocks are listed on the NYSE and the AMEX, the ratio during that week stood at 13.10-to-1 — which is the highest, and most bearish, reading for the ratio since Vickers began collecting data in 1974.
Further confirmation that the insiders are responding in true contrarian fashion to the market's plunge: Vickers' sell-to-buy ratio steadily improved last week as the market dropped. For transactions just last Friday, for example, the day after the Dow's 513-point plunge, the ratio stood at an extraordinarily bullish 0.33-to-1.
To be sure, you should never throw caution to the winds when following any one stock market indicator. After all, the insiders aren't always right. And even when they are, the market doesn't always respond as immediately as it did following their record level of selling in mid July.
Still, it is comforting that a group of investors who presumably know more about their companies' prospects that the rest of us consider the low prices of their stocks to represent attractive bargains.
(Newser) – December brought the news that Johns Hopkins University planned to attempt the first penis transplants in the US; now, the first candidate has been selected. An American soldier wounded in an explosion in Afghanistan will be the first person in the US, and the third in the world, to undergo a penis transplant. The first was in China in 2006, though the patient was so disturbed by the donated organ that he asked for it to be removed, while the second, in South Africa in 2014, was so successful the man fathered a child. Reuters reports the unnamed American patient sustained significant groin injuries and lost the majority of his penis in the explosion. The transplant could happen within a few weeks, pending the availability of a donor organ that fits the necessary age (within five to 10 years of the recipient) and skin color parameters.
The Washington Post looks at the donation part of the equation, noting that the Johns Hopkins team has voiced worries that some individuals may shy away from becoming an organ donor over the thought of losing his penis after death. A Johns Hopkins Q&A on the transplant clarifies that "many people might think that organ donation means unquestioned consent for donation of all organs. That's not the case with the face, hand, or penis"; the consent of the deceased's family is required in those cases. Johns Hopkins is currently looking only at US servicemen as potential transplant candidates, with more than 60 identified as possibilities, per the Post.

Story highlights Rachel Hope suffered for years with PTSD before looking into an experimental treatment
Using Ecstasy, "My whole brain was powered up like a Christmas tree," she says
There are skeptics who question the need for MDMA as a treatment for the disorder
Researchers say more study is needed before calling MDMA a proven treatment
When Rachel Hope picked up the phone in 2005 to call Dr. Michael Mithoefer, she didn't have high hopes.
"I had very low expectations," said Hope, who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder for years before investigating whether the drug Ecstasy might be able to free her from her torment. Her PTSD was traced to a period of sexual abuse as a child and a life-threatening car accident.
In the initial 45-minute conversation, Mithoefer determined that Hope didn't have other serious psychological problems. He agreed to fly her to South Carolina to take part in his study of the experimental therapy. There, she underwent more psychological testing and a physical exam. There were standard therapy sessions, so Mithoefer could understand Hope's past and her symptoms. Finally, she was ready.
Light streamed through the skylight as Hope lay back on a futon in Mithoefer's office, in the rear of a small bungalow.
On either side sat Mithoefer and his wife, Annie, a nurse.
Annie put in a CD and music started playing. As Hope placed a capsule on her tongue, they began to talk. Thirty minutes later, she began to feel deflated. Even though she had no experience with drugs, she knew: she'd been given a placebo.
True to their protocol, the Mithoefers continued the therapy, as if Hope were under the influence of MDMA. Said Hope, "We went through the process, but by the end, I'm like, 'I'm not different.'"

A week later, Mithoefer called back. He had permission to conduct MDMA sessions with test subjects who'd previously received the placebo. Would Hope like to fly back to South Carolina?
And so once again, Hope found herself on the futon, the light streaming, the music playing, the capsule on the tongue. This time, everything changed.
"It was like my whole brain was powered up like a Christmas tree, all at once," recalled Hope.
Listening to audiotapes, it isn't obvious what's happening. The conversation is fractured. But something was going on inside Hope's brain.
"Somehow, I became aware of the hardwiring decisions that my brain had made to explain why all these traumatic things happened to me, and what they meant to me about being a woman, a child living in the world, about sex, about violence," she said. "What the medicine did, it brought everything up for question."
Mithoefer said he lets patients drive the direction of the session. Typically, they alternate between talking and stretches of pure introspection. The trauma, he said, "always seems to come up."
"It's not that people just have a blissed-out experience and feel great about the world," he cautioned. "A lot of the time it's revisiting the trauma, and it's a painful, difficult experience. But the MDMA seems to make it possible for them to do it effectively."
Hope said it certainly worked for her. She estimates that 80% of her symptoms disappeared after that first MDMA-assisted session. "It allowed me to rewire my brain," she said. Another 10% of her symptoms went away over the next few weeks, she said.
According to results published last month in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, the effect was typical. Of 19 subjects in the study, more than two-thirds still showed significant improvement more than three years later -- what Mithoefer and colleagues describe as "meaningful sustained reductions" in their symptoms.
With PTSD, a common measure of severity is the so-called CAPS score, determined by answers on a detailed questionnaire. To be part of the study, patients needed a CAPS score above 50, which generally signifies moderate to severe symptoms. Hope rated a score of 86. At long-term followup, about three years after their final MDMA-aided session, only two people in the study had scores as high as 50. The CAPS score for Hope was 14.
One patient, who chose to stay anonymous, described a sense of new freedom: "I was always too frightened to look below the sadness. The MDMA and the support allowed me to pull off the controls, and I ... knew how and what and how fast or slow I needed, to see my pain."
"The question is whether this was just a flash in the plan, where people just feel good from taking a drug," said Mithoefer. "The answer to that turns out to be no, it really wasn't just a flash in the pan for most people."
For all the promise, however, 19 people is still a tiny study.
'Rebooting a computer'
Not surprisingly, there are skeptics. Dr. Edna Foa, who developed a widely used treatment for PTSD called prolonged exposure therapy, or PE, met with Mithoefer to review audiotapes of MDMA-assisted therapy. She walked away shaking her head.
"I was completely confused," Foa said. "They were all over the place. They didn't use evidence-based therapy, which would be CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy), PE or EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing). They were just kind of going with feeling. I don't know the rationale."
She was also jolted by the frequent hugs the Mithoefers gave patients at difficult points in the session. "It's very unusual," Foa chuckled. Foa said she never touches a patient "unless they ask for it. And then I hold their hand."
Mithoefer said the key feature of his approach is that it's "nondirective," in that what happens during the session is determined primarily by the individual's own process and needs. He said he often includes elements of other types of therapy -- including PE and CBT -- but that it depends on the patient's response.
Even those who see promise in MDMA-assisted treatment aren't sure how it works. "It's not well understood by any means," said Mithoefer. "We think it gives people this window of time in which they can process things without being overwhelmed by emotion, but also not being numbed up."
He said brain imaging studies, while crude, support the theory that MDMA alters hard-wired connections between conscious thought and emotional reactions -- or overreactions.
"We do know that MDMA decreases activity in the left amygdala, and increases it in the prefrontal cortex" -- brain areas associated with emotion and higher thinking, respectively, he said.
David Nichols, a professor of pharmacology at Purdue University, said no one really knows why MDMA, as well as drugs like LSD and psilocybin, have such a profound effect on the brain.
"I liken it to rebooting a computer," he said. "But when it comes to things that change the fundamental structure of personality and consciousness, and changes who you are, we don't really understand that."
Nichols warned against a simple explanation. "You could talk about neurotransmitters, but that's really superficial. (MDMA) releases serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine. It activates other hormones. But what does that all mean?"
'Why do we need this MDMA?'
Uncertainty is easier to take if you think there's no other option, and Foa argued it's a misperception that existing treatments are ineffective.
A recent study by psychiatrists at the National Center for PTSD tracked 171 patients who received either PE or CBT therapy. After 10 years, fully 80% still enjoyed milder symptoms. However, about one in four of those treated could not be found for followup.
"With PE, you get about 40-50% (cured) of PTSD, and you get about 80% getting improvement," said Foa. "So we have good treatments, that have no side effects. The question is, why? Why do we need this MDMA?"
Foa also cites concerns about neurotoxicity, although a 2011 study by Harvard psychiatrist Dr. John Halpern found that occasional MDMA use produced no cognitive damage.
Dr. Julie Holland, a psychiatrist who is overseeing the safety of an MDMA study Mithoefer is now conducting on veterans, said most risk is eliminated by the controlled nature of the experience.
For casual Ecstasy users, said Holland, "The biggest risk is not knowing what they're taking." Apart from being illegal, the street drug is often contaminated with other substances. Holland added that, "The next big one (risk) is heatstroke, if you get out and dance for six hours."
"The third biggest risk is overhydration," she explained. People are taught to stay hydrated, but MDMA causes the body to retain water. Combined with the drug's disorienting effects, this can lead users to overdrink, to a condition known as hyponatremia, a dangerously low concentration of sodium in the blood. "This is the main reason MDMA users die," said Holland, "from drinking too much water."
In a controlled setting, said Holland, "You get an incrementally higher heart rate, higher blood pressure and body temperature, but there isn't real danger as long as you're moderately healthy."
'Real people are paying the price'
Additional studies using MDMA against PTSD either have been completed, are planned or are under way in Colorado, Canada, Spain, Switzerland, Israel, Australia and Great Britain. Meanwhile, Mithoefer is conducting a study treating military veterans and firefighters; so far 11 people have enrolled and more than 280 have called to see if they might take part.
While the military and Department of Veterans Affairs have expanded services in recent years, they struggle to keep pace with the inflow of new patients. The number of active-duty military personnel seeking treatment for PTSD rose from 10,408 in 2002 to 281,468 last year, according to Cynthia Smith, a Department of Defense spokeswoman.
One reason MDMA seems tempting is the sense that existing treatments are not enough. "It's not like we don't have effective treatments for PTSD," said Dr. Boadie Dunlop, director of the Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program at Emory University. "But there are many people for whom these therapies don't work."
Retired Brig. Gen. Loree Sutton, who headed the DOD's Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury from 2007 to 2010, said she left the Army in part because she felt existing treatments often do more harm than good.
"We invested in conventional approaches towards research, but I also knew we had to go beyond that," said Sutton. "Real people are paying the price for our failure to harness knowledge."
The National Center for PTSD, a branch of the VA, says approved treatments include a type of antidepressant known as SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), along with EMDR, CBT and PE, developed by Foa. In some studies, more than three-quarters of those who complete PE therapy are "cured." But success can be hard to evaluate, in part because treatment is too emotionally painful for many patients to complete.
The DOD and VA also support a variety of research, much of it to try to fine-tune existing approaches. For example, Foa is leading a study offering more sessions in a shorter amount of time -- twice weekly -- to soldiers at Fort Hood, Texas. About 360 people are expected to enroll.
Neither the VA nor the military is part of clinical MDMA research, but Sutton said that before leaving the Army, she did call Rick Doblin to encourage his work. Doblin is the founder of MAPS, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, which wants to turn mind-altering drugs like Ecstasy into prescription medicine.
"With MDMA -- Ecstasy -- if rigorously designed studies show there's a benefit, better than existing therapies, then we should use it," Sutton said.
Doblin said he's working with the Defense Department to develop a protocol involving active-duty troops, and said he would gladly give up his status as the prime backer of MDMA research: "If there are other people who have a better idea, or want to try it with cognitive behavioral therapy, or whatever -- if there are other people trying to fund MDMA research, we think that would be great." With a laugh, he added, "We could even provide them with free MDMA. We have a lot more than we need."
Encouraging signs
Hope no longer has flashbacks or night terrors, and she no longer jumps when the phone rings. After finishing with Mithoefer, she decided to abandon her quiet life on Maui and moved to Los Angeles.
In 2008 she felt strong enough to have a second child. "That's another part of the gift of MDMA," she said recently. "Before those sessions, I just couldn't get it together, to expand my family the way I wanted to."
Crowds no longer faze her. In fact, she spent two months this fall as a full-time climate-change protester, doing street theater in a polar bear hat in front of hostile crowds at presidential debates and similar events.
"It gets pretty intense," she said. "It's something I couldn't have done, before the treatment."
Grateful as she is for Mithoefer's study, she feels as strongly as ever about avoiding recreational drug use. "I have a very, very serious respect for that medicine. You really don't want anybody to do this without professional supervision. It could open portals, in a way that could really damage you."
Chatting in his office, where books about shamanism sit side by side with standard psychology texts, Mithoefer remained cautious.
"I think at this point, what we know is that MDMA can be administered safely to people with PTSD, to the right people in the right setting with the right screening. It shows very encouraging signs of being effective, you know, but the numbers are too small to say we can definitively prove that."
Google's Autocomplete feature was born with the purpose of making search a little bit faster, and maybe a little bit more fun. Type in a few words or even just a character or two, and Google will suggest the most common completions of that query. Sure, it can save you a few keystrokes when you're looking for the name of that nearby burrito shop. But isn't the real point of this crowd-sourced sociological treasure trove to discover what weird and wonderful things people are searching for?
This article is the first in our Searching Canada series where we explore public search data to understand what Canadians really think about their country, their city, and themselves. Today, we tackle the question of what baffles Canadians most about their provinces and cities, by offering Google the prompt “Why does [place name]” and seeing what Autocomplete tells us most users type next.
So what vexes Canadians most about their provinces and cities? For many places, it's the weather and local geological phenomena (Alberta, PEI, Yukon); for others, it's the fear of separation (Quebec, Newfoundland and Northwest Territories); and still others, it's the sometimes bizarre quirks of a place that can befuddle even long-time residents (Saskatchewan and Ontario).
Weather and Geology
Canada is rightly known for its magnificent physical beauty, vast territory and remarkable climate diversity, and Canadians are hitting their keyboards to better understand the natural mysteries of their land. For instance, Canadians are curious why Alberta (“have so much oil”) possesses the giant (and environmentally controversial) oil sands in the northeast of the province, and why the Yukon (“have gold”) contained a wealth so vast that it triggered the Klondike Gold Rush at the end of the 19th century. Prince Edward Island (“have red sand”) is home to the signature red-tinted beaches – caused by the high iron-oxide content in the sandstone bedrock – while Manitoba (“flood”) is burdened with surge-prone rivers like the Assiniboine near Brandon and the Red River near Winnipeg.
Some Canadian cities are known for their weather quirks, too. Easterners likely wonder why Vancouver (“have mild winters”) is blessed with pleasant temperatures all year round, while everyone outside Alberta is trying to figure out what those unique warm winter winds in Calgary (“get chinooks”) are all about. Most of Canada is not particularly known for its seismic activity, so searchers are often curious why Ottawa (“get earthquakes”) tends to experience moderate tremors (like the 5.0 quake in 2010) from time to time.
Separation
It is perhaps no surprise that searches about Quebec (“want independence”) focus on the province's decades-long quest to separate from Canada. But apparently Canadians are also looking to Google to understand whether Newfoundland (“want to separate”) has an independence movement of its own. The Northwest Territories (“split”) is a big place, but we all know that it used to be bigger. On April 1, 1999, the territory of Nunavut was carved off of its eastern half; many Canadians are apparently still trying to figure out why.
The Oddities
Most Canadian provinces celebrate a statutory holiday called Family Day, occurring on the 3rd Monday of February. British Columbia (“have a different Family Day”) decided to forge its own path by celebrating it instead on the 2nd Monday of February. Canadian searchers are rightly scratching their heads about that one.
In another stumper, most of Saskatchewan (“not change time”) has decided to go it alone by sticking with Daylight Savings Time year round. While this strategy may offer the advantage of not needing to change clocks twice a year, things may get a little bit confusing if you find yourself traveling for a 9am appointment in the city of Lloydminster, the only place in Saskatchewan that does adjust its clocks.
Finally, Canadians use Google to gain insight into what is perhaps the deepest mystery of all: why Ontarians drink milk stored in bags rather than in cartons or jugs. This popular instructional video explains the complex mechanics (and accessories) required to simply pour yourself a glass.
Methodology
For most locations on our map, we simply used the first autocomplete suggestion after “Why does [place name]“. However, in a few cases, we picked an autocompletion from further down the list if it was particularly unique or representative of that place, and also substituted common contractions (like BC for British Columbia) to solicit more representative completions. Note that for New Brunswick and Northwest Territories, autocomplete changes the search term does to did on its own, and so suggests a historical event.
All of our searches were conducted on www.google.ca, but note that Autocomplete can vary by place and time, so not all of our results may be reproducible where (and when) you are.
A number of the world's top architects have jointly-condemned the Prince of Wales for using ‘his privileged position' to intervene in the design process for the Richard Rogers Chelsea Barracks scheme in London
In a letter to the Sunday Times, the architects, who include five winners of the Pritzker prize including Zaha Hadid, Norman Foster and Frank Gehry, criticise the Prince of Wales for trying to interfere with the democratic process by using his royal connections to stop modernist plans for the site.
It is also signed by Ricky Burdett, David Adjaye, Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron and Renzo Piano.
The letter states: ‘It is essential in a modern democracy that private comments and behind-the-scenes lobbying by the prince should not be used to skew the course of an open and democratic planning process that is under way.'
The architects were moved to write the letter following reports that Prince Charles had written privately to Qatari Diyar – the development arm of the Qatar government and owners of the site. In the letter he is understood to recommend alternative plans by the classicist architect Quinlan Terry.
According to the Sunday Times, Prince Charles has already been successful in persuading the developer to consider having more traditional brick and stone buildings for the development, as opposed to the emphasis on glass and steel proposed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners planned.
Following our visit to the Volkswagen brand museum in Wolfsburg, Germany, we trekked over to Autostadt in the center of the city to visit the museum there. Autostadt (a name that literally translates to “car city” in German) is a Volkswagen-themed visitor attraction that houses a museum, a pavilion for the SEAT, Škoda, Audi and Volkswagen brands, a swank hotel, several restaurants and the world-famous car towers, among other features.
While the aforementioned Volkswagen museum is like walking through a book that goes into precise details about the German automaker's history, Autostadt is more like a coffee table book that showcases the 100 greatest auto designs. Jaguar E-Type? Present. Bugatti Veyron. Yep. Citroën DS, Lamborghini Countach, DeLorean DMC-12 and a Porsche 356? Check, check, check and check.
Overall, the museum puts an unabashed focus on cars built by automakers that belong to Volkswagen but there are some unexpected vehicles like a Lincoln Zephyr, a Lancia Lambda, a Citroën 2CV and a Honda S600. Volkswagen has not forgotten the darker periods of its history and a small section of the museum pays homage to Felix Wankel's rotary engine with a NSU Ro80, an exceedingly rare Citroën M35 and a Van Veen OCR 1000 motorcycle.
Karmann GF, the German Manx
Our favorite car in the museum was the Karmann GF, a Manx-like buggy designed by German car magazine Gute Fahrt and assembled by coachbuilder Karmann using a modified Beetle chassis and a carbon fiber tub. The GF was launched in 1971 with a 1.5-liter 44-horsepower engine to public acclaim but production ended shortly after because of then-new safety regulations that came into effect throughout West Germany.
The GF was available as a kit that sold for 3,000 Deutsche Marks or fully-assembled for 8,000 Marks.
Offering an ever-changing collection of cars, the museum is often crowded – hardly a surprise considering it's in the heart of Wolfsburg's main tourist attraction – and lighting is not its strong point so we advise you to bring a tripod if you want to walk away with a decent set of photographs.
You'll find a gallery of photos from our visit to the museum below. If some of the pictures look blurry in the preview, click “view full size” on the bottom right of the preview to see a full, sharp image.

“Kill the bill! Don't kill me!” chanted protesters in the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, opposing passage of the controversial Senate health care reform bill. President Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress are intent on repealing the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare), even if their repeal bill is massively unpopular nationally, with only 17 percent approval based on a recent poll, and will reportedly leave tens of millions of Americans without health insurance. A new study predicts that stripping health insurance away from that many people will lead to 29,000 more Americans dying per year. So, when many of these protesters are begging their senators not to kill them, they are serious.
Dr. Steffie Woolhandler is a primary care physician and co-founder of Physicians for a National Health Program. Woolhandler, who also has been a fierce critic of the Affordable Care Act, co-authored the new study “The Relationship of Health Insurance and Mortality: Is Lack of Insurance Deadly?” published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. “We reviewed the world's scientific literature on the relationship between health insurance and mortality. There is really now a scientific consensus that being uninsured raises the death rates,” she told us on the Democracy Now! news hour.
As with climate change, Republican politicians tell us to ignore the science. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, was questioned at a town hall meeting last month about why he supports Medicaid cuts, which will lead to loss of insurance and, in some cases, death. He replied: “No one wants anybody to die ... that line is so indefensible. Nobody dies because they don't have access to health care.” Woolhandler responded: “Sen. Ted Cruz has said that. Marco Rubio has said that. Secretary Tom Price, the secretary of Health and Human Services, has implied that, that you can be uninsured and nothing happens. That's simply not true. The science is showing us that if you lack health insurance ... people die earlier as a result.”
Dr. Steffie Woolhandler is a supporter of single-payer health care, also called “Medicare for All,” after the immensely popular taxpayer funded program that covers all seniors age 65 or over and chronically disabled people. She explained how such a system would work:
You would get a Medicare card the day you're born, and have it your entire life. All medically necessary care would be covered by a tax-funded Medicare for All program. ... All that billing and insurance enrollment is extremely expensive in the United States, consuming 31 percent of total U.S. health spending, according to our research. By going to a simple single-payer system, you could save about half of it, about $500 billion a year, which you could use to get to universal health care and to remove co-payments and deductibles from people who now have them.
SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Help Keep Common Dreams Alive Our progressive news model only survives if those informed and inspired by this work support our efforts
Similar systems work well around the world. “Much of Western Europe has single-payer systems. They cover everyone. They live two years longer. They pay less for health care than we do,” Dr. Woolhandler said. “Being uninsured is bad for your health, it can cause deaths. Being fully covered for all medically necessary care, as would happen under Medicare for All, makes people healthier, and it prolongs their life.”
John Conyers, D-Mich., introduced H.R. 676, The Expanded & Improved Medicare for All Act. It has received an unprecedented number of co-sponsors, with 113 of his colleagues (all Democrats) signing on. Sen. Bernie Sanders is preparing a similar bill in the Senate, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren just told The Wall Street Journal, “Now it's time for the next step ... single payer.”
While protesters sitting-in at the Capitol, or in offices of Sens. Mitch McConnell, Cory Gardner and others, get mentioned on the news and dramatic footage of their sit-ins and arrests get some airtime, where are the protesters voices? Rarely are they invited into the studios to explain why they are willing to risk arrest. Instead, the networks turn to the same circle of pundits who know so little about so much, focusing only on the Democratic/Republican divide in Congress.
A new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that just 17 percent of people support the current Senate bill. Compare that with single-payer, which gets almost no attention in the media. The Pew Research Center released a report this week, stating that 33 percent of those polled now favor single-payer, up 12 percentage points from 2014.
We in the media should not be a party to the parties, and only present what they are presenting. We need a media that is the fourth estate, not for the state. We need to open the airwaves to include a diversity of voices, including those who are advocating for single-payer health care. It is, as Dr. Steffie Woolhandler and her colleagues have shown, a matter of life and death.
Afghan Elections for Another Fake Regime
By Eric Margolis April 06, 2014 " Information Clearing House - Afghanistan's national election held this week is a sham. A group of candidates, handpicked by the US, will pretend to compete in an election whose outcome has already been determined – by Washington. The candidates include US groomed politicians, and drug-dealing warlords from the Tajik and Uzbek north. Chief among them, Rashid Dostam, a major war criminal and principal CIA ally who ordered the massacre of over 2,000 Taliban prisoners. Such is the rotten foundation on which Washington is hoping to build a compliant Afghan “democracy” that will continue to offer bases to US troops and warplanes. Afghanistan's majority, the Pashtun tribes, have little voice in the election charade. The largest, most popular party in Afghanistan, Taliban, and its smaller ally, Hisbi-Islami, have been excluded as “terrorists” from the current and past elections. They are boycotting the vote, rightly claiming it will be rigged and run by the western powers and their local collaborators. We see this same pattern of faux democracy across the Mideast. If an open vote was held today, Taliban would probably win. Americans have no problem it seems working with Afghan Communists, war criminals, and drug kingpins. In fact, under American rule, opium, morphine and heroin production in Afghanistan has surged to all-time record highs. This is called “nation-building.” After 12 years of using everything in its arsenal short of nuclear weapons, the mighty US military has failed to defeat lightly-armed Taliban forces. The Pashtun tribes are almost certain to keep on fighting indefinitely. A favorite Taliban saying: “the Americans have watches; we have time.” The Pashtun defeated four British attempts to colonize Afghanistan, the Soviet effort in the 1980's, and now the US occupation. Afghanistan has proved the longest war in America's history. As US troops and heavy bombers attacked Taliban position, I wrote in the Los Angeles Times and other newspapers that invading Afghanistan was a terrible mistake, a war that would not be won. Not surprisingly, I was widely denounced. My column of 26-years was blacklisted by a major newspaper chain after I dared to say the war was lost and a waste of blood and money. I knew this having been in the field with the Afghan mujahidin during the 1980's Great Jihad (holy war) against Afghanistan's Soviet occupiers – recounted in my “War at the Top of the World.” A few years later, I was present at the birth of Taliban. The Pashtun movement arose during the early 1990's Afghan civil war to fight the mass rape of Afghan women, and combat foreign-backed Afghan Tajik and Uzbek Communists. Washington's current plan is to install a new, post-Karzai Afghan client regime in Kabul, and keep control of the 400,000-man Afghan police and army who fight for US dollars. The tame Afghan regime will then “invite” some 16,000 US soldiers and airmen, plus large numbers of tribal mercenaries, to stay on and keep Taliban at bay. The key to ongoing US control of Afghanistan is airbases at Bagram, Kandahar, Herat, and Shindand, supported by bases in Central Asia, Pakistan and the Gulf. The US and its allies could not retain their bases across Afghanistan without mounting hugely expensive 24-hour combat air patrols that respond within minutes to any Taliban attacks. Without constant resupply and support from the air, western forces would be quickly cut off and defeated. This is one big reason why the war in Afghanistan has so far cost the US $1 trillion dollars. Billions have disappeared due to massive corruption. Without a steady stream of US dollars, the Afghan regime in Kabul would collapse. Pakistan has been paid over $18 billion since 2001 to fight its own Taliban and allow US military operations. Meanwhile, President Barack Obama's efforts to cut US occupation forces in Afghanistan are being openly and brazenly challenged by his own insubordinate military commanders who cannot face admitting defeat at the hands of Taliban – the ultimate humiliation for the high-tech US forces. But now that China and Russia have challenged the US, the Pentagon has found a new foe and reasons for ever-bigger budgets. So it may reluctantly abandon the Afghan misadventure. After all, who remembers the Vietnam War and the disgraceful flight from Saigon? Eric S. Margolis is an award-winning, internationally syndicated columnist.

As many of you all know, I recently moved to New York. I seem to come back to this city over and over again, this being maybe like my fourth time back. New York is a transitory city, people always move in and move out, therefore each experience here is unique.
The downside is that I usually have to start over, building a network of people before getting somewhere. Oh well. I keep hearing this kind of catch-phrase with people living here that you shouldn't “try too hard” or be “over eager” when finding friends or looking for work. Apparently this is annoying.
And what a Catch-22. You're in a new place – you WANT friends, you WANT a job. It's natural to want to try too hard to attain both.
“Eager ick” no no, NY don't heart over-eager. It is considered emphatically icky (“EAGER ICK!”) to LONG FOR things in this city and show it.
I'd like to create a space here for you to LONG FOR things, to want a good life for yourself.. But also remind you (“EAGER ICK”) not to over water your plants, so to speak. Long for your things, create a space to feel into your heart's desires, let them go, and see comes back around. Easier said than done.
With love, Ambar x

Prime Minister Naoto Kan has survived a bitter challenge to his leadership from political heavyweight Ichiro Ozawa, who questioned Kan's backpedalling on manifesto promises. In winning the poll for presidency of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan, Kan has managed to stop the revolving door of the Japanese prime minister's office, for the time being at least.
Kan must now tackle the issue of how to reunite a party that has been deeply divided over which direction it should take barely 12 months after sweeping to power in last year's general election.
Kan was announced the winner of Tuesday's party presidential vote at 3:40 pm. He garnered 721 votes compared with Ozawa's 491, winning a larger than expected share of the total. As predicted by media surveys, Kan won an overwhelming majority of support among party staff and supporters, but he also unexpectedly beat Ozawa 206-200 in the vote among DPJ parliamentarians, which counted double and for about two-thirds of the overall result.
While this means Kan has done better than expected and will be able to say he has majority support from all sectors of the party, he still must find a way to heal the open wounds of a divided party. Attention will therefore focus on what role, if any, he offers Ozawa and his supporters in the interests of party unity.
Of the DPJ's Diet members who had yet to make up their minds over who to vote for in the ballot, it seems most of them opted for Kan. The influence of several opinion polls suggesting the vast majority of the public were in favor of Kan over Ozawa must have been one factor in shaping their final decisions. Ozawa has yet to shake off a politics and money scandal that has seen three aides indicted, and cleaning up the party was one of Kan's original goals in taking over from Yukio Hatoyama in June.
Not surprisingly, Kan was keen to play up this clean-and-trustworthy card in his final speech delivered to a meeting of the DPJ's Diet members immediately before the vote. He also stressed that one person or one small group of people could not take full political responsibility for leading the nation, saying that his administration would have ‘a cabinet of 411,' referring to the number of DPJ Diet members. Everyone's voice should be heard and this was the kind of democracy the DPJ should stand for, Kan stressed, a less than disguised attack on Ozawa's autocratic style.
For his part, Ozawa talked of his long-held dream of transforming the nature of Japanese politics and taking the power away from bureaucrats and giving it back to the people. Politicians had to make decisions, not leave policymaking to the bureaucrats, a practice he said was typical of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party. This change had to take place now, Ozawa said, before it was too late, thereby suggesting that under Kan the DPJ was not much better in this respect than the LDP. But while much of the content of Ozawa's speech seemed to tally more with the original goals of last year's general election campaign than Kan's, his voice wavered at times and his historical references to the 19th century Meiji Restoration seemed dated compared with the imagery of Kan's speech.
All the same, those recent opinion polls that showed public support for Kan over Ozawa, also indicate that even members of the public believe Ozawa has more of an ability to get things done than Kan, even if they don't want him as their prime minister. So the question now is, what if anything will Kan ask Ozawa to do?
A Virginia infertility clinic sparked an international ethical controversy Wednesday by sponsoring a seminar in London that gave away an attempt to get pregnant using an American woman's eggs.
More than 100 people attended the 90-minute session at the Millennium Gloucester Hotel, which was organized by the Fairfax City-based Genetics & IVF Institute, one of the United States' largest infertility clinics. As organizers had promised, one of the attendees learned at the end of the seminar that she had won a free cycle of in vitro fertilization using the eggs of a woman from the Washington area, worth about $23,000.
The seminar, designed to entice infertile British women to seek donor eggs in the United States, drew intense criticism from infertility experts, bioethicists and others in Britain and the United States, who likened the event to a crass, commercial come-on similar to a lottery, with the prize being a human body part.
"We strongly have the view that using a raffle to determine who will receive treatment with donor eggs is inappropriate," said a spokesman for the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority, which regulates infertility care in Britain. "It trivializes altruistic donation, whether of eggs, sperm or embryos."
Officials with the Fairfax clinic defended the seminar, which they said was encouraged to take this approach by advocates for infertility patients and has been used widely in the United States to educate women about their options.
"The idea that we are raffling off an egg is just not the case," said Harvey J. Stern, director of reproductive genetics at the Fairfax clinic. "That's just sensationalist. The offer of a free treatment cycle or package of treatment is not an unusual technique. This is just a niche we saw to offer this service."
The recipient of the free IVF cycle would undergo the procedure at the Fairfax clinic.
Infertility clinics in the United States have long paid women thousands of dollars to provide eggs for those who are unable to get pregnant.
Egg donors receive weeks of hormone injections to stimulate their ovaries into producing multiple eggs and then undergo a painful procedure to extract them. The process can in rare cases cause a dangerous over-stimulation of the ovaries, and there are concerns about the long-term risks of hormonal stimulation.
The donated eggs are mixed in a laboratory with sperm from the recipient's husband or a donor and grown into embryos, which are transferred into the recipient's womb to develop naturally.
European countries, including Britain, prohibit payment for eggs and limit the amount of money a donor can receive to a small amount to cover minor expenses. The result is that eggs are much more difficult to obtain in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, leading increasing numbers of women to travel to the United States.
"This is just about patients trying to get access to treatment they need," said Sean Tipton, a spokesman for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. "If they can win a contest that is going to allow them to build their families, and a physician is going to offer a service that can help them do that, then we applaud them."

This is the hub of the Veolia World Solar Challenge 2011, a place where you can track your favourite team, see what the rest of the field is up to and track progress as the solar vehicles travel 3021 kilometres from Darwin in the North of Australia, to Adelaide in the South.
The maps show tracker locations as they're reported, which sometimes means that there is a delay between where the tracker last reported a vehicle and where the actual location on the road is. Australia is a huge country and there is limited mobile phone coverage along the route, so our trackers use satellites to communicate back to base. Sometimes a mountain, a tree or a person is in the way and the signal doesn't get through immediately.

Lucky's Teriyaki is apologizing and offering free meals to officers after word spread that the Skagit County restaurant didn't want law enforcement to dine there.
SEDRO-WOOLLEY — Lucky's Teriyaki is apologizing and offering free meals to law-enforcement officers after word spread that the Skagit County restaurant didn't want law enforcement to dine there.
Law-enforcement members will get free meals Monday at the restaurant, which is about 70 miles north of Seattle.
A Facebook post Thursday afternoon by Skagit County Sheriff Will Reichardt led to a social media storm that continued into the night.
Reichardt wrote on the official Sheriff's Office page that when four deputies finished lunch at a Sedro-Woolley restaurant, they were told customers didn't like law enforcement officers being there.
“I am not often speechless but today I was advised of an incident at the Lucky Teriyaki restaurant in Sedro-Woolley that completely took me by surprise,” Reichardt wrote, adding that the chief deputy later called the owner to verify the request and was told to spread the word among law-enforcement agencies that officers were not welcome.
The owner's son says it was a misunderstanding. The Sheriff's Office Facebook page had an update Friday encouraging people to eat there, saying the owner and his son “expressed their desire to accept everyone to their business, including law enforcement officers associated with all offices and departments.”
But it will be hard to, as the mayor of Sedro-Woolley put it, “unfire that bullet.”
The reaction to the sheriff's initial post was swift, with hundreds of shares and comments in the first 30 minutes and more than 17,000 shares and thousands of comments over the next several hours.
Most commenters vowed a boycott over the restaurant discriminating against law enforcement, though some called out Reichardt for using the official Sheriff's Office Facebook page to air a grievance with a private business.
Reichardt said the Sheriff's Office shared the message with other law enforcement agencies through private emails and internal communications. But he also posted the statement on Facebook and told the Skagit Valley Herald that it was because “we also thought it's something that the public would want to know and weigh in on.”
“I'm kind of just flabbergasted that a business would take this position with officers that have been eating there for years,” he told the Herald.
Within hours of Reichardt's post, a “Boycott Lucky Teriyaki” page was also created.
Reichardt said he did not intend for the statement to provoke members of the public to strike back at the business, either through online comments or threats of violence.
“It certainly was not any of my intent to generate some sort of violence. Could that happen? I suppose it could. I would feel bad if someone took it to that extreme, not only feel bad but we would go and arrest them,” he said.
He said he was sure that regardless of the restaurant's feelings toward law enforcement, officers would always respond to any emergency situation.
A couple of hours after the post was made, the father and son who run the business visited the Sedro-Woolley Police Department and spoke with Sedro-Woolley Police Chief Lin Tucker.
They had hoped to meet with Reichardt as well, said Sedro-Woolley Mayor Keith Wagoner. At the police station, the father needed his son to translate for him.
Wagoner said he believes the son at Lucky Teriyaki made the comments about officers without the father's consent.
“I don't want to see damage done to (anybody's business), but once you utter something like that, it's hard to take back,” Wagoner said.
As the social media furor grew along with calls for a boycott, some questioned why the sheriff felt the need to publicize the issue on the internet.
“Did you get what you wanted by calling them out on Facebook,” one commenter wrote. “Seems you would be above bullying a privately owned business online. You are supposed to be the example, not sinking to their lows. Doesn't seem to be any response from your office about the comments inferring you wouldn't be there to protect their business if it were in danger. They still pay their taxes, and hence your salary.”
Another said: “WHY would Sheriff Reichardt make this a public issue? What is his motive? Drive a business out of town? Is that his job?”
Similar comments drew hundreds of “likes.” But the outrage against the business led the discussions.
”We have the best of the best here in Skagit County and never never should be treated like this. Love all you guys,” commented former Skagit County Commissioner Sharon Dillon.
“DONT CALL THE COPS WHEN U GET ROBBED !!!,” said another, to which the Sheriff's Office responded “Please do. It is our job to keep our community safe.”
Jared Couch, president of the Fraternal Order of Police for Island and Skagit counties, said he supports Reichardt's decision to make the Facebook post.
“It wasn't an attack; he stated the facts,” Couch said. “He didn't draw to any conclusion. I think it's something that, with the current environment we're in, I think it's something people want to know. What is the real reason you don't want law enforcement in your establishment? We saw the other night, we have an outstanding support for our law enforcement.”
Chief Criminal Deputy Tom Molitor said the Sheriff's Office monitors comments left on its Facebook page and deletes and investigates any comments that are considered threatening or criminal in nature.
Neither official thought the community would retaliate against the business with violence.
“Most people are bigger than that,” Wagoner said.
Still, Wagoner said, having the conflict shared on Facebook will likely be bad for the business.
“I'm sad because I want to see all my businesses succeed. And I want to see my police supported,” he said. “(The employee) couldn't have picked a worse week to do this.”
Sedro-Woolley Chamber of Commerce President Pola Kelly likened it to business suicide.
“Certainly, other people are going to boycott them because of it,” Kelly said. “My feeling on it is that we have a really good police force in Sedro-Woolley.”
County Commissioner Lisa Janicki expressed support for law enforcement, calling the event a sad state of affairs. She would not, however, speak to Reichardt's decision to post.
“I support what law enforcement has to do,” she said. “I just think it's unfortunate that that feeling isn't shared across (our) community.”
Comments on the sheriff's follow-up post were similarly mixed:
“They only took it back because they want the business,” wrote one commenter.
“Your attempts to destroy this business and claim you were ‘just getting the information out' makes me very uneasy about your judgement,” wrote another. “… The power we give you must be used in a much better manner than this. I am disappointed.”
The Church of Scientology has launched a deeply creepy advertising campaign. They're buying spots on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360, and seem to have stolen the ad playbook from their arch-enemies in the pharmaceutical industry.
The ad—it's new to us, though we're not sure how long it's been in circulation—is awash in blue tones and features assorted lost souls struggling with an "unexplainable emptiness that can only be filled by one thing—the truth." It looks exactly like an ad for one of the anti-depressants that Scientologists regard as tools of a fascist psychiatric regime. Except at the end, you don't get a pitch for Paxil, you get a glowing Scientology logo directing you to the group's web site. (For comparison, see this old Effexor ad.)
And it's been working: According to the rough stat guide of Alexa.com, the reach of Scientology.org has seen a bump in the past month.
Traffic aside, the ad's real purpose is clearly branding: It's a slick, well-produced effort designed to position the church as a mainstream provider of spiritual answers and not a cult that relies on the slave labor of children. It's certainly miles ahead in that regard from Scientology's earlier efforts:

NEWS:
2/18 - The State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) has adopted requirements for commercial and personal medical use cannabis cultivation to reduce impacts from discharges of waste and water diversions. The State Water Board Cannabis Cultivation Regulatory Programs are now in effect and cannabis cultivators should apply online for the necessary water quality and water right permits.
The Cannabis Cultivation Policy includes requirements to reduce impacts from discharges of waste and water diversions associated with cannabis cultivation activities. The Policy is available at the Water Board's Cannabis Cultivation web page.
Cannabis cultivators must obtain coverage or waiver under one or both State Water Board cannabis cultivation regulatory programs. The Cannabis Small Irrigation Use Registration Program is an expedited way to obtain a water right for cannabis cultivation activities. Many cultivators will need to obtain a Small Irrigation Use Registration by April 1, 2018.
Most cultivators that have submitted Initial Statements of Diversion and Use or other water right forms to the State Water Board still need to file for a Small Irrigation Use Registration.

1/2/2018 - CDFA Now Accepting Applications for Annual Cannabis Cultivation Licenses
SACRAMENTO, January 2, 2018 – The California Department of Food and Agriculture's CalCannabis program has begun accepting applications for annual commercial licenses for cultivators, nurseries, and processors.
“After many months of preparation, California's licensing system for cannabis cultivators is open,” said CDFA's CalCannabis Director Richard Parrott. “The system allows applicants to begin the registration process now, even if they do not yet have all of their documentation ready.”
During this initial application period, the program is also accepting applications for temporary licenses that will allow firms to operate while the annual license applications are being processed. Temporary licenses issued by CDFA will be good for 120 days, with the possibility of extensions, if warranted.
The online licensing system can be accessed here. New users will be required to register for an account within the online licensing system prior to applying for a license.
Temporary licenses are only issued to applicants with a valid license, permit, or other authorization from their local jurisdiction.
CDFA's emergency regulations are now in effect and the final text can be found here.

Prop. 64 to legalize recreational use and cultivation of marijuana has brought over 50 localities (and probably more) passing or considering local regulations. Under Prop. 64, all Californians can grow up to 6 plants per parcel of land for their personal use. Local jurisdictions may ban outdoor cultivation, but may not ban growing 6 plants indoors or in a “secure” location (they can, however, "reasonably regulate" it). Patients with a doctor's recommendation can still grow more plants if needed, provided their local jurisdictions will allow it.
The Drug Policy Alliance and ACLU have teamed to file a legal challenge against the city of Fontana's overly restrictive personal cultivation ordinance. The OC Register writes, "At the very least, the lawsuit should cause other localities to think twice about onerous meddling in personal cultivation."
2/17/2016 - This page formerly listed ordinances that were in place before January 1, 2016. There are over 400 localities in California and many passed cultivation bans due to the erroneous and now-repealed March 1 deadline in the state MMRSA regulations.
Arguably these are “placeholder” ordinances retaining locals' right to license and regulate once MMRSA is fully implemented. We are working on strategies to challenge the bans, and encouraging local action to start the process of developing regulations instead.
You can find your local ordinance code by Googling the name of the city or county plus the word "code," going to a website that list your local codes, and then searching for marijuana or cannabis. However not all of the online listings are up to date and you should also check your city or county's council or board meeting agendas at their websites for the latest ordinances. Searching at the Facebook Ban Watch page is another way to find out what's happening in your city or county.
Absent a local ordinance, state law allows 6 plants on a parcel for recreational gardens (but local ordinances can drive those gardens indoors or put other "reasonable regulations" on them). For medical cannabis, the state allowance is 100 square feet of plant canopy for a patient, and caregivers can to grow 500 square feet for up to five patients. State licensing for commercial-sized medical marijuana farms is allowable under the new law, provided locals approve. Existing entities can operate with local approval until at least January 1, 2018.

Appeals Court Rules Marijuana Growers Can't Be Criminalized by Local Ordinances
The CA Board of Equalization has issued a special notice to growers and sellers of medical cannabis telling them that they are required to register and file returns. There is no charge for registering with the BOE. Note that growers do not have to pay sales taxes on products that they sell to retail dispensaries and collectives, provided the latter have a BOE resale permit. However, they are required to report their sales to the BOE. Cal NORML strongly advises all parties involved in the marijuana industry to register with the BOE if they are interested in becoming legal providers under California law.
The North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board has issued an order for cannabis cultivation and similar activities along with Best Management Practices.

On November 26, 2013, the Third District Court of Appeals upheld the city of Live Oak's ban on medical marijuana cultivation. California NORML supported a court challenge to the Live Oak ruling, but the California Supreme Court refused to hear the challenge.
Cities and counties across the state have moved to establish zoning regulations for medical cannabis cultivation. In many cases, these are driven by complaints from neighbors who don't like the sight or smell of marijuana, or by public officials with overly punitive attitudes. Public safety concerns have been raised, and there have been a few incidents of violence around marijuana gardens. While there may be a need in some cities to require greenhouses or other security measures for gardens, in rural areas and in whole counties, there is no justification for outlawing outdoor marijuana gardens. Any patient who is impacted by planned or existing local ordinances can write to CalNORML.
Also see California Association of Counties ordinance page.
Some doctors are charging clients extra for so-called "cultivation licenses" supposedly entitling them to grow more than the normal number of plants. There is no such thing as a "cultivation license" under California law. Any patient with a California physician's recommendation may legally cultivate or possess as much marijuana as they need for their own personal medical use, and no more. No physician can authorize them to cultivate more (they can only testify in court that a certain amount of marijuana is consistent with the individual patient's needs, and they do not have professional competence to prescribe plant numbers).

The base model of Apple's anticipated "iPhone 7" will share the same width and height as the iPhone 6s, but use different camera technology, a design schematic published on Monday suggests.
The graphic depicts the new phone's shell as measuring 67.12 millimeters wide and 138.3 millimeters high, said French site NWE, which obtained the image. Cutouts in the upper left are likewise similar to those of the iPhone 6s, except for the lens opening, hinting at a redesign of that component.Past reports have indicated that an "iPhone 7 Plus" might have a dual-lens camera , but that the regular model will have a conventional single-lens system, presumably as a way of encouraging people to step up to the more expensive Plus.Notably missing from the schematic is depth, although NWE said the new device will be "imperceptibly" thinner than the iPhone 6s, citing sources. Many rumors have claimed that Apple is eliminating the 3.5mm headphone jack to reduce thickness, but more recently a parts leak hinted that the jack could be left intact Indeed "iPhone 7" rumors have become heavily conflicted in general, with opposite views on whether the phone will be fully waterproof or use a Smart Connector . The product is at least expected to ship later this year, presumably in Apple's normal September iPhone window.
In Kim Stanley Robinson's novel “Red Mars,” the first human colonists to arrive on the red planet use bricks made of indigenous materials to construct their habitats, presenting a solution to what has, in recent years, become an intractable problem insofar as establishing extraterrestrial colonies is concerned. With recent advances in 3D-printing, the idea of using technology to utilize resources available on site as building material has shifted from the realm of science fiction to one that is being actively debated by international space agencies, including NASA.
“Shelter is among the most basic and crucial human needs, but packing enough materials and equipment to build a habitat on a distant planet would take up valuable cargo space that could be used for other life-sustaining provisions,” NASA said, in a statement released over the weekend, announcing the launch of a $2.25 million competition to design and build a 3D-printed habitat for space exploration.
The competition, which is part of the space agency's Centennial Challenges program, is divided into two phases. The first phase will award a $50,000 prize based on pure architectural merits, while the second one will give out two $1.1 million prizes for those who figure out how to manufacture individual components and habitats from “indigenous materials” or “indigenous materials combined with recyclables.”
Currently, it costs $10,000 to put a pound of payload in Earth orbit, making missions to establish colonies on Mars, or other planets for that matter, economically infeasible. This is where 3D printers that utilize the raw materials available on site to build lasting structures assume special importance. However, building a 3D printer that works reliably in the extreme Martian environment is also a challenge that is yet to be overcome.
“The future possibilities for 3D printing are inspiring, and the technology is extremely important to deep space exploration,” Sam Ortega, Centennial Challenges program manager, said, in the statement. “This challenge definitely raises the bar from what we are currently capable of, and we are excited to see what the maker community does with it.”
The competition is being held in collaboration with the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute, also known as America Makes, and is currently open for registration.
When pollsters field a survey, they randomly call (or contact online) a representative sample of the population they're studying. If you're looking at the entire United States, maybe that's 1,000 people. The magic of statistics means the researcher can be fairly confident, within a certain margin of error, that the opinions of that sample will match up with the population as a whole. If the sample is large enough—and 1,000 people almost always is—that margin of error will be minimal.
But if the pollster is particularly interested in a smaller subgroup—say, suburban housewives—they might run into trouble. What if they only contacted 50 suburban housewives during their random phone calls? That's a lot less than 1,000. The margin of error for their responses will be a great deal higher—making it harder to accurately predict what suburban housewives really think.
Oversampling is the solution. When pollsters launch a survey, they'll often try to interview more people from underrepresented groups so they'll end up with a large enough samples to draw real conclusions. Before they report the results, they'll rebalance the sample to bring it back in line with the overall demography of the population—negating the inflationary effect of the oversample.
Take the example in the screenshot above. If a campaign is particularly interested in how Hispanics will vote in Arizona, it might interview a bunch more than a random chance alone would offer, just to make sure the sample is large enough to reasonably draw conclusions about how the entire community feels. Hispanics, after all, are still a minority in the Grand Canyon State; a random sample of 1,000 people might only net 300 or so.
Perhaps they'll aim to interview 500 instead. But once the pollster shifts back to looking at the entire state, they will dial back the proportion of Hispanics in the survey to mirror the actual demographics of Arizona.
Oversampling is, in other words, a completely valid statistical practice that everyone uses, including Republicans pollsters and probably Trump's own campaign. If the polls are overestimating Clinton's lead, and Trump is headed for an upset win, it's not because of pollsters using oversampling to get more accurate results for demographic subgroups.
“If you wanted to just bias the poll, you wouldn't waste the extra money making all these extra calls—you'd try to manipulate it from the beginning,” said Jon McHenry, a Republican pollster. “This is an added expense to the pollster with the idea of getting more information about a certain subgroup, and weighting that back so you understand the overall as well.
“Sometimes,” he added wryly, “the polls say what they say because they're accurate.”
It's more common to complain about how pollsters weigh their surveys; The New York Times recently supplied four researchers with the same data and received five different results back, all because of differences in how the respondents were screened. Pollsters have different methods to determine whether a surveyed voter will actually cast a ballot, and that's usually behind complaints about a given poll being too Clinton- or Trump-friendly.
But oversampling? It's benign. The fact that a post detailing a media oversampling conspiracy has gotten more than 1 million pageviews says something about Trump supporters' fears of losing the election, but even more about America's statistical illiteracy.

Fear of missing out (FOMO) shouldn't be your rationale for making any investment. If you buy bitcoin today, you might be investing at a near peak, right before the descent begins — something professional investors call chasing performance.
Watch and Wait
Of course, you're not alone if you're feeling this temptation, since lots of retail investors make this mistake.
The smarter move would be to keep watching how bitcoin's value moves — wait for it to descend to what might look like a trough and maybe try to buy at that time.
What you'll see in the meantime might remind you of a rollercoaster, or perhaps something that goes up and down even faster than that.
Actually, volatility is part for the course with bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies — there are now hundreds of them in existence. There's an ironic chicken-and-egg aspect to this volatility: it limits the currencies' appeal to investors, but relative dearth of investors in the currency keeps it volatile.
That's not the only thing keeping it volatile, of course. Another very basic driver of the volatility has to do with the foundation of cryptocurrencies. Regulation of cryptocurrencies are a work in progress.
Like Options
The velocity that bitcoin moves at invokes comparisons with derivatives — like small-cap stock options. One of the reasons why the value can plunge so quickly has to do with the relatively small size of cryptocurrency markets compared to other asset classes.
This is actually challenging for even professional investors to move around in. They find it difficult to take on a large position in markets of these size: Any move into or out of the currency is noticed by the rest of the market and they typically also move in the same direction. This has the result of amplifying the momentum of an upward or downward movement in the exchange rate, intensifying the volatility.
All of this also makes cryptocurrencies challenging for novice investors to do anything other than perhaps try to make a long-term investment — or simply watch the market and learn from its development.
Don't Be Impulsive
Otherwise, if you rush into bitcoin trading with the attitude of a day trader — intending to move around a lot — you might get hurt, or at least get vertigo.
Investing in bitcoin is not without risk. And what goes up quickly can also go down quickly. Investment professionals often compare the stock market to a casino, and the comparison also seems relevant to bitcoin.
Just like there's no way to predict where a spin of the roulette wheel will end, it's impossible to time the market. Anyone who boasts that they can is either lying or destined to fall into the hands of regulators — although the regulators are still trying to reach an agreement on how they plan to handle cryptocurrencies.
Readers, have you tried your hand at bitcoin — or are you wishing you did?

Secretary of State John Kerry received the Legion of Honor in Paris on Saturday, where he warned in his acceptance speech of "dangerous currents of authoritarian populism."
"No part of the world remembers better what happens when difficult economies mix with sectarian exploitation with nationalism and fear," Kerry said. "We really need to be careful going forward and think hard about the choices that we face."
Kerry said the award, as "everybody in America is rekindling this personal sense of the relationship between us," underscores the special relationship between the United States and France.
"Together we have traveled this journey of peaceful pursuit of social progress, of continuing to try to respect the rights of man, to live an honest life in democracy where people really are respected and where we can do better, and most importantly where we live by rule of law. And we see the challenges for that in today's world," he said. "...We are pursuing diplomacy because the world needs the values that have been espoused by France and the United States since our inception and built on the experience of France."
Kerry reminisced on the P5+1 coming together to push through the nuclear agreement with Iran, noting that "in this complicated world" they "actually found a path forward and worked together and sort of sorted through difficult contradictions."
"...Trying to provide a better vision for people of what the choices are, is not highfalutin, it's not out of touch, it's not pie-in-the-sky. It's what defines both of our countries, and it's why we are who we are and it's why we are where we are. And so I believe very, very deeply that we need to maintain our fidelity to those values."
He asked those present to "not to be diminished by the crosscurrents that are flowing through the world today because I'm convinced – and I really believe this – I see the world – I see the glass as definitively half full, not half empty."
"And I say that because for the first time in history severe poverty is under the 10 percent mark on this planet. We are curing diseases we never thought we could cure. If you are a young person born in some deprived place in the world, you are more likely to be fed and more likely to go to school than at any time in human history. If you are a mother giving birth somewhere in the world, you are more likely not to die in the bringing to life than at any time in human history. We have food and food product, the capacity to grow," he continued. "But even as we do that – yeah, we've got climate change and all these other challenges – I am absolutely convinced that we know the choices we need to make. They're staring us in the face. There's no problem we face that doesn't have a solution. And this will continue to inspire me to stay at it and continue to work in whatever capacity I can."
Kerry also thanked Napoleon Bonaparte for creating the award, drawing laughs dignitaries in attendance.
A University of Illinois graduate instructor has been arrested for assaulting two conservative students at an anti-Tump protest this past Thursday, reports Campus Reform.
Tariq Khan is a 39 year old Fighting Illini PhD candidate with a keen interest in far left causes, including communist and anarchist groups. However, this past week it seems Tarqir took his school's mascot a little too seriously. He attacked two conservative students for simply making mocking comments.
Khan has taught students at the University of Illinois in courses such as “Constructing Race in America” and “U.S. Gender History since 1877.” This past week he was addressing students at an anti-Trump rally. However, his speech turned hostile towards conservative students, specifically the student organization Turning Point USA. In a video provided by Campus Reform, Khan be heard saying “F*ck Trump, F*ck Those Guys," referring to TPUSA.
Upon hearing these remarks Joel Valdez, an executive board member of TPUSA, yelled at Khan, “Don't you have anything better to do? Don't you have kids?”
Khan then gets down from his platform and runs up belligerently to Valdez and his colleagues. Khan attempts to punch one of the students and smashes another's cell phone.The video truly has to been seen to be believed.
Khan was subsequently arrested and issued a notice to appear in court for criminal damage to property.
Khan's actions are not that surprising. Plenty of campus leftwing loons in teaching positions have been fired or reprimanded for harassing and intimidating conservative students. But, the video really does show the threats some students, such as Valdez and TPUSA, have to endure in order to have free speech and productive conversations.
Of course, Khan probably justifies his actions as fighting against a supposedly white supremacist, capitalist, and patriarchal society.
In 2015 he wrote, "In the present-day United States, a shallow idea of “free speech” is often wielded by the privileged as a way to direct attention away from critiques of existing conditions and systems; particularly critiques of capitalism, imperialism, white supremacy, and patriarchy.”
Valdez for his part took to Twitter and called upon the University of Illinois to expel Khan.
Tariq Khan will face justice soon for what he did to my fellow TPUSA members and I. Now, it's time for @Illinois_Alma to speak up and expel this scumbag. https://t.co/Qhn424zKVw — Joel Valdez (@joel_valdez22) November 18, 2017
It is unclear what steps will be taken next.
Kevin Plank has, to put it mildly, a demanding day job. He is the founder and CEO of Under Armour, and, just 20 years after he was selling shirts out of his grandmother's basement, his company ranks as the eighth-fastest-growing firm in America, with 12,000 employees and projected revenues of nearly $5 billion this year. At this rate, it should end Baltimore's Fortune 500 drought within the next couple of years. In and of itself, that rags-to-riches story (and to be clear, we're talking sweat-wicking, microfiber rags) merits recognition. But in 2016, Mr. Plank showed what it means when an entrepreneur of his skill, daring and ambition focuses not just on his company but on his community. In ways large and small, this city and state will never be the same because of what he accomplished. He is The Baltimore Sun's 2016 Marylander of the Year.
Port Covington
For some time, it had been clear that Mr. Plank was quietly buying up hundreds of acres of underused parcels in Baltimore's Port Covington neighborhood, presumably for a new headquarters for Under Armour, which is bursting at the seams of its Tide Point complex. In retrospect, it should have been obvious that he would envision something grander than an office park or even a fancy corporate campus. What he had in mind was the single largest development Baltimore has seen in decades, if ever: a multibillion-dollar mix of offices, residences, retail, parks, boat launches, a light rail spur and a pedestrian bridge. (The area includes The Sun's printing facility, for which the paper has a long-term lease.) In scope, the Inner Harbor is tiny by comparison. Situated just off Interstate 95 on the southern edge of town, the Port Covington development will replace travelers' first impression of Baltimore — currently, the smokestack on a trash incinerator — with a gleaming new city of the future.
After a decade in which it seemed like every crane in the Mid-Atlantic was rising above Washington while Baltimore fought over scraps, Mr. Plank's vision for Port Covington represented a massive vote of confidence in Baltimore and its future. But that would prove not to be the most remarkable thing about it.
As with just about every large redevelopment proposal in Baltimore, this one came with a request for public assistance. Mr. Plank's Sagamore Development asked the city for more than a half-billion dollar in tax increment financing to build infrastructure, to be paid back over decades from the increased property taxes the development would generate. Such deals have come under increasing scrutiny in Baltimore in recent years, particularly as it has become clear that they have hurt the city when it comes to state aid for education.
Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank urged support for the Port Covington project and proposed investing more than $100 million in recreation centers, job training, schools and parks in a full-page ad Wednesday in The Baltimore Sun.

Sagamore officials conducted extensive outreach and struck Baltimore's largest-ever community benefits agreement with the neighborhoods around Port Covington, known as the South Baltimore Six. But that did little to mollify the anger among activists citywide who believed Baltimore was poised to approve a deal that would affect the whole city for decades with no meaningful commitments to help those residents most in need.
After tensions boiled over during a City Council work session in August, Sagamore sat down with representatives of Baltimoreans United for Leadership Development for an extraordinary period of negotiations that led to binding agreements on affordable housing, local hiring and job training the likes of which the city had never seen. Activists believe it set a standard against which all future subsidized development deals will be measured.
Mr. Plank wasn't at the negotiating table personally, but BUILD's clergy co-chair, the Rev. Glenna Huber, said his obvious commitment to Baltimore empowered BUILD to push harder for a transformational agreement without fear that he would pull up stakes and walk away from the city. "His team told us he was committed to Baltimore and was committed to doing what was right," she said.
Baltimore's chief entrepreneur
Pivotal though the Port Covington agreement was, it was by no means Mr. Plank's only significant achievement of 2016 when it comes to building a stronger Baltimore. He committed to bring a 1,000-job Under Armour e-commerce distribution facility to the Sparrows Point redevelopment. He started manufacturing rye whiskey in South Baltimore. His development company transformed the Recreation Pier in Fells Point into a luxury hotel, which is due to open in 2017. One of the horses from his Sagamore Farm even won a race at Pimlico on Preakness Day — the Old Bay Race, no less.
"He always pushes to make Baltimore the best it can be and tries to push people to see what Baltimore's potential is," said Donald C. Fry the president and CEO of the Greater Baltimore Committee, on whose board Mr. Plank serves as vice chair. "When someone of his stature in the business world is putting this kind of commitment into Baltimore, it makes people take another look."
Meanwhile, Baltimore's most successful entrepreneur deepened his connections to the city's startup scene. His City Garage at Port Covington has helped expand Baltimore's makerspace community with an eye toward boosting local manufacturing, and his BetaMore incubator has continued to provide early-stage support for tech companies. It held its second annual Beta City pitch competition for startups this year, providing $50,000 to the winner, health tech company Tissue Analytics. Josh Budman, the company's co-founder and chief technology officer, said what set Beta City apart was the degree to which it was community-centric, bringing together people from a host of different industries, from finance to real estate, to help young companies grow. "Getting Kevin on the stage and him doing an awesome job, and getting our face on the map in Baltimore, gave us exposure to all those different kinds of individuals who can help with our business," Mr. Budman said.

A Georgia woman who is three years into a painful recovery is suing after claiming she received the wrong dosage of a medication that caused her body to burn from the inside out. Khaliah Shaw, 26, spent three weeks in a medically induced coma while her skin slowly peeled off and wants to ensure that other patients are protected from pharmaceutical errors, 11Alive.com reported.
“This did not have to happen,” Shaw, who lives in Snellville, about 30 miles northeast of Atlanta, told 11Alive.com. “This was not just some sort of fluke in my opinion. This happened as a directly (sic) result of somebody's error.”

In 2014, Shaw told her doctors she felt depressed and received a prescription for Lamictal, an anti-seizure medication sometimes used to treat bipolar disorders, the Tech Times reported.
Shaw took the medication for two weeks before she started breaking out in blisters. Shaw told the news outlet that her body felt like it “was on fire.”
Eventually, doctors diagnosed her with Stevens Johnson Syndrome, a rare skin disorder that is typically caused by an adverse reaction to medication, 11Alive.com reported.
“It essentially causes your body to burn from the inside out, and you pretty much just melt,” she told 11Alive.com.

The Palm Beach Post reported that others are also suing pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) for promoting Lamictal without advertising its risks in full. In July 2012, the pharmaceutical company pleaded guilty to criminal negligent charges for allegations of fraud and failure to report product safety data for the drug, the newspaper reported. GSK paid $3 billion total.
As for Shaw, the young woman has come to resemble a burn victim. She has lost her fingernails and sweat glands, and she is slowly going blind, 11Alive.com reported.
“They're telling me this could happen again, and they're telling me if it did happen again, that it would be worse,” Shaw told the news outlet.
The lawsuit claims her medical bills total upwards of $3.45 million and are expected to continue to grow as she continues receiving treatment.

“I never heard of Steven Johnson Syndrome until I was in the hospital with my skin melting off my body. That's when I learned what it was,” she told the news outlet.
Shaw's attorney told 11Alive.com that alleged errors by pharmacists continue to “happen at an alarming rate,” because staff are too rushed and too busy.
In telling her story, Shaw wants to raise awareness about the dangers of prescription medication errors.
"It is difficult being in the spotlight, but I think it is worth it if it means someone is more educated about the medication that they are taking," Shaw told The Palm Beach Post.
PRESS RELEASE CFR Attack on Trump's ‘Infrastructure': Mr. Mallaby Plays the Fool Feb. 19, 2017 (EIRNS)—The New York Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), in the Sunday Washington Post, joins the drive to stop President Trump's "infrastructure investments." The City of London/Wall Street establishment clearly thinks they can wipe out President Trump's $1 trillion infrastructure idea as quickly and thoroughly as they stamped out Bill Clinton's $110 billion infrastructure bank idea in 1993. (Clinton abandoned it within months under an all-points media, think-tank and Congressional barrage. The nation's productivity has continued to pay the price since.) Sebastian Mallaby—who is a British-trained economist, Alan Greenspan's biographer, and the Paul Volcker Senior Fellow at the CFR—followed up Greenspan's Feb. 17 interview attacking Trump's (or anybody else's) plans for infrastructure investment in the U.S. economy. Mallaby's Post op-ed, titled, "The Economy Is Already Pretty Great," is laughably false but quite centered on Greenspan's and London and Wall Street's target. Mr. Mallaby tells us that the "Obama expansion could soon become the third-longest of the post-war era." How very extraordinary. And, that "Wage growth has picked up to around 3.5% per year." This statement is also extraordinary—extraordinarily false, as current data on 2016 from the Bureau of Labor Statistics make clear (see separate report). Moreover, "Household income grew rapidly in 2015." In fact, that was the only year of Obama's eight in which real household income grew at all, and median real weekly income is still somewhat below the 2007 level. But then comes the real point: "In some past recoveries growth ... exceeded the sustainable rate." Obama's crawling "recovery," then, is quite enough. "The main cloud on the horizon is that ... infrastructure spending could drive growth above its sustainable rate." Chair Janet Yellen's Federal Reserve is also on this line, and Mallaby threatens the Fed "would put on the brakes" with high interest rates if under Trump, infrastructure investments led to "overheating." And don't worry about the lack of any productivity growth for a decade, Mallaby adds: "Official measures of productivity exclude the value to consumers of cool new stuff" like Internet search, auto navigation. Productivity growth is completely unpredictable anyway, he says, defying decades of economic research. So the CRF's conclusion: Let's have no "railing at the poor performance of the economy, and using that ... to justify rash populist measures" like investment in new infrastructure. Meanwhile, infrastructure draft legislation may be coming from the White House. Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell said at his Feb. 17 press conference that he "expects to receive some kind of recommendation on an infrastructure bill shortly, a subject that we frequently handle on a bipartisan basis." McConnell's wife is the Transportation Secretary Elaine Chow.
Russian authorities Wednesday charged an employee of the cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab and two officers in the Federal Security Service (FSB) with committing treason in the interest of the United States.
The three people have been identified as Ruslan Stoyanov, head of Kaspersky's computer incidents investigation team; and Sergei Mikhailov and Dmitry Dokuchayev, who worked for the FSB's Information Security Centre.
Ivan Pavlov, a lawyer representing one of the three, did not specify who he was representing, but said Stoyanov was not his client. "My client, along with the others, has been charged with state treason and cooperating with U.S. intelligence services," Pavlov told Reuters.
Stoyanov's cybersecurity team at Kaspersky had been cooperating with the FSB since 2013 in analyzing cybercrime cases and offering expertise in criminal cases concerning cybersecurity. Kaspersky Lab officials confirmed Stoyanov's arrest but said the charges were filed against him even before he joined the company in 2012.
Mikhailov was the leader of a covert hacking group known by the name "Humpty Dumpty" that "cooperated with the Ukrainian SBU (security service), which is the same as working for the CIA; he worked with them, which is obviously treason," Sergei Markov, Kremlin adviser and parliamentarian, told the Daily Beast. Mikhailov was arrested in late December during a meeting by his own FSB colleagues "with a bag over his head," Markov added.
Speculations had come up regarding the arrests and it was linked to the alleged Russian hacking of last year's U.S. election. U.S. intelligence officials accused Russian hackers of sabotaging the elections in favor of Donald Trump, though Moscow denied all the allegations.
A Kremlin spokesman said Russian President Vladimir Putin was aware of media reports about the arrests and the details of the treason charges, but did not say if Putin looked into the matter.
Roy Oswalt retired this week, and that's disappointing: Roy Oswalt was great, and less of him is not a positive. However, his retirement does mean we get to revisit what is arguably the greatest moment of his career, when he came off of the bench to play outfield for the Phillies, because there was no one else.
Phillies' first baseman Ryan Howard was ejected for arguing a check-swing call in the 14th inning of a 2-2 game between the Phillies, and, conveniently enough for historical reflection, Oswalt's original club, the Astros. The Philadelphia bench was empty, so when the 15th began, they shifted left fielder Raul Ibanez to first base, and put Oswalt in left.
Even better, Oswalt got to make a play:
The crowd erupted when Oswalt made this simple play, and how could they not? That led to possibly an even greater moment, with Oswalt unable to wipe an enormous grin from his face.
If you want to see the whole thing, from ejection through grin, MLB.com was kind enough to provide full video of Oswalt's greatest moment for all of us to see:

Oxfam has partnered with Liftshare, one of the UK's leading shared travel platforms, in order to provide its music festival volunteers with a cheaper mode of transport.
The charity, which recruits overs 5,000 festival volunteers each year for events like Glastonbury, Bestival and Reading, said the new Oxfam Stewards group will help volunteers to arrange car shares with other stewards heading in their direction.

Stewards are being encouraged by Oxfam to download the Liftshare app or visit the company's website when making their travel plans.
Liftshare founder Ali Clabburn said: “We're super excited to be helping the amazing Oxfam volunteers save money getting to festivals. Working with Glastonbury in 1999 was our first real success and we've loved helping fans get to festivals ever since.”
Oxfam marketing executive Clare Williamson said: “We hope using the app on-site for last-minute plans will encourage stewards to help each other out more than ever before.”
Glastonbury, Bestival, Reading and Leeds all depend on an army of Oxfam volunteers in order to put their festivals on.
The partnership comes after projections that the sharing economy sector will be worth £9 billion by 2025 and the recent launch of sharing economy trade union SEUK, of which Liftshare is a founding member.

NEW YORK (AP) — The first day of jury deliberations at the federal securities fraud trial of Martin Shkreli ended Monday without a verdict for the former biotech CEO best known for hiking up the price of a life-saving drug and for trolling his critics on social media.
The deliberations, which resume Tuesday, follow about a month of testimony in federal court in Brooklyn, most it from investors in two failed hedge funds run by the defendant. The witnesses told jurors the 34-year-old Shkreli concealed the fact that he lost millions of dollars and made them the victim of a scheme to pay them back with worthless stock in a startup drug company.
The trial “has exposed Martin Shkreli for who he really is — a con man who stole millions,” a federal prosecutor, Jacquelyn Kasulis, said in closing arguments last week.
The defense countered by arguing the investors weren't victims because they recouped their money when the drug company went public. Some even made large profits when the stock price took off.
“Who lost anything? Nobody,” defense attorney Ben Brafman said in his closing argument. Some investors had to admit on the witness stand that partnering with Shkreli was “the greatest investment I've ever made,” he added.
Before his arrest in 2015 in the securities fraud case, Shkreli became notorious for buying the rights to a drug called Daraprim and promptly raising the price by 5,000 percent, from $13.50 to $750 per pill. The defendant, who didn't testify, also came into the trial with a reputation for trolling his critics on social media to a degree that got him kicked off Twitter and earned him the moniker “Pharma Bro.”
Rather than lay low like his lawyers wanted, Shkreli got into the act, using Facebook to bash prosecutors and news organizations covering his case. In one recent post, he wrote, “My case is a silly witch hunt perpetrated by self-serving prosecutors. ... Drain the swamp. Drain the sewer that is the (Department of Justice).”
Shkreli faces eight counts of securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. If convicted of the most serious counts, he faces up to 20 years in prison but likely would receive far less time under sentencing guidelines.
It's no secret that cold and flu season peaks in winter. And if you're looking for ways to stay well, one priority, say experts, is simple: Follow a wholesome diet, just as you should any time of year. But that can be a tall order during the busy holiday season, when hectic social schedules and family commitments often interfere with regular meals.
Nutritionists recommend foods -- not supplements -- to help you stay strong through the winter.
Food alone can't protect against the common cold or influenza, and the science isn't yet clear on which or how much of some nutrients may help bolster immunity to reduce your risk of getting sick. But experts agree that a diet rich in a variety of produce, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy products -- along with adequate sleep, moderate exercise, and minimal stress -- contributes to a well-functioning immune system and may promote a faster recovery if you do come down with a cold or flu. CookingLight.com: Choose healthful treats this holiday season
Stay hydrated
Water is the largest single constituent of the human body -- contributing to at least half your body weight -- but it's "also a forgotten nutrient," says Jennifer K. Nelson, M.S., R.D., director of clinical dietetics at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. This essential nutrient (meaning it's one the body can't produce on its own) promotes healthy muscle, bone, and blood.
Adequate hydration is even more important once you're sick because fluids lost through sneezing, watery eyes, and a runny nose need replacing. "When you have a mild fever, your body becomes more dehydrated as a result. So drinking plenty of fluids is probably the first line of defense," Nelson says.

Don't Miss Expert Q&A: Why do I get colds despite constant handwashing?
The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends an average 11 cups of fluids daily (from beverages and foods) for healthy women, while men need about 15.5 cups per day. Water, coffee, tea, and juice, as well as water-filled foods such as fruit, vegetables, soups and stews all count toward daily hydration needs.
Choose food
While it's known that certain nutrients like vitamins C, E, and A, as well as the mineral zinc, are associated with immune functions, it's hard to attribute specific immunity-boosting benefits to any one nutrient because of inconclusive research. "Many studies have been done in nutrition and immune function, involving numerous nutrients -- and [they] come out with different, often contradicting results," says Dayong Wu, Ph.D., a scientist in the Nutritional Immunology Laboratory, the USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, and assistant professor at the Friedman School of Nutrition and Science Policy at Tufts University.
Because a nutritional intervention may have different effects on people of different ages or nutrition status as noted in scientific studies, Wu says, it's difficult to make broad recommendations based on study findings. "In general, it's easier to see positive, immune-strengthening results by supplementing someone with a vitamin or mineral that he is deficient in," he says. The same benefits may not confer to "people with adequate intake."
That's why Julia Zumpano, R.D., of the Cleveland Clinic Department of Preventive Cardiology, recommends foods -- not supplements -- to help you stay strong through the winter. "An overall healthful diet rich in vitamins and minerals is your best bet for the cold weather months," says Zumpano. "You'll also benefit from other nutrients not typically found in supplements when you eat a whole food." She encourages plenty of fruits and vegetables (for vitamins C and E); whole grains, lean meats, and poultry (for zinc); and low-fat dairy products (for vitamin A). For example, in addition to vitamin E, a whole grain like quinoa or rye bread offers fiber, B vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients, which support overall good health.

Fruits, vegetables, and seafood may also help you enjoy a healthier winter. Pumpkin, butternut squash, and other deep-hued orange produce provide beta-carotene, which is converted in the body to vitamin A. Choose citrus, like grapefruit, oranges, kumquats, tangerines, and clementines as well as canned tomatoes, chiles, or pineapple for vitamin C. Oysters offer zinc.

Donald Trump addresses the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in Washington, D.C., on March 21. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images
According to a report in the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot, U.S. intelligence officials have warned their Israeli counterparts about sharing information with Donald Trump's administration, suggesting it could end up in Russian hands. Reporter Ronen Bergman writes that in a recent meeting, according to his sources, the Americans “voiced despair” over Trump's election and said they believed that Russian President Vladimir Putin had “leverages of power” over Trump. This would be particularly worrying for the Israelis, given Russia's ties with the governments of Syria and Iran. Berman writes:
The Americans implied that their Israeli colleagues should “be careful” as of January 20, Trump's inauguration date, when transferring intelligence information to the White House and to the National Security Council (NSC), which is subject to the president. According to the Israelis who were present in the meeting, the Americans recommended that until it is made clear that Trump is not inappropriately connected to Russia and is not being extorted – Israel should avoid revealing sensitive sources to administration officials for fear the information would reach the Iranians.
Bergman is a prominent investigative journalist, but the sourcing on his story is vague and, as with nearly all the reporting so far about Trump's Russia ties, skepticism is warranted.
If true, this would be extraordinary. There's a long-standing close relationship between U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies that has only gotten deeper in recent years. Documents released by Edward Snowden detailed a “far-reaching technical and analytic relationship” between multiple intelligence agencies in the two countries aimed at targets in the Middle East. Controversially, this reportedly included the National Security Agency providing its Israeli counterpart with raw intelligence data without first removing information about U.S. citizens. The two countries also reportedly cooperated on the deployment of the Stuxnet cyberattack against Iranian nuclear facilities. (An underdiscussed looming dilemma for Trump's foreign policy, as suggested by this story, is that his desire for a close working relationship with Russia is at odds with the hard line he and his advisers have taken on Iran.)
There's been mutual suspicion as well. Another document released by Snowden identified Israel as a major counterintelligence target alongside China, Russia, Iran, and Cuba. During the 1980s, Israel received classified U.S. intelligence from analyst Jonathan Pollard, which may have ended up in Soviet hands.
But now, it seems that rather than spying on each other, the two spy communities could band together in the face of an unprecedented challenge in the form of the new U.S. president. If Bergman's sources are right, it's hard to believe that the Israelis would be the only ones getting a warning like this. The U.S. maintains close intelligence-sharing relationships with a number of other governments, the “five eyes” network of English-speaking countries for instance. Reporting by Newsweek during the election suggested that NATO allies were deeply alarmed by Trump's blasé response to reports of Russia's election hacking. If confirmed, Bergman's report suggests that at least some members of the U.S. intelligence committee trust their foreign counterparts more than they trust the incoming U.S. president and his team.
We start the morning on a cloudy note across SE England and East Anglia, as a band of locally heavy and thundery rain along a cold front clears east here in the next few hours.
Heavy rain clearing east this morning
The cold front clears this band of cloud and rain into the North Sea by early afternoon. Then brighter but showery conditions, already across northern and western areas this morning, spread across all areas this afternoon. Scattered showers will affect many areas this afternoon, heaviest and most frequent across central, northern and eastern areas, where they'll be accompanied by hail and thunder in places too. Sunny spells in between the showers, most lengthy in the south. Remaining cloudy across northern Scotland, and increasingly cloudy across Ireland and Northern Ireland - with showery outbreaks of rain moving in. Still pleasantly warm in the sunshine across the south, temperatures reaching 23C in London, 19C in Cardiff, 18C in Manchester and Edinburgh, 16C in Belfast. turning increasingly breezy though.
Locally heavy and thundery showers, Storm Forecast Issued
Cloud and showery rain across the far north and west will then spread across many northern, central and western parts overnight, drier but cloudy towards SE England. Breezy across many areas, but not a cold night, with temperatures no lower than 13-15C across many areas, chillier across the far north of Scotland though.
Then a cooler and cloudier day on Wednesday, breezy too, as we start to see winds switch to come from a more northwesterly direction through the day. There will be outbreaks of rain or showers across many parts in the morning, though rain or showers becoming increasingly confined to eastern areas through the afternoon, while it turns drier and brighter in the west. Temperatures perhaps reaching 21C in London, but generally we will see the mid to high teens elsewhere, with 18C in Cardiff and 16C in Glasgow. A far cry from the temperatures in the low to mid 30s a week ago!

Charges are pending against a 15-year-old boy after a pet parrot was stolen and killed in Slave Lake, Alta., RCMP announced on Wednesday.
The arrest was made after Ozzi, an African Grey Parrot, was taken from the yard of a Slave Lake home on Monday.
Owner Asem Al-Daboubi found Ozzi's empty cage in the bush 20 minutes from his home two days later.
Ozzi was a 10-year-old Congo African Grey Parrot. Her owner says she was taken on Monday and killed. (Supplied)
He found the bird's body on the ground nearby. She had cuts on her chest and back and bruises to her head.
“I just lost it. I just, you know, started crying,” Al-Daboubi said of finding Ozzi's body.
Ozzi was 10 years old when she was killed, but African parrots can live up to 70 years. Al-Daboubi had the bird since it was just months old. He said Ozzi danced, sang and could speak in both English and Arabic.
“Somebody killed my baby, somebody killed my kid. It's my kid. I have no kids. Married for 16 years but have no kids. This bird is my kid.”
Condolences have been pouring in over Facebook.
ColorFabb's XT-CF20 is one of the more exotic filaments for adventurous 3D printerers to get their hands on. This PETG based material features a 20% carbon fiber content, aspiring to be the material of choice for tough parts of high stiffness. It's a fascinating material that's certainly worth a closer look. Let's check it out!
An Abrasive Fellow
The high amount of carbon fibers makes this material extremely abrasive, so I obtained a hardened steel nozzle for my E3Dv6 hotend to print it without harming my brass nozzles. It's also worth mentioning that the filament is capable of cutting deep grooves into extruder idlers and other printer parts on its way through the printer.
The Composition
XT-CF20 features an Eastman Amphora PETG base resin, which itself is already a tough material and lies about halfway between PLA and ABS in terms of temperature resistance. Yet, PETG filaments are fairly undemanding to the printer hardware: No high nozzle or bed temperatures, no heated build chambers and also no exotic build plate materials are required. The XT-CF20 combines this resin with 20% carbon fibers. These fibers come as a finely milled filler rather than in the shape of long, reinforcing strands, so they surely don't bestow superpowers on printed parts. However, the XT-CF20 features a significantly increased shape fidelity, stiffness, and temperature resistance compared to the unfilled members of the XT family.
Print Quality
To get an encompassing idea of the material's surface-finish, overhang tolerance, and bridging capabilities, I printed below Benchy, which resulted in a highly uniform texture and color with a nice matte finish. The bridges and overhangs at the cabin windows turned out great, and all details came out nicely. Despite all countermeasures, it has a tendency to ooze and create little blobs and artifacts here and there, which can be an obstacle to printing something that has to look perfect.
0.2 mm, 240 °C, 25 mm/s 0.2 mm, 240 °C, 25 mm/s 0.2 mm, 240 °C, 25 mm/s
Conductivity
Probably by accident, the material safety data sheet describes this material as conductive, but nope, it's merely antistatic. Despite the high carbon fiber content, the XT-CF20 features a surface resistivity of 109 Ω/sq (as stated in the technical datasheet) and is nothing you'd want to print your circuits with.
Warping
PETG filaments generally show a very low tendency to deform during printing, and with the high fiber content of the XT-CF20, the issue of warping goes down to virtually zero. Part of my tests were several massive 100 x 20 x 10 mm bars with 100 % infill, which I printed on a glue-stick-coated glass plate. It stuck to the plate perfectly straight during the 4 hour print with not a single corner lifted. That's something I cannot even reproduce with PLA. In terms of shape fidelity, this material really deserves 5 out of 5 perfectly straight bananas.
Perfectly straight, chunky bars with 100% infill.
Build Plate Material And Adhesion
In my tests, the filament adhered to plain borosilicate glass briefly. Small objects could be printed directly to the glass surface, but taller objects were prone to just popping off during the print. With a thin layer of glue stick on the glass, I was able to print the massive blocks shown above with perfect build plate adhesion.
I also tested the material on my PEI build plate. The build plate adhesion was certainly stronger than necessary for a material that does not warp at all, but all parts could be removed without damaging the PEI plate or the parts themselves. Glue-stick on glass is probably the better solution for printing XT-CF20.
Bed Temperature
ColorFabb recommends 80 °C for the print bed, which worked great. Going below 80 °C led to problems getting the first layer to stick to the glue-stick-coated glass plate, but caused no problems when printing on the PEI plate.
Printing Temperature
The XT-CF20's specified processing temperature ranges from 240 to 260 °C. I tested it at temperatures from 230 °C to 310 °C, and well, 240 to 260 °C is really the sweet spot. At 230 °C, parts can still be printed well, but the results are weak and break easily. Parts printed at 240 °C are already quite strong, but still have a slight tendency to break at the interface between the layers. At 260 °C, cracks no longer occur in between layers, but throughout the part, which indicates perfect layer bonding. Below fracture test series shows the difference quite clearly, and if you were wondering, was conducted by meticulous professionals using a laboratory-grade set of hammer and chisel.
At about 290° C, the material starts to noticeably deteriorate until printing becomes virtually impossible at 310 °C. Eventually, the best looking results were produced at 240 °C and 25 mm/s printing speed, with little oozing, while parts printed at 260° C and 25 mm/s printing speed were extraordinarily tough and showed perfect layer bonding.
Oozing
Not all PETG based filaments are alike, but many tend to ooze. So does the XT-CF2, with droplets of molten material flowing out of the nozzle during travel moves. Over the course of a print, some of these oozed material droplets are also collected back by the printing nozzle, where they accumulate to a larger drop of liquid plastic, which sooner or later drops down to the print, creating blob-like artifacts and sometimes even massive obstacles for the print head to run into.
ooze accumulating on the nozzle oozing blob oozing disaster
The issue can be mitigated by printing at lower temperatures and speeds. With a printing temperature between 240 and 260 °C, printing becomes practical at 25 mm/s, with little oozing and low material buildup on the nozzle. Other settings I found helpful in mitigating oozing are a slight underextrusion, as well as activating “retractions on layer change” and turning off “only retract when crossing perimeters” in Slic3r. Keeping the retraction length short — 2 mm for the E3D hotend I am using — speeds up the retraction moves and prevents nozzle clogging.
Printing Speed
ColorFabb recommends a print speed (40 – 70 mm/s) for the XT-CF20, although, within printing temperatures of 240 to 260 °C, the maximum printing speed I could achieve without strongly affecting layer bonding was 25 mm/s for perimeters and infill and 10 mm/s for small features. As mentioned before, lower printing speeds also result in reduced oozing and fewer blob-artifacts.
These values deviate a lot from ColorFabb's recommendation, so I still could be wrong in my findings. Nevertheless, in ColorFabb's comment sections, complaints are piling up from users who are unable to “print anything” with XT-CF20 and the recommended settings. In contrast to that, Pau from Tilt Racing Drones in Sweden published a highly positive review showing the great results from his efforts to print drone frames from XT-CF20 at painstaking 15 mm/s and 260° C.
Resilience
Parts printed from XT-CF20 are extraordinarily stiff and can take a beating. The technical data sheet attests XT-CF20 this outstanding toughness, below table puts the values into a known context.

Overhangs
With the settings dialed in, I threw a plain overhang test object with overhang angles from 15° to 75° at the material. It was printed at 0.2 mm layer height with a 0.4 mm nozzle at 240° C with a nozzle fan to selectively cool the overhangs. The test ended in a messy catastrophe when it reached the 75°, which destroyed the test piece, so I redid the test with a maximum overhang angle of 60° for the below photograph.
Bridging
A positive effect of the PETG resin's high melt strength is its excellent bridging ability. The XT-CF20 bridges even large gaps of 40 mm without specialized print settings, and even made it across the 80 mm bridge. Note that these bridges were printed with default settings, such as a bridge flow rate of 100%, with only a nozzle fan to selectively cool the bridges. These settings might be tuned further for an individual setup to obtain better results.
Support Material
I found it necessary to configure Slic3r to 0.0 mm Z-contact-distance to get a reasonable adhesion between the support structures and the actual print when using XT-CF20 on my single extruder setup. Also, a higher extrusion width of 0.7 mm for the support structures was necessary to prevent Slic3r's support material from degenerating, since it's printed with a greater layer height. The support material could still be removed and breaks easily at the touching points. Given the resilience of the material, the support structures themselves were also quite rigid, which could be a problem when printing objects with a lot of support material all around them.
Hygroscopicity
A noteworthy property of the XT-CF20's PETG base resin is its hygroscopicity. It absorbs water from ambient humidity, which then leads to a chemical reaction named hydrolysis once it's printed — or otherwise heated above 160° C. The reaction causes the longer polymer chains in the material to decompose into shorter chains, which results in higher brittleness of the material. Wet PETG can be dried for a few hours at 65 °C, although preventing it from getting wet in the first place by storing the filament in a sealed bag with silica gel seems to be the way to go here.
Safety
XT-CF20 comes with a material safety data sheet that should be read. In particular, dust created when sanding or otherwise processing the material should not be inhaled and can also form an explosive mixture with air. The filament is not explicitly hazardous, but the MSDS clearly lacks accurate toxicological data. For good measure, I'd rather not use this material for objects that come in contact with humans on a regular basis or use a varnish to seal the printed parts.
Conclusion
XT-CF20 has its caveats. Oozing is still a problem, and the low printing speeds take the fun out of the large, tough parts that this material would theoretically enable you to print. Nevertheless, it's an exceptional material, capable of a beautiful surface finish, while at the same time being extremely tough and able to replicate steep overhangs and wide bridges. Because it does not require high temperatures or special build plates, it can be printed on virtually any printer that can be equipped with a steel nozzle (or comes with a cheap supply of brass ones). And it does not warp a micron. There are many use-cases where a tough material of high stiffness saves the day, regardless of little deficiencies or long printing times. Be it DIY drone frames, GoPro fixtures or even functional, load-bearing parts for 3D printers and small CNC mills.
I hope you enjoyed diving into a rather exotic 3D printing filament with this very first filament review on Hackaday. Have our readers yet run into projects where they'd wished for a tougher material? Other filaments you'd like to see here? Let us know in the comments!

According to Deadline, Gravity is now on track for a $55.5 million opening weekend box office. The film did $17.5 million on Friday and $23.5 million on Saturday. In comparison, Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs 2, which should finish in second place, is projected to do $21.5 million. Also, Runner, Runner, which was this week's other big new movie opening, is crash-landing with only a $7.9 million opening weekend.
Gravity was produced on an estimated $80 million to $120 million budget. Given the rave reviews from critics and the strong positive reaction from audiences, Gravity should have enough legs to stand tall at the box office for several weeks. If Gravity makes it into the Best Picture Oscar race as most are expecting, it could even enjoy a second run in theaters during Awards season.
Gravity's $55.5 million opening weekend also set a new opening weekend record for the month of October, besting the old record of $52.5 million held by Paranormal Activity 3.
Growing up in the TV generation turned the online/smartphone generation, I've never had a long attention span. The books I've started and not finished would form a much larger library than the ones I made it through.
That works well for being in the news business, from wire services (UPI) to the Web, where multi-tasking was the way to survive long before it became a buzzword.
And being a news junkie since 2nd grade (edited the Room 210 Tooter), I still find myself speed-reading the old issue of a magazine or newspaper as soon as the new one is out – its value feels somewhat diminished, as if it's now not news — it's history.
I always loved the gift of magazines in the mailbox – even when they showed up late or with covers shredded in the rough-and-tumble physical world of mail delivery.
I especially liked how magazines were always dated for the next week, or month. Even though the magazine's articles were written days or weeks ago, that helped me to fool myself a bit (hey, born on April Fool's Day, you do that) that I was reading … news of the future. Or at least of the immediate present.
But a radio or TV, or even a newspaper, put the lie to that. The “first rough draft of history” was at hand, even then. So even then, the “newest” magazines didn't feel … all that new, or now.
But now … now! Everything can be instantaneous! I should be able to pick up today's magazine. This hour's. Electronically of course. It should have the absolutely the newest stuff out front, and then, I'm more than willing to dive deeper and find a bit older stuff toward the “back of the book.” But even there, it should be updated for anything from the tiniest typo to a bombshell about the topic at hand.
But it's not.
Oh the material is out there, often from the same source. There's this … bifurcation. Go to a magazine's Website, especially the weeklies, and you have fresh stuff out front, and a link to articles in the current issue.
OK, that's good enough for some. But … again, a split that doesn't need to exist any more. A rocky ledge in the free flow of today's information. Or a barrier one needs to portage around — between the Old Stuff and the New Stuff. Between Now and Then.
That's just me, but … maybe not just me?
Noawadays, tablets (like my Nook) have made it so wonderfully possible to be reading an endless array of magazines, newspapers and books, all without filling endless shelves and boxes and stacks all over the house.
And yet, something's always seemed missing, in our move to electronic reading – and no, I don't mean the romanticized joy and feel of a newspaper or book in one's hands. I do understand the tactile sensation of paper pages feels so … right, to so many. I still hope color e-ink of some kind will bridge the gap and give us the best of both worlds — “electronic paper” promised for as long as the videophone was, it would seem – readable in any light, but … electronic.
But gee, on a related topic, I've been musing: Are e-books really e-books? No, not yet. But will they ever be?
Go to the electronic bookstore and it feels much like the bricks-and-mortar bookstores we've all come to know and love — though you can search instantly and sort by genre, the most recent publication, the best in reviews, the cheapest, the most expensive.
That's a step along the path – but I'm here to tell you that in my mind's eye, we've barely begun down that path. There is so much more to do!
I think one reason I haven't finished writing or reading many of my books – and many others probably haven't as well – has as much to do with the one-way and by very definition, it seems, dated – old – nature of book (or article) writing or reading as the short attention span I happen to possess.
Then there's the split between writing/reading and our increasingly social (media) world.
Some folks crave that solitary nature, with all they read or certain things — to be alone in their thoughts being offered or received. As the comic-strip character Shoe said recently, “Writing is the loneliest job in the world.” It's a common phrase.
But today, it sure doesn't have to be any more, right? Everything is social now – why is our media still somewhat wedded, even welded to the forms and processes of the past? Are we such creatures of habit that we can only embrace the potential of the new in the forms of the old? (An Edsel front bumper welded to a 21st-Century hybrid or electric car.)
Or are we just not yet far enough along in the way we think about these things that we have not ventured out of our comfortable media and content boxes of the past? Then again, maybe we're just not quite there in the tech end, from too-short battery lives to wifi almost everywhere but not quite as reliable or easy to use as a light switch.)
I've said for some time that, in many cases, on things I feel strongest about or most interested in – one's passion, from archaeology to, um zebras? — I'd love to read a “book” (for lack of a better term) that is as fresh as the technology makes possible – with the deep thought, care and history of a book – but the updated nature of the very things I can find elsewhere on my little portable tablet – the blogs, the Web, the forums (remember those?) to discuss them, even an ability to interact with others who just read the same thing I did and can't wait to talk to someone about it.
We can do all these things, today. But not in one place — where the discussion advances the book (if the author decides to partake) and the book advances based on new developments and the ideas and information shared by others. A new form of media “social solar system,” allowing writers to use the various pieces of today's media landscape to create something bigger.
And yes, the Internet is one step away from anywhere, thanks to the amazing Web of links. But mentally, once we “go there,” what are the odds we'll go back where we started to resume reading? Is that really the best architecture for all purposes?
If a book or long-form content actually becomes truly social, it also could be a means of readers or would-be readers sharing ideas of books or articles they'd like to read about — perhaps investing money, not just an up-vote or down-vote. Many details to work out, but again, a part of the Grand Vision worth exploring.
I truly, passionately believe that we have, to this point, barely ventured down the road toward that vision, of the potential for truly interactive, “living” books (and, quite possibly, other traditional media forms) — one that truly liberates and underscores the “e” in e-book.
Otherwise, we are using silicon, pixels, wi-fi and all the rest to replicate the books of the past, rather than taking advantage of the inherent potential in today's technologies and social media to create something far, far grander.
This is about the next generation of not just reading, but writing and interactivity. Not coming from the perspective of a computer programmer, but a wordsmith (I daresay) and a veteran end user (hey, I was a beta tester for America Online! If I had been a “beta shareholder,” I could hire a team of great coders to weld together an example of just what I'm talking about!)
I have found most people with whom I've shared my enthusiastic, condensed “elevator pitch” of this grand vision tell me that they find it, at the least, an intriguing idea worth further exploration, if not something they'd partake in – if it existed.
I know that in the vast reaches of the Net, someone may be doing or trying to do just what I'm talking about here — taking the disparate pieces of today's media and social media products and platforms and unifying them in a simple way that makes the whole far greater than the sum of its parts. I send this electronic message in a bottle out there, actually to feel somewhat relieved if someone or more than one are working to take us down that path. (And hoping I can kick its digital tires!)
Then again, maybe there are some good reasons this whole Grand Media Unification/Socialization Theory can't and won't happen that I'm missing, beyond the obvious issues of – well, first of all, of course, how can it make money? What about the negatives of today's social media battlefield – the trolls, etc.? (Then there's that four-letter word – porn – or crime, which makes me shudder to think of how such a platform might be abused. Every tool is a weapon, and vice versa.)
There are no doubt as many UX (user experience) challenges to this social future of the media – making it simple, smooth and inviting – as there are fiscal, legal (the rights to crowdsourced books?) etc.
I will address some of the counter-arguments here, as best I can – having first tried one writing platform – FastPencil – that is a wonderful writing interface — and also allows editors, reviewers and collaborators with whom to interact, though not as easily and widely as I envision. Thus the move to a more traditional WordPress blog. Still, perhaps it's a step along the way, or a glimpse of the vision. Time will tell.
But what I know in my head and my heart is that I am voicing this Grand Vision because it's something I don't necessarily want to invent — hey, I still love my day job, riding the tide of the daily news — but something I wish existed or was coming to fruition so I could help, and dive in! And since it doesn't exist, as far as I know, I'd love to help make it happen.
When I read an online article these days, I often move down to the end before I even decide whether to read the whole thing. Not that I want to “know how it turns out” — traditional “pyramid form” journalism isn't arranged that way – but to read the wise, dumb or insightful comment thread that follows — and I often find that as, if not more enlightening than the article itself. And yet, they are together, but separate – the comments rarely if ever resulting in changes to the content itself!
An article online without comments, especially if on a hot topic in a popular spot, makes me wonder what went wrong. One without a comment system seems old-fashioned in a cold, sterile and one-way way. With all the headaches of moderating Website comments and babysitting the Facebook yahoos, it still feels more of a logical, natural interactive affair — occasionally enlightening, and yes, sometimes exasperating – than what the past allowed.
In fact, I know this e-book-turned-blog would have been a better, richer experience for the writer and readers if these tools already existed and this was an interactive, social conversation that involved you, dear reader – if you wanted — and then, on the author(s)' end, taking in like a big trawler boat your thoughts and questions and illuminations you share as you read it. Picking the best to share with all, to update the book, to ignore — whatever. A living, evolving “book” as community, a social network — merging content and conversation if we want, to make it a content-grounded dialogue..
Not to mention your discussions with others about the topic(s) at hand – and the thoughts and directions that evolve as you read the book. Maybe it even would inspire you to branch off and start your own …. C6. (OK, that's one acronym thought, standing for Content Creation, Collaboration, Curation and Conversation Community) – on this or any other topic you see fitting such a system/platform/tool.
If such a system existed, I would have used it to write this. Because it doesn't, from anywhere I can see – at least not as easy to use and powerful as I envision – I've been to the WeBooks and the Widbooks, etc., and I see the promise, but on a too-small, mostly fiction-driven scale — I instead am using this blog – not one-way, but not as interactive or easily customizable as I envision — to describe in some detail the various potential elements and how I see them fitting together.
Sure, anything is possible these days if you pay more – customizable CSS inside-out upside-down flexibility. But I am talking about the notion of something as easy to use as a word processor but with the content publicly available and discussable. I'm also talking, as you'll see, about a desire to bring the static world of “content” into the always-updatable world we now inhabit.
I hope one day to be able to choose whether to write in private, old-school fashion — or whether, from the first chapter, even the first sentence, I want to write “on the street corner,” with folks looking over my digital shoulder – to laugh, to quibble, to agree or what have you. That crowd may build you up or shout you down, or lead you in directions you'd never have considered. Such is the value of human interaction. Rules/processes could be easily set up to limit the potential downside.
There are an infinite number of free or low cost Website creation tools out there – but most seem very much focused on the visual and not so much on one of the first loves of my life – the text, the “printed” word. White space, big bold photos, elegant design – great. But the text seems almost to intrude, relegated to narrow columns or a minority of templates that seem to say “oh, you want to actually write or read something? OK, I suppose.”
But marrying content creation — the words that paint a picture, collaboration (to whatever degree you wish) and conversation about that content seems so natural in my mind, yet so foreign to much of what I see.
So I am laying out that vision, to see if others agree.
Doesn't that sound, not just fun, but … potentially amazing, in terms of what it might make possible?
Sure does to me!

Nick Clegg has outlined his proposals to curb benefits to European Union migrants, during a meeting with his German counterpart in Berlin.
The deputy PM insists the UK could find allies in Europe to support efforts to tackle "benefits tourism" - without challenging free movement in the EU.
He discussed the issue with Germany's Sigmar Gabriel.
UK PM David Cameron is due to set out his own plans to restrict EU migration later on Friday.
But Mr Clegg warned the Conservatives were in danger of making "irresponsible declarations" on Europe in a bid to quell unrest at the rise of UKIP.
'Wild overpromising'
"If the prime minister asserts that a Tory government will introduce caps or overall quotas on the number of EU migrants coming here, we will find ourselves in the worst of all worlds," Mr Clegg wrote in the Financial Times.
"UKIP will say it is not enough. Europe will say it is not possible. Once again the British people will be plunged into a cycle of wild overpromising and inevitable disappointment, their scepticism confirmed."
Instead he suggests that migrants could be prevented from claiming the government's new Universal Credit benefit until they have "worked and contributed" to the system.
He also proposed restricting access to in-work benefits like tax credits, suggesting that migrants could be required to work the equivalent of full-time hours on the minimum wage in order to qualify.
Mr Clegg argued that Mr Cameron's speech could put the British economy at risk if he proposed measures that would jeopardise the country's EU membership in an effort to win back supporters from Nigel Farage's UKIP.
'Pay something into the pot'
In the FT he argued that Mr Farage wanted to "pull up the drawbridge", conceding that it was a "message that has played well" in the by-elections at Clacton and Rochester and Strood.
"The bigger danger now is that a rattled Conservative Party resorts to equally irresponsible declarations, in a bid to calm their own ranks," he said.
Mr Clegg believes it is possible to work with European allies to secure reform within the existing freedom of movement rules.
The BBC understands he is considering a minimum of six months of contributions before the entitlement threshold would be reached.
Ahead of his meeting with German vice-chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, the Lib Dem leader said: "I have already proposed that we work with other states to stop EU migrants from claiming child benefit for children who are not living here.
"As a first step, we should pay the same rate as the country in which those children reside. In the UK it is about £80 a month, whereas in Poland it is less than half that. And there are other proposals we must now explore."
Benefits
He added: "As we streamline our welfare system by combining a range of benefits in a single Universal Credit, we should make sure that only migrants who have worked and contributed can receive support.
"New jobseekers should not be eligible. Applying the same principle - that support should be reserved for migrants who are paying something into the pot - we should look at increasing the earnings threshold for in-work benefits such as tax credits.
"EU migrants could, for example, be required to work the equivalent of full-time hours on the minimum wage in order to qualify."
Mr Clegg said Germany was pursuing five year re-entry bans for migrants involved in identity or benefit fraud, suggesting that "we must see if we can strengthen our laws as well".
Liberal Democrat Justice Minister Simon Hughes said the view he hears most from constituents is that migrants who travel to the UK to work should not qualify for benefits automatically.
"The right to travel, the right to work is one thing. The right to claim benefits is something else and doesn't follow," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Larry Johnson, a former intelligence officer, said he served unknowingly as a source of Fox News senior analyst Andrew Napolitano, who incorrectly used his information to back the claim that British intelligence wiretapped Trump Tower.
Johnson, a former CIA analyst and former Fox News contributor, told CNN's “Reliable Sources” on Sunday that Napolitano made him a source unknowingly and “didn't get it right, [or] accurate either.”
“I think judge should have had a different approach to it,” Johnson added.

Johnson said two sources told him that the British intelligence agency GHCQ had been passing information through back channels about the intelligence community's meddling in U.S. politics, even before Thursday's press briefing. That was when Spicer cited allegations Napolitano made — apparently fueled partially by Johnson — earlier in the week on Fox News that the GHCQ had spied on Trump.
“Now, I had known about the fact that the British through GHCQ were passing information back-channel. This was not done at the direction of Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaWith low birth rate, America needs future migrants 4 ways Hillary looms over the 2020 race Obama goes viral after sporting black bomber jacket with '44' on sleeve at basketball game MORE. Let's be clear about that. It was being done with the full knowledge of people like John Brennan and Jim Clapper,” Johnson said Sunday.
Johnson said Napolitano used information that he posted in an online discussion board, and falsely said British intelligence wiretapped Trump Tower.
“I'm not saying the British GHCQ was wiretapping Trump's Tower. … [Napolitano] shouldn't have used the word wiretap. I call it an ‘information operation' that's been directed against President Trump and people like John Brennan,” Johnson said.
Napolitano reportedly directed the New York Times to call Johnson after facing skepticism regarding his U.K. wiretapping claim.
Johnson said Napolitano used Johnson's anonymous sources to support his claims.
“I'm hearing it from people who are in a position to know. … I posted that on the discussion board and one of the individuals there shared that with the judge. I don't know what his other sources are. All I know is what I know,” Johnson told CNN.
“What's ironic is I was a Fox News analyst through 2002 to 2003. I never spoke to Judge Napolitano then and I hadn't spoken to him until he called me on Saturday,” Johnson added.
Fox News's news division says it does not have proof to support Napolitano's claims.
Speaking at GDC, League of Legends developer Riot Games have said that Warcraft III custom scenario Defence of the Ancients is 'needlessly inaccessible', and that League of Legends is a kind of spiritual successor that brings the DOTA experience to a wider audience.
Developers Tom Cadwell and Steve Snow explained how League of Legends took inspiration from DOTA, realising that the concept was "needlessly inaccessible" and unavailable to anyone outside its niche. With no large-scale promotion, DOTA still reached a vast audience, with over 10 million downloads of the Warcraft 3 custom map per release, without a commercial model. Riot Games took on the task of bringing DOTA to a wider audience with League of Legends and made changes to make the DOTA-style experience more streamlined. Read on for the details.
Riot also made changes to the DOTA formula to make the game a better player experience. For example, the beloved DOTA tactic of 'denying' (killing your own Hero character to prevent the enemy gaining XP) was removed, but Riot were careful to explain this to the community to ensure a positive reaction.
“We were as transparent as possible" explained Tom Cadwell, explaining that even the president of Riot Games would go into chat to answer player's questions.
"It was player tactics such as denying that made DOTA a bit of a rough game. DOTA has a reputation for being a 'ragey' community. Having your teammates toss racial slurs makes people not want to play the game. We thought the mechanics of the game incentivised negative interactions... positive team experiences make people want to hang around."
There are certain times when it may be more appropriate to call a hiring manager or employer, while other times it is better to send an email. Deciding on the right method of contact can ultimately create more leverage for you during the job search process. Phone calls are definitely a personalized way of showing your interest in a position, but at times, a phone call may be too forward. We examine two very important situations in the job search process: the interview wait and the job offer wait.
RELATED: Need help with the job search? Watch these tutorials!
Waiting For The Interview
If you are a job seeker who is waiting for the initial interview call, the waiting period can seem torturous. You stare at the phone day after day. If it has been at least 3-4 days since you sent in your resume, you can follow up with a hiring manager to see if they have begun the interview process or if they are still collecting resumes.
Should I really call so soon?
I'm sure you've heard of the saying, “The early bird catches the worm.” This statement rings true in the job search process. If there is a specific job you desire, being proactive about getting your foot in the door shows initiative. A candidate who truly wants a job and goes after it is a winner in the employer's eyes. With an average of 200+ resumes being submitted for each job, your resume may currently be stuck in a stack of resumes that have yet to be reviewed. A go-getter attitude is one that will stick out in the employer's mind.
I'm really nervous about making that call to the company.
A great way to prepare for this type of phone call is to create a short script as to what you want to say. Be prepared to let the hiring manager know when you sent in your resume and ask about the hiring steps as well as the expected time frame for the interview process. Some companies have closing dates for resume submissions and wait a few weeks before setting up interviews, yet they move very quickly in the decision-making process. By reaffirming your interest in interviewing with the company and other opportunities that may exist, you will have just opened the door to creating a strong rapport with the hiring manager. This can even result in future job leads.
Waiting For The Job Offer
You sent in your resume. You had the interview. Now you're in the waiting zone for the job offer.
Why are they taking so long? Is it time to throw in the towel?
A typical job offer can take anywhere from a few days up to a few weeks. It is first recommended that you thank your interviewer by email within 24-48 hours of the interview. The “thank you” following the interview is very important. Calling after your interview before you send that “thank you” email will seem presumptuous. Instead, send a positively-charged email that reaffirms your interest in the position and the company. If you have not heard back from the employer within a week or two after the interview, you may follow up via phone as you have already established a relationship with the interviewer. Nervous to make the call? Sending a “follow-up” email is just as acceptable. In fact, some job seekers may find it more comforting to type the email and hit “send” for fear of stumbling over their words. In a “follow-up” email you will want to again reaffirm your interest in the position and ask if a decision has been made. If a decision has not been made, then you can ask if you are still being considered for the position and the time frame for the decision-making process. This type of phone call can provide you with the answers you need to enthusiastically move forward in the job process.
Regardless of whether you make a phone call or email, make sure you remain professional, cordial, and appreciative.

The police department's Street Crimes Unit has placed warrants on file for his arrest.
Wynn has outstanding warrants on file for felony reckless endangerment, disorderly conduct and possession of a firearm with intent to go armed.
Police say it started as a confrontation inside the mall then spilled outside here into the parking lot, As one of the groups were trying to leave, that's when 18-year old Jeremy Wynn fired a single shot in their direction.
"They got back into their vehicle and left, and the person who fired the shot went back into the mall in an effort to leave and escape," said Asst. Chief of Neighborhood Policing Eric Tucker.
Police say Wynn was aiming at a group of people he was arguing with.
Assistant Chief Eric Tucker says by the time officers arrived Wynn was gone. they think he left the mall through a different store.
"It was determined by eyewitness accounts and it was determined by video surveillance," Tucker said.
Police searched for that suspect and mall management decided not to put the mall on lockdown.
We're told by police there was no threat to the public once they realized the suspect had run off.
"That was established very soon in the investigation, so it was irrelevant at that point," Tucker said, "I mean it was determined that he was gone."
The decision on a lockdown is ultimately up to the owners of Hamilton Place Mall.
They denied our request for an on-camera interview but released this statement that says,
"On Saturday May 30, 2015 at approximately 5:30 p.m. an argument broke out and a single shot was fired in the parking lot. This was an isolated incident and one which we take very seriously.
We will continue to work with the Chattanooga Police Department on the investigation. One of our top priorities is to provide a comfortable, convenient and enjoyable shopping experience for our customers, retail partners and employees." - Catherine Wells, CBL Marketing Director.
Assistant Chief Tucker says at the time, police were focusing on securing the area not contacting store managers or mall patrons to tell them of the incident.
"But in this particular case, the way in unfolded, and the information that we gathered, it was the proper response," Tucker said.
Tourist visits to the US dropped by 4.2% in the early months of 2017, raising fears of a “Trump slump” following the November 2016 presidential elections.
Data collected by the US Department of Commerce showed that 697,791 fewer tourist visits in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period last year, the New York Times reports. The decline is estimated to have cost the travel industry around $2.7 billion (£1.99bn) in lost custom.
The news follows months of “warnings from the travel industry about the negative impact of increased travel restrictions from the Trump administration”, the BBC reports.
Tourists from Africa and the Middle East were the most likely to give the US a miss, says the Times, further suggesting the possibility of a “a ripple effect from President Trump's proposed travel ban on visitors from six majority-Muslim countries”.
In Europe, the steepest drops in travel to the US occurred in Switzerland, Belgium and the UK. The number of Britons travelling to the States fell 15.5% from last year.
“Comparatively, international tourism saw a 6.4% increase during the beginning of 2013, following the reelection of President Barack Obama,” The Hill reports.
Prior to 2016, international visits to the US have risen every year since 2009, peaking at 77.5 million in 2015, Travel Weekly reports.
The decline in international tourism comes months after a survey by global polling company Pew found a significant drop in US prestige around the world since Trump came to power.
Across 37 countries polled, only 22% of respondents said they confidence in Trump to do the right thing on the world stage, a 52-point difference from his predecessor
Their overall opinion of the US had also fallen steeply since the end of the Obama administration. Less than half of those surveyed said they had a favourable view of the US, compared to 64% at the end of President Obama's second term.
However, political turmoil may not be the only factor behind the disappointing figures. Easter, a traditionally busy time for international travel, fell in April this year compared to March in 2016, meaning Easter travel statistics would not be included in first quarter data this year.
The strength of the dollar may also be driving tourists away from the US in favour of a destination where their money will stretch further.
In June, Chris Thompson, CEO of a company which markets the US abroad, told CBS that politics had “little or nothing to do” with destination choices compared to the currency exchange rate.
Damien Duff to join Melbourne City after World Cup following end to Fulham career
Damien Duff will move to the A-League this summer
The 35-year-old left Fulham after five seasons at Craven Cottage
Duff will be first major signing for newly-formed Melbourne City
Former Ireland international was linked with a move to Bray Wanderers
Former Republic of Ireland winger Damien Duff is poised to move to Australia and become the first major signing for the club bought by Manchester City's owners.
The 35-year-old, who announced his decision to quit relegated Fulham this week, will join the A-League after the World Cup Finals.
He will become the first major signing for the newly-formed Melbourne City, who are hoping to change their name from Melbourne Heart in time for next season.
City's Abu Dhabi-based owners, who have also purchased sides in New York and Japan since acquiring Manchester City six years ago, are hoping to build a competitive side Down Under. Heart are currently bottom of the A-League.
Heading Down Under: Damien Duff has signed for Australian A-League club Melbourne City on a one-year deal
Duff, capped 100 times by Ireland, had been linked with a return to his home country and a role with Bray Wanderers in the SSE Airtricity League. But he has turned his back on a potential return to the Premier League or any moves to clubs in Europe, or even a drop to the Championship with Fulham, to move Down Under.
Duff will take a summer break with his family before moving to Melbourne for the second part of their season. He has had his pick of A-League sides, including Heart's city rivals Melbourne Victory, Sydney FC and Perth Glory. City's backers are prepared to match Duff's wage demands.
His decision to quit Europe for a lucrative move to Australia will still come as a surprise, even though he made just 11 league appearances last season.
New chapter: The 35-year-old brought an end to his five-year spell at Fulham and will head to the A-League
Former Chelsea and Newcastle midfielder Duff left Craven Cottage after five years and nearly 200 games, following their relegation from the Premier League, and was looking for a new challenge.
‘It was time for everyone, for me and the club to part ways,' he said. ‘It's sad but that's the way it is.
‘I've matured as a person and a player at Fulham.
‘Since I've been here I've got married, had two kids, so it has been a special time in my life and I stand by what I've said before that my most enjoyable time in football has been at Fulham.'
But Duff, who is signing an initial two-year deal, will be by far the biggest foreign star Melbourne has attracted since the A-League was founded 10 years ago.
I knew when I decided to write about this topic I would probably offend a whole lot of people and have death threats made against me. But in my endless drive to educate the unenlightened proletariat on the truth and madness of the restaurant/ foodservice industry, I had to express myself on this subject. Please bear in mind I literally have 34 years of blood, sweat, and tears invested in this business, with a myriad of observations, and in no way am I trying to demean anyone, I am just pointing out the truth after interviewing many people like myself in the trade, and drawing from my own humble experience.
It seems the term “chef” is given out like candy to anyone who can lift a knife and cut a vegetable. Someone who graduates from culinary school with no previous experience is called a chef and enters the work force expecting a huge salary and an executive title without paying the dues. I decided a long time ago I would rather be a good cook than a great chef. I have worked and run the 4-star hotels and resorts and I know how to make the fancy French cuisine that impresses the ostentatious crowd of gastronomic snobs. But by choice, most of my career has been getting down and dirty making burgers, sandwiches and chicken wings for the everyday people who just want a good meal at a good price. Fancy food is exciting, but no one eats like that all the time.
Now don't get me wrong, if you graduated from culinary school and cook for your family and friends that is great, I am happy for you and wish you the best. But if you are looking for a job as the executive chef or kitchen manager position on a line filled with people who have worked their way up from the bottom of the kitchen food chain (bus boy or dish washer), you had better be prepared to work 60 or more hours a week, sweep and mop the floors, wash the pots and pans if needed, and scrub down the kitchen like the rest of them. You can't sit on your laurels and write the menu and spend all day at the organic produce market and then expect everyone else to sweat to make your recipe and menu ideas come to life. You will never get the reverence you think you deserve. I am sure you have great recipes and menu ideas, but I hope you are prepared to make them 40 times a day for 7 days in a row, 365 a year. This isn't a dinner party you are doing once, with 12 people showing up, and sitting at the table with their place cards and a glass of the flavor of the month. And the dish needs to taste the same every time you make it, or when someone else is making it if you aren't there.
For all of us who work and toil in the industry, we applaud the fact that you went to school, and we pray for your success. My research has shown that a few things are not mentioned to the students. There are long hours for low pay and you will have to work holidays. You have to cover when someone calls in sick or hung-over (believe me it happens all the time, especially after payday). You will be the only cook on a busy night and you will have to do dishes or wait on customers. You will have to put the deliveries away and you may get your chef coat dirty. You might actually have to stock the kitchen yourself, do the prep work and cook all at once. Food you think is perfect is going to get sent back to be prepared correctly (gasp!). It isn't an easy life, and that is why we take exception to those who walk into the kitchen with big ideas and no understanding. I am not bitter or resentful because I never went to school. I learned a long time ago to keep my mouth shut and listen to those who have been around the block. School is great, but this is an industry where you never learn everything. It is also an industry that will chew you up and spit you out if you let it. You could spend a lifetime just learning the food of one culture. So if you ever get the opportunity to run a brigade, make sure you tell them “great job” after every service, and buy them a round of drinks after you help them clean up.
I cheated at Pokémon Go. And I liked it.
It took a lot of work to become a level 21 Pokémon trainer. A lot of walking, a lot of swiping, a lot of stardust. I live in Australia, so I was there on day one when the game launched in our country first. The energy was amazing, the lures were plentiful. I was there at the first major Pokémon walk at the Sydney Opera House. The times were good.
But after a few weeks the game was starting to feel like a serious grind if I wanted to keep up with the high-powered Pokémon I saw sitting atop the local gyms. Was this the end of the road for me? What could help me find the fun again? Could cheating be the answer?

I'd heard about Pokémon Go bots you could run on your computer: an app that pretends to be you, walking around town, doing all the things a Pokémon trainer would do. Hatch those eggs. Catch those 'mons. Spin those stops. Rinse. Repeat. Forever. Unlike real people, those bots don't have day jobs or family relationships to maintain. They can wander around town like the men and women of virtual leisure they are.
Botting sounds difficult, but I thought I'd start a new account -- to keep my 'real' account free of the taint of cheating -- and see how things work. My goal: to bot my way to level 30. That seemed far from my grasp on my real account. Far from the grasp of my real, human shell.
Gotta bot 'em all
There are more than a few bot options out there. Some paid. Some free. I found a free Java app that looked pretty basic. The hardest part was finding the GPS coordinates of where I wanted virtual me to start hunting for Pokémon. Then I opened up a terminal window, ran a command from the command line, and away we Go.
Next thing I know, I'm watching the terminal spit out a list of information. Where I am. When I'm spinning PokeStops. When I'm catching Pokémon. And boy could I catch Pokémon. The bot was moving at a jogging speed (you could customise how fast it covered ground too) and it caught everything in its path. My experience points were gliding rapidly through the early levels and my bot was level 10 in short order.
I'm not going to lie. It was fun to see how easy it was to cheat and how quickly my collection was growing. If I really wanted to catch 'em all, was it so bad to just send out a bot to do it for me?
At this early stage the bot was very basic. My bags would fill quickly and the bot couldn't do any more for me except walk around hatching eggs. I'd have to open the app manually and empty things out. Mulch those worthless Pokémon into candy. Get rid of a lot of Pokeballs and potions. (Who needs potions when you're botting? We're here to catch, not to fight.) Start the process over.
But when I'd check back on the open-source bot project there were constant updates. Over the coming weeks my bot learned how to throw curve balls and how to transfer Pokémon and drop items so I didn't have to login and do it manually.
Enlarge Image Screenshot / Seamus Byrne
My favourite update was when I could see the names of the PokeStops it was visiting. Suddenly my data dump felt like a legitimate virtual me wandering the streets of Sydney. I'd notice when I was in a park nearby, or near local landmarks, or even right outside our office. That sense of my virtual location in the real world made my bot feel more tangible. A virtual real me playing the real virtual game.
It even learned how to show me all the magic hidden statistics for the Pokémon it caught.
Chasing the dragon(ite)
When it comes to determining how good your Pokémon are, the hidden IVs, individual values, are everything. Attack, Defense, Stamina. Each a score out of 15. Every Pokémon has these hidden stats that decide whether or not your Pokémon is a 'perfect' specimen of its kind. Or a terrible one. And now I could see these stats for every catch and know which Pokémon to keep and which to trash. To do this manually is tricky, and mostly an estimate, not an accurate insight into the real numbers behind the veil.
My bot lived behind the magic curtain. It could see all. It was my Great and Powerful Oz. With its power the game was mine to dominate with a host of ultimate powered Pokémon ready to destroy gyms at my whim. (Well, it felt that way at the time...)
Another update brought more automated perfection as the bot gained the power to instantly trash any Pokémon that didn't live up to elite IV standards. My bot would trash anything that was less than 800 combat points or less than 80 percent on its IV ratings. And it would only ever keep the three 'best' Pokémon of any kind.
I was loving it. The bot was a game within a game. It became something different to what Pokémon Go was meant to be, but it was intoxicating. A lottery system where winning was not a matter of 'if', but 'how much'. Leave it running and come back later to see what prizes had been collected. My collection rapidly became nothing but excellent specimens across the board and plenty of rare Pokémon I'd never encountered on my 'real' account, which was now looking rather neglected -- were my Pokémon IVs any good on that account? I didn't even know. The real Pokémon Go wouldn't tell me.
The great bot crash
Then the bot stopped working.
It always had an issue with crashing after a couple of hours. Authentication would drop and wouldn't reconnect without a little manual jumpstart. You just had to remember to check in and reset the bot. But this time it looked permanent. Niantic Labs, the company behind Pokémon Go, was cracking down on bots and had added layers of security to the system to prevent these unauthorised systems from accessing the game.
I was level 28. Two levels short of my goal, but still 500,000 XP short. Five thousand Pokémon catches away.
I checked the bot update page hourly for any news on a fix. I was feeling way more upset about seeing my cheating come to an early end than I should have.
The community building the bot was hard at work looking for angles to break an encryption system Niantic had put in their way.
Within four days the bot was working again. It seemed there was nothing Niantic could do to stop the cheaters in their tracks. I breathed a sigh of relief, updated the app again and got back on my journey to level 30.
Lessons from a cheat at level 30
Screenshot / Seamus Byrne
Level 30 arrived soon after. The magic milestone of 2 million experience points. Getting to level 30 is the same as getting to level 21 nine times. NINE. TIMES. Did I really want to put in the same amount of work I'd put into getting to level 21 another nine times over? It just didn't seem worth the effort.
The biggest trick my emotionless bot pulled was never getting bored catching the same cheap Pokémon over and over again. Every catch added up, a few XP at a time, toward that climb up the ranks. Human me was tired of catching Zubats, the most common thing in our area of town. My bot was sitting on a mountain of over 5,000 Zubat candies.
During the climb I'd even reset my minimum IV demand to 90 percent. So many Pokémon were being caught, I could be choosier on what to bother keeping. The virtual velvet rope became ever more exclusive. My level 30 now sat on a throne surrounded by the most glorious of Pokémon. Dragonites, Arcanines, Lapras. Yes, I checked, that's the correct plural for Lapras.
Statistically, it was great. I was rich in the raw data of Pokémon Go success.
But when I shut down the bot and logged into the account on my iPad again a few days later, something felt off. I didn't recognise the collection in front of me. It wasn't really mine. I knew their stats were great. I'd looked inside these Pokémon like Neo looks inside the Matrix. But I didn't know where they'd been caught. I'd never felt the thrill of spotting the rares on a map and panicking to catch them before they ran away. There was no story of the moment I caught that Dragonite and who else was around catching one too. Was it even a catch? Had I evolved it? I didn't really know.

The rush of the automated climb to 30 meant the moments in between didn't exist.
The following weekend I went back out for a walk with my kids and my level 21 'real' account. We wandered local streets, caught Pokémon, watched Pokémon flee, manually spun the PokeStops. We hoped for something special to appear. We laughed. We played.
After disappearing down the stat hole and chasing the thrill of playing numbers, coming back to the real experience of Pokémon Go was fun again. It was fun like at the start, when we didn't care what level we were, we just had some fun catching Pokémon.
When that next level would arrive didn't matter anymore. We were just having fun connecting with our neighbourhood landmarks while riding bikes and scooters on a sunny day. The journey, not the destination.
Three weeks later and I logged back into my cheat account to take another look. Or rather, I tried. The account had been terminated. Niantic Labs had caught up with the cheats once more and this time they brought the big guns. That dazzling collection of overpowered Pokémon was no more.
And I didn't really care. They weren't mine anyway.
My best Pokémon is the Lapras I hatched from a 10km egg while walking down a country lane with my kids in July. I don't know its IV, but I remember the sound we made when it popped into existence.
New York Clinton Correctional Facility employee Joyce Mitchell – who engaged in a sexual relationship with an inmate and helped him and a second prisoner stage a dramatic escape – ended up pleading guilty earlier this week.
Before this gripping story made national headlines, the idea of correctional employees smuggling dangerous contraband into prisons or having sexual relationships with inmates may have seemed more grounded in the world of fiction than in reality.
However, inappropriate relationships occur with surprising regularity in day-to-day prison operations – a fact supported by research and also acknowledged by those who work within correctional facilities. These types of interactions between inmates and prison employees are consensual, almost always illegal and usually involve some sort of economic or sexual transaction.
In an attempt to ameliorate this problem, virtually every employee who is hired to work in a prison or jail must go through some type of pre-service training. The trainings are essentially designed to indoctrinate staff into a “custodial mindset,” a philosophy that legitimizes and enforces boundaries between prisoners and employees.
Nevertheless, in spite of this training, not all correctional employees respect boundaries; some repeatedly cross the line with the very inmates they're paid to supervise.
Over the past several years, I've gone to great lengths to ascertain how inappropriate staff–inmate relationships unfold: I've interviewed inmates who have been successful in establishing these relationships, and I've also administered anonymous self-report surveys to both inmates and correctional employees.
It's evident that some inmates are extremely adept at being able to identify vulnerable prison staffers. After subtly feeling out a target, they're often relentless in their pursuit of inappropriate relationships with these employees. With nothing but time to pass, a skilled inmate manipulator will make every attempt to turn even the most dedicated correctional employee into a deviant one.
Homing in on a target
I once interviewed Tommy, an inmate incarcerated at a prison facility in the southwestern United States. He told me he preferred to target female correctional employees who were sexually frustrated or in an unhappy relationship. He also pursued women who'd been victims of domestic violence.
For roughly two years, Tommy had a series of inappropriate relationships with female staff members that went undetected. He was able to convince multiple female staff members to smuggle tobacco into the facility, which he would then sell to other inmates at a hefty profit. He also admitted to having had a number of sexual trysts with at least two female correctional officers.
However, his luck ran out when another inmate reported that Tommy was having sex with a female kitchen employee.
Asked how this relationship began, Tommy explained:
I was the one who broke the ice. I just started talking to this female kitchen boss and acting real friendly like. She was married but said her husband didn't have sex with her and was always cheating on her. It started out just like when you go to a bar. She talked, and I just listened. Soon we began flirting more and more. We'd go to the storeroom where she could lock the doors to give us privacy.
Some inmates have told me that they prefer to establish inappropriate relationships with staff members who they perceive as unattractive, overweight or sexually frustrated.
One inmate, Oscar, explained to me that these types of employees are easy to control and manipulate.
“We like single, older women who are basically tossed out and nasty,” he said, before claiming that women who are neglected in the “free world” will be “worshiped” by inmates.
I also spoke with Philip, an HIV-positive prisoner. Philip casually described having unprotected sex with a female correctional employee on several occasions. He explained that the staff member had recently gone through a nasty divorce and was lonely and vulnerable. He even bragged that she would have brought in a weapon for him if he'd requested one.
Money to be made
Approximately 93% of the inmates who are incarcerated within the United States are males. In male facilities, when inappropriate relationships occur, it's often the inmate who initiates the inappropriate relationship.
While the majority of the inmates whom I've interviewed established inappropriate relationships with female correctional employees, it should be noted that some male prison staff also cross the line with inmates.
One inmate, Richard, gleefully told me that tobacco-free prison policies create the opportunity for a black market, with correctional officers playing a key role.
“There's a lot of money for bosses [correctional officers] to make,” he said. “Bosses can get rich if they deal tobacco and nothing else. Some bosses make more money from selling cigarettes than they do from their monthly paycheck.”
Time on their side
To help people truly understand the dynamics of inappropriate relationships, I find the metaphor of fishing is often quite useful. Inmates will use a lot of different lures and types of bait to entice staff members into having inappropriate relationships. Often nothing comes of it. But sometimes, it works.
I once had an inmate named Felix describe how he liked to give correctional employees little gifts like food, in an attempt to cultivate a relationship that could possibly lead to “all kinds of things.”
“Sometimes they take it and sometimes they don't,” he continued. “When they do, it's like a ﬁsh on a hook. You just got to reel them in slow. It takes patience. Hey all I got is time, man, so time is on my side.”
Over the course of months – even years – many inmates learn the habits, mannerisms, likes and dislikes of the staff. And skilled inmate manipulators are extraordinarily adept at convincing correctional employees that they're in no physical danger and won't be endangering anyone else by having sex or sneaking in contraband.
At the same time, staff members – especially those who become romantically involved with inmates – may, over time, begin to view inmates as legitimate sexual partners. There's a normalizing effect that takes place. With the right amount of inmate encouragement, coupled with lax supervisors, some correctional employees may come to see their work environment as nightclubs or places to flirt with members of the opposite sex, rather than facilities that warehouse dangerous criminals.
‘I was caught up in the fantasy'
It's extremely unlikely that Joyce Mitchell took up employment in the Clinton Correctional Facility in order to have sexual liaisons with inmates, help them escape and use them as pawns in a murder plot. Rather, the inmates she helped – Richard Matt and David Sweat – were adept inmate manipulators.
In her confession, Mitchell stated, “I was caught up in the fantasy…I enjoyed the attention, the feeling both of them gave me, and the thought of a different life.”
Clearly, both men perceived that Mitchell was lonely and unhappy in her personal life. They used both charm and flattery to convince her to cross over that sacrosanct border between correctional employee and inmate. It's amazing that Mitchell even considered abandoning her husband to go on the lam with two violent convicted murderers. This, indeed, illustrates the power that some inmates hold over their captors.
Even though our nation's prisons are filled with inmate manipulators, this in no way excuses the behavior of deviant correctional employees, such as Joyce Mitchell. It does, however, help us understand how inappropriate relationships are able to flourish, in spite of strong, organizational cultural norms that discourage familiarity between staff and offenders.
Need A Price For A Hip Operation? Good Luck With That
Let's say your 62-year-old granny is feeling creaky. One of her hips has been giving her trouble, and her doctor tells her it's time to get it replaced with an implant.
There's a catch. Grandma isn't old enough for Medicare and she doesn't have health insurance. She does, however, have a stack of cash in the bank and is willing to pay for surgery right away.
So how much will it cost her?
Who knows. Seriously.
Researchers from Iowa called 20 top-rated orthopedic hospitals across the country using a script based on Grandma's predicament. They asked for the lowest price (everything included) for a total hip replacement. The researchers also asked two other hospitals in each state and Washington, D.C., for good measure.
Getting an answer wasn't easy. Of the top 20 hospitals, only 9, or 45 percent, provided a bundled price that included fees for both the doctors and the facilities.
But that response looks terrific compared with how the other hospitals did. The researchers were able to get a bundled price estimate from only 10, or about 10 percent, of the other 102 hospitals they queried.
The researchers were able to piece together prices in quite a few instances by contacting doctor groups when hospitals provided only their fees.
Even after incorporating those figures, however, total pricing information was available for only 60 percent of the top hospitals and 63 percent of the others.
The prices obtained varied widely: from a low of $11,100 to more than $125,000.
The findings were just published online by JAMA Internal Medicine.
Why couldn't more hospitals comply? Some said a doctor would need to see a patient before an estimate could be given. Others said they didn't give out prices over the phone. Some just said there was no way they could do it.
"Our calls to hospitals were often greeted by uncertainty and confusion by the hospital representatives about how to assist us," the researchers wrote. "It is sobering to compare our experience with the best practices we have come to expect from other service industries."
Buying a car used to be like this, an accompanying editorial points out: "A 2013 hip replacement looks a lot like a 1954 Buick." But a 1958 federal law that required dealers to post sticker prices on vehicles began a long road to fuller disclosure about prices and specifications that have changed the marketplace for automobiles.
Now it's time for hospitals and doctors to do a better job, the authors of the editorial write. "There is no justification for the inability to report a fee estimate, or a 12-fold price variation for a common elective procedure," they declare.
As a matter of fact, they argue, the health care business is even worse off than the car business was. Many doctors and hospitals don't know the price of their products, unlike car dealers.
Still, there's hope, the editorialists say.
"The history of the automobile industry shows that information asymmetry is treatable," they write. "Health care will need to travel down a similar path. It is time we stop forcing people to buy health care services blindfolded — and then blame them for not seeing."
The chance of guessing a coin flip 248 times in a row is 1 in 452 trevigintillion—a 75-digit number. Winning the lottery—at odds of a couple hundred million to one—looks like a sure thing by comparison.
The likelihood of picking the best performing stock in the S&P 500 every trading day—248 of them—this year is even smaller than guessing those coin flips. Nonetheless, if you did it in 2014, you could have made yourself a billionaire in just eight and a half months from a $1,000 investment. You would have made more money than most American households make in an entire year in just over two months. By now you'd be the richest person in the world, with at least twice as much money as anyone else on the planet, $179 billion.
To accomplish this feat, you'd have to invest entirely in just one stock every day, and that stock would have to be the largest gainer of the S&P 500 on that day. Each day you'd reinvest all of your money in what you'd thought would be that day's largest gainer, and you'd have to be right.
Here's how it would have gone:
Of course once you've made enough money it would be impossible to put it all into one stock without drastically affecting the stock's price. Before long, you'd find that there were not enough shares to buy, or that you had purchased an entire company—a situation that we ignored for our analysis. Furthermore, we did not include trading fees nor changes in the composition of the S&P and we assumed that investment in fractional shares was allowed by all companies.
A trader with this kind of unbelievable luck would have made less this year than a similar one last year. In 2013, that trader would have made $263 billion through the second week of December.
Why are written French and spoken French so different?
A really interesting answer to a question on Quora, from Andrew MacKenzie. Quora is sometimes weird about making you log in to read things, but I think this link will work.
The answer describes several areas where written and spoken French are different, and it's worth reading in full, but I want to focus on discourse configuration. Here's the first bit of what MacKenzie says about it:
Written French word order is based on argument structure, i.e. the role the nouns play in the verb's action: Subject verb object. In spoken French, however, word order is much more dependent on discourse structure— the role the nouns play in the speech context.
In English we can move things around for this kind of reason, but it isn't common. For instance, to show contrast, we can put objects before subjects:
(4) Coffee, I like. Tea, I don't.
This displacement is accompanied by a sharp change in intonation— the contrasted item gets emphasized.
We can also set nouns apart as topics (this is called topicalization)
(5) Your brother, he can run a mile in five minutes!
Again, in English this isn't common. And in written French, it isn't common either. But in spoken French, it's the normal way to make a sentence.
(4 again) Le café, j'adore. Le thé, moins
(5 again) Ton frère, il peut courir un km six en cinq minutes!
In spoken French, it's also common to put several nouns in front. Note that with topicalization (5) you have to have a pronoun in the sentence that refers to any arguments that you've topicalized. One sentence that I remember well:
(6) Moi, les flics, je les aime pas.
I don't like cops [Lit: Me, cops, I don't like ‘em]
The use of nous, on for “we” is common, too, if you're interested in syntax-semantic mismatches (on is 3rd singular morphologically)
(7) Nous, on va au ciné ce soir.
We're going to the movies tonight [Lit: Us, one is going to the movies tonight]
It's also normal to put things after the sentence. This is usually done to emphasize the last constituent, notably the predicate. The emphasized part is pronounced with more loudness and higher pitch.
(8) Il est con , ton frère.
Your brother's a jerk. [Lit: He's a jerk, your brother ]
The next one was some advice from my mother-in-law
(9) Faut en boire , du café, le matin.
You have to drink coffee in the mornings
[Lit: have-to some drink, coffee, the morning ] (Full text)
He mentions that he can't speak for Belgium or Canada, but as a fluent second-language French speaker living in Montreal, I can definitely say that discourse configuration is very common here, and I hadn't actually realized it was quite so common in France.
I also get the sense that it's more acceptable to drop the object in contexts where you definitely can't do so in English. For example,
(10) Je peux goûter?
Can I try some? [Lit.I can taste? ]
I could also just not be hearing the objects though, since the /l/ is often deleted in casual speech for the object pronouns le, la, l', les, which makes them almost inaudible. Any French speakers from anywhere want to weigh in?
Months after Kurdish-led forces kicked Islamic State out of Syria's Manbij, change is in the air with IS-imposed burqas replaced by a women's council. Now, however, the city finds itself on the edge of the Turkish-Kurdish conflict, RT's Lizzie Phelan reports.
READ MORE: Assad: No one invited US to Manbij, all foreign troops in Syria without permission are ‘invaders'
The US-backed, Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) liberated Manbij, some 135 kilometers (84 miles) from the Islamic State (IS, ISIS/ISIL) stronghold of Raqqa in August 2016. While many of the buildings still lie in ruins, the city's bustling hum is apparent, Phelan reports from Manbij.
The city seems gradually returning to the way of life it enjoyed before the occupation of jihadists, who enforced their radical interpretation of Islam onto locals after overrunning the city in 2014. Under IS rule, Manbij women were effectively banned from leaving their homes and had to adhere to a mandatory dress code, covering themselves in head-to-toe burqas. Following the city's liberation, the images of women burning and ripping off these garments went viral, becoming a symbol of resistance to fanatical terrorist rule.

The contrast between what the residents of the city had to endure under Islamic State and what they experience now is striking, Nour, a young woman, told Phelan, saying that “there was no life for us, we just lived – eating and drinking, everything was prohibited.”
“But right now, things have progressed and Manbij has developed. Thank God all institutions, schools, everything have reopened and are better than before. Honestly, we didn't expect this development,” she added.
Women in Manbij have gone a step further, setting up their own council to gain control over their future. RT's Phelan witnessed the opening of the council on March 25, attended by dozens of local women wearing colorful headscarves.
Not only women's life has changed dramatically following liberation, life has been breathed into the whole city, which is now swarming with locals and cars. People are streaming into the reopened shops that sell everything from snacks to jeans.
Zacharia, a jeans store owner, told Phelan that local businesses have been reassured by the current situation in the city.
“Manbij right now is being run very well, there is no looting. Girls and children go out... there is no pressure on them. We don't need better or worse, what we have now is perfect for us,” he said.

Buses are running from Manbij to other parts of Syria, in particular to the capital, Damascus, through the city of Azaz, controlled by Turkey-backed rebels from the Free Syrian Army (FSA). Azaz is some 32 kilometers (20 miles) northwest of Aleppo – and just five kilometers from the Turkish border.
The proximity of Manbij to Turkish troops, who view Kurdish militias including the YPG, part of the SDF, as terrorists, has now become a major concern for the locals, who now fear that a new confrontation, this time between the SDF and Turkish troops, can spell another war inside the city, Phelan reports.

Turkey claims the growing strength of the Kurdish militias may enable them to pursue the fight for a so-called Greater Kurdistan, which includes eastern Turkish territories as well as parts of Syria and Iraq. The Syrian Kurds, however, deny they have any designs on foreign lands.
“On the ground, there is only military cooperation to fight terrorism and liberate areas controlled by radicals… The idea we will extend our project [to Greater Kurdistan] is not true because our project is based on a shared and democratic vision, all parts of the community participate,” Kemal Berkel, deputy executive president of the city's Kobane canton, told Phelan.
“This makes many sides unhappy, because they don't want to see an end to the Syrian crisis, they want it to continue,” he said.

The Turks have claimed that the Kurds are oppressing the city's Arab population, but locals who talked with Phelan did not appear to have any need for “liberation” from the Turkish troops.
“We don't like Erdoğan, we like the SDF – we don't want either Turkey or the FSA,” a woman said.
“We don't want Turkish involvement, the situation here is very good and comfortable… why would we need someone to come and occupy our territory?” a man called Mahmoud said.
Turkey has been supporting the FSA on the ground since its army's incursion into Syria in August 2016 within the Operation codenamed Euphrates Shield. While the goal of the intervention was stated by the Turkish authorities as targeting IS positions along the Syrian-Turkish border, Kurdish militias have been arguing that they are the real target of the Turk offensive.

As the conflict risked spiraling into a full-blown war between Turkish forces and the US-backed SDF on Syrian territory, the Pentagon used the tense situation as a pretext to dispatch hundreds of Marines to Manbij in early March. At the time, Sharfan Darwish, spokesman for the Manbij Military Council, justified the deployment of forces by “the increase in Turkish threats to occupy the city,” citing incidents of sporadic exchanges of fire that had already occurred outside Manbij between Kurdish and Turkish forces.
Meanwhile, the dispatch of US forces was condemned by the Syrian authorities, with Syrian President Bashar Assad calling the uninvited troops “invaders,” arguing that the presence of the US military only destabilized the situation.
The US “didn't succeed anywhere they sent troops, they only create a mess; they are very good in creating problems and destroying, but they are very bad in finding solutions,” Assad said in an interview with Chinese media earlier in March.
Hi there guys! here goes a image I'm done the last February as cover for the metal band "Hound of Hades". This pic was done in livestream, was a rly fun comision to do, love cerberus and the idea of showing him at hell´s gate. hope you like itif you want to know more of Hound of hades here goes their website and FB15hours/bamboo/pscs3/music:Hound Of Hades-Galtons Theory-------------------------------------------------------------------------Lets wikiattack!!Cerberus or Kerberos, (Greek form: Κέρβερος, kerberos) in Greek and Roman mythology, is a multi-headed hound (usually three-headed) which guards the gates of The Underworld, to prevent those who have crossed the river Styx from ever escaping. Cerberus featured in many works of ancient Greek and Roman literature and in works of both ancient and modern art and architecture, although, the depiction and background surrounding Cerberus often differed across various works by different authors of the era. The most notable difference is the number of its heads: Most sources describe or depict three heads; others show it with two or even just one; a smaller number of sources show a variable number, sometimes as many as 50.Cerberus is said to be the sibling of the Lernaean Hydra, the Nemean Lion, the Sphinx, the Ladon, and the Chimera.Cerberus was the offspring of Echidna, a hybrid half-woman and half-serpent, and Typhon, a fire-breathing giant whom even the Olympian gods feared. Its brother is Orthrus, always depicted as a two-headed hellhound. The three-heads can respectively see and represent the past, the present, and the future, while other sources suggest the heads represent birth, youth, and old age. Each of Cerberus' heads is said to have an appetite only for live meat and thus allow the spirits of the dead to freely enter the underworld, but allow none to leave. Cerberus was always employed as Hades' loyal watchdog, and guarded the gates that granted access and exit to the underworld (also called Hades).Capturing Cerberus alive, without using weapons, was the final labour assigned to Heracles (Hercules) by King Eurystheus, in recompense for the killing of his own children by Megara after he was driven insane by Hera, and therefore was the most dangerous and difficult. In the traditional version, Heracles would not have been required to capture Cerberus, however Eurystheus discounted the completion of two of the tasks as Heracles had received assistance.After having been given the task, Heracles went to Eleusis to be initiated in the Eleusinian Mysteries so that he could learn how to enter and exit the underworld alive, and in passing absolve himself for killing centaurs. He found the entrance to the underworld at Tanaerum, and Athena and Hermes helped him to traverse the entrance in each direction. He passed Charon with Hestia's assistance and his own heavy and fierce frowning.Whilst in the underworld, Heracles met Theseus and Pirithous. The two companions had been imprisoned by Hades for attempting to kidnap Persephone. One tradition tells of snakes coiling around their legs then turning into stone; another that Hades feigned hospitality and prepared a feast inviting them to sit. They unknowingly sat in chairs of forgetfulness and were permanently ensnared. When Heracles had pulled Theseus first from his chair, some of his thigh stuck to it (this explains the supposedly lean thighs of Athenians), but the earth shook at the attempt to liberate Pirithous, whose desire to have the wife of a god for himself was so insulting he was doomed to stay behind.Heracles found Hades and asked permission to bring Cerberus to the surface, which Hades agreed to if Heracles could overpower the beast without using weapons. Heracles was able to overpower Cerberus and proceeded to sling the beast over his back, dragging it out of the underworld through a cavern entrance in the Peloponnese and bringing it to Eurystheus. The king was so frightened of the beast that he jumped into a pithos, and asked Heracles to return it to the underworld in return for releasing him from his labors.-------------------------------------------------------------------------This image is featured in along with other mythological pics of this gallery in Legendary Visions Artbook edited by you can order it on amazonAmazon USA: [link] Legendary visions, 30 USD, Free shipping worldwide in bookdepository!
Everyone knows Jamaica tends to produce the best sprinters and Ethiopia often has the best distance runners, but how do other countries' top runners fare compare to the best in the world?
Seth Kadish created a map that visualizes how much slower a country's best time is compared to the world record on his Vizual Statistix blog. He did this for the 100 m, 1500 m, 10 km, and marathons using data from alltime-athletics.com.
The U.S. fares pretty well and is no more than 2 percent slower than the world record for each race. As expected, African countries fare better in distance runs than they do in the 100 m. Overall, Asian countries tend to do the worst among the represented countries, as most are 3 to 4 percent slower than the world record in every race. In the 10 km most of the continent is at least 6 percent slower than the world record. South American countries also don't fare too well in the 10 km.
The gray areas indicate data wasn't available for that country, and obviously, this accounts for a big portion of the world. These are generally nations that aren't as competitive in these events, however, so the map can stand as a broad measuring stick of where the nations stand.

The Longyou Grottoes, located in Longyou area in Zhejiang province, have been reported by many news media ever since they were first found in 1992. They have been draped with mysterious colors and have attracted the attention of archaeologists, tourists and many others.
It will take about one hour to get to the destination from Jinhua City, traveling about 70 kilometers per hour. Shiyanbei is small village within Yazhou region in the middle of Zhejing province, this village, sitting at the foot of the mountain on the North and facing the water to the south, has been regarded as the treasure place with geomantic omen since olden times. Looking over from one end of the village, you can see a wide field of vision with Qujiang River revolving around and passing by the village, which gives you a sense of enchanting illusion. There is a temple in a bamboo forest on one side of the river close to the village; the temple is full of the burning incense and Buddha sound.
On June 9,1992, Grandma Wu with three other villagers, after 17 days pumping using four pumping machines, revealed to the whole world such a mystery that could match with the discovery of a UFO. Grandma Wu took the lead entering into the mysterious underground world full of magnificence and complicated confusions. The grottoes won peoples admiration and also left people confused. Groping for half a day in the grottoes was an unforgettable experience of a life. An introduction of preliminary points of view from individual observation is reported here as a reference.
I. Scale and characteristics of Longyou Grottoes:
Longyou Grottoes have been asserted as the ninth miracles in China after Great Wall and The Tomb of the Emperor of the Qing Dynasty. From a preliminary observation, the author thought that Longyou Grottoes surpass the Great Wall in terms of the causation, scale as well as the artistic value. It was summed up as the following eight points:
1). Longyou Grottos are huge and extensive in scale.
Judging from the 7 unearthed grottoes, the Longyou Grottoes were huge projects and the model was consistent with others. The model, pattern and the style are extremely similar. On the whole, the distribution is very reasonable, the No.1 grotto, the smallest, covers an area of 300 square meters, No.2 to No.5 grottoes covers an area of 900 square meters, 1,200 square meters, 2,000 square meters and 700 square meters respectively. The whole covering area of the 5 grottoes reaches 5,100 square meters. It is understood that there are 23 similar grottoes underground within the circumference of 1 square kilometer of the Shiyanbei village. There are about 50 to 70 similar grottoes under the ground in the Longyou area within circumference of 2.88 square kilometer. Calculated at a covering area of 1,000 square meters per grotto, one grotto will need to dig out 20,000 square meters of soil. Calculated according to 50 grottoes, it will need to dig out 1,000,000 square meters of soil. If we calculate the digging rate of 0.3 square meters per day per person, it will take 2,000,000 days to finish. According to the statistics. It will take 1,000 persons six years to work day and night without break to finish this project. Since the model was consistent, the technology was particular and delicate with the care and precision of a sculptor, the actual workload would far surpass the theoretic estimation.
2). The design of Longyou Grottoes is delicate and scientific.
The scale of the Longyou Grottoes is magnificent and momentous, the design was delicate and scientific, the construction was standard and sophisticated, and it had the glamour of superlative craftsmanship. Every grotto itself is a grand hall, presenting a shape of an inverted Carpenters Square with a small outlet and larger bottom. One side is steep and another side is 45% inclined. Four walls are straight; the edges and corners are clearly demarcated. The chiseling marks are arranged orderly on the roof and the walls of the grottoes, the chiseling line was uniform, the straight line is straight line and the curve line is curve line. The widths are all about 1 foot as if the same person made them. They looked as if they were made by machine. There are stairs leading up and down along the wall in the shape of a saw-tooth. There is distance of three meters between saw-teeth. It is four meters long from the platform to the outlet. Every grotto has huge stone pillars ranging from four at most to one at least to support the roof, the perimeters are 10 meters at most and 5 meters at least. Every Grotto is in a shape of triangle with the peak pointing inside and the base facing front. Every grotto was well separated and there was no connection between grottoes. There is a huge square pool 5 meters deep with a area of 20 square meters that was half-carved and half-laid. A clear rock picture was seen at a point of 10 meters high in No.1 grotto containing three animals a horse, bird and fish. This was the only rock picture found in the seven grottoes. The line and pattern are simple and vigorous, straightforward and uninhibited, full of artistic conceptions.
3). The construction marks of Longyou Grottoes are still fresh.
The accurate starting date of the huge and delicately designed Longyou Grottoes was nowhere to be found. The records of the human studies of Longyou started in the Han dynasty. There were no traceable records before. From historic information of Zhou and Qin dynasties and the documents from Tang dynasty, Hanyu wrote The Monumental to Xuyuan Emperor . There was the record showing "to make the room by chiseling to set a memorial temple for Emperor Yuan". Emperor Yuan was the fifth emperor in the West Zhou (eleventh century BC to 77 year BC.). There is no record of how huge the "room" is. In chiseling the stone to make the room, and the association with the grottoes in Longyou still is questionable. If it was, the grottoes were built at least 2,500 or 3,000 years ago. They have gone through numerous floods and calamities and wars in such a long period, the mountains have changed their appearance and the exposed stones have been weathered, but the shape, patterns and marks are still fresh, as if it were made yesterday.
II. The dissection and question about the Longyou Grottoes;
After on the spot investigation plus quotation of the works of classics, scientists and scholars have put forward many explanations for the Grottoes, but most of them could not justify themselves so they were unconvincing
1) Theory of the tomb (including the theory of emperor palace and theory of storage)
According to The Monumental to Xuyuan Emperor written by Hanyu, many archaeologists have put forward that the grottoes were the tombs of the old emperors, or the emperor halls or place for storage. This interpretation is undoubtedly far-fetched.
First: if it was the emperor halls for the members of the emperor to live, why there were no trace of the funeral objects and things left behind by the deceased.
Second: if it were the emperor place, it would be separated into different halls, such as the hall for morning meeting, the palace for sleeping and the place for the guards to live, etc. The grottoes were empty and nothing for blocking could be seen.
Third: if it were an emperor palace, it would have traces of the people living there, but the walls of the grottoes were still very clear and fresh.
Fourth: The distance between of the stairs is very long; it was difficult to transport the goods in and out of the grottoes. Wouldnt they consider the disasters caused by the flood, fire, earthquake and other nature calamities?
2) Theory of mining (including digging other mineral resources)
Some experts held that Longyou Grottoes were the abandoned caves left by digging the stones, it could justify itself.
First: The safest and the most economic approach is to do the work outside, it is both safe and convenient for digging, why did they design deliberately such a way to do so.
Second: the stones in the grottoes belong to the stones formed by the red soil deposits, judging from appearance, the stones are easy to get weathered, why take such huge and painstaking project to dig the stones that could easily get weathered.
Third: the underground operation would need a lot of equipment and apparatus, such as equipment for digging, illumination, transportation, etc. How did they get these problems solved? Why were no marks left at all?
Fourth: If these caves were abandoned caves for digging stones, why did they make such delicate and regular decorations.
3) The troop station theory:
Some experts held that the grottoes were the places of troop stations of emperor Yue to revenge, the explanation was that he was afraid of the leakage of the information, he dug this underground grottoes for war preparations. This interpretation also has many points to be doubted.
First: it was not a work to do in short period of time, if you spent so many years to dig and then many years to prepare, should you lose and abuse the power already weak and small?
Second: if they worried about the leakage of the information, didnt they worry about the collapse caused by sabotage from the enemy because of the leakage of the information?
Third, in the grottoes, it is impossible to use the nature illumination and there were no trace left by the artificial lighting, how all this could be explained?
Fourth: troop station should be characteristic of smooth road, promptly getting in and out, this is the common knowledge of the military, but the grotto had only one way with three-meter distance between the stairs, how could they embody the strategy of the fast movement.
Fifth: if it were for the troop station, they should have left some trace of fighting and exercise.
4) The theory of the alien civilization
UFO experts made on the spot investigation and analysis. They raised the theory of civilization left by the alien. It is to some extent convincing, but still there are many questionable points as follows.
First: How many aliens and equipment are needed to fulfill such a huge project? Could so many aliens land on the earth?
Second: on the whole, the digging of the grottoes was very regular, the chiseling marks were standard and sophisticated, aliens must have used sophisticated equipment to operate. But under careful observations, the chiseling marks also displayed fine differences. We would say that this was done by skilled craftsman rather than done by powerful equipment.
Third: what was the purpose of the aliens digging these grottoes. If they dug these grottoes to live in, it was better and more economic to build an earth observation station with their materials. If they dug these grottoes for gleaning the elements from earth, why did they do such a delicate and careful work? If they dug these as presents to earth, to dig so many grottoes is no better than to dig only one or two grottoes and put one or two civilized products from the other space, which could carry more meaning.
III. Preliminary points of view of author.
According to the careful on the spot observations in the grottoes and comprehensive analysis from all materials by myself. I think it was too early to come to any conclusion with the currently collected information. The accurate answers need complete unearthing and more comprehensive observations. But some points are certain:
1) The grottoes were not formed naturally.
The area in the middle of Zhejiang is hilly land. According to the quotation from the classics, about 300 to 250 million years before. In the geologic age, this area was an ocean. Times brought about great changes of the world. Great orogeny came about in the earths crust in this region. The earths crust raised and became bulged and formed many folds and crease. This region became an area with many caves, such as the double-dragon cave, ice-pot cave and Chaozhen cave in Jinhau City, and also the underground cave in Lanxi City. All these caves were obviously different from the Longyou Grottoes.
2) The grottoes were not built by modern technology:
The development of the production power has offered more and more advanced underground digging machines to humans. It makes the underground operation safer and more efficient, such as the digging of coal and the excavation for underground transportation, etc. But the modern human starts from the safe, economic and beautiful points of view. Underground digging was in a straight line. Once it takes shapes, it would be reinforced and begins to make it beautiful instead of decorating original-digging models directly. In addition, if it was a product of the modern technology, it should be a project built after the industrial revolution in 18th century. Such a huge project, if I was built after 18th century, must have left detailed records in history.
3) The ancients did not build the grottoes:
Huge projects and backward production methods form striking contrasts. It was not possibly built by an individual or common person. Only the emperor and the leaders could have organized such a huge project and the digging capacity. Like the construction of the Great Wall, which was built to defend against invasion from the outside. It was really unnecessary to spend so much manpower and so much time to dig these grottoes without any purpose. Therefore, the Longyou grottoes were not the product of the poor and backward ancients out of leisure and for enjoyment.
In what is being called a landmark moment for the Continent's Jewry, Europe's first university-level school of Jewish theology is set to open Tuesday at the University of Potsdam, situated just outside Berlin.
“The opening of the School of Jewish Theology marks a historical milestone in the training of liberal and conservative rabbis and is unique both in Germany and Europe,” university president Oliver Günther said in a statement.
Jewish theology has never been an academic subject at any European university — “nowhere,” said Rabbi Walter Homolka, the rector of the university's Abraham Geiger College, a Reform Movement-affiliated rabbinical seminary founded in 1999 which will work closely with the new theology school.

“You do find this field of studies at one or two other European universities, but when it comes to covering all fields — exegetical, hermeneutical, philosophical, historical, and practical — the [new] School of Jewish Theology is unique,” he said.
Nearly 50 students from Germany, Israel, the United States and Hungary will attend the school's inaugural semester starting this fall. The school, which receives financial support from the German government, will initially have six professors and offer bachelor's degrees. It is also entitled to grant doctoral degrees and habilitation, the German degree qualifying for a full professorship.
“In addition to the basic knowledge about Judaism, the bachelor's program — unique in Europe — teaches basic academic competences,” the university stated. “Moreover, it provides insight into Jewish religious practice.”
Christian and Jewish theologies have ‘finally reached equality'
Jewish theology taking a prominent place at a European university “creates a milestone in the history of science, but also in the history of German and European Judaism,” noted German President Joachim Gauck. “In Germany, of all places, where the Jewish intelligentsia — which had such a large and irreplaceable share in the intellectual prestige of German academia — was expelled and murdered, out of all places in Germany, Jewish theology is finally given its proper role.”
Writing in a brochure published by the university, Gauck — a former Protestant pastor — said that with the school's opening, Christian and Jewish theologies have “finally reached equality.”
The school will be headed by Israeli-born poet and Talmud expert Admiel Kosman. After concluding his service in a combat unit of the IDF and receiving a PhD from Bar-Ilan University, Kosman relocated to Germany and currently serves as academic director of the university's Abraham Geiger Reform Rabbinical Seminary.
In addition, on Sunday night the University of Potsdam opened Europe's first rabbinical seminary for Conservative Judaism. The Zacharias Frankel College, which will closely cooperate with the School of Jewish Theology, pledges to be “a full-fledged rabbinical school that values rigorous scholarship, embraces the splendors of spirituality,” according to Vice Dean Rabbi Cheryl Peretz.
Tuesday's opening ceremony of the School of Jewish Theology will be attended by German and Israeli dignitaries, including the president of the European Union for Progressive Judaism, Leslie Bergman; vice president of the Central Council for Jews in Germany, Josef Schuster; Brandenburg state's Culture Minister Sabine Kunst; and Israel's ambassador in Berlin, Yakov Hadas-Handelsmann.
“Almost 70 years after the end of the Holocaust, we are witnessing a rebirth of Jewish life in Germany,” Handelsmann wrote. “Not only because the number of Jews here is growing, but also because Jews and Judaism are increasingly in the focus of Germans' research interests.”
The core subjects to be taught include religious philosophy and history, Bible and exegesis, Talmud and rabbinical literature, liturgy and religious law. While the school is affiliated with Conservative and Reform movements, the academic program is open to everyone regardless of religious affiliation.
Besides the Reform and Conservative institutions for higher Jewish learning, there are also two Orthodox yeshivas in Berlin.

Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell asked state officials Thursday to suggest 4 percent cuts to their agency budgets in anticipation of the “fiscal cliff” that threatens the national economy.
In a memo, the governor's chief of staff told executive agency heads to prepare their departments for the economic crisis that might result if Congress and the White House don't reach a long-term deficit-reduction plan by year's end.
“It has become clear that several factors are placing immense pressure on the Commonwealth's finances and, therefore, will necessitate immediate action to plan prudently for the future,” wrote Martin L. Kent, who warned that a failure to reach a compromise in Washington could lead to “a second recession.”
Although the request to trim the state budget is routine, there is an added sense of urgency heading into next year, McDonnell spokesman Tucker Martin said.
“We ask agencies for spending reduction proposals and strategies every year,” Martin said in a statement Thursday.
“This year is no different,” he added. “The importance of this exercise is heightened by the unprecedented uncertainty presented by the looming federal fiscal cliff, and additional budget pressures currently facing Virginia.”
Martin said McDonnell (R) is seeking ideas for savings and has not made any final decisions on budget reductions.
The request contrasts with the state's relatively healthy fiscal picture. Virginia posted a budget surplus of nearly $130 million for fiscal 2012 and has reported surpluses for each of the past three fiscal years.
Kent's memo cites the rising cost of health care as another reason to identify potential budget cuts, pointing to the increasing financial burden of Medicaid and rising costs of the state employee health insurance program and inmate medical care.
“Balances sufficient to cover this continued growth do not exist,” Kent said in his memo, first reported by the Associated Press.
The fiscal 2012 surplus will go toward paying bonuses to state workers Dec. 1 and to cover various required costs. New revenue “likely will be limited,” the memo warns.
McDonnell's request came two days after an election that is returning President Obama to the White House and a divided Congress to Capitol Hill.
House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) signaled Wednesday that he is open to compromise to avoid the fiscal cliff and is “willing to accept new revenue” as part of the discussion.
But after a contentious presidential campaign that focused largely on the economy and partisan infighting, it is unclear whether Congress can reach a budget compromise by the end of the year to avert deep cuts. If it fails, sequestration — automatic spending cuts projected to total $1.2 trillion divided evenly over nine years — is set to begin taking effect Jan. 1.
The cuts will heavily affect defense spending, and federal officials say the first year's cuts could amount to $109 billion.
Negotiations to stave off another government shutdown have reached the stage of technical discussions over ways to raise extra government revenue after “good progress” was made between Washington lawmakers aiming at $1tn budget deal.
Congressional staff were expected to hold talks on Thursday to thrash out finer details, according to sources close to the process, after a brief, but productive, meeting in private on Wednesday between Democratic senator Patty Murray and Republican Paul Ryan.
The Democratic chair of the Senate budget committee is leading formal negotiations with her Republican counterpart in the House of Representatives that hold out the best hope of avoiding another crippling government shutdown and ending months of stalemate.
But the Congressional calendar is adding to the long list of political obstacles that have previously stood in the way of reaching this crucial agreement on next year's federal budget.
House and Senate sessions only overlap for five days next week before the lower chamber breaks up for Christmas, making the next few days the last practical chance to strike a deal before current spending authority expires on January 15.
The two interlocutors met for half an hour on Wednesday after Murray's return from Thanksgiving for the first in a series of crunch-time talks aimed at meeting a self-imposed deadline to present a proposal by December 13.
There are no new face-to-face talks scheduled for Thursday or Friday but they may hold further discussions by phone over the weekend if progress is made between staff negotiators.
Sources close to the negotiations say they are within grasp of a two-year deal that would set the annual government budget at approximately $1tn – roughly halfway between the $1,058tn sought by Democrats and the existing $967bn that Republicans would like to stick to.
Aides are keeping many of the politically-sensitive details under wraps for now, but the Guardian understands they are also discussing limited relief from the sequester, which forced government agencies to apply blanket budget cuts after negotiations last Christmas failed to reach any compromise that would allow more targeted reforms.
This time around it looks like some limited spending increases will be made possible by offering alternative ways to raise government revenue rather than the tax rises that Republicans are so strongly opposed to.
Such a strategy would require a tricky political balancing act and leaders of both parties have been downplaying expectations in recent days for fear of triggering a backlash from those on either wing who would regard such a deal as a sell-out.
Moderate Republicans are more optimistic however and have suggested one such revenue-raising route might involve demanding that federal workers contribute more toward their pensions.
Senator Patrick Toomey for example, who has previously sided with Democrats on issues like gun control and gay rights, suggested on Wednesday that he would be back such a compromise. “The chances [of a budget deal] are better than even,” he told MSNBC.
But there are plenty of left-leaning Democrats who are wary of such moves, and have fought off separate plans to cut entitlement programmes such as social security that were proposed by the White House in its suggested budget compromise.
With hardliners on both sides reluctant to give ground on taxes or entitlement cuts, the contours of the deal sought by Murray and Ryan are likely to remain limited.
Nevertheless, any deal at all would be a major achievement for a Congress that is poised to strike a new record for the least legislation passed in one year and would be a much-needed confidence boost for the economy.

Pubs in Cardiff and Swansea suspected of showing Premier League football matches illegally using foreign satellites face prosecution, BBC Wales has learned.
In the last four months the Premier League's private investigation firm has visited nearly 200 pubs in south Wales.
The League is planning to bring up to 100 prosecutions across Wales and England this season.
The first will be against The Rhyddings Hotel in Brynmill, Swansea, shortly.
Many south Wales pubs have subscriptions with foreign channels and show Cardiff City and Swansea City's 15:00 GMT Saturday Premier League kick-offs.
These games are unavailable on the Premier League's authorised UK broadcasters - Sky Sports and BT Sport - at the kick-off time.
Copyright law
When we go in and find use of foreign satellite systems we'll give them the opportunity to get rid of that system Dan Johnson, Premier League
By showing the foreign channels, the Premier League believes pubs are probably breaking copyright law.
In 2011 Karen Murphy, a Portsmouth pub landlady, won a court case against the Premier League.
The ruling effectively proved it is legal to buy a TV subscription from anywhere in the EU.
However, when a pub or club uses such a subscription to show Premier League football matches, it is breaking copyright law if the League's logo is shown in on-screen graphics, or if the League's anthem is heard before kick-off or at half time.
Tom Richards, a barrister specialising in copyright law, said it was unlikely a pub could screen the games without breaching Premier League copyright.
"The Premier League owns the copyright in its logo, in its anthem and in other bits of sound recording and artwork which are superimposed on any feed of a Premier League match," he said.
"If you play those in a pub without the Premier League's consent that's copyright infringement in the law of copyright.
"Technically speaking, there is a loophole.
"If you could separate out the copyrighted content, such as the Premier League logo, from the match footage, then in theory you wouldn't be infringing copyright.
Image caption Pubs screening matches illegally will be warned first
"In practice it's rather doubtful whether that can be achieved because the Premier League - you can be confident - will make it as hard as possible to separate out the protected from the unprotected content."
Some pubs try to use this loophole by blocking out graphics of the Premier League logo.
But the League says its private investigation firm, ID Inquiries, has not come across any "masking technology" that would stop it taking action against a pub.
So far this season ID Inquiries has visited 195 pubs in the Cardiff and Swansea areas and is planning legal action against "a small number of them".
'Black spots'
Dan Johnson, the Premier League's director of communications, said: "BT Sport and Sky Sports invest huge amounts of money in the Premier League and that then is in turn invested by the clubs in new stadia, developing players, acquiring players, the whole range of things that make Premier League football so popular.
"So anything that damages the ability of broadcasters to invest in that has the potential to damage the ability of the clubs to invest in that.
"With the advent of Cardiff and Swansea being in the Premier League clearly the interest in Premier League football has gone through the roof in south Wales.
"So, it becomes an area of interest and you can go round the country and you can see these blackspots where Premier League football is of great interest, and people will try and utilise that interest to their advantage, including pubs and clubs.
"We want to help pubs, we want to help educate licensees, and when we go in and find use of foreign satellite systems we'll give them the opportunity to get rid of that system."
"So if in the first instance - they say 'we hear you, we'll get rid of this system and we'll get a legitimate one' - they will face no further action and we don't want to be going round the country prosecuting pubs and licensees.
"However if they choose not to, they face the very real prospect of prosecution."
Mr Johnson says the League expects to bring up to 100 prosecutions this season across Wales and England.
The action against The Rhyddings Hotel in Swansea is the League's first prosecution since the Karen Murphy case and is expected to be heard in the next few weeks.
Bold plan for $1.2 billion opera house on the Perth waterfront
Updated
Shane O'Riley is a man with a vision. He's spent five years working on a dramatic design for an international concert hall for the Elizabeth Quay riverfront development, only now releasing it to the public.
A Perth-based building designer who works on large residential projects, Mr O'Riley said he began the design as a private project to showcase his skills.
"When the second Narrows Bridge went up I thought that was a wasted opportunity to do something with that landscape," he said.
"I knew there was a parcel of land earmarked for Elizabeth Quay before the public knew, and I researched the Indigenous heritage of the area.
"The underlying brief was very simple. It needed to compete as an icon against concert halls and opera houses around the world, not just Sydney.”
His design is already drawing strong responses from the public: some love it, some hate and others have compared it to an echidna.
The projected cost - $1.2 billion - has many doubting it will ever be built but Mr O'Riley says he's resilient and prepared to work long and hard to realise the building.
"I'm thick-skinned and I'm able to take on board the polarising comments that a structure of this magnitude would open up," he said.
"At the same time there has been a lot of very positive feedback on it because I think Perth very much needs this icon."
Looking past the price
Mr O'Riley believes that people, especially politicians, need to look past the cost and think about what an iconic building could do for the city.
"If you look at Sydney for example, it is the architectural and urban landmarks that have located it on the map," he said.
"We need to think about things in Perth in terms of what we need iconically and then have everything else revolves around that centrepiece.
"We are not doing that in Perth and I am very concerned that, on the foreshore, there is a mishmash of architecture that has the potential to give us slums of the future and degrade the image of Perth.
"We end up spending good money after bad because no-one is pre-planning the grand vision because I think planning is based around political terms, not visions."
Asked on 720 Mornings about the design, Premier Colin Barnett said he did like it, but indicated it was unlikely to be backed by the State Government.
"We haven't got a lazy billion lying around, but I do think we will see some magnificent architecture go into Elizabeth Quay," the Premier told Geoff Hutchison.
"That site at Elizabeth Quay is reserved for an Aboriginal art and cultural area. That's in the long-term plan; it's not something that is going to happen soon.
"When that is ultimately developed I hope it would be a spectacular building."
Musical sculpture
The design, Mr O'Riley said, was intended to be a metaphor for "what it feels like to be sculpturally inside music, without the experience of the sound".
"The living embodiment is you being inside a musical instrument, a sculpture, something that is dynamic and inspirational," he said.
At the very least, he hopes the design will start a discussion about how the city should look, and points out that the combined budgets of the new sports stadium and Elizabeth Quay total $4 billion.
"No-one cares about making Perth an international city of the future, it's all about developers," he said.
"What I've learnt in building is that you get one shot at things in a location, once you build it is there.
"It's always about our sporting prowess, not our cultural prowess, and we need to grow up."

"Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks, receives; and the one who seeks, finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened" (Matthew 7:7-8).
Today, myself and others knocked at the door of St. Patrick's Cathedral, but the door was not opened, rather it was slammed in our faces. As I begin to write this article, I'm cognizant of the raw emotions that I feel deep inside my heart. It's a feeling that I'm unfamiliar with, because until today, I have never been denied a seat at Christ's table. In fact, today marks the first day that I have ever felt disowned, abandoned, and lost.
Earlier today, a group of Catholics including myself gathered on the corner of East 46th Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. We gathered for a simple purpose, to dirty our hands as we prepared to attend Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral. We were soiling our hands as a silent response to Cardinal Dolan's column last week in which he suggested that LGBT people were welcome in the church so long as they washed their hands. As we began to rub our hands together with pieces of ash, our hands took on the look and feel of the effort that has defined our work to receive an equal seat at the table of Christ in the Catholic Church. Those participating were not only LGBT Catholics, but also allies and, perhaps most importantly, parents of LGBT children. We gathered not in protest, but as a silent witness.
It is what transpired in the moments after soiling our hands that I have trouble understanding and placing in the context of the Christian experience. At around 9:30am, the ten of us gathered were greeted by four police cars, eight uniformed officers, a police captain, and a detective from the Police Commissioner's LGBT liaison unit. The detective informed us that the Cathedral would prohibit us to enter because of our dirty hands. It was at that moment that I realized the power of fear. The Archdiocese of New York was responding out of fear to a peaceful and silent presence at Mass. Even in light of this, we decided that we would walk solemnly from our gathering spot to the Cathedral with hopes that we might be welcomed.
As we reached St. Patrick's Cathedral, we were approached by Kevin Donohue, who identified himself as being in charge of operations for the cathedral. Sadly, Mr. Donohue's tone was both cold and scolding. What astounded me most was when he said that we could enter the cathedral so long as we washed our hands first. Even now, writing those words I find myself struggling to understand their meaning, while coming to terms with their exclusionary nature.
It was at this moment that Mr. Donohue advised us that if we entered St. Patrick's Cathedral with dirty hands, we would be arrested and charged with criminal trespassing. Upon hearing those words, I remember standing there thinking, "How can I be charged with criminal trespassing in my own home?" It was then that I realized what it meant to be spiritually homeless. This realization was particularly difficult for me in light of the private meeting that I had with Cardinal Dolan on November 27, 2012, at his office in Manhattan. It was during that meeting that he expressed such love and welcome that I find his subsequent "conditional welcome" to be difficult to understand.
In response to the Archdiocese's threat of arrest, we opted to remain outside where we stood in silent vigil with our palms turned out facing toward the main doors of Cathedral. As the start of the Mass drew near, the temporary steel doors that mark the front of the Cathedral while the original doors are refurbished, seemed to be symbolically appropriate. The cold steel and the means by which the doors closed as we stood outside seem now to capture well the chill that we felt from the Cathedral's staff as well as the Cardinal. Our peaceful presence was responded to with a resounding "you are not welcome."
As someone who was reared Roman Catholic from the moment of birth, I have always known the Church and its community of believers to be a place of welcome and affirmation. When I came out as a gay man, my childhood priest and the leadership of my hometown parish stood beside and supported me. Today, this childhood experience of "church" stands in stark contrast to the cold and heartless response of the Archdiocese of New York and Cardinal Dolan to our presence at the Cathedral earlier today.
The other day, I posted on my Facebook page that in the wake of the Cardinal's recent false welcome, I stand at a crossroad in my faith journey; however, I realize now that it is not I who stands at this crossroad, but rather the Cardinal himself. He stands at point at which he can choose to see the inherent dignity present in all people or to follow a path laid with judgment and accusation.
Today, I don't stand at a crossroad, but rather I find myself standing at the threshold of a door. I and others are standing at the doorway to the Church knocking, seeking, and asking. By this action, I hope that the doors of the Cathedral will be opened to us not on a conditional basis, but rather with the understanding that we are all created in the image and likeness of God.
This morning's vigil was not about dirty hands, but rather in the words of Brendan Fay it was about, "clean hearts." With our clean hearts and dirty hands, we will continue to knock at the door of the Cathedral with hopes that one day, Cardinal Dolan might finally realize that we too are worthy to enter the church as children of God.
Note: Although Cardinal Dolan was not present at the Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral, as some may conclude based on the title, the title is intended to draw reference to the fact that the Cathedral is the seat of the Archbishop, Cardinal Timothy Dolan. With that in mind, he is the leader of the Cathedral; therefore, he would be aware of the policies pertaining to access to the Cathedral and ultimately responsible for how those policies are implemented and/or revised.
CDPR started a Community Q&A a couple of days ago, which has been posted on the official forums. Miles Tost, Level Designer from CD Projekt RED, answered several questions.
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt features huge dungeons
Several questions regarding the size of the dungeons, included in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, were asked to which Tost replied:
“There's some really large dungeons. I guess some of them offer 1H+ game time, depending on how good you are with combat, how thoroughly you explore them (SECRETS!!!) and how well you cope with being in utter darkness for an extended period of time.”
Miles was asked whether the dungeons will have a horror vibe, and he explained:
“With some we did, with some we didn't. Sometimes you want to go for more of a mystical vibe, for example. It helps that, much like in the previous games, dungeons and caves are very dark unless you come prepared though. Luckily this time around, Geralt has a torch. Comes in handy should you not have your cat potion or if you have it, but already find yourself at the edge of the toxicity threshold. You can even fight while wielding the torch in one hand, however, IIRC it renders Geralt unable to parry attacks.
Does look quite spectacular with the dynamic shadows, though.”
The dungeons in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt are handcrafted
Due to the extremely large size of The Witcher 3, some of the dungeons must be randomly generated, a fan commented. In response, Miles Tost replies:
“Ah, we in the Locations Team are really proud of the fact that everything is hand-crafted, which is why you keep hearing us say it over and over. Your conclusion there makes my heart almost hurt just a little bit. So for this reason, to be a hundred percent sure, I called in what is now called the Environment Council, consisting of me, Daniel Olejnik (Senior Environment Artist) and Marcin Michalski (also a Senior Environment Artist).
We discussed this and shed a couple of tears together. Enough of it is hand-crafted for us to not feel like lying when we say that everything has been hand-crafted by us. Even when the team created the basic land shape it started out in zBrush, then got some erosion applied via software, and then iterated in-engine (sculpting the terrain without terrain brush tools). Terrain Textures are painted by hand, assets including foliage are placed by hand as well. We do have foliage generation for a basic foliage layer based off the type of terrain texture used (which again is painted by hand). It will apply a layer of grass. However, any further vegetation, trees, bushes, flowers, etc, are all hand placed.
Think about Novigrad City: none of the houses have been placed procedurally or by an algorithm, the city was carefully planned and crafted all the way from the rough districts to individual pathways in between (or through) houses. Also I realise that the question might've been meant differently. In that regard: Terrain was shaped by hand, erosion effects are applied, at this point, there's virtually no spot of terrain in the world that hasn't been touched by a dev.
Yes, it is an insane amount of work that we did have to sacrifice our fair share of evenings for – but for us it's just worth it and honestly, we firmly believe it makes for a better game, because it makes the world more enjoyable.
If we wouldn't we would've not done it, right?”
Miles Toast also mentioned that the team is hard at work ironing any issues, such as the vegetation pop-in that was evident in the last trailer.

By RAPHAEL SATTER, Associated Press
WASHINGTON (AP) — FBI officials say there's no clear evidence the agency violated its own rules when it posed as The Associated Press to unmask a criminal, according to a report obtained through a public records lawsuit.
However, the internal FBI report being made public by the AP and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press says "an argument can be made" that field agents bucked protocol by not informing senior brass in Washington of the 2007 operation.
The sting was aimed at identifying the hoaxer behind a series of bomb threats to Timberline High School in the suburban town of Lacey, Washington.
Agents crafted a fake AP article, digitally booby-trapped it and sent it to the suspect's MySpace account. Pretending to be an AP reporter, they asked him to review the piece before it was published. When the hoaxer opened what he thought was a story about his exploits, the digital trap was sprung, his location was revealed and he was swiftly arrested.
The FBI's use of the AP's name in the operation wasn't widely known until Chris Soghoian, a technologist with the American Civil Liberties Union, discovered a reference to the bogus news article in a cache of previously released FBI documents in October 2014. The AP called the FBI's action "unacceptable" and, in a letter to the Justice Department a month later, AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt said the FBI's tactics amounted to "a theft of our reputation and credibility."
FBI Director James Comey defended the operation, saying in an editorial that the technique was "proper and appropriate under Justice Department and FBI guidelines at the time."
But the seven-page "Situation Action Background" report, drafted by the FBI's Cyber Division on Oct. 31, 2014, gives a more nuanced take.
It notes that undercover operations involving agents who pose as members of the media are typically categorized as "Group 1," the label given to sensitive operations flagged to the agency's Washington headquarters for review and approval. That does not appear to have happened in the Timberline case. The report says it isn't clear whether the Seattle office ever even told headquarters about their impersonation of AP.
Despite that, the FBI's Cyber Division found in the Seattle office's favor, saying it acted reasonably "under the circumstances."
"Although an argument can be made the reported impersonation of a fictitious member of the media constituted a 'sensitive circumstance' that would have made the undercover activity subject to FBI HQ review and approval required for a Group 1 undercover operation, the facts of the case do not clearly indicate that such a sensitive circumstance existed," the report says.
The "facts of the case" invoked by the report aren't made clear. The following four pages are heavily redacted.
The report was among 186 pages of material recently turned over to the AP and the Reporters Committee after they teamed up to sue the FBI for more information about the agency's impersonation of journalists. Both groups are still fighting the FBI for more documents about the bomb hoax case and others like it. In a legal brief filed Monday, they described the government's disclosure as inadequate and some of its redactions as improper.
"We don't believe it's appropriate to fake being a journalist under any circumstances, whatever the FBI's own findings may be," AP Executive Editor Kathleen Carroll said. "AP journalists are independent and it is wrong, and potentially dangerous, to create a lie that then links them with government activities."

Amazon's the devil — and I love it I know the online behemoth helps destroy the book culture I care about. But then I got a Kindle -- and it's awesome
I bought a Kindle, which means I'm the devil.
I'm the devil because Kindle is part of the vast network of Amazon, whose goal is pretty much to destroy everything I hold dear in my brick-and-mortar culture. And they employ a morally reprehensible scheme to do so. They charge less than what a book actually costs them, taking a small loss on each sale, with the hope of driving every other book retailer out of business. Kind of like gas wars from fifty years ago, when two competing gas stations lowered their prices beyond profitability to beat the guy next door, but in this situation Amazon's the only company that can afford to lose money. Their job, as they seem to see it, is to keep dumping cash into themselves until they become the go-to place for not just books, but everything. “Don't waste your time going to your local store. Buy it from Amazon for less and you'll never have to leave home.” This drives many independent bookstores—which rely on profits to stay afloat—out of business, taking with them the entire culture of book buying I value (selling back used books, seeing my money go into the local economy, dealing with a bookseller, author readings, creaky floors, participating in a community as opposed to mouse-clicking, etc.)
Advertisement:
But resistance is futile, right? Has a more imposing windmill than Amazon ever been chased? In less than twenty years, the online monolith has established itself as the unalterable king of the book-buying world. And isn't every company pretty much out to destroy its competition?
Yes, yes and yes, but I'm notoriously hard-headed about these things. I get it in my transom that some company is too powerful, and I get this sour feeling in my stomach, which makes it all but impossible for me to support them. It started when I was eighteen and decided I'd never eat at McDonald's again, claiming they were too big, too greedy. This was hard to explain to my friends, who liked cheap food, but they humored me and we ate at Burger King instead. My favorite offending company in the nineties was Starbucks, which transformed my world into one giant corporate coffee shop in what felt like minutes. Amazon seems to be my online equivalent of Starbucks, another bare-knuckles Seattle company going out of its way to crush the little guy at every instance.
I feel this way, and yet I buy a Kindle. Let me explain.
Despite being a loyal book-book reader, I bought an e-reader because I'm a self-published novelist, and I need to be able to check how my e-books look on an actual e-reading device. Also as a self-publisher, I sold more e-books than book-books in 2011, which was a first, and I want to understand why this is happening. Is it just the cheaper price, or are people finding e-readers an equivalent—or more fulfilling—way to read a book? Finally, I sometimes get free pdfs of books, and I need an e-reading device to read them. These factors, combined with a general curiosity of what the publishing world is going through, made me take the plunge.
But there are myriad other e-reader devices. Why buy Amazon's Kindle? Because the Kindle is the industry standard. In 2011, Amazon accounted for 61 percent of U.S. ebook purchases, according to R.R. Bowker. It wouldn't make sense to buy some e-book device that most people aren't using and tailoring my e-books to them. I want my customers to find my product comparable to those released by traditional publishing companies. If I'm checking my work on a Nook, I'll never know how it looks to most of my buyers.
And truth be told, there's something about this devil that beguiles me. Despite their predatory retail model, Amazon challenges the publishing industry in ways I find interesting. They're the only entity big enough to go up against New York publishing and win. They have successfully pushed for change in many industry practices—e-book pricing, for example—and they have enough market share to seriously give traditional publishing fits if they want.

Because yep, you guessed it, I have a grudge against traditional publishing too. Another monster in need of taming, albeit an entirely different kind of taming. Too tame, might be the better way to put it.
Traditional publishing has published ninety percent of the books I've valued over the years, books that changed my life and made me want to be a writer. But the last decade or so has seen them get undeniably safe with the books they choose to publish and promote. I would even go so far as to say much of the valuable literary talent in the country today isn't being published by New York publishing but by independent presses. Why would the entities that brought us Updike and Morrison and Bellow so willingly give up the mantle of publishing the best? Are they counting on past glories to convince us that whatever they release is quality? How long will that dog hunt?
Is Amazon the lessor of these two evils? Hard to say. They're both pretty evil in that they're both owned by huge conglomerates, and both wish to make you a mindless crack monkey for their products and no one else's. The rest of us out here in the Wild West of self-publishing don't stand a chance against the monoliths on the East Coast, so it's nice to see someone do some damage to them, even if it is Amazon. Hopefully, it will lead to better books getting published and hyped.
Also, in my decade as a self-publisher, no one wields the term “vanity press” so indiscriminately as those loyal to traditional publishing. Not only is this offensive, it scares writers away from getting the best cut of sales, which is to sell directly to their readers with fewer middlemen. With the advent of e-books and print-on-demand publishing, self-publishing can be a viable economic path for some writers, but many who support traditional publishing don't want to hear it. In the brick-and-mortar world, this would be equivalent to trumpeting the products of Walmart over those at your locally-owned corner store.

Perhaps those who embrace New York publishing are afraid of self-publishing taking over the industry. No doubt making everyone in the world a publisher is something that should give pause to those who support the Old Way, but more than anything I think they just don't like the idea of a ton of garbage books cluttering up the market. To the traditional publishing industry acolyte, your name along the spine of a book is earned through hard work and the Publishing Gods deeming it worthy. It's more like being chosen. Self-publishing stands on no such ceremony. If you've got a few thousand words, a few bucks and computer access, you can be the next Amanda Hocking, or (what the hell) Stephen King. There is no ceiling (yet) to this newly revamped branch of publishing, so don't try to tell the would-be starry-eyed self-publisher it isn't going amount to anything. “How would you know?” he'd say, and he'd be right.
As evil as Amazon is, they've been completely supportive of the idea that anyone can be a publisher (which of course makes sense for their business model) with programs like Kindle Direct and Author Central, and Amazon's association with indie godsend Kickstarter doesn't hurt its perception with self-pubbers either. Name one advance New York publishing has come up with over the last decade. And no, circling the wagons doesn't count.
Still, with my Kindle purchase, I know I'm dancing with the devil. There's always the chance it could alter my reading habits. I may start buying all of my books with it, which is just what the folks at Amazon hope for. This morning I was on the Internet looking for a title. I noticed it was fifteen dollars at my local independent bookstore and $11.99 on Amazon as an e-book. To get the book-book would require a trip across town. The e-book would be on my Kindle in a matter of seconds. I'm not saying I thought about giving over my soul right then and there, but I certainly understood why many do.

So Amazon's the devil, but apparently I like some aspects of this devil. I guess I'm taking my chances with this spin around the dance floor.
Much like their bank account, Disney's wealth of storytelling and franchises are ever-flowing and rich. The market of good, popular media has been nearly monopolized by Disney for some time, but today their presence seems hyperbolized with their involvement (read: ownership) of Marvel Studios and Lucasfilm, both of which are moneymaking machines in their own right. The Marvel Cinematic Universe disrupted the entire art of franchise filmmaking with its model of tangential, intricate interconnectivity. And while the model has found its footing in Star Wars, traces can be found of its vague implementation in another Disney franchise: nearly every animated classic the studio has ever released.
For those keeping track at home, Friday's hotly anticipated release of Beauty and the Beast marks the sixth live-action remake of their own classic animated films. Seventh, if you count Disney's undercooked previous attempt at cracking The Jungle Book before Jon Favreau's marvelous film. Eighth, if you count 2010's Alice In Wonderland, but I barely count that as a movie. Though with each live-action attempt, even with its successes, Disney was very clearly experimenting and code-cracking an age old question with its remakes: How close can we get? How close can we get to capturing the magic of animation, with all its wonder, in a more approachable, “real” setting? Star power in animated films goes far, but it can go further if movie stars are on the posters of our films. Y'know, like Angelina Jolie?

A long time ago I played Shiren the Wanderer which was possibly on the DS. I was thinking maybe the GBA but I don't see it anywhere. At any rate, I love these types of rogue like dungeon crawlers, fighting through Izuna, the Unemployed Ninja, and cruising through the Pokémon Dungeon games. However, with Shiren, it was one of the few games I'd rage-quit on. I vowed never to play it again. So what happened? I suddenly find myself with the new Shiren and I'm actually enjoying it alot. Here's the difference between the two...the old one was so brutal (as I remember it anyway) that I could never even get out of the dungeon with an upgraded weapon. I felt I made zero progress time after time. Izuna was hard, but Shiren was harder. I watched part of the walkthrough on YouTube for the new Shiren and it convinced me to give it another go. This time there are so many things to help you. There is a lot of storage, there's the capability of getting items to revive you every time you start over (from the Points Card guy) and there are things to help you acquire items in the extra Dungeon and Puzzle house. Plus you start from a good place from the Training house with some items. You can hire help and bank money to give you an upper hand. So this version is completely different from the last one I played. I don't feel so hopeless when I die. Though you have to be kind of a masochist to play these games anyway, and have great patience, as I've aged (56 now) I feel that I don't have infinite time to play one game.. Shiren really makes you feel like you've accomplished something which encourages one to keep going. I've made it through the first small dungeon and the three (Past, Present and Future) other preliminary dungeons, I feel really good about the game. In conclusion, it's a great game with lots of goodies to keep you going and has beautiful graphics.

She is an actress and sex symbol, best known for her starring role in a TV show from the 1990s and for her relationship with a famous rock star.
He is a journalist who people either love or hate.
What's the attraction? An insider tells us:
He sees her as the ultimate woman. She is a sex symbol and a sympathetic ear to him. There's really no one else like her in his life. He also likes her passion for fighting for [the causes she supports]. She sees him as worldly and intellectual and an activist who fights for what he believes in. She wants to be more fearless like him. She also wants her kids to meet him because she would rather they grow to be activists than rock stars.

He said he heard his team yell ''Wow!'' through audio monitors as the image materialized on his screen.
''It's a very distinct shape,'' he said. ''It's 78 feet long, 6 feet in diameter, it's got a hole through it and two torpedoes in the front. It could hardly be more distinct. In its present situation it is absolutely, 100 percent, positively identified. Because there's no possible question it could be anything else.''
''The shot through the conning tower of this submarine brought the U.S. into World War II,'' Mr. Wiltshire added. ''And the captain of this sub is the first casualty of the war with Japan.''
The submarine, burrowed in a military debris field, has long eluded undersea explorers, including Robert Ballard, discoverer of the Titanic, who conducted a search for the Japanese midget in 2000. The National Park Service, which runs the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial, began search efforts in 1988.
The Hawaii laboratory, which is one of six national laboratories conducting underwater research, partnered with the park service, Mr. Wiltshire said, keeping an eye out for the submarine on its three or four training missions each year.
''We always tell the pilots, 'Now keep an eye out for the midget sub,' '' he said. ''The prize is if you can find the sub.''
Early on Dec. 7, 1941, the Ward was notified of a suspicious vessel in the vicinity of the harbor. It was one of five midget submarines trying to penetrate the harbor, according to historical accounts, and the Ward began firing on it around 6:30 a.m.

Finding the submarine confirms that shots from the Ward sank the vessel well before the Japanese attack, historians said.
''We've been talking about this incident that took place nearly an hour and a half before the attack on Pearl Harbor for 60 years,'' said Daniel Martinez, chief historian for the park service at the Arizona memorial.

''Now we have the tangible evidence of what happened out there in the dawn hours,'' Mr. Martinez said.
He said the submarine also added to a scant collection of Pearl Harbor artifacts. All but 3 of the 21 ships hit in the attack were returned to service, he said, and other damaged equipment was repaired or scrapped.
''The Ward fired the first shot of the Pacific war,'' he said. ''And this submarine now shows us where that shell landed, and how it sank that sub. We now have that artifact.''
Mr. Martinez said discussion of recovery was premature. Mr. Wiltshire said he could envision the site becoming part of the national sanctuary run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. American and Japanese agencies are expected to be involved.
Mr. Wiltshire said: ''Clearly it's a Japanese war grave, and it's a major, major historical site.''
None of the five submarines sent by the Japanese returned to their navy. The one found on Wednesday was the only one stopped by the United States. Of the others, one washed up on Dec. 8, 1941 in Waimanalo, on the other side of Oahu; one was found off Oahu in the 1960's; and a third was sunk in the attack. The fifth is unaccounted for.
''I think it's probably a hopeless case,'' Mr. Wiltshire said of finding the fifth submarine. ''But we'll keep telling the pilots training in the debris field there's one more left.'' --------------------
Steamship Wreck Identified
BOSTON, Aug. 29 (AP) -- Underwater explorers have identified the wreck of a 19th-century steamship that sank in one of the worst hurricanes in New England's history, a disaster that prompted changes in ship design and maritime practices.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The steamship, the Portland, sank off Massachusetts on Nov. 26, 1898, killing more than 190 people, after it ignored storm forecasts and sailed from Boston bound for Portland, Me.
Its whereabouts were never firmly established until today, when the oceanic agency announced that the wreck had been found in the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary between Cape Ann and Provincetown.
The wreck was first sighted in 1989 by Arnold Carr and John Fish, two underwater explorers, but they could not prove it was the Portland.
''I was pretty convinced it was the ship, but I didn't have evidence,'' said Mr. Fish, who was also involved in the current expedition.
Scientists estimate 192 people died on the Portland, but the exact number has never been determined because the sole passenger list went down with the ship. Only about 40 bodies were recovered.
Last week, model Layla Lace went public with claims that Drake had gotten her pregnant and was subsequently dodging her calls. Lace shared a series of alleged texts between her and the rapper on Instagram. She claimed that the two had met up in London and had sex, but after she discovered she was pregnant a few weeks later, Drizzy went silent on her.
According to TMZ, sources close to Drake claim that the rapper has never met Lace, and that her story was fabricated for attention. They are also denying "rumblings" that Drake's team had threatened to sue her over the posts, which have now been deleted. The source argues that there was no reason for Lace to keep the posts up after the story was picked up and Lace received the "attention" she was looking for.
Lace has not publicly responded to this development. While she deleted her posts, she has not officially retracted any of her claims. Read her original posts here.
The Humanity Project in Moncton is being evicted by Curl Moncton from the former Moncton Curlers' Association building.
Charlie Burrell, the founder of the group dedicated to helping the homeless, was served with a 30-day eviction notice on Monday.
The organization has operated from the building for 15 months, but its efforts to buy the building fell through in February, when Moncton city council rejected its request for a $200,000 loan.
Curl Moncton wants the building sold so it can access the equity it holds in the building to expand its location at the corner of Lockhart and Essex streets.
Burrell doesn't know where the organization is going to end up.
"We've spent the last three months looking for places," he said. "They're either not feasible for what we need them for, or they are way out of our price range."
But Burrell vowed to keep pushing forward.
"Whether we're in another building or whether we're in a parking lot, we can't leave people in our city to go hungry."
Burrell said he plans to launch a fundraising page this week to try to raise the necessary funds "to do it on our own."
"If we don't have a place, the impact will be we'll be in a parking lot in the rain and in the bad weather, serving people and trying to give them the stuff they need," he said.
"We'll be operating out of 10 people's houses, like we did before. It's not an ideal situation."
In addition to feeding about 150 people a day, the Humanity Project provides free clothing, furniture, survival items and food boxes for families in emergency situations.

The city's Parks Department manages about 29,000 acres of parkland that's comprised of all sorts of facilities including your more traditional playgrounds, beaches, and sports facilities, but it is also the steward of many monuments, historic structures, and uninhabited islands throughout the city. While a vast amount of this land is publicly accessible, there are several notable exceptions, and on Thursday, the City Council's Committee on Parks and Recreation debated this very issue—land owned by the Parks Department that is currently off-limits to the public.
For this wide-ranging discussion, the City Council had highlighted ten notable areas throughout the city that were either completely inaccessible to the public or only had limited or supervised access.
Those ten are as follows: the potter's field, Hart Island in the Long Island Sound, North Brother Island in the East River, the Prison Ship Martyrs Monument in Fort Greene Park, the Soldiers' and Sailors' Arch at Grand Army Plaza, the Croton Aqueduct which stretches from Westchester Country through the Bronx to Manhattan, the New York State Pavilion in Queens, the Soldiers and Sailors Monument in Riverside Park, the Washington Square Arch, the High Bridge Water Tower, and the 119th Street Gatehouse.
“To allow New Yorkers a chance to see and touch these marvelous sites up close is in many cases complicated and in every case will require significant resources,” City Councilman Mark Levine, the chair of the parks committee, said in his opening remarks. “But investing in expanding access would yield incredible benefits to New Yorkers and visitors alike, offering countless opportunities for education and inspiration, and even providing a potential economic boom from tourism.”
The Council's presentation was followed by Parks Department one where representatives pointed to recently completed projects that had been made accessible to the public, such as the High Bridge which connects northern Manhattan to the Bronx or other attractions that have limited access like the Little Red Lighthouse in Washington Heights. Representatives for the department stressed time and again that while they would be willing to open a significant number of inaccessible areas, they just didn't have the resources to make it happen.
Levine questioned if the sites chosen for limited access had been arbitrarily selected, but the representative from the Parks Department countered by saying that each site was studied for its specific conditions and only opened if all the factors added up, particularly the safety of the visitors.
Some, the same representative said, were deemed entirely inaccessible after studies were conducted such as the Washington Square Arch. The interior and the roof there were once accessible to the public but have been closed off for quite some time now due to structural issues. That property would essentially require an inordinate commitment of resources to make it accessible to the public.
The Parks Department stressed that it had to weigh the importance of making parkland accessible to the vast majority instead of focusing one or the other smaller property. What they seemed to suggest was that even if a place like Washington Square Arch were opened, it would only accommodate small groups of people at a time, and hence might not make it the best use of the Parks Department's resources (which account for a minuscule 0.6 percent of the citywide budget).
Council member Elizabeth Crowley questioned why Hart Island, 101 acres of which is the largest tax-funded cemetery in the world, was still under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections. Crowley insisted that the Parks Department take up the issue with the mayor's office to transfer control to Parks and make it more easily accessible to the public. Parks representatives agreed to take up the matter, but expressed hesitation about managing an island where such a significant portion was a cemetery.
Several groups spoke in support of opening up more Parks-owned land including the Regional Plan Association and Open House New York, the latter of which offers tours to usually off-limits spaces once a year at least. Moses Gates, the director of Community Planning and Design at the RPA raised the important point that in New York he found that such projects were usually all or nothing. He advised instead that not all sites had to go undergo multimillion dollar renovations but could just be opened with the requisite safety and maintenance work such as the Promenade Plantée in Paris, which is a High Line-style park that isn't quite as dazzling as the latter, but still provides a vital public resource.
The meeting on Thursday acted more as an oversight hearing to get the ball rolling with the Parks Department. Based on all the testimony collected at the hearing, the Council will now debate whether they want the Parks Department to formally explore this avenue through pilot programs or cost estimates.
Millions of articles might soon disappear from ResearchGate, the world's largest scholarly social network. Last week, five publishers said they had formed a coalition that would start ordering ResearchGate to remove research articles from its site because they breach publishers' copyright. A spokesperson for the group said that up to 7 million papers could be affected, and that a first batch of take-down notices, for around 100,000 articles, would be sent out “imminently”.
Meanwhile, coalition members Elsevier and the American Chemical Society have filed a lawsuit to try to prevent copyrighted material appearing on ResearchGate in future. The complaint, which has not been made public, was filed on 6 October in a regional court in Germany. (ResearchGate is based in Berlin). It makes a “symbolic request for damages” but its goal is to change the site's behaviour, a spokesperson says.
ResearchGate may already have begun taking articles down, according to a 10 October statement by the coalition. The group said it had noticed that the site had removed "a significant number of copyrighted articles", although ResearchGate hadn't shared information about this with publishers. "At this point, not all violations have been addressed and ResearchGate will need to take additional steps to cease unauthorized distribution of research articles," the statement says.
The clash has been a long time coming. Researchers are increasingly posting paywalled research papers online, many of them on ResearchGate, a network often likened to Facebook for scientists. The site boasts more than 13 million members and has raised more than US$80 million in start-up funding from investors including Microsoft founder Bill Gates and the Wellcome Trust, the London-based biomedical-research funder.
Not only do academics upload articles to the site, but ResearchGate also scrapes material online and invites researchers to claim and upload these papers, says James Milne, a spokesperson for the five-publisher group, which calls itself the Coalition for Responsible Sharing. In February this year, information scientist Hamid Jamali at Charles Sturt University in Wagga Wagga, Australia, reported that he had examined 500 articles at random from ResearchGate, and found that 40% of them breached copyright1.
Access issues
In September, the International Association of Scientific, Technical, and Medical Publishers, a trade group based in Oxford, UK, sent a letter to ResearchGate suggesting that the network introduce an automated filtering system, through which uploaded articles would be shared publicly or privately depending on their copyright status. Publishers generally say that paywalled articles for which they own copyright can be shared only privately; scientists are allowed to upload preprints, and peer-reviewed but unedited manuscripts, online for general access.
“ResearchGate refused to engage with us on that,” says Milne. The Coalition for Responsible Sharing, which also includes publishers Wiley, Wolters Kluwer and Brill, says it is “now left with no other choice” but to issue take-down notices.
Litigation has been tried before: in 2013, Elsevier sent 3,000 notices under the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act to scholarly networks including Academia.edu, demanding that they take down papers that breached Elsevier's copyright. Those notices were passed on to the networks' academic users. But the new actions would be on a larger scale.
Terms and conditions
ResearchGate declined to comment on the coalition's statement, but its terms of service ask users not to store information that infringes copyright. They also state that because the site neither previews nor automatically reviews information that users have stored on it, ResearchGate can't know about — and isn't liable for — any possible infringements. The site says it will quickly disable access to infringing material after being notified of a problem.
But repeatedly sending lots of take-down notices is not a long-term solution, Milne says — hence the lawsuit, which aims to clarify what responsibility ResearchGate has to prevent copyright breaches. Milne says Elsevier and the American Chemical Society are hoping that the German court will tell the social network that it has a duty to identify copyrighted material on its website, and remove it; that the site must check whether material it scrapes from the Internet is copyrighted before users are invited to ‘claim' it and upload it; and that ResearchGate will also be told it cannot modify copyrighted material.
“The expectation is that ResearchGate will be told by the courts to cease certain behaviours. This could take months or years,” says Milne.
Not all publishers have stopped discussions with ResearchGate. On 9 October, the company posted a joint statement with Nature's publisher Springer Nature, saying that the two firms had been in “serious discussions for some time” about sharing journal articles online while protecting intellectual-property rights, and that they were “cautiously optimistic” that a solution could be found. (Nature's news and comment team is editorially independent from its publisher.)
Donald Trump has spent much of his presidency obsessing over whether he's personally under investigation as part of the probe into his Russia scandal. Ironically, the president's focus grew so intense, he may have taken actions that put him under investigation.
Close video Special counsel investigating Trump for obstruction: WaPo Adam Entous, national security reporter for the Washington Post, talks with Rachel Maddow about breaking news that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating Donald Trump for possible obstruction of justice in the firing of James Comey. share tweet email save Embed
The special counsel overseeing the investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 election is interviewing senior intelligence officials as part of a widening probe that now includes an examination of whether President Trump attempted to obstruct justice, officials said. The move by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to investigate Trump's conduct marks a major turning point in the nearly year-old FBI investigation, which until recently focused on Russian meddling during the presidential campaign and on whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. Investigators have also been looking for any evidence of possible financial crimes among Trump associates, officials said.
Rachel noted on last night's show the blockbuster new report from the Washington Post.
The piece added that Trump had received assurances from then-FBI Director James Comey that he wasn't personally being investigated, but that changed for the president “shortly after Comey's firing.”
Remember, Trump admitted publicly that he fired Comey, who was leading a counter-espionage investigation into the Russia scandal, because of the president's dissatisfaction with the probe. He also reportedly leaned on top officials in the intelligence community, asking them to intervene in the matter, adding weight to concerns about Trump's alleged obstruction efforts.
What's more, it's not just the Post. The Wall Street Journal reported that it was Trump's firing of Comey that is “now a subject of the federal probe … which has expanded to include whether the president obstructed justice.” The New York Times, meanwhile, added that the special counsel “has requested interviews with three high-ranking current or former intelligence officials, the latest indication that he will investigate whether President Trump obstructed justice.”
For months, the Russia scandal has focused on events that occurred before Trump and his team took office in January. These reports point to an important twist: Trump is now the subject of a criminal investigation because of actions he took as president.
All of Trump's rhetoric about feeling “vindicated” by recent developments suddenly looks quite silly. He is, after all, now one of only a handful of presidents to face a federal investigation, while in office, over actions taken after his inauguration. The other modern examples are Bill Clinton, who was impeached, and Richard Nixon, who resigned in disgrace before he could be impeached.
Trump World has not yet responded to the allegations specifically. A spokesperson for the president's attorney said in a written statement, “The FBI leak of information regarding the President is outrageous, inexcusable and illegal.” That's not a denial about the investigation into Trump's alleged misconduct, and it's not necessarily true that the information came from the FBI.
For his part, the president whined a bit on Twitter this morning, but Trump also did not deny that after five months in office, he's facing a criminal investigation.
While 14-year-old Ahmed Mohammed is adjusting to his newfound, albeit unwanted fame after being blatantly accused of being a domestic terrorist for making a homemade clock, his support is also growing.
The hashtag #IStandWithAhmed has been trending all day and now he's gotten one of the biggest co-signs a kid could possible attract.
The country's commander-in-chief.
“Cool clock, Ahmed,” President Barack Obama wrote on his official Twitter account. “Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great.”
Ahmed has since been suspended from school but what cooler way to spend a few days off than to kick it in the Oval Office?
In the meantime, the Council on American-Islamic Relations is crawling all over the situation in Irving, Texas.

Story highlights The "cessation of touring agreement" goes into effect after 2015
"Everything must come to an end," drummer Tommy Lee says
Agreement is "a peaceful decision to move on to other endeavors," band's lawyer says
"The Final Tour" starts in July 2014
All four members of Motley Crue signed an agreement Tuesday that will permanently dissolve the legendary rock group after a final tour.
Vince Neil, Mick Mars, Nikki Sixx and Tommy Lee appeared in a Hollywood hotel Tuesday for a signing ceremony for a "cessation of touring agreement," which their lawyer said would bring a peaceful end to the group.
"Other bands have split up over rancor or the inability of people to get along, but this is mutual among all four original members and a peaceful decision to move on to other endeavors and to confirm it with a binding agreement," attorney Doug Mark said.
Motley Crue has sold more than 80 million albums since hitting the road in 1981, but drummer Tommy Lee said, "Everything must come to an end."
"We always had a vision of going out with a big f**king bang and not playing county fairs and clubs with one or two original band members," said Lee, who is the youngest member at 51. "Our job here is done."
Guitarist Mick Mars, the oldest band member at 62, said the group's 33 years have had "more drama than 'General Hospital.'"
Vocalist Vince Neil, 52, said he'll miss the group, but it's not an end to his rock career. "I feel there are a lot of great opportunities and exciting projects after Motley."
The first leg of "The Final Tour" starts in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on July 2.
The termination agreement becomes effective at the end of 2015, after a global tour that will include Alice Cooper.
"Motley Crue and Alice Cooper -- A match made in Armageddon?" said Cooper.
Social Media
Twitter bots are often thought of as being of the spam variety, and an account by the name of Your [sic] in America is having a bit of fun with them. It's been around since November 23rd and has already amassed over 8,000 followers.
The account's objective is simple: Find Twitter users telling others to learn to speak English and saying, “Your in America,” and correcting them on it. So far, Your in America has posted 59 tweets and aggravated many users.
For being so simple, it's pure comedic gold. Here's just a few worth mentioning:
It's “you're.” As in, you're embarrassing yourself. RT @paigeparr: your in america…speak english. — Your in America Bot (@YourInAmerica) November 26, 2012
“You're” in America. We spell in English, learn it. RT @drewpattt: your in America, we speak english, learn it — Your in America Bot (@YourInAmerica) November 24, 2012

Twitter is full of bots and it's amusing to see accounts having a bit of fun instead of spamming out links.
Most tutorials focus on one aspect of the shooting process or another, which can sometimes make it a bit difficult to understand why each creative decision was made at different steps of the process. This great video follows a photographer from planning to finished image, giving an overview of the shoot, what difficulties he faced, and how he overcame them.
If you don't already know Francisco Hernandez, he's a portrait guru, known for his well-lit and retouched work. In this video, you'll follow him from the conceptualization of a shoot with a model, to the shoot itself, and on to the finalized image. I think it's important to watch the complete workflow of professionals, as while we're used to isolating techniques or ideas and diving into them at a deep level, seeing them as they fit into a singular timeline can make it clear how different creative decisions tie together and how these in turn can have consequences on other aspects of the shoot. For example, Hernandez has a little trouble overpowering the sun, so he moves his octabox closer to the model. This in turn softens the light, which may affect the way you treat contrast and dodging and burning when you bring the image into Lightroom and Photoshop. While the video doesn't get in depth in explaining the techniques, it does explain each decision well, and it's worth watching.
This Cabbage Roll Casserole is probably the most popular recipe on this site – and for good reason, it's ridiculously delicious! I've yet to try my hand at making traditional cabbage rolls, I have to admit I'm a little apprehensive. I do love to order them in restaurants however, and my inspiration for this dish was making them a bit more accessible and easy. While this casserole is certainly not directly related to a traditional cabbage roll, all that flavor is still there.
I get a lot of feedback about the cheese not being necessary as it is not present ever in a traditional roll, but I absolutely love what it adds to this casserole. All that zesty tangy deliciousness combined with that ooey gooey cheese really does make this one of my favorite things to eat. 🙂
There isn't too much prep time involved – about 30 minutes, and it's in the oven for about 45 minutes. It makes a large casserole dish worth – so it's enough food for about 6 – 8 people.
casseroles are the best thing ever!

The Big Ten will release its 2013 and 2014 conference schedules a little later today, but I've obtained the future slates and wanted to share them with you.
Several things stand out about these schedules.
START DATES/OPEN DATES
You'll notice two separate start dates for league play. In the past, we've seen one team have a bye for the first Saturday of Big Ten play, but all the other squads begin conference games at the same time. In both 2013 and 2014, we'll see two Big Ten openers on the final Saturday of September and the other four conference openers on the first Saturday of October.
Here's how the Big Ten will open league play ...
2013: Iowa at Minnesota, Wisconsin at Ohio State on Sept. 28
2014: Michigan at Indiana, Minnesota at Penn State on Sept. 27
The four Big Ten teams that open conference play in September will have two open dates after the first league contest. One open date falls on the first Saturday of October, and the other comes later. The other eight squads will have one open date after Oct. 1 and one before Oct. 1.
FOUR-YEAR BREAKS
Each Big Ten team will have a four-year break from facing one of its conference foes. There's only one six-year break -- Iowa and Illinois, which resulted from two different scheduling formats blending after expansion -- but six pairings will not face each other between 2011 and '14.
They are:
Illinois-Iowa
Indiana-Nebraska
Michigan-Wisconsin
Michigan State-Penn State
Minnesota-Ohio State
Northwestern-Purdue
These breaks are unavoidable given the current scheduling setup: eight total conference games, five division games, one protected crossover game and two rotating crossovers.
"That's just the mathematics of it," said Big Ten senior associate commissioner for television administration Mark Rudner, who puts together the schedule. "While teams are still playing eight conference games, out of the total inventory of games available, we're playing a smaller percentage. We've added a 12th institution. Part of this could be solved if we went to a nine-game [Big Ten] schedule moving forward.
"It's not ideal, but hopefully moving forward it can be addressed."
We could have a final verdict on the nine-game league schedule at the Big Ten spring meetings next month in Chicago. If approved, the slate could go into effect for the 2015 season. The tricky part is ensuring certain teams maintain seven overall home games.
Back to the no-plays: I think Michigan State fans and Penn State fans will get over not having the Land Grant Trophy at stake for four years. The extended break for Iowa-Illinois is unfortunate, and I know I'll miss the Wisconsin-Michigan series during the span. Some exciting games between the Wolverines and Badgers. Breaks in the other three series are unfortunate, but none of those matchups has much pizzazz.
Rudner said the no-plays were decided randomly.
END-OF-SEASON GAMES
Four of the six Big Ten matchups to close the regular seasons in 2011 and 2012 will remain for 2013 and 2014. Michigan-Ohio State isn't going anywhere, and Iowa-Nebraska, Purdue-Indiana and Penn State-Wisconsin all will be played on the final regular-season Saturday.
The other closing games are Northwestern-Illinois, which has often been on the final regular-season Saturday, and Michigan State-Minnesota.
NONPROTECTED CROSSOVERS/TWO-YEAR NO-PLAYS
Here are the nonprotected division crossover games for each Big Ten squad in 2013 and 2014:
Illinois: Michigan State, Nebraska
Indiana: Minnesota, Michigan
Iowa: Wisconsin, Ohio State
Michigan: Penn State, Indiana
Michigan State: Illinois, Purdue
Minnesota: Indiana, Penn State
Nebraska: Illinois, Purdue
Northwestern: Wisconsin, Ohio State
Ohio State: Northwestern, Iowa
Penn State: Michigan, Minnesota
Purdue: Nebraska, Michigan State
Wisconsin: Northwestern, Iowa
A lot can change between now and 2013, but Northwestern, Purdue, Iowa and Illinois seemingly have the toughest nonprotected crossovers. Nebraska and Michigan State get a bit of a break with these.
Here's a look at the no-plays just for 2013 and 2014 (these teams will play in 2011 and 2012):
Illinois: Michigan, Minnesota
Indiana: Northwestern, Iowa
Iowa: Indiana, Penn State
Michigan: Illinois, Purdue
Michigan State: Ohio State, Wisconsin
Minnesota: Illinois, Purdue
Nebraska: Ohio State, Wisconsin
Northwestern: Indiana, Penn State
Ohio State: Nebraska, Michigan State
Penn State: Northwestern, Iowa
Purdue: Minnesota, Michigan
Wisconsin: Michigan State, Nebraska
It'll be tough not seeing matchups like Nebraska-Ohio State, Penn State-Iowa, Michigan State-Ohio State and Nebraska-Wisconsin. I'd say Nebraska, Michigan State, Ohio State and Wisconsin "benefit" the most from these no-plays.
FINAL NUGGETS
The Big Ten championship game will take place on Dec. 7, 2013, and Dec. 6, 2014. The location is to be determined.
Some of the most exciting league openers include Wisconsin at Ohio State in 2013 and Iowa at Wisconsin in 2014.
That's a lot to digest. What are your thoughts on the future schedules?
WASHINGTON — A Senate subcommittee has found that the official who served as the Department of Homeland Security's acting inspector general from 2011 to 2013 “jeopardized the independence” of his office by delaying reports and alerting department officials about their contents.
In a 29-page report released on Thursday, a subcommittee of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that oversees contracts said that the official, Charles Edwards, a longtime federal employee, had been “openly seeking a nomination” to become the department's permanent inspector general. Mr. Edwards resigned in December, shortly before a scheduled hearing by the panel on his tenure.
Shortly after the report was released, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Jeh C. Johnson, said that Mr. Edwards, who was reassigned to a science and technology job in the department, had been placed on administrative leave.
“Other individuals who are apparently and allegedly implicated have already left D.H.S., and if additional information comes to light, I will continue to take appropriate action,” Mr. Johnson said.
Workers Fight for Justice, From Wal-Mart to Chipotle
The great recession of 2008, this global economic meltdown, has wiped out the life savings of so many people and created a looming threat of chronic unemployment for millions. This is happening while corporate coffers are brimming with historically high levels of cash on hand, in both the “too big to fail” banks and in nonfinancial corporations. Despite unemployment levels that remain high, and the anxiety caused by people living paycheck to paycheck, many workers in the United States are taking matters into their own hands, demanding better working conditions and better pay. These are the workers who are left unmentioned in the presidential debates, who remain uninvited into the corporate news networks' gilded studios. These are the workers at Wal-Mart, the largest private employer in the United States. These are the tomato pickers from Florida. With scant resources, armed with their courage and the knowledge that they deserve better, they are organizing and getting results.
This week, Wal-Mart workers launched the first strike against the giant retailer in its 50-year history, with protests and picket lines at 28 stores across 12 states. Many of these nonunion workers are facing retaliation from their employer, despite the protections that exist on paper through the National Labor Relations Board. The strikers are operating under the banner of OUR Walmart: Organization United for Respect at Wal-Mart, started with support from the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. OUR Walmart members protested outside Wal-Mart's “Meeting for the Investment Community 2012” in Bentonville, Ark. Demanding a stop to the company's retaliations, the group promised a vigorous national presence at Wal-Mart stores on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving and the largest retail shopping day of the year. The workers have an impressive array of allies readies to join them, including the National Organization for Women.
Wal-Mart has historically shrouded its business practices by engaging subcontractors to perform tasks like warehousing and delivery. In Elwood, Ill., warehouse workers employed by Wal-Mart subcontractor RoadLink went out on strike immediately after a similar strike in California. According to Warehouse Workers for Justice (WWJ), “warehouse workers labor under extreme temperatures, lifting thousands of boxes that can weigh up to 250lbs each. Workplace injuries are common; workers rarely earn a living wage or have any benefits.”
According to WWJ, after 21 days on strike in Elwood, the workers “won their principal demand for an end to illegal retaliation against workers protesting poor conditions. They will return to work … with full pay for the time they were on strike.”
I spoke with one of the Elwood strikers, Mike Compton, who described just one of the awful conditions they endured at their low-wage job:
“We have a big problem with dust. You know, all our containers that we unload come from China, and they're just filled with black dust. It's horrible, breathing the stuff in all day, you know, and we'd have to ask seven, eight times to get a dust mask. We'd just be pointed in different directions, to a different manager, to a different department. And half the time we'd walk away empty-handed at the end of it anyway. We've actually had trailers that were labeled ‘defumigated in Mexico.' We don't know why. People have had trouble breathing in the trailers. You know, dust — something as simple and as cheap as a dust mask should just be readily available to anyone, in my opinion, especially a company as wealthy as Wal-Mart.”
Compton was in Bentonville, Ark., Wal-Mart's corporate headquarters, to protest at the Wal-Mart investor meeting
Meanwhile, immigrant farmworkers have for generations labored under brutal conditions, picking tomatoes in the rural town of Immokalee, Fla. In 1993, they formed the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) to organize in solidarity with consumers to demand that major restaurant chains source their tomatoes from farms that pay a fair wage to their workers.
I spoke with farmworker and CIW organizer Gerardo Reyes-Chavez. He was in Denver, where the fast-food outlet Chipotle is based. CIW has been working on Chipotle for 10 years. He told me: “We have been able to create a Fair Food Program, addressing abuses in the tomato industry. We created a whole new system … to identify where abuses are going on and uproot them from the system. This is an opportunity for Chipotle to do the right thing. They claim that they sell food with integrity, and they are really focused on the sustainability … what we are saying is, this is an opportunity for them to make it a reality.”
The day after I spoke with Reyes-Chaves, Chipotle signed the Fair Food Agreement. As the presidential candidates trade barbs over jobs in their heavily-controlled debates, workers at the grass roots are organizing for change, from Florida to California.

Google has combined the powers of fashion nerds and computer nerds to create Boutiques.com, a shopping site that seeks to imitate the glorious experience of browsing through a store stuffed with limitless racks of clothes, except that when this (algorithmic) personal shopper suggests something would look great on you, it is not an insidious lie.
The Boutiques site "uses computer vision and machine learning technology to visually analyze your taste and match it to items you would like," its CEO explains, based on input from "taste-makers of all types" who took its visual quiz to teach the site "to understand their style genre." The site features advanced search filters to make it easier to find the perfect clothing item you've imagined in your head and are sure must exist somewhere in reality. Like Polyvore, Boutiques offers inspiration photos, as well as famous style icons you can emulate and an outfit finisher for when you can't figure out what to wear with your latest find.
(One clear drawback is that the site doesn't have a feature offering guidance for what to wear in socially terrifying events, like "My husband's coming back from Iraq" or "My case is being decided by the Supreme Court" or "I've been plucked from obscurity to be the Republican nominee for vice-president.")
Better Sifting, Cathy Horyn says at The New York Times. When you pick "whatever your style preference — classic, romantic, casual — the inspiration panel automatically adjusts for them, like a support group that can read your mind with surprising precision. And that may be Boutiques.com's ultimate game-changer — how precisely it analyzes your preferences to give you what you requested. As many online shoppers know, search engines tend to give you stuff you don't really want. A request for fern-colored shoes might yield fern shoes, plus fern-print blouses. But, as two experienced online shoppers found when they tested the site earlier this week at Google's New York office, if you ask for cobalt blue shoes, you get them," Horyn writes. "In simple terms, what the style experts did was come up with about 500 words for color, shape and pattern — robin's egg blue, for instance, and gingham — and then the engineers trained the algorithm to know what each was. They would have pictures of what gingham was and what gingham wasn't."
A Step Forward in Online Shopping Technology, Search Engine Land's Greg Sterling says. "On the surface Boutiques may resemble other 'social shopping' sites such as Polyvore or Stylehive. But the underlying technology, I'm told, is much more sophisticated than comparable female-centric shopping sites. Boutiques is a highly visual, social and personalized shopping destination built on sophisticated machine learning and visual recognition technology. Munjal Shah, CEO of Like.com, the company Google acquired in August and which built Boutiques.com, likened it to Pandora for apparel. There's an elaborate taxonomy and structure behind the presentation of content on Boutiques."
It Has Its Quirks, New York's Amy Odell writes. "In creating your own boutique, Google attempts to analyze your style with its 'Stylizer' that forces you to choose between two images, usually of models or celebrities wearing outfits, but landmarks or alcoholic beverages randomly pop up if you skip through all the selections." Plus, there's nothing for dudes. "Men's ought to come down the line, in the typical online retail fashion of adding men's after women's proves successful. Though it wouldn't seem like a bad thing to launch menswear with womenswear since many men prefer online shopping, which saves them the embarrassment of physical shopping. Then again, maybe it's more embarrassing for them to shop from Ryan Reynolds's e-boutique."
An Interesting Play for Google, Seth Weintraub writes at Fortune. It's "unlike anything Google (GOOG) has done before. There isn't any advertising and the imagery is big and beautiful. This is all about shopping." The celeb feature will be a big draw, Weintraub says, because much like "celebrity playlists on iTunes, Celebrity Boutiques show the favorites of celebrities consumers may want to emulate in one way or another. Google has an impressive lineup of both entertainment stars and celebrity bloggers listed at its opening."
No Google Branding, Zee notes on The Next Web. "On face value this appears to be a very random move from Google but the visual search technology itself stems from Google's acquisition of Like.com for a reported $100 million. Before the purchase, Like.com ran similar sites including Covet.com, and the styling tool Couturious.com. Interestingly there's virtually no Google branding on the site. Is this the first of many? It screams 'experiment.'"

FOX's renew/cancel standings for week 29 of the 2016-17 season note that bad news for one show can be good news for another.
Here are the standings, and here's an explanation of the Bear's methodology.
Show Status 18-49 rating Renew/Cancel Index Bones (O) Final season 0.81 0.11 Scream Queens (O) 🐻 0.61 -0.09 Rosewood (some F) (O) 🐻 🐻 0.68 0.11 The Exorcist (F) (O) 🐻 🐻 0.67 0.26 Sleepy Hollow (F) (O) 🐻 🐻 0.5 0.02 The Last Man on Earth (O) 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 0.94 0.24 Pitch (O) 🐻 🐻 🐻 0.85 0.15 Making History (O) 🐻 🐻 0.72 0.02 Son of Zorn (O) 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 1.18 0.48 Shots Fired (O) 🐻 🐻 🐻 1.03 0.33 Lucifer Renewed 1.08 0.38 Brooklyn Nine-Nine 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 0.99 0.29 New Girl (O) 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 0.93 0.23 Gotham 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 1.14 0.44 APB (O) 🐻 🐻 🐻 0.83 0.13 Star (O) Renewed 1.35 0.65 The Mick (O) Renewed 1.18 0.48 24: Legacy (O) 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 1.52 0.82 Family Guy (O) 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 1.32 0.62 Lethal Weapon Renewed 1.57 0.87 Empire (O) Renewed 3.03 2.33 Bob's Burgers (O) Renewed 1.01 0.31 The Simpsons (O) Renewed 1.83 1.13
*The index number for “Rosewood” is a weighted average of its performance on Thursdays and Fridays.
Two weeks ago the Bear downgraded “Making History” to a likely cancellation at FOX. Its loss is another show's gain: “Son of Zorn” is getting bumped up to a likely renewal.
Simply put, FOX doesn't have a ton of options. Moving “The Mick” to Sundays would weaken an already shaky Tuesday block, and maybe one of the comedy pilots FOX is developing sounds like a Sunday show.
“Zorn's” ratings weren't great, and they were inflated by the NFL for about half of its season. But they're likely good enough to earn a second season. Remember the Bear's maxim: A show doesn't have to be the fastest to outrun the Bear; it just has to make sure it's not the slowest.
Key:
DSW Dead Show Walking: All but officially canceled yet still airing 🐻 sure bet to be canceled by May 2017 🐻 🐻 likely to be canceled by May 2017 🐻 🐻 🐻 tossup between renewal and cancellation by May 2017 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 likely to be renewed by May 2017 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 sure bet to be renewed by May 2017
The Renewal/Cancel Index is the amount above (or below) a replacement-level rating — i.e., the expected adults 18-49 rating of an emergency fill-in show should a series be canceled. For the 2016-17 season, replacement level is a 0.7 same-day rating in adults 18-49 for the Big 4 networks and a 0.2 for The CW. (Read more here.) The index number is taken by subtracting 0.7 (or 0.2) from a show's average same-day rating.
Friday scripted shows (denoted with an “F” above) on the Big 4 have average ratings about 30 percent lower than those of other nights, therefore their ratings are multiplied by 1.43 (1/0.7, or 7 70 percent) before subtracting the replacement-level number.
Shows that have ended their seasons have their R/C Index number frozen at the point of their final episode.
(O) – Owned: All other things equal, shows owned by studios affiliated with their networks have a better shot at renewal than those from outside producers.
The offseason has given way to spring training, and the regular season is right around the corner, but that hasn't stopped the Cleveland Indians from trying to wheel and deal their way to a better team. With under two weeks to go, Nick Cafardo is reporting that Cleveland (among other teams) "loves Boston's young outfielders," and "have been pitching a trade" for the likes of Mookie Betts and Jackie Bradley Jr. in trade talks.
For those who just did a sharp intake of breath, or immediately curled up into the fetal position in fear of losing Mookie Betts, rest assured, the Red Sox are not looking to send him anywhere. Cafardo describes the young star-in-the-making as "untouchable," which he should be in any trade talks that don't include one of the top young players in all baseball coming back the other way. The Indians do have that sort of player--hi, Francisco Lindor--but deals like that just don't tend to be made. Why upset a good thing, after all?
Jackie Bradley Jr. represents a more realistic target for the Indians. It wasn't a year ago, after all, that the Red Sox would've loved to have any serious interest in the dynamic young center fielder. Since then, though, they've been given reason to believe that Bradley might be able to cut it at the plate in the majors after all, be it with an .850 OPS or a .700. The former figure would leave Bradley one of the best players in the game, but the latter wouldn't be bad at all given that he's one of the best defenders to set foot in Fenway's outfield in recent years. Dave Dombrowski is plenty familiar with that, as Bradley almost seemed to make a point of putting on a show for the new President of Baseball Operations when he attended his first Red Sox games.
Still, it's a trade that can be made, as Cafardo suggests, but one that would be difficult to swing. Four months ago, there would be a much better opportunity. The Red Sox would have time to react, switch up some plans, and replace Bradley with another strong center fielder (or move Betts to center and replace him in right). As is, their outfield bench options are solid, particularly if trading Bradley opens up a space for David Murphy, but a Murphy/Young platoon would leave the Red Sox with little help on the bench, and in trouble should they lose one of their better defensive outfielders.
Which brings us to the final option, and one that Cafardo mentions as an afterthought: Rusney Castillo. The reality is that the Red Sox don't have a great trade chip there. He's semi-young and fairly cheap, but not so cheap that the Indians were willing to pay him that sort of money when he was on the open market in 2014. Given that since that point he's only added injury questions to the mix, Cafardo is likely right in saying the Red Sox would have to eat some money, but the possibility exists they'd like to cut bait on that particular gamble and turn to more reliable options, even if it means sacrificing upside.
Major League Baseball took the first vote in a two-step process Thursday, unanimously approving funding for expanded instant replay in 2014. They plan to approve the new rules when they meet Jan. 16 in Paradise Valley, Ariz., after agreements with the unions for umpires and players.
"We made a gigantic move today," Commissioner Bud Selig said. "This is quite historic."
Selig long opposed replay and watched from afar as it was first used by the NFL in 1986, the NHL in 1991, the NBA in 2002 and Wimbledon in 2006. Even the Little League World Series put replay in place for 2008.
MLB allowed it starting August 2008 but in a limited manner: to determine whether potential home runs were fair or cleared fences.
Now, virtually every decision likely will be subject to review, except balls and strikes, checked swings and some foul tips.
"Tag plays, out/safe at first, fair/foul past the bags, those are all going to be included," said Rob Manfred, MLB's chief operating officer.
So no more blown calls, like Don Denkinger's at first base that turned Game 6 of the 1985 World Series or Jim Joyce's bad decision at first base that cost Detroit's Armando Galarraga a perfect game in 2010.
"We want to get more plays right, the ones that matter," Manfred said.
Manfred said when a manager wants to challenge a call, he will notify an umpire, triggering a review in New York by what are likely to be present or retired big league umps. A headset would be brought to the crew chief, who would be notified of the decision.
There will be a maximum of two challenges per manager in each game -- "it could be less," Manfred said -- and if the challenge is upheld it would not be counted against the manager's limit. If a manager is out of challenges, umpires probably will be allowed request a review on their own.
"Getting more plays right can only enhance the game," St. Louis Cardinals general manager John Mozeliak said.
Manfred appeared to indicate that the video being reviewed in New York could be show to fans in stadiums or possibly on television broadcasts.
"I think you can expect that there will be as part of this package expanded use of in-stadium video boards," he said.
Selig has emphasized that he doesn't want replay to slow games, whose increased length in recent decades has been targeted for criticism.
"The current thinking is that if a manager comes out and argues, once he argues, he can't challenge that play," Manfred said. "One way to control the timing of challenges is to use the natural flow of the game, that is the next pitch cuts off your right to challenge."

Hi there! We are super-excited to announce the new, big-fat update of Mitti, version 1.1
Mitti 1.1 contains various performance and UI/UX optimisations, polishings, and bug fixes - but let's start with the most exciting new features.
Transitions
Mitti 1.1 adds the possibility to make Transitions between Cues by adding an option to toggle on/off Transitions for each - and any type of - Cue individually.
You can of course set different transition time to each Cue independently, and Mitti is coming with over 30 type of GPU-accelerated, OpenGL-shader based transitions.
In/Out Time for Video Cues
Setting the In/Out time for Video Cues was far the most requested feature since Mitti hit the prime time, so we are happy to let you know we also added this feature in Mitti 1.1.
The In/Out times are absolute times, and can be set in the Cue Preferences - but for the Current Cue there is also a keyboard shortcut and an option in the - new - Cue Menu.
Cue-Level Pause on Start/End Option
Mitti 1.1 adds options to individual Cues to Pause on Start and End, and it supersedes the Pause-At-Cue-End feature of Mitti 1.0 - this means that function has been removed. Setting this option is also available from the right-click menu of course, and you can even set it to all selected Cues.
If Pause on Start or End enabled for a Cue, it will stop when its reaching the Cue's beginning or start point.
Cue-Level Fade Times and Cut To/From Black
From the Cue Preferences now it is possible to set different Fade Time for each Cue individually, and also added a 0s option which results in Cut To/From Black.
Auto-Start & Auto Fullscreen options
There are 2 new options in the Misc preferences, allowing you to set Mitti to automatically start playback and automatically toggle fullscreen mode on after a project has been opened.
These little additions are extremely useful for permanent installations.
Logic Pro X 10.3 and Mitti
Mitti 1.1 improves the compatibility with Logic Pro X 10.3 - now It's possible to receive MMC commands from Logic Pro while scrubbing on its timeline, so you will be in sync all the time.
And a whole lot more...
Various UI/UX & project loading speed optimisations.
Added a progress bar for project loading.
Enhanced MTC sync precision.
A new Cue menu.
An even smarter right-click menu.
Updated to NDI SDK 2.0 for even better performance.
Supported the latest changes of the OSCQuery protocol.
Various bug fixes - all known issues has been fixed!
For a full list of changes so far, please check out the changelog.
Thanks to everyone who submitted bug reports and feature requests, and also thanks for your help with testing out beta builds!
Mitti 1.1 is a free update, so grab it while it is hot – use the built-in updater or just download the latest version from the website.
While serving in Afghanistan, Petty Officer Chris Holden has attended numerous memorials to honour the dead. This is what they look like to an atheist
People tend to reject the primitive religions, but sun worship seems to me an entirely rational theology. This occurred to me, ironically, as I struggled into full body armour, beneath a sun as merciless as the Old Testament God, in the Main Operating Base (MOB) Lashkar Gah, Afghanistan. Photo of Chris Holden, by Tim Kelly
As I shouldered my rifle, an amplified wail erupted beyond the sandbags and wire and over the MOB's monolithic walls. In Helmand Province, the Islamic call-to-prayer resolutely punctuates the pattern of life, and while it fails to emancipate Afghans from the “tyranny of cousins”, liberal alternatives are crushed with great success.
But the Adhan was competing today with an infidel chant. ISAF Christians had congregated in a canvas chapel and their hymn was melodic to be sure. Yet in this harsh environment, the Islamic lament retains an atavistic authenticity. One imagines the nomads of antiquity, hunkered around flickering camp fires, swathed against the desert dust, mesmerised by the verses of the great mystic poets, or perhaps just ranting in the Abrahamic tradition.
I reached the canvas chapel and glanced inside. The Anglican flock were dressed like me in crumpled deserts and scuffed boots. They had worked, slept and eaten beside me constantly for months. Nevertheless, as they projected their voices in unified praise, I knew I had no business with them here, so I turned away and trudged on through the dust alone.
Later that afternoon, the MOB gathered to remember the latest victim of the war. These vigils are frequent and militaristic, of course, but they are also overtly religious – much more so than you might expect. We stand at ease in deep files facing a wide concrete cloister the colour of sun-bleached bone. Obstinate sage-green plants line its base and embossed plaques denote a memorial. Before it, coalition flags on tall, white poles hang limp at half-mast. A waist-high wooden cross and a pulpit stand ready in the dust. The overall effect is Spartan – and exquisitely poignant.
We wait, silent as posts, sweating. Mosquitoes zip and buzz, provoking constantly; but discipline incarcerates so our only reaction is clandestine twitching. The stillness is quite extraordinary. Then a sudden, powdery wind whispers like a living thing. The flags billow for a moment . . . and then flop once more, exhausted.
Still we wait.
The sun relents a little, but it delegates a modicum of its oppressive power to the Regimental Sergeant Major, who scrutinises us constantly for illegal movement. He clamps his parade stick underarm and briefs us with perfect calibration: “Remember why you are here!” he bellows. And we do. “If you feel queasy, I have no problem at all with you fainting. As long as you remain perfectly at attention until your face connects with the ground, nothing more will be said.”
We slam to attention.
The Brigadier enters the compound and we stiffen like androids. The RSM salutes. Snippets of their exchange carry on hot, undulating breezes: “… at ease, RSM,” says the Brigadier, “… remember . . . fallen warrior … gave . . . today, for our tomorrow . . .”
We stand at ease.
The Padre, a Lt Colonel commando, with wisps of light-brown hair and eyes like soft steel, wears an ankle-length black stole over his multi-terrain-pattern combats. He walks to the pulpit, and even now, after so many times, I still marvel at his calm. The wooden symbol of his faith casts its long shadow across the memorial behind him. He grips the dais, sets his broad face towards the declining sun, inhales the baked air for a moment, and then begins:
“I am the resurrection and the life, says the Lord, those who believe in me, even though they die, will live, and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die.
“The souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and no torment will ever touch them.
“We gather today to remember . . .”
I have no right to record the name of the fallen here. I want to give a sense of this experience from the perspective of an unbeliever, but there is a dignity to what I have seen and I will not betray it.
“Heavenly Father, through your Son Jesus Christ you have given us a lasting hope. Grant to those who are bereaved the spirit of faith and courage, that they may have strength to meet the days to come, not sorrowing as those without hope, but in the sure expectation of a joyful reunion in the heavenly places. This we ask through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.”
The Brigadier takes the pulpit: “The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: For thou art with me; Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; Thou anointest my head with oil; My cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the House of the Lord forever.”
In a land repressively nurtured and obscenely abused by religion, the introductory invitation to Pascal's Wager is chilling, but my reaction to the Psalm is more complex. The Brigadier delivers it earnestly, and this strikes me with a kind of dread. Its bucolic promise is implausible, yet a furtive glance left and right reveals a sea of bowed heads. “No man is an island,” reckons Donne, but he was never an atheist in Afghanistan during prayer.
And yet! In this ultra-real-surreal situation, could secular poetry compare? Wilfred Owen is for all time, but precisely recalls his own; troops in Helmand are often “bent double”, but never like old beggars under sacks.
Who will express the essence of loss in this war? Or have we resolved the “Romantic dilemma”? Perhaps our poetry hides in shaky footage, from a helmet web-cam.
In any case, Psalm 23 moves me. If you skipped the words, take a moment and read them again. They do make me think about the fallen soldier, my comrade, a human being I have never met and will now never know; but I am not relating an epiphany. Empathy moves me, of course, and the sublime apprehension that I am here, that violent death is not an abstraction, injects . . . not fear exactly . . . a more giddy dose of existential anxiety.
The eulogy, read by a shaken comrade, is always the hardest to bear. We listen grimly to the synopsis of a life that is both unique and similar to our own. I impose the faces of my family on to those so recently shattered. This is solipsism, I know; but I am powerless.
“Parade . . . Shun!”
Dust explodes around our boots. The RSM, a ramrod, recites from memory the name and number of the fallen.
“They shall grow not old as we that are left grow old: Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn: At the going down of the sun and in the morning. We will remember them.”
We echo, “We will remember them!” and my spine sings.
Then, as the memorial's radiating whiteness softens, the first sour note trembles from a bugle, and the Last Post resonates in a way that would be bellicose if not for its undeniable beauty. Towards the end, I flinch at a dropped note, but somehow this breaks the spell and articulates the futility of it all with crystalline precision.
Silence. I think about the young man in whose name we are gathered; but my thoughts inexorably turn to my own dear friend, lost to this war. The sadness I feel is constant and too deep for words. I cannot analyse it here; I am not ready.
After a conscious minute, the Reveille's three-toned chords cleave the silence. Then the Padre recites the commendation and invokes The Lord's Prayer.
The instant rhythmic murmur isolates me from the rest like a compound wall. A memory strikes: in primary school, many years ago, I used to dread this ritual. I never learnt the words and I would mouth silent nonsense with the skill of a French mime. It bewildered me that the other kids knew it. I thought the knowledge must be innate, that I was deficient in some way. I don't think that any more – nor do I mime.
After Amen, the Padre recites a prayer attributed to Sir Francis Drake: “O Lord God, when thou givest thy servants to endeavour any great matter/Grant us also to know that it is not the beginning/But the continuing of the same until it be thoroughly finished/Which yieldeth the true glory; through him, who for the finishing of thy work/ Laid down his life, our redeemer, Jesus Christ. Amen.”
Then he traces the shape of a cross in the air and proclaims: “In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, may God's light be upon you and those you love. Amen.”
The RSM crunches dust as he turns smartly and salutes the Brigadier. We tense in anticipation. “Parade complete, Sir. Permission to carry on?” “Carry on, RSM.” “Parade . . . Shun! Dismiss!”
We turn 90 degrees to the right, dwell for two marching paces and then disperse. We exchange glances darkly. Then someone mutters, “That was honking.” This colloquialism will mean little to you, but to us it says it all.
With its chairman bearing a Glock handgun on his hip and crowds peering through the windows of its “overflow” observation room, a Minnesota House committee on Wednesday debated and heard testimony on a pair of gun rights bills that have garnered dozens of sponsors.
Rep. Raymond Dehn, DFL-Minneapolis, asked, “What problem is this bill trying to solve?”
“It's a constitutional right. A law-abiding citizen … should have that right,” replied the chief sponsor of both bills, Rep. Jim Nash, R-Red Wing.
While legislators heard public testimony from both sides of the issue, the large majority spoke against the bills — including residents, gun owners and a series of law enforcement officials.
The first bill, known as the “constitutional carry” bill, eliminates the need for a gun permit on public property entirely in most cases, except for people who cannot legally carry guns, such as felons. For them, it increases criminal penalties for gun possession to a felony.
Despite talk of “carnage” on the national stage, gun rights proponents touted the fact that homicide rates are at a near all-time low, including in states where similar legislation had been passed.
Protect Minnesota, citing information from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, noted that of the 364,000 people who had applied for gun permits from 2006 to 2016, just over 4,300 people had been denied.
“I don't think we can argue this is onerous,” said Rev. Nancy Bence, the organization's head.
Still, Bence argued that that's still 4,300 people that shouldn't have a gun, as they handed a list to each representative of those denied in their communities.
Rep. Eric Lucero, one of the bill's sponsors, noted that his list had 915 names — an impossibility since the district is question only had 800 people.
“I think this is just made up,” Lucero said.
Protect Minnesota later clarified that the list of 915 names they gave Lucero was for all of Hennepin County, not just Lucero's small section, over a 10-year period.
Maplewood Police Chief Paul Schnell, representing the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association, said chiefs oppose the bill because it would eliminate basic safety training requirements mandated by the permit process, “allowing even people who have never carried a gun to carry.”
“To take away the background checks and training … is the height of irresponsibility,” added Bill Kraus, who said he's been a gun owner for 40 years.

Ranking DFL committee member Debra Hilstrom of Brooklyn Center wondered how a police officer would be able to tell if a person they pulled over could legally carry a gun. Under current law, they could expect to see a permit.
“So is that your intention, that anytime law enforcement sees a firearm in a vehicle, that they would have to do a full and complete immediate background check of anyone, prior to letting them leave the scene?” she asked.

Federal money for election security again tied up in Minnesota Legislature “I don't know enough about the information, about the computers on the patrol cars, about whether it's available … I simply can't answer that,” said Joseph Olson, a professor at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law who helped draft the bill.
“We've been down this road before and the sky hasn't fallen,” said Rob Doar, political director for the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus.
STAND YOUR GROUND
The second bill, known as the “defense of dwelling and person act” — commonly referred to as the “stand your ground” bill — expands the types of incidents in which it is legal to take another person's life.
Under current law, a Minnesotan can intentionally take another person's life only if they reasonably believe it will prevent “great bodily harm” (the highest standard of harm), death or a felony in their own home.”
The new law would allow lethal force to stop a variety of felonies, whether a person is in their home or not. Those crimes include a variety of assaults, arson, burglary, robbery and kidnapping. It also lowers the feared “harm” threshold to substantial, rather than great.
And as for the defense of a person's own home, “An individual taking defensive action … may use all force and means, including deadly force, that the individual in good faith believes is required to succeed in defense …
“The individual is not required to retreat,” the law states.
Someone entering a home “by stealth” can be met with deadly force, the law says, unless the resident knows the person being stealthy has a legal right to be there. The bill also defines “dwelling” to include things that are “temporary,” including tents, motor vehicles and watercraft.
Dakota County attorney James Backstrom objected to the bill, saying, “Do we really want the law to presume that a homeowner has the right to shoot and kill an unarmed teenager who sneaks into a garage to steal a bicycle, as would be the case under this proposal?”
Chief Schnell noted that nationally, there has been a call for police to increase training in de-escalation techniques — a trend he said the bill would contradict in the case of private citizens.
Others worried race would become a factor in what people perceived as a threat.
“I'm a 43-year-old educator, and when I put this hood up, I'm feared,” said Shauntyll Allen, representing Black Lives Matter St. Paul.
THE TALKED-ABOUT SIDESHOW
One speaker, identifying himself as Ross Koon of West St. Paul, caused perhaps the greatest disturbance of the hearing when he went on a tirade in ostensible support of the “stand your ground” bill.
After talking about the need of frontiersmen to bear arms against “marauding savages” or defend against “a lawless uprising of our valuable workforce,” he added, “It was not lightly that we took to weapons and rope to ensure the purity of our nation.”
The tirade caused those in the audience to wonder aloud whether Koon was a plant or trying to be ironic, with others saying it was hard to tell these days.
Chairman Tony Cornish, R-Vernon Center, and Rep. John Considine, DFL-Mankato, took the man seriously.
“Mr. Chair … this testimony is offensive,” Considine cut in over the speaker.
“Maybe to you but not to a lot of people in the room. We never shut down any of the opposition, we're certainly not going to shut down … ” Cornish said.
“Marauding savages and talking about lynching black people?” Considine asked.
The speaker then took his tirade up a notch, saying “As we face hordes of illegals and so-called refugees, it is of the utmost importance that we be granted broad liberties to kill with impunity. … It's time to kill the scary people. It's time to make Minnesota lynch again.”
“All right … yeah that was rather offensive, but last time we had these hearings if we shut anybody down on either side we'd get booed and hissed, so I thought I'd just let him rave on,” Cornish said.
The man quickly left the hearing room after his speech.
Almost as quickly, Nash told the committee that he had not invited him.
In this essay, I want to look into how we can broaden and deepen our understanding of meditation, so that it encompasses more of our life and isn't just something we do “on the cushion.” I've found the meditation instruction of J. Krishnamurti especially helpful in gaining this broader view, and so I share some of his insights below.
First, let me say that “formal” sitting or walking mediation is good! Not just “good,” but, I would argue, essential. If a Pablo Casals at 93 years of age could get up every morning to practice, “to get better,” as he said, then it's hard to see how gaining depth and skill in meditation could be much different. It's recorded that even the awakened Buddha spent hours in meditation, for the sheer pleasure of it.
Self-examination at the deepest level of meditative concentration and insight can reveal the transient nature of thoughts, feelings, perceptions, and emotions. It can help us see the basic interdependence of the “dhammas,” (mental/physical elements), that create a aggregate, fabricated “self.” Looking deeply into the mind to see the non-self nature of the dhammas and seeing how they create a “self” are skills essential to liberation. Deep meditative insight helps deconstruct the illusion of the solidity and permanence of thought and ego structures that we identify with and believe to be so essential to being.
But I would argue that it is equally important to gain deep insight into how this constructed, fabricated “self” works at “upper” levels—at the so-called psychological and personal level. Without this “upper level” insight, it's like understanding the code of a computer program with no idea of the code's function or purpose. The code or programming may execute without error, we may understand its internal logic, but the result may be totally wrong and the code's application inappropriate or even harmful to solving the problem at hand. This is where the Buddha's emphasis on looking at actions and their consequences is so very skillful and important. What am I doing as a human being? How do I act and interact with other people? What role do I have in society and how do my actions affect society and the world? Insight into this is no less important than insight into the inner workings of the mind or how psycho-physical energies arise and pass away.
Even more importantly, it is my experience that there are problems at the “upper level” that can't, in principle, be solved at the level of sheer meditative concentration and insight. The two domains are interrelated, of course but what is emergent from the brain and mind is profoundly different in its nature from the how the underlying “machinery” works, so to speak. Put simply: the qualia of human consciousness—love, truth, beauty, art, mathematics, to name a few positive emergent elements—are no more reducible to the Buddhist khandas than they are to the neural nets of the brain. A “nothing but skandhas” reductionist view of what it means to be a human being is as bogus in Buddhism as a “nothing but neural nets” view of human consciousness is bogus (and unscientific) in neuroscience.
The Buddhist path must be integral, not just focusing on the inner workings of the mind, but on all our actions as a human being in relationship with other human beings, a society, and a physical environment. To fully awaken, we need this full view—one that looks at what kind of person we are in the world and how we act. Without an integral Buddhism, we can become a kind of meditative “idiot savant” who is great “on the cushion” but who is a moral idiot in life itself. Put more bluntly: one may be become very good an entering deep states of concentration and bliss, one may be able to gain some insight into the inner workings of the mind and still, on the whole, be someone whose unexamined and hidden shadow elements do great harm to oneself and others.
To some, this assertion may seem surprising. Many seem to think that meditation, by itself, is some kind of magic wand or pill that miraculously frees our minds without any need for real, honest self-examination on our part. But in the Buddhist path, there's so much more to awakening than having the ability to enter deep states of concentration or to be able to passively and non-reactively watch mental stuff arise and fall away. The way of awakening involves a kind of self-immolation fueled by an earnest desire to uncover and let go of whatever causes suffering—our own or others. We have to die to the old to give birth to the new, and at times, the giving up of false self-identifications can indeed feel like a kind of death. But it also brings to light an indestructible happiness that's not dependent on anything.
Of course, we need to learn how to quiet the wild, drunken “monkey mind,” or in the Zen ox-herder metaphor, how to tame the “wandering-ox” mind. Techniques like working with the breath and seeing how to let go of thoughts and to come back to presence, developing concentration, cultivating insight, working with koans, and loving-kindness meditation—all of these are highly important skills that require practice and what the Buddha called vigorous “right effort.” But developing these skills is but the step along the way to having the kind of mind and heart that can get quiet enough to look into the nature of everything that arises, at every level, not just in the mind, but in our actions and in how we live in the world.
I love J. Krishnamurti's description of a broader, deeper, and more inclusive sense of meditation than one often hears about:
“[People] sit in a corner, close their eyes and concentrate, like school boys trying to concentrate on a book. That is not meditation. Meditation is something extraordinary, if you know how to do it. I am going to talk a little about it. First of all, sit very quietly; do not force yourself to sit quietly, but sit or lie down quietly without force of any kind. Do you understand? Then watch your thinking. Watch what you are thinking about. You find you are thinking about your shoes, your saris, what you are going to say, the bird outside to which you listen; follow such thoughts and inquire why each thought arises. Do not try to change your thinking. See why certain thoughts arise in your mind so that you begin to understand the meaning of every thought and feeling without any enforcement. And when a thought arises, do not condemn it, do not say it is right, it is wrong, it is good, it is bad. Just watch it, so that you begin to have a perception, a consciousness which is active in seeing every kind of thought, every kind of feeling. You will know every hidden secret thought, every hidden motive, every feeling, without distortion, without saying it is right, wrong, good or bad. When you look, when you go into thought very very deeply, your mind becomes extraordinarily subtle, alive. No part of the mind is asleep. The mind is completely awake. That is merely the foundation. Then your mind is very quiet. Your whole being becomes very still. Then go through that stillness, deeper, further – that whole process is meditation. Meditation is not to sit in a corner repeating a lot of words; or to think of a picture and go into some wild, ecstatic imaginings. To understand the whole process of your thinking and feeling is to be free from all thought, to be free from all feeling so that your mind, your whole being becomes very quiet. And that is also part of life and with that quietness, you can look at the tree, you can look at people, you can look at the sky and the stars. That is the beauty of life.”
Although insight into the what the Buddha called the “three characteristics” of existence (dukkha, suffering—anicca, impermanence—and anatta, not self) is always liberating, the changes we may most need to make may be at the level of psychological insight into the constructed self—the human personality, our belief systems, and how we act and interact with others. If you think Buddhism is principally about getting rid of, or suppressing, or negating the ego, then this wonderful essay by Thanissaro Bhikkhu titled “The Problem of Egolessnes” offers a more skillful perspective:
See: The Problem of Egolessness
The Buddha's dharma is about life. Indeed, the most fundamental meaning of dharma is just how things work. Meditation must therefore embrace the whole human being, and all life, including our belief systems as well as our relationships with others and the world. We are all living out internal “programs” and mental self-constructions that we give our identities to, or identify with. Mostly, we do this unconsciously. An aspect of awakening is to be able to see these thought/self patterns playing themselves out and not identify with them. This is something we can really zero in on by developing skills in concentration and insight in our “formal” mediation practice.
As we develop the skill in seeing how our minds work, then its just natural that the larger patterns and ways of being “me” need to be looked into and honestly examined. We need the courage to not only develop the deepest levels of meditative insight, where mental skandhas are seen to be ephemeral and flicker in and out of existence. We also need to examine our hearts—examine our total humanhood, our morals, and the standards we live by. The skill comes in doing this self-examination non-violently, without self-condemnation and self-hatred. And happily, that equanimity and dispassion towards what the Buddha called “toxins” are exactly what the “un-selfing” of deep, “formal” meditation prepares us to do. We have seen for ourselves see that the “toxins” are not-self, impermanent, and cause suffering.
In Buddhism, this awakening and developing of moral virtue is called sila and is considered the foundation and sine qua non of meditation:
See: Buddhist Morality—It's All About Karma and Skillful Means
I don't want to overdo the programming metaphor—the brain is not some sort of meat computer!—but the programming metaphor can be a helpful analogy. Like skillful, trouble-shooting software programmers, we not only have to know how the lower-level “code” of the mind works; we have to look at the the operation and nature of the entire program and its “output”— the way we look at ourselves, others, and the world. This “output” is our individual karma, the results of the way we think and act as a person. It's one of the few things actually have some real control over! The Buddha said our actions and their results are the only things we truly own. Sure, we may we sometimes mistake the nature of cause and effect in our individual karma, but in one sense, our self-produced karma never lies to us. By seeing what thoughts and actions produce suffering, testing new ways of thinking and acting, and then looking at those results, we can become as scientific in our progress as an researcher in physics.
So, it's up to us to look deeply into the big picture of our lives, as well as the deep inner workings of the mind, and then make the skillful changes that liberate our hearts and minds and bring lasting happiness. Doing so is an art, as well as a science, poetry as well as technique. It's specific and integral. It's also the very happiest and most skillful way to live.

In 1906, Upton Sinclair's novel "The Jungle" shocked the world.
Sinclair told the story of Jurgis Rudkus and his extended group of family and friends emigrating from the countryside of Lithuania to industrial Chicago. Initially full of hope and energy, despite being cheated and conned on their way to the city, they get jobs in the factories of the Union stockyard and Packingtown and set out to live the American dream.
But that was not to be. Things go rapidly downhill, as they are brutalized by the work and exploited by the corrupt economic system. Socialist activist Sinclair used all the skills he had honed in writing popular pot-boiler novels to make Jurgis and his friends and family represent all the bad things that could happen to anyone in the factories, streets and saloons of Chicago. Illegal and unsanitary conditions in the packing plants are detailed, and disaster after disaster ensues. The immigrants die one after another, from work injuries or worse: one boy passes out in a remote corner of a factory and is eaten by rats. Jurgis' wife, Ona, dies in childbirth, and then his son Antanas drowns in a puddle in the street. The novel, even when it leaves Packingtown behind, is unrelentingly grim. Industrial Chicago was a man-made capitalist version of Dante's Inferno.
Sinclair's purpose was avowedly political: He wasn't trying to write a novel of subtle psychological sophistication. He wanted to expose the physical realities and moral evils behind industrial capitalism to inspire his readers to reform the system through political action.
Some industrial apologists have argued that Sinclair's literary strategy makes the novel bad history as well as bad literature, but investigations at the time bore out the facts represented in the novel.
In any case, Sinclair's literary world is no more. It's become commonly accepted by the literary establishment (and the many readers they educate) that, in Samuel Goldwyn's phrase, "If you have a message, call Western Union." Literary art is to be art first and foremost, otherwise it's dismissed as propaganda. But sometimes propaganda might be necessary, if some aspect of our culture is excluded from the realm of aesthetics. The realities of urban poverty were considered inherently not-literary, and Sinclair was well aware of that. He writes:
There is a poet who sings that
'Deeper their heart grows and nobler their bearing,
Whose youth in the fires of anguish hath died.'
But it was not likely that he had reference to the kind of anguish that comes with destitution, that is so endlessly bitter and cruel, and yet so sordid and petty, so ugly, so humiliating — unredeemed by the slightest touch of dignity or even of pathos. It is a kind of anguish that poets have not commonly dealt with; its very words are not admitted into the vocabulary of poets — the details of it cannot be told in polite society at all. How, for instance, could anyone expect to excite sympathy among lovers of good literature by telling how a family found their home alive with vermin, and of all the suffering and inconvenience and humiliation they were put to, and the hard-earned money they spent, in efforts to get rid of them?"
Beyond their horrific environment, Sinclair focuses on the bodily harm that industrial workers experience:
He is a beef-boner, and that is a dangerous trade, especially when you are on piecework and trying to earn a bride. Your hands are slippery and your knife is slippery and you are toiling like mad, when somebody happens to speak to you, or you strike a bone. Then your hand slides up on the blade, and there is a fearful gash. There are learned people who can tell you out of the statistics that beef-boners make forty cents an hour, but, perhaps, these people have never looked into a beef-boner's hands.
Sinclair makes his readers look at that beef-boner's hands. Contemporary cultural theorists interested in thinking about representations of the body in literature would do well to read "The Jungle."
"The Jungle" also should be read to remind us that Americans keep fighting the same political, economic and cultural battles over and over again, and while our factories might be cleaner and our food more pure, things haven't really changed structurally. "Socialist" is still a dirty word to conservatives, even as Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont seeks the Democratic nomination for president.
On the economic front, workers and their unions are still the site of political conflict. One political party, including the current governor of Illinois, seems hell-bent on smashing the power unions have amassed since Sinclair's day. Workers in traditionally low-paying jobs are beginning to organize and fight for better pay and working conditions. While the employees of restaurants, fast-food chains, and retail stores might seem to have little in common with workers in railroads, packinghouses, or steel mills a century ago, their economic situation is structurally the same. Today's service employees work poorly paid and physically demanding jobs, at the pleasure of bosses who see them as disposable. In 2015, Jurgis Rudkus would be flipping burgers or stocking shelves at a Wal-Mart.
Chicago's corruption is another ongoing theme. Jurgis goes to jail twice for striking men with "pull" (today more commonly known as "clout"). After he descends into common criminality and then becomes a political worker and strike-breaker, he himself gets away with assault after his sponsor puts in a word with the judge. He even works on the illegally built system of tunnels beneath the Loop, now most famous for flooding in 1992, but once symbolic of corruption. The tunnels were built to break the Teamsters' union, and without proper city council approval. One of the work sites for entry to the tunnels was behind a saloon owned by an alderman.
In Chicago, the only industry that outdoes civic corruption is the vice trades. In perhaps the most heart-breaking scene in a novel full of tragedies, Jurgis encounters Marija, one of the few in their immigrant group who had survived. She's been reduced to opium addiction and prostitution, and tells Jurgis that "when people are starving . . . and they have anything with a price, they ought to sell it, I say. I guess you realize it now when it's too late. Ona could have taken care of us all, at the beginning." Just as the industrialists of Packingtown transform animals into products to be bought and sold, Chicago's vice industry reduces women to commodities.
Something here doesn't add up.
How can the Alberta government publicly decertify a school association one day over allegations of “financial impropriety,” then recertify the association another day while the allegations still hang over the school board's head?
Either the government recertified the association prematurely this week, or the government unfairly decertified the association in the first place back in October.
We're talking here, of course, about the Trinity Christian School Association.
It was on Tuesday, Oct. 25, that a sombre Education Minister David Eggen called a news conference to announce he was immediately shutting down the province's largest provider of homeschooling after a government audit had discovered “significant misuse of public funding.”
The government had been giving Trinity Christian about $5.5 million a year, which was directed to a third party, Wisdom Homeschooling Society, to run the home-schooling operations.
Among the apparently troubling things discovered by the audit: Wisdom leased a modular from a “non-arm's length party” for $105,000 a year — 10 times what the government thought reasonable.
Eggen said the “financial impropriety” was so great he was sending the audit to the RCMP for further investigation.
At the time, I said Eggen was so unhappy he looked downright sick. But I wasn't sure if he was ill at the possibility of government money going astray, or if he was queasy at the thought of a showdown with home-schooling parents.
Politically, the latter is a much larger problem than the former — as Eggen discovered thanks to a very loud and heated reaction from parents who supported Trinity.
The association defiantly told the parents to ignore the government's recommendation to enrol their children with another board. Keeping the fight alive, the association won a court injunction to keep the board open.
All the while, home-schooling parents — always a fiercely independent lot — accused the government of interfering with their rights to educate their children.
Thanks to a court ruling Thursday — that criticized both sides in the tussle — the government and the association have reached a truce.
Eggen recertified the organization after it agreed to be placed under a government-appointed financial adviser for the next year.
Yet, the RCMP is still investigating the government's complaint against Trinity.
How can the government climb back into bed with an organization it apparently didn't trust a few months ago?
You get the impression that maybe the government overreacted in October by decertifying the school association. Maybe the government should have waited.
Or, at the very least, it should have done the decertification with more tact and more planning. Instead, its abrupt move left thousands of parents and students confused.
The government should have listened more intently to the Wildrose Party, which managed to manoeuvre though this political minefield with some agility.
The official Opposition has said all along that while any financial mismanagement must be investigated and dealt with, the main focus should have been on the students, ensuring their education was not interrupted.
In a news release Thursday, the Wildrose happily gave itself a pat on the back: “The decision to appoint a financial administrator to handle their concerns surrounding financial management of the school was what Wildrose initially called for. It's disappointing that it took months of legal battles and court filings to come to what was an obvious and appropriate solution.”
This saga is not over. If the police find evidence of wrongdoing, people will ask why the government is in bed with such a troubled organization.
If the police don't find enough evidence to lay charges, people will ask why the government was so quick to shut down Trinity.
Either way, something doesn't add up — and the education minister is the one doing the math.

A US House committee heard grim testimony today on West Africa's Ebola epidemic, with an official of a leading aid group asserting that inaction by the rest of the world has let the disease get out of control.
"It's clear to say that this disease is uncontained and out of control in West Africa," said Ken Isaacs, vice president of program and government relations for the relief group Samaritan's Purse (SP). "The international response has been a failure, and it's important to understand that."
He said SP's experts believe the official epidemic case numbers from the World Health Organization (WHO) represent only 25% to 50% of the true numbers. Yesterday the WHO put the Ebola total for Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria at 1,711 cases and 932 deaths.
"The governments simply do not have the capacity to handle the crisis in their countries," Isaacs added. "If a mechanism isn't found to create a paradigm for the international community to get involved, the world will effectively relegate the containment of this disease to three of the poorest nations in world."
Isaacs spoke at a hearing convened by the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations. The session was streamed over the Web.
The subcommittee also heard from several other witnesses, including Tom Frieden, MD, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), who called the epidemic unprecedented in multiple ways but asserted that it can be stopped by using tried-and-true public health interventions.
A daunting challenge
But Isaacs made the challenge sound daunting. His organization employs Keith Brantly, MD, one of two American health workers who contracted Ebola while working in Liberia and were recently flown back to the United States for treatment. He and Nancy Writebol of SIM (Service in Mission), the other patient, have been treated with an experimental drug and are said to be improving.
"There are bodies lying in the street in Liberia," a nation that's still trying to recover from a long civil war that left lingering tensions, Isaacs said. "There are gangs threatening to burn down hospitals."
"It's clear to me that Liberia is in a severe crisis that I believe threatens the stability of the society as it exists today," he told the panel.
SP's office in Liberia remains open, but "we've in fact suspended all other program activity," he said. "We're in the process now of backing up and reloading. We intend to come back."
The committee also heard sobering observations from Frank Glover, MD, a urologist and medical missionary with SIM, who described the weakness of Liberia's medical system.
Glover said 95% of expatriate doctors in Liberia have left, leaving only 50 doctors in the country. After the second of two doctors died of the disease, all the government hospitals shut down.
The country has only two Ebola treatment centers, one in Monrovia and one in Lofa, Glover reported. Many patients are dying of Ebola in community settings because of the lack of treatment facilities.
Unprecedented in five ways
The epidemic has previously been described as unprecedented, but Frieden expanded on the theme, saying that's true on five counts.
"First it's the largest outbreak ever. In a few weeks there'll be more cases than in all previous outbreaks put together," he said. "Second, it's multi country. One of the epicenters is on the confluence of three different countries" (Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone).
"Third, this is the first outbreak in west Africa. And because of this it's been a particular challenge. Fourth, many of the cases have been in urban areas, and there's been spread in urban areas, and this is something we've not seen before."
Fifth, Frieden said, "it's the first time we've had to deal with it in the US." Besides the presence of the two sick American medical workers, the nation has to worry about testing travelers who are sick after returning to the states from the affected countries, he explained.
He noted that the CDC has an Ebola test that's relatively fast, and the agency is working to make it available to the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) within a few weeks. The network consists of state public health labs and other labs that can test for a wide range of diseases.
Frieden laid out what he called three basic facts about Ebola: "First, we can stop Ebola, we know how to do it. It will be a long and hard fight, the situation in Lagos [Nigeria] is particularly concerning. Second, we have to stop it at the source in Africa, that's the only way to get control. Third, we have to stop it at the source through tried and true means, the core publih health interventions that work."
He re-emphasized the CDC message that only people who have symptoms can spread Ebola to others and that transmission occurs only through close contact with body fluids.
To arrest an outbreak requires "meticulous isolation" of those infected, followed by equally carefully tracing and management of their contacts, Frieden said. If a contact gets a fever, the process must be started all over. "It's laborious, it's hard, it requires local knowledge, but it's how Ebola is stopped."
Isaacs, however, told the committee that that type of follow-up isn't happening in Liberia. "I don't think the ministry of health can fight this. There are no contacts being run down in Liberia," he said.
Frieden, who voiced confidence that the United States will not face a big Ebola outbreak, was asked if the virus can spread through sneezing or coughing.
"In medicine we often say, 'Never say never,'" he replied. He noted that a Liberian official who died in Nigeria was sick on an airliner. So far no illnesses have been identified in his fellow passengers, but "we do have concerns that there could be transmission from someone who is very ill."
"If someone is ill on an airplane, having a fever or bleeding, that might present a risk to someone who came in contact and didn't take appropriate precautions," he said.

Information on Aug 7 House hearing
Sierra Leone's president has appealed for urgent help to support the thousands of people affected by a devastating mudslide on the outskirts of the country's capital.
A national emergency has been declared after the city suffered heavy flooding, thought to be the worst in Africa over the past two decades. Freetown's mayor, Sam Gibson, said 270 corpses had been recovered and were “being prepared for burial”, while the chief coroner told Reuters that nearly 400 bodies had been found. Estimates of the numbers missing vary: the Red Cross reported that 600 people have not been traced, while the country's interior minister has said thousands are unaccounted for.
At least a hundred houses were hit when a hillside in Regent, a mountainous town 15 miles east of Freetown, collapsed in the early hours of Monday morning.
Search and rescue efforts have continued throughout Tuesday, hampered by the country's dangerous terrain and the sheer scale of the tragedy. The mudslide, which trapped residents while they were sleeping, is thought to have travelled for two miles.
Addressing the media, president Ernest Bai Koroma said the devastation “was overwhelming us”. “Entire communities have been wiped out,” Koroma said. “We need urgent support now.”
Linnea Van Wagenen, working for the UN in Sierra Leone, said: “We have the mountains and very steep hillsides. [It's very hard to] access these areas, where it's muddy, it's slippery – there's a risk of a second landslide. We're not sure how this massive landslide has affected the ground around it.” She added that the chances of finding survivors on Tuesday was low.
The UN is using satellite data, radar imagery and drone mapping to assess which areas may be at risk of a second mudslide or further flooding. The country is not yet halfway through the rainy season, Van Wagenen said.
“Last year the heavy rains came in September, so we want to make sure we do analysis of communities that are at risk now and [see how we can] prevent the risk of something like this continuing to happen.”
Sierra Leone is prone to flooding, but it was not prepared for a disaster of this magnitude, said Daniel Byrne, monitoring and evaluation officer for Oxfam in Sierra Leone. “This particular emergency is unique because the total number of survivors is not that high compared with the people who have died. No one was expecting a situation like this. People are using their bare hands to remove bodies.”
Issatu Koroma, from Regent, is among the hundreds of people to have lost relatives and their homes in the mudslide. Both her son and nephew are missing, she said on Monday. “Everything is gone. We've lost everything – our house, everything. The mud came down with the water so fast and my son did not escape. We found him lying in the mud. He was just a boy. They took his body with the others to I don't know where. God help Sierra Leone. Why are we cursed? What are we supposed to do now, with nothing?”
Abibatu Kamara, a mother of three who spent the night on her neighbours' veranda, said so far any government response had been absent. “We have not received any food or blankets since the disaster occurred yesterday,” she told Agence France-Presse.
Kayode Akintola, Cafod's country representative for Sierra Leone, said bodies are lining some of the capital's streets: “Things are really bad on the ground. Just a few minutes' walk from our office a bridge has been submerged. There are dead bodies in the water and littering some of the streets, and houses are still underwater.
“We are working with our local partners to assess what support we can provide. The immediate need of people affected are water and food, meanwhile thousands of families who have lost their homes need shelter, and there are also serious health concerns.
Gaston Slanwa, Tearfund's Country Representative for Sierra Leone, added that 60 people have died in one church community alone. “I drove around Freetown yesterday and saw several houses had disappeared, roads completely gone. On one bridge I saw two people who were already dead being pulled out of the water. In just one of the church communities we work with, 60 people have died and 300 have lost their homes. One of the churches was hit by the mudslide.”
Many of the 3,000 people left homeless spent last night in neighbouring homes that had survived the tragedy. Others were taken to a nearby police station for shelter.
Ishmael Tarawali, head of the Office of National Security, said that burials of identified bodies will begin immediately. “The hospital mortuary is overwhelmed right now and it is really our only option,” he said. Body bags are being donated by charities and NGOs.
“We're hoping to organise as well as we can to get every last person identified, but it's a complicated process,” he said. In some cases entire families have been killed, and the condition of the bodies is also making it difficult to identify victims.
The Red Cross and the government have been moving bodies to a holding centre at Connaught hospital in Freetown.
Alex Carle, director of international programmes at the British Red Cross, said the death toll is likely to rise, adding: “The spread of diseases such as cholera, typhoid and diarrhoea following flooding is also a huge concern.” The city's drainage system has been overloaded by the torrential rains, leaving stagnant water in some areas.
Sorie Bangura, whose family is safe, was among the residents helping the rescue operation on Monday. “We've been trying to dig people out all day but it's no use – just not enough volunteers. Some houses are so buried it would take machinery to dig them up,” he said on Monday.
“There are dead everywhere and people don't know where to go. There are only so many houses still standing, and we can't take in everybody. What we need is help from the international community. People need shelter, clothes, anything. This is the rainy season and it might only get worse. There must be a way to stop this from happening but nobody seems to know how. I'm scared for my life because it could be my family next.”
Richard Miller, ActionAid's humanitarian director, said he feared the situation could get worse.
“There are signs of continuing rainfall and hanging debris from the mudslide,” he said. “ActionAid is planning an immediate humanitarian response in the worst-hit areas. Thousands of people's homes have been swept away and their businesses and crops destroyed.
“Our local aid workers in Sierra Leone are telling us that they are especially concerned for the welfare and safety of girls and women, who are the most vulnerable at this time. Many children have been made homeless and are in immediate need of shelter and protection,” he said.
According to Agence France-Presse, Sierra Leone's meteorological department issued no warning ahead of the torrential rains, which might have allowed for swifter evacuations from the disaster zones.
Priti Patel, the international development secretary, said in a statement that the UK is ready to provide support. “We have pre-positioned vital aid supplies and helped prepare the country's response to disasters. We are already working with the government of Sierra Leone to coordinate the rescue ‎efforts and are ready to provide further assistance to those in need.”
Kristin School pupils, from left, Lillian Zhang, Emma Lee, Jacqueline Tsui and Lorreta Wang, ate vegan for two weeks to raise awareness about factory farming.
It seemed like a daunting task. Two weeks without things like meat, eggs, honey, or milk.
That's what friends Lillian Zhang, Emma Lee, Lorreta Wang and Jacqueline Tsui thought when they decided to try eating vegan as part of a school project about factory farming.
EMILY FORD/FAIRFAX NZ Best friends Rosa MacDonald, left, and Isla Lewis donated sports equipment and clothes to refugee children in New Zealand.
In fact, it turned out to be easier than expected for the year 6 Kristin School pupils, based on Auckland's North Shore.
"I found giving up meat easy because my favourite foods are not meat," Emma says.

"After doing this inquiry, I learnt that animals can't be treated like that," Lorreta says. "You can eat potatoes or something, there are lots of other things you can eat."
Lillian, Emma, Lorreta and Jacqueline also visited a farm in Kumeu to see animal living conditions and researched SAFE for information about animal products.
"Factory farming harms animals and the planet. Because they have so many animals and they have to put the waste somewhere," Jacqueline says.
The project is part of the International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme at Kristin School.
Year 6 pupils spent a term researching causes they're passionate about, including things like bees and homelessness, which culminated in a week-long exhibition for family and friends.
Best friends Rosa MacDonald and Isla Lewis focused on refugees and the effects of seeking refuge in New Zealand for their project.
"Since there was lots on the news last year, we heard about it and we thought it would be a good idea to research more about it," Isla says.
Rosa and Isla visited the Mangere Refugee Resettlement Centre and met children their age who now live in New Zealand with their families.
The pair then organised donations of sports equipment and clothes to donate to the refugee children. They say it was amazing and touching meeting with the children.
"It was quite amazing how friendly they were when you consider all that they've been through. They learnt English really quickly," Isla says.
"The whole thing really stuck with us. We learnt that refugees aren't always happy when they come to New Zealand."
The girls plan to pack Christmas shoebox donations to continue helping those less fortunate than them.
YouTube TV, which bills itself as an alternative to cable television, is expanding into Baltimore and 13 other markets.
With the new markets — including Boston, Cincinnati, Las Vegas, Louisville, Ky., Memphis, Tenn., Nashville, Tenn., and Pittsburgh — YouTube TV said Thursday it is now available in 50 percent of U.S. households.
It said it plans to expand into 17 additional markets in the coming weeks, including Indianapolis, Kansas City, Mo., Milwaukee, San Diego and St. Louis.
YouTube TV, a Google-owned pay service, is different from YouTube, its online partner offering originally created videos.
It offers nearly 50 networks, promoting itself as suitable for a generation “that loves live TV but wants it delivered in a way that suits their mobile and flexible lifestyles.”
Its offerings include live local feeds from ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC, cable networks including ESPN, AMC and FX, and local sports networks including NBC Sports and Fox Sports in many markets.
Also Thursday, Baltimore-based Sinclair Broadcast Group said it has reached an agreement with YouTubeTV for the service to include not only Sinclair's major-network affiliates, but also the Tennis Channel.
The companies “also expect YouTube TV to expand its offering to include Sinclair's CW and MyNetwork TV stations, as well as the 24-hour science fiction channel, Comet TV,” Sinclair said in a news release.

Trump is odious, but impeachment is dangerous—both for the Democrats and the progressive movement.
Impeachment would help restore the damaged Republican brand.
Donald Trump's abrupt firing of an FBI director who was leading the investigation of the Trump campaign's possible collusion with Russia has sparked a new flurry of calls for impeachment.
The impulse is understandable. Comey's firing is just the latest in a litany of outrageous behavior that's shredding the credibility of the presidency: from the financial conflicts of interest to the pathological lying to the authoritarian attacks on the judicial branch and the press.
But outrage aside, we must keep one thing in mind: how progressives and Democrats approach impeachment could shape our democracy and the domestic political landscape for a generation. We must focus on what is best for the American people, not on what is worst for our so-called president. I believe it would be a major strategic blunder for the Democratic Party to fall for what I call the Impeachment Trap—the powerful temptation to lead the charge for impeachment without considering the strategic implications.
Since neither impeachment in the House of Representatives nor conviction in the Senate are possible without Republican votes, it is a waste of time and energy for Democrats to promote impeachment in the absence of any Republican support. I am most concerned about the scenario where one or more leading Republicans come on board and entice Democrats to lead a successful impeachment.
The simple majority necessary to impeach in the House of Representatives, as well as the two-thirds majority that is required to convict in the Senate, can be achieved with the support of most or all Democrats and a minority of Republicans. Unfortunately, this scenario would offer enormous political benefits to the Republicans.
If Trump were impeached and convicted, Vice President Mike Pence, a right-wing, evangelical ideologue, would be a much more reliable and competent rubber stamp for the conservative policy agenda. Trump, for all his failings, cannot be counted on to support conservative Republican orthodoxy. While his cabinet picks and early policy proposals have largely catered to right-wing ideology, his policy flip-flops and incompetence make him a very unreliable partner for congressional Republicans. In particular, his positions on Russia, trade, entitlements, and deficits are antithetical to Republican dogma, and recently Trump even applauded Australia's single payer health care system. And thus far, most of his attacks on immigrants and Muslim refugees have been turned aside by a wall of public outrage and judicial rulings, although we will need to remain extraordinarily vigilant about an emboldened ICE. Pence, on the other hand, who was given a 99 percent rating from the American Conservative Union, would be much more likely to cut Social Security, push National Right to Work, and try to restrict gay marriage, and would probably treat immigrants and refugees just as badly, in order to court the Trump base.
Impeachment would also help restore the damaged Republican brand. Trump lost the popular vote by the largest margin of any incoming president in history. His administration is mired in incompetence, chaos, and suspicion, and has already sparked a massive public resistance. His public approval rating hovers around 40 percent, by far a record low for a new president. If these trends continue, his presidency will be a massive albatross around the GOP's neck in future elections.
By contrast, the robot-like Pence—despite his extreme right-wing views—would be packaged as a comforting return to normalcy. The relief at no longer having an egotistical lunatic at the helm could provide Pence with a long and generous public opinion honeymoon. Republicans could claim that Trump was “never one of theirs,” and approach the 2020 campaign with the benefit of incumbency and without Trump's liabilities.
Democratic ownership of impeachment would also cement the loyalty of working-class Trump voters to the Republican Party. Republican incumbents in swing districts could spin impeachment as a partisan witch hunt. Trump would become a martyr, and his voters would blame Democrats. This is a terrible outcome for progressives who want to move the Democratic Party back to its economic justice roots.
Most important to progressives, Democratic ownership of impeachment would sacrifice the historic opportunity to integrate the massive anti-Trump resistance into a revitalized progressive movement and Democratic Party. A short-term focus on impeachment would divert the focus of many activists away from less glamorous, but more important, grassroots organizing, coalition building, and policy advocacy, and decrease the likelihood of mass grassroots mobilizations on critical issues such as health care, immigration, Planned Parenthood, electoral reform, climate change, and so many others.
For these reasons, I believe a successful impeachment led by Democrats would be a colossal mistake.
Of course, Republicans may well decide that impeachment is in their best interests and lead the charge. This is a slightly better scenario for Democrats.
While Republican ownership of impeachment still achieves the first three political benefits discussed above—a more reliable and competent right-wing presidential rubber stamp, protection of the Republican brand, and a stronger incumbent for 2020—the last two outcomes would now favor Democrats. With Republicans owning impeachment, Trump supporters would be livid with the Republican Party, some withdrawing from politics altogether or splintering off to support minor parties, others perhaps willing to reconsider a Democratic Party refocused on economic justice. The combination of Republicans losing core Trump supporters and ongoing demographic trends would put Democrats in a very favorable position for 2018 and 2020 and beyond. Most importantly, the energy and enthusiasm of the anti-Trump resistance would not be diverted to impeachment.
Moreover, this scenario gives Democrats leverage, as Republicans would need Democratic votes to get the two-thirds Senate majority necessary for conviction. Ultimately, Democrats will have to back impeachment, as it would be political suicide not to. But Democrats can publicly demand key concessions in exchange for their support: First, that Republican leaders clearly own impeachment by drafting the charges and whipping a significant number of GOP votes, and second, that Republicans refrain from pushing radical right-wing legislation until after the 2020 election.
Can Democrats publicly defend a strategy of supporting impeachment only if the Republicans own and lead it, as well as demanding concessions from Republicans? Absolutely. Simply put, Republicans “birthed,” enabled and elected Trump. Republicans have staffed his Cabinet, sacrificed their principles to cut deals with him, and made countless excuses for his outlandish behavior. The public will understand that, if impeachment is warranted, the Republicans have the responsibility to lead the charge.
Paradoxical as it may seem, however, the best scenario for Democrats is one in which they resist the impeachment trap, the Republicans stand by their president, and Trump, odious as he may be, remains in office. Admittedly, this would extract a major toll on the national psyche and require an active resistance to thwart Trump's attacks on marginalized groups, but the country would (probably!) survive. From a policy perspective, a paralyzed Trump administration would be far better than a more competent and reliably right-wing Pence presidency. Politically, Trump would become a black eye for the GOP, and the Democratic opposition would remain energized, all of which would favor the Democrats in both 2018 and 2020. An especially delicious scenario is one in which an unpopular Trump insists upon running in 2020, and the Republican Party is torn apart by a war between Trump supporters and the Wall Street, evangelical and libertarian factions that each want to reclaim “their” party.
If the Trump presidency continues to unravel and a constitutional case for impeachment can be made, Democrats can force Republicans into a perilous Catch-22 over whether to own it. If Republicans refuse, they will likely fail to achieve much of their policy agenda, risk permanent damage to their party brand, and weaken their future electoral chances. If they do own impeachment, they blow up the tenuous Republican-Trump coalition. Either way, Democrats can focus their energies on mass resistance and rebuilding an electoral majority.
Republicans are in a political straitjacket—unless Democrats commit political suicide by falling for the impeachment trap.
Let me emphasize that I am not arguing against pursuing the truth about possible Russian collusion through a special prosecutor, nor against holding Trump responsible for financial conflicts of interest. And I agree that Democrats must ultimately vote for a Republican-led impeachment.
But I am arguing that it would be a major strategic mistake for us to focus on impeachment as a top strategic goal, thereby siphoning energy from the progressive movement. As deplorable as Trump is, we must focus our efforts in the next four years on blocking bad public policy and mobilizing for the future, and those goals are better served with Trump than with Pence. If the Republicans figure this out, let them be the ones to expend their energy getting rid of Trump.
It won't be easy to resist the temptation to humiliate the worst president in modern history, but Democrats must muster the discipline to resist the Impeachment Trap, insist that Republicans be the ones to take responsibility for their shameful president, and mobilize to build real grassroots democratic power for 2018, 2020 and beyond.
Movie Review
Cave of Forgotten Dreams
Directed by Werner Herzog

In December 1994, explorers walking through southern France's rocky environment found a slight disturbance in the air, coming from the rocks. They began to dig at the rocks, and uncovered what came to be known as the Chauvet Cave, a cavern sealed off by a rockslide some 20,000 years earlier.
What the explorers found was a treasure trove of cave paintings and skeletal remains of extinct animals. The art is twice as old as anything else found to date, the earliest example of culture produced by modern humans. Consequently, the French government sensibly sealed the Chauvet Cave. A door to the cave was constructed, making it impossible for anyone to enter without permission. Access is restricted only to scientists studying the discoveries.
But besides enriching our knowledge anthropologically, such a find cannot help but produce feelings beyond the simple excitement of a new discovery: awe, mystery – even a sense of sorrow.
Enter Werner Herzog. He is the only filmmaker ever granted access by the French to the cave, and judging by his documentary of it, Cave of Forgotten Dreams, the Ministry of Culture made the right choice. Any film crew working for National Geographic could have gone in and simply shown people what had been found and explained the scientific significance of it. But Herzog does this as deftly as anyone else could, while adding something deeper.
Herzog is known for both wildly eccentric dramas like Even Dwarfs Started Small and for highly stylized documentaries. He is also an eccentric personality. In a possibly apocryphal story, after one of the dwarf actors in Even Dwarfs complained about dangerous working conditions, Herzog made a promise to the actor, on which he made good: if the actor survived the making of the film, Herzog would throw himself into a cactus.
In Cave of Forgotten Dreams, Herzog adds a sometimes absurd, but always human, touch.
In an interview with The A.V. Club, Herzog said, “It's not so much facts that interest me, but a deeper truth in them – an ecstasy of truth, an ecstatic truth that illuminates us. That's what I've been after. … The danger is to stupidly believe that depicting facts gives us much insight. If facts were the only thing that counted, the telephone directory would be the book of books.”
Indeed, Herzog revisits the theme of the phone book in Cave, telling a scientist he interviews that many of the facts he presents are like the Manhattan directory, with its list of “4 million names.” These people are just a list, according to Herzog, about which the phone book says nothing. “What are their hopes, their dreams?” he asks.
Herzog has largely been successful in bringing out these deeper, more human truths in earlier documentaries. In his Encounters at the End of the World, he studies Antarctica. But instead of a simple catalogue of animals and glaciers, he presents a desolate world inhabited by animals and people, all of whom, perhaps a product of their world's desolation, seem a bit insane. (Is there a definition of insanity among penguins? he asks a scientist. “…I don't mean that a penguin might believe he or she is Lenin or Napoleon Bonaparte, but could they just go crazy, because they've had enough of their colony?”)
And while Herzog is seemingly omnipresent in his documentaries, he also knows when to keep quiet. In his 1992 documentary Lessons of Darkness, he allows the cruel character of Saddamist Iraq to show itself, most poignantly in drawn out scenes of Kuwaiti oil wells burning with an evil beauty. In How Much Wood Would a Woodchuck Chuck, a short film on the bizarre language of cattle auctioneers, he allows the subjects to speak in their auctioneering voice at great length.
The same style holds sway in Cave, producing both an awe at the simple fact that our ancestors were there creating art – and here we are, 30,000 years later, looking at it – as well as a sense of sorrow. We will never know these people, the vast majority of people who ever existed. “We are stuck in history,” Herzog says. “But they were not.”
How stuck are we? In one scene, the audience is shown the fossilized tracks of a child and a wolf, next to each other. Herzog ponders: Did they walk together as friends or did the child run from the wolf? Or were the tracks made 5,000 years apart?
And who were these people? The point of the Manhattan phone book analogy: we'll never know; we can't. There is a section in the cave in which red handprints decorate a wall, somewhat like an abstract painting. The painter has a curved pinky; this is the closest we'll ever come to understanding his individuality. To Herzog's delight, though, it is possible to see, based on the knowledge of his curved finger, that the same painter did drawings throughout the cave. It is, remarks Herzog, like we're following him as he works.
Herzog doesn't skimp on the historical details. The viewer emerges from the theater with a much wider knowledge of this cave, the science used to study the age of the artifacts and so on. But, in the hands of someone else, there would be no emotional connection.

The media and Democratic leaders have mocked President Trump as a "rookie" prone to stupid mistakes, pointless fights, and support-sapping insults, but new polling shows that his voters like that he's stirring up Washington.
And even better for Trump: The increased support from his base in response to the left's attacks are helping to keep his overall approval rating fairly stable, near 50 percent.
That will be tested Friday if the House moves on Trump's demand that the vote on repealing Obamacare even if the votes aren't there to OK the GOP plan. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and some in the media have called Trump's dare a "rookie" mistake, but the new polling suggests that even in defeat the so-called "Trump Train" will stick with him.
The polling by Morning Consult tested the response of "Teflon Don" voters to several "scandals," like the fight over Inauguration crowd sizes to his tweet that the media is the enemy of American people.
In all, his support among his base increased.
"On the whole, these scandals don't seem to be pulling down Trump's overall approval numbers. He has hovered around 50 percent after dropping a few points after the first executive order on immigration. It's also important to note that for about a 20 percent of voters, these scandals didn't change their opinion either way," said the analysis.
Morning Consult, which worked with Politico on the survey, concluded: "So what does this mean? It's possible that the scandals tamp down on support in the moment, but the outrage of the day isn't yet driving public opinion of the president. And if anything, it's making Trump's base like him even more."

If you are using the privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo, you have probably installed the official application of the search engine on your phone or tablet as well to make use of the very same features that make it a great alternative to the big dogs Google and Bing.
DuckDuckGo promises that it wont track users, won't personalize search results, and enables users to search the web anonymously.
The Android application, DuckDuckGo Search & Stories, offers the same feature set as the web-based version. You can use it to search on DuckDuckGo, and use all the features that makes the search engine special. This includes the !bang syntax, all privacy protections, and also zero-click information about select search phrases that are displayed right on top of the regular results.
DuckDuckGo and Tor
One of the recent changes in DuckDuckGo's application for Android is the integration of Tor in it. It depends on another application though, but will point you in the right direction once you enable Tor in the DuckDuckGo preferences.
To use the Tor network in DuckDuckGo, do the following:
Install the DuckDuckGo Search & Stories application on your Android device. It is compatible with all Android versions from 2.2 onwards.
Tap on the menu button and select settings from the menu that opens up.
Scroll down on the settings page until you find TOR listed there.
Tap on Enable Tor to activate the integration.
A prompt is displayed that informs you that you need to install the free Android application Orbot for that.
If you select yes you are taken to Google Play where you can install the app.
When you open the DuckDuckGo application from now on, it will check if Orbot is running, and if it is not, ask you if you want to start it.
Note: If you enable Tor, you need Orbot to run. If it is not running, you won't get any connection to DuckDuckGo using the application.
You are probably wondering how you can tell that you are connected to the TOR network and that the DuckDuckGo application is making use of it as well.
Besides the connection error that you get when it is not running, you can install the free Orweb: Private Web Browser application to test that on your phone or tablet.
Just run the app after installation and you should get a confirmation that you are connected to the TOR network.
Verdict
Support for the Tor network is certainly something that many DuckDuckGo users will appreciate. The integration itself works really well once you are past the setup. It may take one additional click to start a search, as you may need to start Orbot if it is not running.
You can configure Orbot to automatically start with the Android phone so that it is available right after that.

Microsoft researchers are working on a new project aimed at trying to secure low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
The Project Sopris team is "exploring the goal of security the vast number of low-cost internet connected devices coming online," says the research page for the Sopris project, which was officially established March 31, 2017.
"As part of this research work, we have tested different approaches to device security from silicon to software and hypothesize that optimal device security must be rooted in hardware but kept up-to-date through evolving software," explain the researchers.
Among those working on Sopris are partner research manager Galen Hunt; principal researcher Ed Nightingale; and senior hardware architect George Letey. As unearthed by "The Walking Cat" (@h0x0d on Twitter), senior director of silicon and system architecture Rob Shearer also seems to be on the team.
Hunt has been a key member of a number of previous significant Microsoft OS research projects, including Singularity, Drawbridge, and Menlo.
The Sopris team has published its first technical report, titled "The Seven Properties of Highly Secure Devices."
That paper notes that the Sopris researchers are paying special attention to the "tens of billions of devices powered by microcontrollers," as they are not prepared for the security challenges posed by internet connectivity.
The Sopris team is working silicon partner MediaTek to revise one of their controllers -- the the Wi-Fi-enabled MT7687 -- to create a prototype of a highly secure microcontroller.
Microsoft is looking to have security researchers test the Sopris security kit via the Project Sopris Challenge. The application period for the challenge closes April 14. Microsoft is offering bounties from $2,500 to $15,000 for submissions of eligible security vulnerabilities found in its early research prototype.
Early findings indicate that "even the most price-sensitive devices should be redesigned to achieve the high levels of device security critical to society's safety," the researchers say.

Future Football Transfer Fees
How Much Will Football Transfer Fees Cost in 10 Years' Time?
Ten years ago splashing out £10 million on a new player would mean most clubs breaking their transfer record. Fast forward to today and this price is the average premier league transfer fee and upwards of £45M seems to be normal for a top marquee player.
With data from Deloitte and Transfermarkt, we've been able to research just how inflated football transfer fees have become, and we've used this data to predict the transfer fees of the future. To predict the transfers of the future, we've had to look into the transfers of the past: Average 'Marquee Transfer' Fee By Season - Last Decade
The price of a top premier league player has increased by an average of 11.5% each season.
To work this out, we've used the following calculation:
Average Marquee Transfer Fee = Top 5 Transfer Fees Each Season ÷ 5
By using this % increase in transfer fee cost of the most expensive premier league signings, we've been able to predict what a marquee signing will cost in the future.
'Marquee Transfer' Fees Of The Future - Next 10 Years
We predict that in 10 years' time, the average transfer fee of a marquee player will be nearly £150m.
There will still be outlying transfer fees like Paul Pogba of last season, but we think that in the 2026/27 premier league season, the top 5 signings will come to an average of £148.5m. You would expect that in 10 years' time, the most expensive transfers of that season, like Romelu Lukaku this season, will probably be in the hundreds of million pounds.
What Would Recent Football Signings Cost in 2027?
Using our model, we've looked at the top premier league transfers of this and last season, and predicted how much they would cost in 10 years' time.
This uses the average price percentage increase of marquee football transfers over the last decade, and applies it to each transfer.
Transfer Fees Of This Season vs 2027/28 Price
Romelu Lukaku – £303m in 2027 (£75m in 2017)
The 24 year old Belgian powerhouse was transferred to Manchester United this season for £75m + addons. We predict that in 10 years' time his transfer fee would be over £300m, this fee alone would be nearly more than the entire premier league's transfer spend 10 years ago.
Alexandre Lacazette – £182m in 2027 ((£45m in 2017)
The fast French forward was transferred to Arsenal this season for £45.05m. With our research, we think that he'd be going for over £180m in the 2027/28 season.
Bernardo Silva – Manchester City moved quickly to sign Silva from Monaco back in May for £43m. We think if he moved in 2027 his fee would be around £170m.
Mohamed Salah – The Egyptian international was confirmed as a Liverpool player in June, breaking their club transfer record for a fee of £36m. We reckon he'd be going for over £140m in 10 years' time.
Transfer Fees of Last Season vs 2027/28 Price
Paul Pogba – £415m in 2027/28 (£89m in 16/17)
The French midfielder was the biggest transfer of the 2016/17 season costing Manchester United nearly £90m. We think that in 2027 he'd be going for over £400m. With transfer fees continuing to rise, will there ever be a billion pound player?
John Stones – £220m in 2027/28 (£47m in 16/17)
Stones' performances were questionable last season, but Manchester City splashed out nearly £50m to sign him back in August 2016. With our model, he'd be costing well over £200m in 10 years' time.
Leroy Sané – The German winger was another big money signing for Manchester City last summer, setting them back over £40m. If transferred in the 2027/28 season, we think he'd be going for nearly £200m.
Henrikh Mkhitaryan – The silky midfielder took a while to make it into the Manchester United eleven, but impressed when finally starting. We think his sale price in 2027/28 would be around £165m.
To work these figures out we've used the following formula:
Transfer Cost 2027/28 = Fee Year Transferred x 11.25% to the power of 10 or 11 years
(Depending on whether they were transferred last year or this year)
How Much Will An Average Premier League Signing Cost In The Future?
To look into this, we've used data from Transfermarkt to look at data from the last 10 years:
Average Premier League Transfer Fees 2007-2017
Over the last 10 seasons, transfer fees have risen by an average of 28% each year.
To find this, we used the following formula:
Average Fee = Total Premier League Transfer Spend ÷ Total Number of Transfers
Unsurprisingly, the highest average fee by premier league season was last year, where the average signing would set you back an estimated £9.29 million.
The average fee has steadily grown over the last 10 years, with the exception of the 2011/12 and 2013/14 seasons.
Premier league spend has grown in line with this, over quadrupling in the last 10 years:
Total Premier League Transfer Spend By Season
Using this data, as well as an average of the amount of players transferred each season, we've been able to predict what the standard premier league player will cost you in 10 years' time:
Average Premier League Transfer Fees Of The Future
We predict that in 10 seasons time the average premier league transfer fee will be over £50million.
To work this out we've used the following calculation:
Average Future Fee = (Current Premier League Spend x 121% to the power of 10) ÷ Average Number of Transfers
Being a specialist sales recruitment agency, we have a keen interest in recruitment fees, although we can't see them growing in line with football costs!

We all knew this would happen once they got on the field together, but it's still important to note that through two weeks, the combination of Tom Brady throwing to his tight end duo of Rob Gronkowski and Martellus Bennett looks nigh unstoppable.
The Patriots have scored 33 and 35 points in the two games Brady has played, an average of 34 points per game that would lead the league if they kept it up over the full season. Brady himself has thrown for 406 and then 376 yards in those two games, figures that yield an average of 391 yards per game that would also, unsurprisingly, lead the NFL.
Brady's accumulated those numbers by doing what he does best -- getting the ball out of his hands and into the hands of playmakers quicker than anybody in football. Nobody reads the defense before the snap better than Brady, and the New England offense is designed with route combinations that allow him to exploit the weakest point of the defense very soon after the ball is snapped. That's how you wind up with a 76 percent completion rate, 10.4 yards per attempt, and a 135.5 passer rating through two games.
Amazingly, though, Brady has been even better than that when targeting his two monster-sized tight ends. He's thrown to Gronkowski or Bennett 29 times in those two games, and he's completed 23 of those passes for 386 yards and four touchdowns. That's a 79.3 percent completion rate. It's 13.3 yards per attempt. And it all yields a perfect 158.3 passer rating.
The Patriots operate out of two-plus tight end sets more than almost any other team in football. Even last season, before acquiring Bennett, the Pats had two or more tight ends on the field for 54 percent of their plays, per Pro Football Focus; the average NFL team used multiple tight ends on around 25 percent of its plays.
Through the first four weeks of this season, the Pats did not use multi-tight end looks nearly as often as they did last season. They were in two or three tight-end looks on only 29 percent of snaps, per PFF. It makes sense -- Gronkowski sat the first two games of the season due to injury, then played only 14 and 39 snaps in Weeks 3 and 4 as the Patriots blew out the Texans and then were shut out by the Bills.
Once Brady returned, though, Bill Belichick and Josh McDaniels ramped things right back up. New England used multiple tight ends on 76 of its 144 snaps in Weeks 5 and 6, with 72 of those snaps featuring both Gronkowski and Bennett -- a rate of exactly 50 percent. It's on those plays where the offense has been at its most dangerous.
Most teams that run two-tight sets tend to use their tight ends as exactly that -- tight ends. Maybe one on either side of the line of scrimmage, or two stacked toward one side. And the Patriots definitely do that sometimes. But they're also not afraid to move these guys around. Both players have lined up in the slot or out wide nearly as often as they've been inline as traditional tight ends, per tracking data from PFF.
PLAYER INLINE SLOT WIDE Gronkowski 64 (52%) 40 (33%) 18 (15%) Bennett 53 (57%) 23 (25%) 17 (18%)
Take this play from Week 5 against the Browns, for example:
The Patriots are in 12 personnel here (one running back and two tight ends) but they're lined up as though they're in an 01 grouping (no tight ends and one back). Gronk is split out wide right as a receiver, while Bennett is lined up in the slot to the left side of the formation.
Just lining them up this way creates chaos for the defense. The Browns know they can't single-cover Gronkowski with a cornerback -- he's too big. So they rotate a safety over for an inside double-team to take away the slant. With both linebackers to that side of the field coming on a blitz, Bennett is left one-on-one on the back side. All he has to do is get inside his man, and Brady has a free lane to toss him a quick touchdown pass, which is exactly what happened on the play. Gronk ran both his men into the back of the end zone on a slant, Bennett came across the formation, boxed his man out, and scored.
Later in the game, the Pats brought out a personnel grouping with three wide receivers and two tight ends. Yet, they lined up Gronk and Bennett both in the slot this time, on opposite sides of the field.
Again, this is a near-automatic mismatch. There are only so many underneath defenders available, and you can't devote enough resources to stop both of Gronk and Bennett. Look how confused the Browns are just before the ball is snapped, then watch as two of them chase Bennett on his route, leaving Gronkowski with one-on-one coverage to the (offense's) right side of the field.
That is just way too easy, but it somehow got even easier later in the drive.
The Patriots, back in 12 personnel this time, lined Gronkowski and Bennett up right next to each other on the right side of the formation, this time as inline tight ends. They also brought Julian Edelman in close to the formation on the back side, showing a clear run look.
Except, of course, they did not run the ball, and both Gronk and Bennett wound up wide the heck open down the field.
The unfairness continued in Week 6, though not so much until after halftime. Near the goal line, the Pats again lined up in 12 personnel, this time with Bennett slot left and Gronk as a receiver to the right side, but in tight to the formation.
This is practically giving Brady a free touchdown. All he has to do is recognize which of his monster tight ends will be seeing one-on-one coverage, then look off any possible help and fire away. Because Brady is Brady, that's exactly what he does.
I'd say it's almost too easy, but there's no almost about it. That's just too easy.
The operative question here, of course, is whether anyone can stop the Patriots when these two guys are on the field together, especially near the goal line. Neither the Browns nor Bengals was able to do it, and it seems unlikely the Steelers can either.
The best way to disrupt the Pats' passing game is likely the same as it has always been: get pressure on Brady quickly. Doing so might mean sending extra rushers, though, and that's a dangerous proposition. Every extra man you devote to the pass rush is one less man that can help out in coverage against these two gigantic targets.
The team best-equipped to do it will be one that is able to generate a rush while rarely blitzing -- like the Bills and Seahawks, who they play in their two games following this week's tilt with the Steelers, though Rex Ryan may get over-aggressive and send a ton of extra rushers. Or one that has good enough defensive backs and safeties to hold up on the back end when extra men are rushing the quarterback -- like the Broncos defense that flustered the Patriots in last year's playoffs.
With the additional weaponry the Patriots have added this year, though, it may just be too difficult to shut them down.
Not all cosmic mysteries lie light-years away. Some secrets are being unearthed on our nearest neighbor, about a quarter of a million miles from home.
For almost seven years, NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has been keeping a close eye on the moon. During its tenure, the spacecraft has cataloged craters, pinpointed subsurface deposits of water ice and found evidence of recent volcanic activity. It has even witnessed crashes by three other spacecraft. (One, LCROSS, launched a plume of ejecta from the South Pole that scientists searched for water vapor.)
“No other mission has orbited the moon for as long as LRO has,” says Noah Petro, a geologist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. Constant lunar vigilance has “really pushed our understanding of how the moon changes today, over the last billion years and what happened early on.” A
At least 200,000 of the nearly 2m trophies collected from animal hunts were endangered species, according to report revealing the scale of the industry
Around 1.7m animal “trophies” have been exported across borders by hunters in the last decade, with at least 200,000 of them endangered species, according to a new report.
US hunters are by far the largest killers of trophy animals, including half of all the 11,000 lions shot in the last decade, the report found. The issue came to global attention in July 2015, after a US dentist paid more than $50,000 to kill a lion called Cecil, who was being tracked by conservation scientists.
The report from the International Fund for Animal Welfare (Ifaw), based on official records, sheds new light on the scale of the international trophy-hunting industry.
It found the number of lions hunted for trophies tripled to 1,500 a year in the last decade, while the number of elephants killed by hunters more than doubled to 1,600. The total number of animal trophies may be much higher as those that remain in the country where they were killed are not recorded.
“The trophy-hunting industry is driven by demand and, sadly, demand for animal trophies is prevalent worldwide,” said Philip Mansbridge, director of Ifaw UK. “Even in the face of extinction, imperilled species are still being hunted every day in order to serve as the centrepiece of someone's decor. It is unconscionable in this modern day where species are under so many threats to survive.”
Three of Africa's “big five” - elephants, lions and leopards - were in the top six targets for trophy hunters. More than 10,000 elephants and the same number of leopards were killed as trophies in the last decade, along with more than 8,000 lions.
The most popular target was the American black bear, of which 93,000 were hunted in the last decade, with the Hartmann's mountain zebra the second biggest target with 13,000 deaths. Large numbers of baboons (9,500) and hippopotamuses (6,000) were also hunted as trophies in the last decade.
Trophy hunting is expensive: hunters pay $25,000-$60,000 to kill an elephant, $8,500-$50,000 for a lion and $15,000-$35,000 for a leopard. Supporters of the industry argue that the money raised can fund conservation efforts and Prince William has argued it can be justified in some circumstances.
In April, the International Union for Conservation of Nature said: “Legal, well-regulated trophy hunting programmes can – and do – play an important role in delivering benefits for both wildlife conservation and for the livelihoods and wellbeing of indigenous and local communities living with wildlife.”
But others strongly disagree. “Many scientists and organisations reject the ‘killing them to save them' philosophy that hunters tout as their justification,” said Azzedine Downes, president of Ifaw.
One species that is being hunted less frequently today is polar bears, of which just 20,000 survive in the wild. The US banned the import of polar bear trophies in 2008 and the number hunted each year in Canada fell from 360 to 210, although the two countries have continued to clash over the issue.
The Ifaw report is based on records from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), the legal treaty agreed by 182 nations, but these do not include trophies that are not exported. The Ifaw analysis is in line with previous research: in February, the Humane Society International estimated that 1.2m animal trophies were imported into the US alone over the last decade.
Ifaw found the biggest sources of trophy animals were Canada (35%), due to the many black bears killed, followed by South Africa (23%) and Namibia (11%).
After the US, hunters from Germany and Spain take the most animal trophies home, with about 10,000 entering each country over the last decade. The UK imported less than 500 over the same period, but Mansbridge is still calling on its government to follow France and other countries and ban the practice.
Mansbridge added: “It could be argued that the concept of trophy hunting as we know it today was invented by the British empire during Victorian times. We started this cruel practice – now we should lead the world in stopping it.”

For job seekers, few things are more discouraging than spending time applying for a position only to later learn that it was never really open to begin with—the job had been posted with a particular person already lined up for it.
Last week, Santa Clara University (SCU) posted a job opening so specific it's hard to imagine anyone would have made the mistake of spending time applying for it. In fact, it was so specific it was hard to imagine that there was anyone who could possibly meet its qualifications, except for, of course, the one person it was written for.
The job posting has now been deleted from SCU's website, but a version still exists at higheredjobs.com. Here's the posting's descriptions of the "basic qualifications" needed to fill this role of an adjunct lecturer in non-fiction writing (emphasis added):
The successful applicant will have at least 25 books on topics ranging from the history of Silicon Valley to the biography of microprocessing to interviews with entrepreneurs to the history of human and mechanical memory; will have been published by presses such as Harper/Collins, Doubleday, Random House, St. Martin's, and SUNY Press; will also have e-books on topics such as home life in the US, home life in the UK, and water conservation; will have worked as both a journalist for a print newspaper and for magazines; will have hosted television and radio productions for PBS, cable television, and ABC; will have worked in electronic media such as being editor of Forbes ASAP or a weekly columnist for ABC.com; will have founded or co-founded at least two start-ups; will have professional connections to Oxford University in the UK as well as to numerous media (print, electronic, and television) in the SF Bay Area and beyond. The successful applicant must have demonstrated experience in teaching nonfiction writing and internship classes for undergraduates, must have demonstrated success in helping undergraduates secure internships in public writing that lead to jobs, and must be committed to working with undergraduates.
It didn't take long before Internet-sleuth extraordinaire (and frequent Atlantic contributor) Yoni Appelbaum figured out who would get the job: Michael S. Malone, whose qualification not only miraculously mirrored the job description, but who actually already holds the position.

I don't think they confirmed Bryce Dallas Howard, who has also been in talks for a role. I'm hearing that 12-year old Ty Simpkins, fresh from Iron Man 3, has booked a lead in Jurassic World.
Despite the fact I probably have food in the freezer older than this young actor, Simpkins has worked before with producer Steven Spielberg, who is producing with Frank Marshall and Pat Crowley. Simpkins made his feature debut in the Spielberg-directed War Of The Worlds, opposite Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning. Last year, Simpkins starred in the genre smash Insidious, and reprises in the sequel. His other credits include Revolutionary Road, Pride And Glory, and the Kate Winslet-starrer Little Children. This should be a breakout opportunity–the first three films grossed more than $1.9 billion worldwide–in a film that was written by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver and is being directed by Trevorrow. Trevorrow, who wrote the most recent draft with Derek Connolly, got the job off the acclaimed indie Safety Not Guaranteed. He's repped by ICM Partners.
Sideshow Collectibles has unveiled their new premium format figure based on the Joker from Batman: Arkham Asylum. The figure is the first in a new line of figures celebrating the first installment of the hit Batman Arkham videogame trilogy.
Here's the figure's description:
Teetering over 24" tall, the deranged criminal mastermind is nearly bursting with glee, seizing control of the Arkham Asylum in what might be his most diabolical scheme ever. Sporting an impeccably tailored recreation of his weathered purple pinstripe suit, the self-styled Clown Prince of Crime waves his 'Ace of Spades' revolver in one hand, while the other conceals more tricks up his sleeve. With one look at the maniacal glint in his eye and disturbing smile etched across his face, you can almost hear Mark Hamill's lilting voice deliver the Joker's jeering taunts, as Gotham City's most sadistic villain positively sways in anticipation of going face-to-face with Bats once again. And surely, it won't be long before the Dark Knight is on his way...
The program was originally pitched in 2012 but was delayed as regulators worked out a balance between utility and privacy. The eCall system in its current form prevents authorities from tracking vehicles prior to a crash and only sends basic information--vehicle type, location and number of passengers--when a wreck does occur. "The information is transferred only at the moment a serious accident occurs and airbag are sensors set off," Sehnalova continued. "Then a standard set of information is sent to the rescue services."
These devices are expected to reduce emergency crew response times by 40 percent in urban areas and halve them in rural communities. As such, the European Commission estimates the program will reduce driver deaths by a whopping 10 percent--2,500 lives annually. The device is expected to add only around $100 to the total price of a new vehicle.

The Brooklyn Bridge Abduction
"Linda Cortile" is a pseudonym Budd Hopkins used in his book 'Witnessed' to protect the true identity of the subject of this abduction. Other names have been used for this case and later publications say the woman's real name is Linda Napolitano.
On November 30, 1989 about 3:00 a.m., a large flying saucer appeared over Manhattan in New York City. Two small beings floated Linda Cortile out of her twelth-floor apartment on a beam of light. They passed her right through a closed glass window. (This is a common occurrence, although I don't know how they do it.)

A World Class Diplomat Sees It All
There were several eyewitnesses, and the event was seen by many people at different locations. Two of the witnesses were U.S. Secret Service agents. They were escorting the Secretary General of the United Nations, Perez de Cuellar. The two agents and Perez de Cuellar saw the whole thing from the Brooklyn Bridge, which they were crossing at the time. Like many other cases of a nearby hovering UFO, the magnetic field generated by the saucer knocked out all the electricity in the area, including the ignition system of the Secretary General's limo. They were a totally captive audience, along with other people on the bridge, who began to panic and start screaming.
Water Getaway
After picking up Linda Cortile, the saucer dove into the East River and disappeared. This too, is a common occurrence. There is plenty of evidence to show that saucers use rivers, lakes, and oceans to travel. The U.S. Navy tracks as many saucers underwater as above. Remember, two-thirds of the earth's surface is covered with water and humans have explored only about 5 percent of the area covered by our oceans. What better way to travel unseen and undetected?
Linda Napolitano
The Return
Like many abductees, when Linda was returned to her room she found that her husband and son had been "switched off." This is a state of unconsciousness that all the other people in the house are put into when someone is abducted. The common statement made by abductees is that the other family members look more dead than alive. It's not a normal sleep state. Linda Cortile, recalling her return said, "I held a mirror under the nose of my husband and my son to see if they were breathing."

Singer Jennifer Lopez has topped attractiveness polls with her curves Carrying extra weight on your hips, bum and thighs is good for your health, protecting against heart and metabolic problems, UK experts have said. Hip fat mops up harmful fatty acids and contains an anti-inflammatory agent that stops arteries clogging, they say. Big behinds are preferable to extra fat around the waistline, which gives no such protection, the Oxford team said. Science could look to deliberately increase hip fat, they told the International Journal of Obesity. And in the future, doctors might prescribe ways to redistribute body fat to the hips to protect against cardiovascular and metabolic diseases such as diabetes. The researchers said having too little fat around the hips can lead to serious metabolic problems, as occurs in Cushing's syndrome. Shape not weight Evidence shows that fat around the thighs and backside is harder to shift than fat around the waist. Although this may sound undesirable, it is actually beneficial because when fat is broken down quickly it releases a lot of cytokines which trigger inflammation in the body, say experts. These cytokines have been linked to cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance and diabetes. Fat around the hips and thighs is good for you but around the tummy is bad
Lead researcher Dr Konstantinos Manolopoulos The slower burning hip fat also makes more of the hormone adiponectin that protects the arteries and promotes better blood sugar control and fat burning. In comparison, carrying excess fat around the stomach, being "apple shaped", raises the risk of diabetes and heart disease. Lead researcher Dr Konstantinos Manolopoulos, of Oxford University, said: "It is shape that matters and where the fat gathers. "Fat around the hips and thighs is good for you but around the tummy is bad." He said in an ideal world, the more fat around the thighs the better - as long as the tummy stays slim. "Unfortunately, you tend not to get one without the other," he said. Fotini Rozakeas of the British Heart Foundation said: "This research helps us better to understand how fat acts in the body in order to develop new approaches in reducing heart and circulatory disease. "If you are overweight, obese, or if you have a waist size that is increased, it is important to make changes to your lifestyle, such as eating a healthy diet and doing regular physical activity, to reduce your risk of heart health problems."

The power of video games is how they take the things that we want to do, the things we imagine doing when we're a kid playing in the yard, and turns them into as close to reality as possible. We've seen this throughout the last few decades with games that let us be spies, super soldiers, sports stars, or pretty much anything else that we could imagine. Yet through all these years there have been few games that nail the joy of becoming a warrior like For Honor does. Pitting the mightiest of histories soldiers against each other, the game is a multiplayer focused experience that genuinely makes you feel like a giant warrior of the past. It's a perfect example of the power of video games, and it's one of the most visceral games you will ever play.
Describing For Honor is like listing off a bunch of your favorite things. The game is a mixture of so much cool gaming and general fiction elements that it ends up feeling very much like the greatest hits album of your childhood. Mixing the large battlefields of military games like Dynasty Warriors, with fighting mechanics similar to 3D titles like Tekken or Soul Calibur, and the biggest historical warriors of all time, the game ends up as one of the best action titles of the last few years.
The key to this is the “Art of Battle” system, which has players squaring off against each other. Locking on by pulling the left trigger, then using the analog stick to decide which way to hold your sword, players have to always watch their enemy to determine which way their attack may come, while also deciding where to send their sword flying, in order to get past their enemy's strong defenses. This system works wonderfully when facing off against another human, but the AI also plays a big role.
For Honor is one of the best multiplayer action titles in years
For Honor is heavily focused on the multiplayer components, but it has a surprisingly strong single player campaign. The story is kind of a confusing mess, presenting you with a world that saw some sort of calamity a thousand years ago. This caused the globe to become embroiled in conflict for that thousand years, with peace only becoming a reality in the last few years. The three groups in these conflicts are the ones you choose from in multiplayer: knights, vikings, and samurai. Why they're in the same region? Who knows.
What we do know is that a new warlord named Apollyon is trying to bring back the wars that just now ended. You play as alternating characters, with a specific chapter for each faction. You'll work for and against Apollyon, trying to figure out what is happening in this world, and maybe how to avoid plunging the globe back into endless combat.
The campaign is deeper than I and many others might have anticipated, but it's still not an amazing experience all by itself. It serves as a great intro to the game, its characters, and the fighting mechanics that you'll need to understand from top to bottom. It goes a bit beyond this, especially thanks to the excellent cutscenes and voice work, but if you're buying For Honor just to play the campaign, you'll likely want to wait for a sale of some kind. Multiplayer is the focus, and it's here where you'll get the real value.
And multiplayer is where For Honor really sings. The game was obviously made for this, and the bulk of its feature set is dedicated to players facing off against other players. Throughout the game's many demo periods, players were able to try out a variety of different game modes. These all offer something unique, and provide a nice set of different experiences, which is good considering how fine tuned and simple the core gameplay is. There's even an overarching conflict between the three factions called The Faction War. By playing multiplayer matches you earn war assets that you can contribute to the battle. It's mostly just quick option choices, but it gives players incentive to get on every day.
In the actual matches, For Honor seems to work just as well whether you're fighting a single enemy, or working as a team. Duel allows you to challenge a single other player to the best of five match, which you can up to two versus two, if you wanna bring a friend along. There's also four versus four modes ranging from deathmatch, to elimination, and finally Dominion, which has teams capturing points on the map.
This last mode will likely be a favorite, as it allows teams to not get swarmed by enemies, just because of a single unfortunate death. It's also a ridiculously tense experience, if the teams are even close to evenly matched. Getting to a thousand points take a long time and a lot of effort, and unless the other team has totally failed, they'll be right there with you, inching closer to victory. Once a team hits a thousand points, the game doesn't just end. Instead the other team has a chance to rally, but none of them can respawn until they claw their way back from defeat. This takes an already adrenaline fueled experience and turns it into a frantic fight for survival, or a methodical slaughter of your foes.
Each match of For Honor feels fresh and exciting, while still offering a somewhat balanced experience. Each faction plays similarly enough to the other that you won't likely see too much favoritism, but within the factions are different types of fighters that might not balance as well. These essentially break down to an all-around fighter, a heavy, a fast mover, and a hybrid. It's tough to say this early on, with players still learning how everything works, but don't be surprised if Ubisoft has to jump in with some balance tweaks to the four main types of fighters.
With balance being in check, the main reason to choose between these different warriors is their looks, which can be customized with an extensive unlock system. Actually, to unlock system in For Honor is a bit too big and cumbersome for my tastes, unlocking cosmetic items as well as power ups that seem to just be minor variations of things you might already have, or ones that just aren't useful enough to even try. Still, it's nice that you can not only customize your look, but also your abilities, both passive and active, even if these might cause some balance trouble in the long run.
I bring up balance mostly because it does feel, so far like it is working exceptionally well. Each fight that I've had in my many hours spread across alphas, betas, and the final game has either felt like the better player won, or the lesser player got lucky and pulled off some risky maneuver, such as pushing their enemy off a ledge, rather than fight them to the death. For Honor is a competitive game, but its network will need to hold for that to work as expected, and with Ubisoft opting for player-to-player connections, that could be a problem as well. Dedicated servers would have been better, and caused less connection drops mid-game, as well as NAT and other connection issues. This likely won't impact the majority of players, but if you're hardcore about your competition, keep it in mind and be ready for some possible host advantage.
That's all nitpicky stuff though, unless it's already a dealbreaker for you. For Honor is a glorious action experience in almost every way. The gameplay is particularly solid, but the visuals are also stellar, offering one of the best looking games available. This is more than just geometry, design, and texture quality though, as every character's animation is fluid and precise, allowing for the quick reactions necessary for combat.
Sound design is solid as well, though some noises, particularly character's screams, can get grating after the hundredth time you hear them. The only time I actually raged about anything it was simply because the game held my hand too much. For some reason you'll keep getting introduced and reintroduced to gameplay mechanics via tutorials or pop-up messages. It can get old, but it's such a small price to pay to keep playing this wonderful game.
The Verdict
For Honor is one of the best multiplayer action titles in years. It's focus on brutal, almost slow paced combat is unique, while still feeling wholly familiar in the annuls of pop culture. The game puts you right into the shoes of history's greatest warriors, then pits you against each other in fantastic ways. The single player campaign isn't worth much more than a single playthrough, and the unlock system is a bit much, but players will find themselves jumping into multiplayer matches over and over again just to experience the adrenaline rush offered by the frenetic, but controlled combat.

Dear Fr. Fortea, do demons experience pleasure? If so, how?
Yes, but only in a spiritual sense. As a pure spirit, a demon can derive pleasure only with his intelligence and will. Intellectual pleasures might seem less intense or real than the pleasures of the senses, but this is not the case. Pleasures of the intellect can be as sublime and varied as those of the five senses. Think about the enjoyment that reading a good book, playing a game of chess, or attending the symphony brings; such pleasures are eminently “spiritual”–that is, intellectual–even though the senses may be involved.
In spite of the demons' drifting far from God, their spiritual powers–intellect and will–remain intact. So their ability to experience pleasure remains intact as well. What they cannot do is love someone with a supernatural love. The capacity to love has been annihilated in the psychology of a demon. A demon knows but does not love. The pleasure achieved in doing an evil act is the same as that which a human being feels when he gets revenge on an enemy–it is a pleasure filled with hate.
To learn more about spiritual warfare and demonology, Catholic Spiritual Direction recommends Fr. Fortea's excellent book Interview With An Exorcist – An Insider's Look at the Devil, Demonic Possession, and the Path to Deliverance.

Liverpool held their second test event following the redevelopment of Anfield on Monday afternoon, with both the interior and exterior improved.
Work began at Anfield at the end of the 2015/16, with plans to expand the stadium's Main Stand representing the majority of the redevelopment, lifting the capacity to 54,167.
Liverpool held an initial test event on Friday evening, to ensure Anfield passes security measures, and this was followed up on Bank Holiday Monday.
For supporters, this provided an opportunity to experience the new facilities, both inside and outside the stadium.
The interior of Anfield now has a more modern feel, with Liverpool introducing new food and drink facilities, including the Paddock Bar within the Main Stand.
Michael Beale oversaw an open training session with the Liverpool U23s on Monday, with Reds legend Robbie Fowler among those also present.
Anfield will host the first home game of Liverpool's 2016/17 campaign after the international break on September 10, when Jurgen Klopp‘s side will welcome Premier League champions Leicester City to Merseyside.
Fifteen first-team players have been called up for international duty, while Klopp will take charge of a behind-closed-doors friendly clash with Huddersfield Town during the interval.
A bitter dispute over minority voting rights in Texas arrives at the US Supreme Court on Monday where the justices must decide which legislative districts will be used in upcoming elections.
At issue is whether federal judges in San Antonio overstepped their authority when they took it upon themselves to redraw congressional and state house election districts without any prior judicial determination that maps drawn for that purpose by the Texas Legislature were illegal or unconstitutional.
Texas officials object to using interim judge-drawn maps while election districts established by the state Legislature remain tied up in ongoing litigation.
With elections fast approaching, the Supreme Court is hearing on an expedited basis three consolidated cases that look at whether the judges' interim maps should be used or whether the judges should have relied more on the maps drawn by the Legislature.
Meanwhile, a federal three-judge panel in Washington is set to consider whether the original maps drawn by the Texas Legislature should be given preclearance for use in the upcoming election – and future elections – or whether there are parts of that must be amended to comply with the Voting Rights Act and the Constitution.
Texas had been scheduled to conduct its primary election on so-called Super Tuesday – March 6. But escalating legal battles have forced state officials to push the vote date back to April 3.
Now, with the Supreme Court involved, even that date may be in jeopardy.
Importance of the case
The case is significant because how election districts are apportioned can alter who is elected in each district. The case involves disputed maps for election districts for the Texas state Senate and House, and for members of Congress.
The election maps produced by the Republican-controlled Texas Legislature favored Republican candidates. In contrast, the maps drawn by the federal judges undercut many of those Republican preferences.
The legal case isn't about which party may or may not gain an advantage in election district line-drawing. Politicians care about that; judges should not. The central issue for the courts is whether maps drawn by state lawmakers comply with the requirements of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and with constitutional guarantees of one person, one vote.
Because Texas has a history of racial discrimination in elections, the Voting Rights Act requires the state to obtain prior approval from Washington before enacting any changes in its voting process – including drawing new election districts.
Texas sought approval last summer, but that process has bogged down. At the same time, several minority groups and candidates filed lawsuits in San Antonio objecting to Texas' proposed new election districts. The minority groups alleged that the newly drawn districts seek to dilute the growing political clout of Latino voters in Texas.
The minority groups asked the three-judge panel in San Antonio to designate interim election maps to be used in lieu of the state's maps as litigation over redistricting is sorted out in the courts. Two of the three judges agreed and produced new maps, significantly changing the districts drawn by the Texas Legislature.
Lawyers for Texas say the judges usurped the role of elected lawmakers in drawing their own election maps.
“Without making any finding of an actual or likely violation of law, the court simply redrew Texas' election maps based on its own notions of ‘neutral principles,' the ‘collective public good,' and ‘fairness and impartiality,' " Washington lawyer Paul Clement wrote in the Texas brief to the Supreme Court. “Those are not standards that courts can meaningfully apply,” he said.
“Redistricting is an inherently political process, and – in the absence of some violation of statutory or constitutional law – it is wholly committed to the discretion of state legislatures,” Mr. Clement wrote.
Texas says the three-judge court should have endorsed the Legislature's maps on an interim basis to allow the election to move forward while challenges to the overall redistricting plan continued in court.
Short of that, Texas lawyers say, the judges should have made a preliminary determination of those portions of the new maps likely to violate the law or the Constitution, and then altered only those portions of the maps to create interim maps for the approaching election.
Critics slam Legislature's maps
Opponents of the Legislature's newly drawn districts say using the state's plan as a baseline for interim maps would allow the state to pull off an end run around the election laws and other protections for minority voters.
The Texas Legislature's redistricting plan “was largely governed by unlawful racial considerations, as Texas legislators knew precisely how best to … pick off, split up, and drown out minority voters to ensure that minority population gains would not translate into minority electoral gains,” wrote Austin lawyer Renea Hicks in a brief to the high court.
By law, congressional districts must be recalculated every 10 years to reflect updated US census figures. The Texas population increased by more than 4 million during the past decade. The increase qualified the state for four new congressional districts, boosting the Texas congressional delegation from 32 to 36 seats.
Minority groups and candidates argued in their lawsuit that because Latinos accounted for 65 percent of the increased population, they deserved additional Latino-majority districts in both Congress and the Texas House.

“Texas has not added a Latino-opportunity congressional district since 1991,” wrote Nina Perales of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, in a brief to the court.
“Since the 1990 census, the Latino population in Texas increased by 5.1 million; the Anglo population increased by 1.1 million,” Perales wrote. “Nevertheless, Texas crafted a congressional plan that carves away majority-Latino counties from majority-Latino districts and uses race to change districts to ensure that Latinos cannot elect their candidates of choice.”
This Wednesday, North Carolina passed the most dangerous piece of anti-LGBT legislation in the country, restricting cities from passing nondiscrimination laws and preventing trans people from using bathrooms that represent their gender identity. All of this has been done in the name of so-called "religious freedom."
It was just moments after Skye Thompson, a transgender teen who shared his heart-aching testimony to the North Carolina legislature, that onlookers were able to see first-hand the religious-based bigotry surrounding this process. Skye talked about the bullying he has experienced during his life due to his gender identity and fear about what the now-passed North Carolina legislation would do to him in his everyday life. Moments later, John, a youth pastor in the chamber, uttered these words: "I will be a homophobic bigot until the day that I die."
John believes scripture tells him there can only be male and female: "If God didn't give you access to a male or female bathroom via your anatomy, neither should we give you access via ordinance or legislation." This is wrong.
Earlier that day John's office at the Christian Academy he works at received a phone call calling him a homophobic bigot. John embraces that title however, because he believes this bill is about protecting his family from sexual predators. John has every right to protect his family from sexual predators. We all do. Where John and the state of North Carolina are wrong is conflating sexual predators with the intention of this bill's objective to ensure that transgender people have a place to use the bathroom in public spaces.
Charlotte, North Carolina passed an ordinance last month that allowed individuals to use public facilities that aligned with their gender identity. The win was short lived as North Carolinian senators vowed to pass legislation that repealed those rights. Last night, they succeed passing said legislation in a special assembly that cost taxpayers $42,000. The legislation not only repealed the rights gained by Charlotte's ordinance but also allows discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. It even goes further than affecting the LGBT community. This legislation eliminates recourse from anyone fired from their job based on race, religion, age, or ability.
The worry, so many claimed, was that "sexual predators" would use this law to enter bathrooms. There hasn't been a single instance of this actually happening. This "bathroom predator" myth has been thoroughly debunked. And yet, many claimed it is due to their sincerely held religious beliefs that they could not allow trans-inclusive bathrooms.
North Carolina passed the most dangerous piece of anti-LGBT legislation in the country that might provoke violence towards transgender people, all in the name of so-called "religious freedom." How exactly will binary gendered bathrooms threaten the religious freedom of others? I'm not certain. Neither are the folks who are claiming transgender individuals using the bathroom infringes on their religious freedom.
In order to believe transgender identities are somehow sinful, you would have to invent scripture that just isn't there. This would also require one to conflate gender and sex either lacking the knowledge that they are not one in the same or just refusing to believe the medical community. You would also have to believe that sex is binary, while ignoring the biological reality of intersex individuals. You would need to also forget Jesus' words of praise to the gender minorities in biblical times. Of course, this doesn't even begin to cover how bathroom usage is somehow part of North Carolinians religious practices.
These bathroom bills aren't about religious freedom. These bills are actually ignorance manifesting itself in transphobia. It's clear North Carolina legislators not only don't understand what it means to be transgender but they also aren't aware on how to back their anti-trans stance in scripture.
Georgia To Roll Out Tens Of Thousands Of CCTV Cameras With Real-Time Facial Recognition Capabilities
from the are-you-a-sheep-or-a-goat? dept
Surveillance using CCTV cameras is old hat these days, even for locations outside the world's CCTV capital, London. But there's an important step-change taking place in the sector, as operators move from simply observing and recording, to analyzing video feeds automatically using facial recognition software. Techdirt has written about this area a few times, but these examples have all been fairly small-scale and exploratory. News from Georgia -- the one in the Caucasus, not the State -- shows that things are moving fast in this field:
NEC Corporation today announced that it has provided an advanced surveillance system for cities utilizing facial recognition to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia, in cooperation with Capital Systems LLC, a leading system developer. The system began operation in June of this year, and works in combination with 400 CCTV surveillance cameras installed in Georgia's major cities, including the capital, Tbilisi. The system utilizes NeoFace Watch, NEC's real-time facial recognition software for video, featuring the world's highest recognition precision. It checks images captured by CCTV cameras against pictures of suspects and others registered in a watch list, making it possible to identify figures rapidly and accurately. This system was introduced as part of Georgia's "Safe City, Safe Region, Safe Country" program aiming to improve public safety. Georgia also plans to install tens of thousands of additional cameras nationwide in the future.
It's not clear whether those tens of thousands of CCTV systems will all be equipped with real-time facial recognition, or only some of them. But even the immediate roll out of facial recognition to 400 CCTV cameras is substantial, especially for a country with fewer than four million inhabitants. It's hard not to see this as a test-bed for other, much bigger countries, which will doubtless be watching Georgia's experience with interest. Some have already started their own trials: ZDNet reports that at least two of Australia's police forces -- the Northern Territory Police and South Australia Police -- have 100s of CCTV cameras with real-time facial recognition features. There's also a small-scale trial employing vehicle-mounted cameras with similar capabilities being conducted by UK police in Wales. All of the examples mentioned here use the NeoFace Watch system from NEC, which the company claims is able to process multiple camera feeds, and to extract and match thousands of faces per minute.
NEC also emphasizes that its product is "suitable for the detection of both undesirables and VIPs." That's an important point. CCTV systems are currently fairly egalitarian, spying on and recording everyone equally. But the addition of facial recognition allows a crowd's sheep and goats to be distinguished, and then dealt with appropriately. While beefy security guards preemptively -- and discreetly -- remove the "undesirables" who might lower the tone of a venue, exquisite hospitality experts can meet and greet the VIPs as they approach. One of the unexpected results of adding facial recognition to CCTV is that it brings out the "servile" in "surveillance".

We trust them with our most personal questions, photos, stories and secrets. They never leave our sides. Most of us have slept with our phone1. And nearly 1 in 5 people would be more willing to give up seeing their significant other, showering or sleeping than having to go without their smartphone for a weekend1. Now that's devotion.
But let's face it, most of the time, these relationships are one-sided. Our phones simply aren't as devoted to us as we are to them. They desert us with a dead battery when we need them the most, embarrass us during important meetings, and pester us while we're driving, demanding we take our eyes off the road to pay attention to them. And needless to say, most of the time, our phones rarely match our personal style. No wonder less than half of people say they are happy with their phone.
At Motorola, we believe everyone deserves the choice of a better mobile relationship. One that is personal, fulfilling, stands the test of time and fits your budget.

It might not be something we like to admit, but we're all in serious relationships with our phones.
LaLiga players were out to impress during the international break, with Liga BBVA and Liga Adelante stars together accounting for a number of goals and top performances.
In the EURO 2016 warm-up friendlies, Aritz Aduriz marked his return to the Spanish national team after a six-year absence with La Roja's equaliser in the 1-1 draw with Italy in Udine. Another of the Liga BBVA's leading goalscorers, Antoine Griezmann, was also on target, dispatching a stunning free-kick to help France triumph 3-2 away to the Netherlands. In another showdown between European powerhouses, Germany's clash with England, Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos broke the deadlock with a left-footed rocket into the bottom corner, although this was not enough to prevent his country falling to a 3-2 defeat in Berlin. Toni Kroos went on to up his goalscoring tally once more in his side's second friendly showdown, the Germans this time coming away with a 4-1 victory against Italy. Arda Turan has also been making a splash for his national side, a goal from the FC Barcelona player contributing to Turkey's 2-1 win against Austria. Never one to miss out, Cristiano Ronaldo made up for a missed penalty in Portugal's Bulgaria game by netting one of the two goals which sealed his side the win. Meanwhile, although he didn't find the net, Cordoba CF forward Florin Andone caught the eye in Romania's 0-0 stalemate with Spain.
The recent South American qualifiers for the 2018 World Cup also featured their fair share of goals and great displays from LaLiga representatives. Luis Suarez earned Uruguay a 2-2 draw away to Brazil in Recife, in a game that Filipe Luis, Neymar and Alvaro Pereira also played in. The Azulgrana again led Uruguay to their 1-0 victory by serving up an assist for Edinson Cavani to finish for the only goal of the match. For his part, Real Madrid attacking midfielder James Rodriguez scored one and set up another in Colombia's 3-2 win in Bolivia. The Los Blancos star followed up in his team's second showdown with another superb assist for Carlos Bacca, who put away the opener in Colombia-Ecuador, which ended 3-1 to the Cafeteros. Dani Alves emerged as the hero of the hour for Brazil as they went up against Paraguay. The FC Barcelona player equalised for his national side when they were trailing 2-1, thereby salvaging a point for his country.
There was a particularly large LaLiga contingent in the Chile v Argentina match, with FC Barcelona duo Claudio Bravo and Lionel Messi on opposite sides, while Atletico Madrid's Matias Kranevitter and Augusto Fernandez, RC Celta's Marcelo Diaz and Fabian Orellana, and Sevilla FC's Ever Banega were also involved. Banega supplied the assist for the opening goal, while Orellana created Chile's equaliser and Messi set up the winner for the Argentinians. The Barça star again went on to shine in Argentina's second friendly, scoring from a penalty to bring his goal tally for the Albicelestes to 50. Fabian Orellana was another BBVA Liga who again impressed in the second round of matches, the RC Celta player teed up an opportunity for Vidal, who finished it to deliver Chile their 3-1 result against a Venezuelaside which featured Juanpi and Adalberto Peñaranda. A LaLiga goalscorer could also be found in the CONCACAF zone of World Cup qualifying, with CD Tenerife forward Anthony Lozano on the mark in Honduras's 2-2 draw in El Salvador.
Furthermore, Liga BBVA and Liga Adelante stars made their presence felt in the latest batch of 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. Villarreal CF's Congolese striker Cedric Bakambu kept up his purple patch with a strike from the penalty spot in his country's 2-1 victory over Angola. Youssef El-Arabi netted the only goal as Morocco came away 1-0 winners from Cape Verde. The Granada player was the star of the show again in the return match, this time delivering a brace. Sofiane Feghouli was even more on song for Algeria against Ethiopia: the Valencia CF livewire notched a brace in a 7-1 romp for his country, for whom UD Levante's Carl Medjani also lined up. William Jebor was another player to put in a stellar performance during the international break, the SD Ponferradina player serving up a hat-trick to seal the win for Liberia against Dijbouti.

"Biggie and Nas – put they ass in a blender, sprinkle some 50 and came out this nigga…" – ScHoolboy Q
For the first time in a long time, Hip Hop can genuinely say that a new generation of MC's have arrived. Sure, there are those who helped birth the culture and music and people who can say they grew up with it. But now, you are witnessing perhaps the first generation that can say they were raised on Hip Hop almost exclusively. If you don't agree, you're probably not listening to enough ScHoolboy Q.
Although the artist born Quincy Matthew Hanley has only been rapping since 2007, his bluntly charismatic presence on wax should've already put him on your radar as one of rap's emerging voices. After his new project Habits & Contradictions (#HnC) makes its way into your rotation though, he's sure to be a fixture.

New research shows that musicians' brains are highly developed in a way that makes the musicians alert, interested in learning, disposed to see the whole picture, calm, and playful. The same traits have previously been found among world-class athletes, top-level managers, and individuals who practice transcendental meditation.
The new study was conducted by Fred Travis, Maharishi University of Management in the US, Harald Harung, Oslo University College in Norway, and Yvonne Lagrosen, University West in Sweden. They relate to high mind brain development, and it appears that this represents a basic potential to become really, really good at something.
The researchers measure mind brain development in several ways. EEGs reveal special patterns in the electrical activity of the brain in people with high mind brain development. They have well‑coordinated frontal lobes. Our frontal lobes are what we use for higher brain functions, such as planning and logical thinking. Another characteristic is that activity at a certain frequency, so‑called alpha waves, dominates. Alpha waves occur when the brain puts together details into wholes. Yet another EEG measure shows that individuals with high mind brain development use their brain resources economically. They are alert and ready for action when it is functional to be so, but they are relaxed and adopt a wait‑and‑see attitude when that is functional.
Two questionnaires are also used to measure mind brain development. One has to do with moral reasoning. Those with high mind brain development score higher here. The other questionnaire targets what are called peak experiences. These are described as a higher level of consciousness. You have an intense feeling of happiness and harmony and of transcending limitations. Individuals with high mind brain development have many peak experiences.
Fred Travis emphasizes that everything we do changes our brain. Transcendental meditation and making music are activities people should devote themselves to if they wish to change their mind in the right direction. But you can make good progress by following common health recommendations: get enough sleep, work out physically, eat healthily, and don't do drugs. How you think also plays a role.
"If you are a very envious, angry, mean person and that's the way you think about people that's what's going to be strengthened in your brain. But if you are very expanded and open and supportive of others, there will be different connections," says Fred Travis.
The Speaker has decided that this debate will take place on Monday 19 October 2015, it will follow today's statement on school expansion.
The scheduled second reading on the Psychoactive Substances Bill [Lords] will be held afterwards.

When the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed the 20,000 mark in January 2017, the media went wild and the president celebrated with a tweet. When it ground out another 25% to hit 25,000 on Jan. 4, 2018 – less than a year later – the cycle repeated itself. When the index dropped 4.6% to 24,344 on Feb. 5, you would have thought the sun had enveloped the earth.
To be sure, the stock market shot up in 2017, and to be sure, the recent plunge was steep. But we shouldn't describe market milestones or calamities in terms of the Dow (DJI). It's just not a good index.
Indexing, 1890s Style
Perhaps we should give the Dow a break. There wasn't much in the way of precedent for designing index methodology when it was founded in 1896; it was only the second equity index, and its inventor, Charles Dow, had also invented the first. Nor was there anything like the processing power necessary to support a complex index. If Dow had put every mathematician east of the Mississippi to work in unison, he could not have begun to match the computing might we wield by fiddling with our phones.
So should we let Charles Dow's average go the way of the telegraph, heroin-based children's cough remedies and other little-missed aspects of the 19th century?
The argument that it's time to retire the Dow starts with its size, just 30 stocks. Once upon a time that was a reasonable cross-section of the market. But today there are around 7,000 listed companies in the U.S. And it's not even as though the Dow's components are the biggest. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is there, sure. It joined in March 2015, a seemingly arbitrary time, since it had already been the world's biggest company on-and-off for four years. The second- and fourth-biggest companies, Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), are nowhere to be seen, but number three Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is, arbitrarily, there.
According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, which owns the Dow, "a stock typically is added to the index only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors. Maintaining adequate sector representation within the indices is also a consideration in the selection process." The components are not, however, chosen according to "quantitative rules."
Choosing blue-chips based on subjective criteria is forgivable, even if choosing only 30 of them might not be. It's what the Dow does next that makes it an inadequate gauge of market performance. The index is price-weighted: for every $1 one of its stocks goes up, the Dow goes up 6.89 points (the Dow divisor, which is used to keep stock splits from throwing the index off even further, yields that ratio).
1:11 Schwab's Terri Kallsen on Dow 20k
In other words, stocks with higher prices affect the index more, whatever their actual value as measured by market capitalization. At close on Jan. 3, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was a $96.2 billion company by market cap with a per-share price of $253.29. Apple was an $894.0 billion company with a per-share price of $172.23. Apple is over nine times more valuable than Goldman, but the Dow gives Apple around two-thirds the weight it gives Goldman.
The result is that the Dow sometimes moves in the opposite direction to the S&P 500, another S&P Dow Jones index, which is capitalization-weighted and has 500 (well, 505) components. On Dec. 1, 2016, for example, the Dow gained 0.36%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.35%. If you had any interest in actually knowing how the market did on that day, you would look at the S&P 500 and realize that it was modestly down. If you were watching or listening to a non-specialist news broadcast, you'd be liable to hear that the Dow was up 68 points – sounds good, whatever that means. In other words, conflating the Dow with "the stock market" is stretching it.
An even worse practice is citing stock market gains or losses in terms of the Dow's points. The 1,175-point drop on Feb. 5 was not the largest drop in the history of the index by any (sensible) measure. Sure it sounds a lot bigger than the 508-point drop on Black Monday (Oct. 19, 1987) – but that was a 22.6% plunge, while the seemingly steeper 1,175-point drop only amounted to a 4.6% loss. And besides, the S&P was down 4.1%. Go with that.
Why the discrepancy between the Dow and the S&P? The Goldman-Apple example gives a hint: Goldman Sachs gained 3.3% on Dec. 1, 2016. Apple fell 0.9%. The S&P takes that information and concludes, "Goldman Sachs added around $3 billion in value to the market; Apple subtracted around $6 billion from it." The Dow? "Goldman Sachs went up $7.34 per share, so let's say it added around 50 points to the market; Apple went down $1.03 per share, so it subtracted around 7 points." (Note that the divisor has changed since these figures were calculated.)
If that seems logical, we've got a SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) to sell you.
What Can You Do?
David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, told Investopedia in January 2017, "There are certainly a lot of times when I'm as surprised as anyone else with how much coverage the Dow gets." Confronted with the issues caused by its tiny number of components and price-weighted methodology, he directed us to his company's other famous product, the S&P 500: it "doesn't have all the issues you just described." He added that professional investors and market analysts prefer the S&P 500, "but the Dow is the one that's all over the newspapers." (The Wall Street Journal, which Charles Dow co-founded in 1889, blared "Dow Hits 22000, Powered by Apple" – which isn't even a multiple of 5,000 – on Aug. 3.)
Blitzer provided some insight into the process of choosing the index's components. Because the Dow has long been accompanied by sister indices tracking transportation and utilities, it does not include companies from those sectors. Until the 1980s, the "industrial" moniker was more or less accurate, but then it was decided that the index would include banks, insurers, restaurant chains and other non-industrial companies – but not utilities or transportation. Blitzer also revealed a fudge the selection committee uses to avoid some of the price-weighted methodology's worst pitfalls: the ratio of the highest stock price to the lowest should be less than 10 to 1 (which may explain why Alphabet and Berkshire Hathaway are excluded).
Blitzer appears to accept the issues with the Dow. He said that the committee has discussed switching to a capitalization-weighted approach. But "you'd just use the S&P 500 at that point" and, he added, "we'd be throwing away a lot of history."
Therein lies the rub. Fixing the Dow's problems would make it tough to distinguish from the more sensible indices that are already out there. In the process it would cut off a metric that, however flawed, can be traced continuously for 120 years – not to mention throwing away an internationally recognized brand. "Why do we keep it?" Blitzer laughed as he repeated the snide reporter's question. "The recognition, the publicity, the long history."
"To be honest," he added, "this is not a hugely expensive index to maintain."

Jeremy Hunt has admitted making false claims in the House of Commons today.
Speaking on World Mental Health Day, he inflated the increase of mental health workers in the NHS by 43 times.
The Health Secretary has corrected the official record, and said it was an “error.”
But a spokesperson for the Department of Health said he has no intention of making an apology for misleading MPs.
He boasted there are 30,000 more people working in mental health today than when Labour left office.
He later repeated his false claim, saying: “We have 30,000 more professionals working in mental health than when my Government came into office.”
But after Channel 4 News' FactCheck questioned the claim, the Department of Health admitted the figure included all professionally qualified clinical NHS staff, not just mental health workers.
(Image: AFP)
A Department of Health spokesperson said: “This was an error and we will be correcting Hansard accordingly.”
The correct figure, according to FactCheck, is an increase of just 692 people.
The increase has been largely driven by a rise in the number of psychotherapists in the Health Service, while the number of mental health nurses has dropped by more than 5,000 since 2010.
Barbara Keeley, Labour's Shadow Cabinet Member for Mental Health and Social Care said: "The Tory government claim to want to make mental health a priority, but Jeremy Hunt doesn't even know how much mental health staff are working in the NHS.
"Safe staffing was an issue raised by the CQC's new State of Care report this week. Labour will invest more in mental health so that all services are staffed safely."
Mr Hunt initially made the claim in response to the opening question in today's Health Questions in the House of Commons, from Tory colleague Stephen McPartland.
In a question provided to Mr Hunt in advance of the session, Mr McPartland asked "what steps he has taken to increase the size of the mental health workforce."
Reading from papers in front of him, Mr Hunt replied: "Our mental health workforce has increased by 30,000 since 2010, and another 21,000 posts are planned."
When a Member of Parliament inadvertently misleads the house, it is common practice for them to come to the house and apologise.
Dave Munday, the Unite union's lead officer for mental health said: "Jeremy Hunt is shameless in trying to distort the true reality of what's happened to mental health nursing under the Tories and should apologise to parliament.
"On his watch we've seen the number of mental health nurses plummet by 13.1% because of austerity and real term pay cuts. The truth is there's a crisis in mental health because of him and the Tory government."
Mr Hunt has previously been accused of misleading the House over his claim that there were 11,000 'excess deaths' in the NHS at weekends.
The claim was slammed by doctors, who accused him of misrepresenting a paper written by NHS England Medical Director Sir Bruce Keogh for the British Medical Journal.
The paper reads: "It is not possible to ascertain the extent to which these excess deaths may be preventable, to assume that they are avoidable would be rash and misleading."
When Dole Japan announced it would be sold its Gokusen banana for $6 each for one day only (May 9) at the Takashimaya Department Store in Shinjuku, everybody's reaction pretty much was, “OMG, those are some fancy-ass bananas.” The fruit, developed using the best characteristics from more than 100 bananas and grown 500 meters above sea level, came in special boxes and equipped with serial numbers.
But this isn't the first time Japan's gone fruit crazy. In fact, the country has an long history of luxe fruit. In Tokyo, the luxury fruit boutique Sembikiya sells everything from $3-a-piece strawberries to $212 square watermelons. But Sembikiya and the Gokusen banana are only the tip of the absurdly-expensive-fruit iceberg. Here are eight fruits around the world that make a $6 banana look like, well, just a banana.
Densuke Watermelon
Price: $121
Where: Japan
Why so expensive?: Sold at Sembikiya flagship store in Tokyo and throughout Japan, the black-skinned, stripeless Densuke watermelon is reported to have a special type of sweetness. Grown exclusively on Japan's northernmost island, Hokkaido, only 100 Densuke are farmed each year. The most expensive one ever sold was a whopping 17 pounds and went for $6,100 at an auction in 2008, making it the priciest watermelon in the world. (Photo: Flickr)
Sekai-ichi Apple
Price: $21
Where: Japan
Why so expensive?: Yes, $21 per apple. Translating to “the best in the world,” Sekai-ichi are washed with honey and branded by hand to ensure they're blemish free. The orchards where they're grown are pollinated by hand using a tiny wand—treatments not uncommon in Japan's fruit-obsessed culture. As BuzzFeed puts it, “These apples were presumably watered with honey, angel piss, and the tears of Donald Trump.” (Photo: blogger.com)
Yubari King Melons
Price: $225 for two
Where: Japan
Why so expensive?: The price above is actually the deal of a lifetime, seeing as a pair of Yubari King Melons once went for $23,500 (making them the most expensive fruits in the world). Another product of the island of Hokkaido, the hybrid, orange-fleshed melon is highly prized for its sweetness, and, as Gourmet writes, “beautiful proportions.” The melons are grown in greenhouses and even given “hats” to prevent sunburn. (Photo: Flickr)
This Pineapple
Price: $1,600
Where: Cornwall, England
Why so expensive?: The Lost Gardens of Heligan grows these pineapples for two years under straw, manure, and horse urine—”Victorian techniques” that allow the pineapples to flourish in England's colder climate. (If you're adverse to the idea of urine-soaked fruit, don't worry—the pineapple never comes into direct contact with the waste fertilizers.) Because of the intensive time and labor required to grow the pineapples, the fruit is never sold at market. Instead, the pineapples are given to garden staff to “thank them for their hard work over the pineapples life span,” the Lost Gardens of Heligan tells the Huffington Post. (Photo: Information World)
Strawberries Arnaud
Price: $1.4 million
Where: New Orleans, Louisiana
Why so expensive?: A bowl of strawberries for $1.4 million? Hell nah. A bowl of strawberries garnished with a 4.7-carat pink diamond ring for $1.4 million? Still hell no. But that's exactly what's served at the 96-year old Arnaud's restaurant in New Orleans French quarter. Of course, you don't just get the strawberries and the ring for your money—there's a jazz ensemble, too. (Photo: Kit Wohl via MSN)
Ruby Roman Grapes
Price: $6,400
Where: Japan
Why so expensive?: The world's most expensive grapes were sold at an auction in 2011 in (surprise!) Kanazawa, Japan. Each grape was about the size of a ping-pong ball, and, since there were 25 in the bunch, cost about $255. To be sold, the grapes must have a sugar content of around 18 percent and weigh 20 grams each. (Photo: Samshou)
Dekopon
Price: $79 for 6
Where: Japan, and now California
Why so expensive?: A hybrid of a mandarin and an orange, the Dekopon is rumored to be the most delicious citrus in the world. It looks like an orange, with the exception of a bump on the top, but is larger and sweeter. Until 2011—when the citrus made it's way to California and was renamed “Sumo”—the Dekopon was available only in Japan. The LA Times writes that the seedless fruit has “a flesh that feels firm at the first bite but then melts in the mouth.” (Photo: Flickr)
Northern Territory Mangos
Price: $50,000
Where: Sydney, Australia
Why so expensive?: In 2012, a tray of 12 Northern Territory mangos sold for $50,000 at an auction in Sydney. The proceeds went to the Prostate Council Foundation of Australia, the Cancer Council of NSW, and OzHarvest. Australia produces a lot of mangoes—7.2 million trays in 2013/2014—so the fruit's sky-high price tag was most likely for charity's sake. (Photo: Flickr)

Still, the reaction to the memo by existing teachers was not positive. "They're not willing to look at anyone who is white and female," an unnamed teacher told the Globe. "It (a job opening) should go to the person who is best for the job."
The gross majority of teachers at the TDSB are female and white. The board considers that to be a problem in a city where just less than half the student body is male, and nearly three-quarters are visible minorities.

MIKE DEAL / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS archives Toronto schools will fill classrooms with more teachers who are male or members of a visible minority to address student-body demographics.
Would more male teachers, or more visible minorities, translate into a better education system?
This week, the Globe and Mail reported that the Toronto District School Board, in order to ensure its teachers reflect the demographics of its student body, is giving preference in hiring to males and visible minorities, including aboriginals and francophones.
The gross majority of teachers at the TDSB are female and white. The board considers that to be a problem in a city where just less than half the student body is male, and nearly three-quarters are visible minorities.
Still, the reaction to the memo by existing teachers was not positive. "They're not willing to look at anyone who is white and female," an unnamed teacher told the Globe. "It (a job opening) should go to the person who is best for the job."
The irony here is quite thick; this is, after all, one of the only instances in which women can assume the role of the oppressed majority.
In many job classifications, it is women who are included with other minorities in the category of the disadvantaged. Programs to boost the number of women or visible minorities by giving them priority in post-secondary school admission or hiring are still considered by many to be controversial. Critics hold that view, even though by now, these practices are recognized as a legitimate, legal solution to inequality.
However, there are several factors in this story that make it different from other tales of affirmative action.
The shortage of visible-minority teachers is perhaps easy to explain. In cities such as Toronto, the increase in the sheer numbers of visible minorities has proceeded much faster than the teaching profession's ability to train and employ visible-minority teachers.
Over time, with more minorities graduating from high school and university, one would assume the face of the teaching profession would change.
The situation is much different when it comes to men. From England and the United States to Australia and Canada, there is a critical shortage of male teachers. In some jurisdictions, including some in Canada, women make up more than 80 per cent of primary school teaching ranks.
How could this have happened, you may ask? Remarkably, it appears the biggest problem is very few men seek it out as a profession.
Some believe having fewer male teachers discourages male students at an early age from seeking a career as a teacher. Others hypothesize women have come to dominate the teaching ranks, so men no longer feel welcome.
Surveys of male teachers have found many believed because of their interest in working with children, they are too often viewed as potential pedophiles. A 2010 Ontario survey of male teachers found one in six had faced allegations of "inappropriate contact with students." Others have claimed they have been sexually harassed by the female majority.
The other problem here is apart from what appears to be a lack of interest in teaching as a profession, the benefits of hiring more men are not entirely clear.
Advocates for hiring more men, for example, start with concerns about the declining academic performance of boys and dwindling numbers of young men attending and graduating post-secondary education. In the U.K., for example, girls are graduating from secondary school at twice the rate of their male classmates and entering university at four times the rate of young men.

The absence of male teachers, particularly at the primary school level, is often cited as a key element in these troubling trends. Boys and girls learn differently, and there has been a growing concern many female teachers are not relating with their male students. This view is bolstered by surveys of male students, who often believe female teachers give lower grades just because they are boys.
There is a fairly broad agreement in education circles that more men and visible minorities would help some male and minority students succeed in their educational careers. However, other than surveys in which students express these preferences, incontrovertible data linking academic performance and teacher gender are not easy to come by. For that reason, and because full-time teaching jobs are very hard to come by in most communities in this country, most teachers' unions and the female majority within teaching ranks have, in general, opposed hiring quotas.
Most educators are reluctant to concede a female teacher cannot effectively teach a male student, or vice versa. They would similarly argue a white teacher, if he or she was good at what they did, could teach a child of any cultural or ethnic background. However, trends that see male students struggling to keep up with female classmates certainly raise questions, not about whether they could, but whether they are motivating all students of all gender, race or ethnicity.
A commentary on this issue posted on the website of the Alberta Teachers' Association quoted, of all things, The Karate Kid in a bid to remind us of one of the fundamental truths in education. "No such thing as a bad student," Mr. Miyagi tells his young charge Daniel Larusso in the 1984 movie. "Only bad teacher."
Perhaps more males and minority teachers would help the education system connect with student groups that are struggling. Or, perhaps this is a wake-up call for the teaching profession to figure out ways of better connecting students and teachers, regardless of gender or ethnic background.

A resolution was put forward at the latest regular meeting of the Board of Alderman last week that the Administration update the Board regarding the request that the FAA reject any design of skyscraper at Winthrop Square in downtown Boston which would be 775 feet tall, as more traffic would likely be allocated to Runway 33L at Logan International airport if such a design is approved.
The primary concern is that such a tall building situated so close to the airport would likely lead to blocking of a particular takeoff and landing corridor and increase air traffic over Somerville. An issue that residents and civic leaders have been complaining about for some time.
The Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport) has already been grappling with the issue since earlier this year when it openly questioned the wisdom of allowing the development to proceed as proposed because of the restrictions imposed on Logan's airspace.
The developer of the proposed tower, Millenium Partners, purchased the Winthrop Square property from the City of Boston last year, submitting several iterations in height ranging from 725 to 775 feet. Massport has said that it prefers the lower height, but at this time the higher range is the current working proposal.
The Somerville Board of Alderman's resolution was sponsored and approved by the full Board.
As a Board member who has placed particular focus on the air traffic noise pollution issue, Alderman At-Large Mary Jo Rossetti was especially emphatic in her remarks on the matter. “We've been receiving multiple communications again over the summer as it related to the annoyance of the air traffic volume, and that's an ongoing issue,” Rossetti told the Board. “What we have unfortunately learned is that in the Boston Common area there is a potential for this 775 foot building to be constructed.”
Rossetti indicated that she immediately spoke with the City of Somerville administration when it came to her attention and they were taken aback and communicated with the state delegation.
“If this building is constructed the noise we're having now will increase dramatically, because the flights will now be positioned to go more in our direction, more than we're already dealing with,” Rossetti said.
The alderman reported that on the very day of the Board meeting she received three “very angry” emails from neighbors who have had it.
“It's very concerning that Boston pretty much has the authority, as I understand it, to go ahead and build it because legislation was already adopted,” Rossetti said. “And it kind of slipped through, quite honestly, from what I understand.”
Board President William A. White Jr. shared his understanding of the matter saying, “There was legislation that basically prohibited certain shadowing on the Boston Common and the Baker administration, because this was going to be such a good project for the City of Boston, basically shepherded that through so the shadowing restriction was eliminated.”
White went on to point out that there is still an issue about the building's height and its intrusion into the airspace and whether the FAA can assert veto authority over it or not. “That is the question nobody has given a firm opinion on,” said White. “There are some people who don't believe the FAA can, even though they do have control over the airspace, and there are others who say that the FAA does.”
In a pointedly tongue-in-cheek analogy, White said that in his view, if the FAA does not, in fact, have jurisdiction then what the City of Somerville should do is “get together with the City of Chelsea, find one of our developers here and have them build a thousand foot building in Chelsea, right in front of the runway, so that we won't have any planes ever going over the City of Somerville.”
“So if that's a possibility, it seems rather strange that communities will be able to block runways by building buildings, said White. “So I would think perhaps the FAA has jurisdiction over it.”
A conference call between city and state officials, along with legal experts was planned as a follow up, and the Board's resolution was duly approved.
Rexnord Corp. has posted layoff notices inside its Indianapolis ball bearings factory where the company is stopping production so it can be done more cheaply in Mexico.
Rexnord has planned to lay off its 300 workers at the plant since last year, but President Donald Trump, who has said repeatedly he would stop American firms from shifting production abroad, criticized Rexnord's plans in a tweet that raised expectations he might intervene.
“Evidently, Rexnord must not have read that,” said Chuck Jones, president of the United Steelworkers Local 1999, which represents workers at the closing factory.
The Local 1999 also represents workers at Carrier Corp.'s furnace factory about a mile from the Rexnord plant. In November, Trump did manage to strike a deal with Carrier's parent company, United Technologies, to make the company cancel its plan to close the Carrier plant. Hundreds of Carrier workers will still be laid off later this year.
Trump made saving jobs for blue collar workers a centerpiece of his successful campaign. The U.S. economy has added manufacturing jobs in recent months, according to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, though manufacturing employment is still way down from its highs of decades ago. As Trump has complained, free trade agreements have made it profitable for companies to shift production to countries with cheaper labor.
The Rexnord layoff notices affect 23 assembly workers and will start in the next two weeks, according to Jones. Though their jobs are ending, he said some people might stay on at the plant to help with winding down operations.
In a Tuesday statement, Rexnord said most layoffs would occur from April through June and that the union would get more updates on timing. Some workers are getting extra pay to train their replacements.
“We deeply appreciate every associate's contributions to the company and understand the impact this difficult decision is having on our associates and their families,” a Rexnord spokesperson said. “We will continue to provide support and transition services to assist associates throughout the process.”
The company's plant closure agreement with the union stipulates that workers have to stay on the job until the plant is closed in order to get their severance payments. Jones said the company has not allowed any exceptions for employees who get job offers in the meantime.
“I knew up front that they're a bunch of dirty sons of bitches because they're leaving because of greed,” Jones said, “but do they not have any shame at all?”
A White House spokesperson said President Trump still wants to stop factories from closing.
A San Diego college student detained for several days in a county detention facility cell is seeking an attorney and may be considering filing a civil lawsuit sources tell NBCSanDiego.
The 24-year old UCSD engineering student was left in the cell for five days without food or water, seemingly forgotten by the federal authorities who detained him.
He was one of seven people detained after a Drug Enforcement Administration ecstasy raid in University City on April 21, according to a DEA statement.
"The individual was at the house by his own admission," the DEA confirmed Monday.
Student "Forgotten" in Custody Mulls Suit
A 24-year old UCSD student was left in the cell for five days without food or water, seemingly forgotten by the federal authorities who detained him. Local defense attorney Gretchen Von Helms talks with NBC 7's Tony Shin in this report. (Published Tuesday, May 1, 2012)
During the raid, authorities confiscated ecstasy, marijuana, prescription medication, hallucinogenic mushrooms, and a white powdery substance that was described as a synthetic hallucinogen. They also seized numerous weapons including a Russian rifle, handguns and thousands of rounds of ammunition.
"Seven suspects were brought back to county detention." One was released, but "accidentally left in one of the cells," a statement from the DEA read.
The defendants were brought back to the DEA office after the raid and processed. The suspects were moved around the five cells at the detention facility during the proceeding. None were strip or body cavity searched, the DEA stated.
Detainee Forgotten at DEA Office Law Enforcement
The San Diego Drug Enforcement Administration is now investigating a 24-year-old student who was detained for several days, possibly without food and water. Rory Devine reports. (Published Monday, April 30, 2012)
A law enforcement source told NBC 7 that the student was handcuffed and held in a room no larger than the average bathroom.
Sources say a worker at the DEA discovered the man by chance about five days later after hearing strange noises coming from the holding cells.
When authorities with the DEA discovered that the student was still in the cell, they immediately called emergency medical services.
In the cell, the detainee told authorities he found a white powdery substance, which he took, the statement said.
Later testing revealed the substance was methamphetamine.
Sources close to the student say he nearly died of kidney failure in Sharp hospital due to the dehydration he experienced. He was treated for several days and released.
He is not currently under arrest, authorities with the DEA said.
San Diego defense attorney Gretchen Von Helms says the victim could get millions if he files a lawsuit.
"In all my years of practice I've never heard of the DEA or any Federal government employee simply forgetting about someone that they have in their care," she said.
"There has to be repercussions if people do not follow the safety and the care when they have a human being in their custody."
Former federal prosecutor John Kirby said he's familiar with the holding cells at the DEA office. He told NBC 7 San Diego that the rooms have no bathrooms and the suspect likely went without food or water.
Given his familiarity with the DEA, Kirby said this incident is “inconceivable” because every detainee is processed, and it would be hard to get lost in the shuffle.
“You talk about whether they might have done it intentionally, No way because somebody's career is done over this,” added Kirby.

Media playback is not supported on this device Highlights: Netherlands crowned European champions
The Netherlands won their first major women's international tournament after a thrilling victory over Denmark in the Euro 2017 final on home soil.
Denmark led through Nadia Nadim's early penalty but the Dutch soon levelled as Arsenal's Vivianne Miedema tucked in.
Lieke Martens put the hosts ahead with a precise 20-yard finish, but Denmark's Pernille Harder slotted in to equalise.
Dutch captain Sherida Spitse blasted in a free-kick to make it 3-2, and Miedema sealed a historic triumph late on.
Surprise finalists Denmark had pushed for another equaliser late on, as Sanne Troelsgaard went close with a swerving half-volley which dipped past the right-hand post.
But the Dutch, backed by the majority of a sold-out 28,182 crowd in Enschede, never looked in serious danger of conceding again and put the game beyond the Danes when Miedema scored the fourth.
It sparked a party atmosphere inside the FC Twente Stadion where virtually every home supporter was wearing the national team colour of orange.
An emotional Miedema appeared to be in tears in the final few seconds of the match, before the stadium erupted when the final whistle was blown.
No stopping the Netherlands
The Netherlands had never reached the final of a major tournament, with their previous best performance coming when they reached the semi-finals of the 2009 European Championships.
They were not among the pre-tournament favourites, but once France and holders Germany - who were going for a sixth successive title - had been eliminated, they built on the momentum created with the support of their fans.
The Dutch had won all of their games at the tournament leading up to the final, conceding just once in five matches, and beating England in the last four.
Watched by Dutch football legends Marco van Basten and Louis van Gaal in the stands, the home side produced a professional display to fight back against a Denmark team they had already beaten 1-0 in the group stage.
After going behind, the Netherlands started to find their rhythm midway through the first half and eventually showed their superiority.
Martens named the best player as Taylor finishes top scorer
The Netherlands won all six of their matches at Women's Euro 2017
The Netherlands are only the fourth different nation to win the women's European Championships, after Germany's 22-year reign ended.
Joint-captains Spitse and Reading's Mandy van den Berg, who came on as a substitute in the closing stages, lifted the trophy amid joyous celebrations for the host nation.
It was not the only prize won by the Dutch, with Barcelona winger Martens being presented with the official Player of the Tournament award after a series of dazzling displays on the left flank.
However, the Golden Boot was won by England's Jodie Taylor.
Arsenal's Taylor finished as the tournament's top scorer with five goals, although Arsenal striker Miedema could have levelled by scoring a hat-trick against the Danes.
Analysis - 'Dutch are a pleasure to watch'
Rachel Brown-Finnis, ex-England goalkeeper:
This is the perfect ending, having the hosts win it, after they created so much momentum with their fans watching them.
They've been absolutely stunning. The way that they play the game is with so much energy, so much enthusiasm and so much interaction with the crowd.
The speed and the power, and the way they flood players forward, with the quality of the likes of Jackie Groenen, Miedema, Danielle Van de Donk, Martens - the list goes on.
They have been a pleasure to watch and they are deserved champions.
Player of the Match - Miedema
Vivianne Miedema netted four times in the three knockout rounds
Denmark captain Harder worked tirelessly and was a constant threat but, with two clinically-finished goals, imaginative movement and some world-class hold-up play, new Arsenal signing Miedema was the deserved Player of the Match, scoring for the third game in a row.
The former Bayern Munich star would have had a hat-trick to savour, but for Danish keeper Stina Lykke Petersen's magnificent reflex save to keep out her far-post volley in the second half.
What they said
"It was an open match," Netherlands coach Sarina Wiegman said. "There were two teams who really wanted to play football.
"A match with six goals, that's very important for women's football as well."
Striker Miedema added: "We've played six amazing games and today we showed that even if we get behind in a game we can still change the game.
"The moment we scored for 3-2, I just thought 'it's not going to go wrong again'.
"We played so much better in the second half and we deserved to win the tournament."
Denmark boss Nils Nielsen said: "The Dutch team was the best team in the tournament.
"It's not easy to play at home. It's so easy to disappoint everybody, but they didn't, they performed so well.
"I am very, very proud of my own team. We have had so many problems and they kept fighting right until the end."

Design Demonstrations July to October 2017
Experience Jasper Avenue Design Demonstration
About the Project
The Experience Jasper Avenue Design Demo was an opportunity to try out the new plan and design for the avenue, from 109 Street to 124 Street, that was developed during the Imagine Jasper Avenue project. It used a combination of public and stakeholder feedback, City policies and procedures, and technical studies and standards to develop the new design.
A number of changes to the current design of the avenue are planned in order to truly make Jasper Avenue into a main street. These changes include features that rebalance the space on the avenue to a pedestrian priority, while accommodating all other travel modes. They also support the dual function of a main street as a destination and link.
During the design demo, the current outside peak hour bus/off peak hour parking lanes were closed to vehicle traffic via barriers. The space from these lanes was instead used to create additional public space in the form of ‘flex space'.
Flex space is a brand-new design zone for streets designated as main streets. Jasper Avenue is the first official main street in Edmonton that has been designed using the Main Streets Guideline and is the first to implement flex space.
Flex space can be used for a variety of purposes in different seasons, such as patios, bike corrals, performance spaces, street sales and any number of other flexible uses. The use of flex spaces are dependant on local businesses and the community to plan how the spaces should be used and activated. The default of the flex space will be on-street parking, which can be easily reallocated to spaces for people rather than cars, as demand arises.
Other features of the new Jasper Avenue plan that were a part of the design demo include:
Public animation stations and parklets
Curb extensions at intersections
Pedestrian crossings at every intersection
Street furnishing and resting areas
trees and landscaping
On This Day
Monday 7th March 1932

The Communist Party of America organized the "March on Hunger"; the procession traveled from downtown Detroit to the Ford Motor Company's River Rouge Plant in order to protest the company's labour record. When police and firemen were unable to disperse the thousands gathered at River Rouge, Ford strongman Harry Bennet, notorious for his mob tactics of labor management, ordered his "servicemen" to quell the crowd with fire hoses. Defying the freezing temperatures and icy water, the crowd refused to give up its protest. Bennet, who ruled Ford's enterprise with nothing short of terrorist tactics, confronted the crowd, ordering them to disperse once and for all. The determined crowd, unaware that they were faced with their nemesis, began to shout, "We want Bennet. And he's in that building." Bennett corrected their mistake, and for his trouble he was showered with bricks and slag pieces. He was struck in the head during the barrage. Before he fell to the ground, the combat-ready Bennett pulled Joseph York, a Young Communist League organizer, to the ground on top of him. Seeing Bennett bleeding profusely from his head, the police opened fire on the unarmed protesters. York and three other protesters were killed. Ford's trouble with labor unions came to a head five years later when Roosevelt's New Deal guaranteed the workers the right to join a union. Again Bennett would be at the center of a violent confrontation at the River Rouge complex.
A poll conducted by Emerson College shows voters see the Trump administration as more truthful than media.
A majority of registered voters, 53 percent, said the media are untruthful, while 39 percent said they were untruthful.
When it came to the Trump administration, 49 percent said they were truthful, while 48 percent said they were untruthful.
“The partisan split on this topic is clear,” said Professor Spencer Kimball in a press release on Tuesday:
89 percent of Republicans find the Trump administration truthful, versus 77 percent of Democrats who find the administration untruthful. Conversely, 69 percent of Democrats find the news media truthful, while a whopping 91 percent of Republicans consider them untruthful. Independents consider both untruthful – the Trump administration by a margin of 42 percent/52 percent and the news media by a margin of 45 percent/47 percent.
That means nearly a third of Democrats, or 31 percent, find the media untruthful. Trump has overwhelming support from Republicans, and deep skepticism about media makes independents and a significant portion of Democrats lean his way.
Pollsters questioned 617 registered voters from Feb. 5 to Feb. 6 with a margin of error of 3.9 percentage points.

A protest has marred the first day of school for young refugees in Greece, with some 1,500 children getting education under a nationwide programme.
In Profitis, north of Thessaloniki, a small number of parents chained up the school gate in protest, waving Greek flags, the AFP news agency reported.
Around 100 police officers formed a corridor to escort 40 "puzzled-looking" refugee children inside, it said.
In other schools, the new pupils were welcomed without incident.
"Our children will be raped and then, who will take responsibility?" AFP quoted one Greek parent at the protest as saying.
Image copyright AP Image caption Migrant children will attend classes in the afternoon, learning Greek and other subjects
The Greek education minister, Nikos Filis, said the demonstration was an isolated incident. A statement from the ministry said the welcome in other schools was "enthusiastic".
The 1,500 or so pupils who started at 20 schools on Monday are part of a national education programme for migrant children. They received books and school bags before arriving at schools in the afternoon.

The pupils will receive lessons in a number of subjects, including the Greek language, during four-hour days after the local schoolchildren finish for the day.
The project is also running in six migrant camps.
Authorities plan to expand the project across the country in the coming weeks.
The UN refugee agency estimates that more than 160,000 people have arrived in Greece across the Mediterranean Sea this year, 28% of whom are children.

LAS VEGAS -- A new push is getting going to extend the Las Vegas Monorail farther than just up and down behind Strip hotels.
Right now, it stretches four miles, connecting riders to the back of some of the most well-known hotels in the world.
Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman is once again throwing her support behind the original idea to have the monorail go to McCarran International Airport. The Las Vegas Monorail carries millions of passengers each year, and Goodman knows its start could have been better.
"The monorail has been very controversial since it was built. How it was funded, how it was started, and why it didn't go to the airport." Goodman said.
Goodman threw the city's support behind an airport connection at Tuesday's Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority board meeting.
"I am a big proponent because we can do it now in this lifetime in the next four or five years," Goodman said.
Goodman would like to see the monorail extended even more, she says hopefully using private funding.
"We need it to go from the airport. We need to bring it downtown," the mayor said.
The Las Vegas Monorail company runs the only privately-funded public transportation system in the U.S but an expansion won't happen overnight.
"It has to be community-based. It has to be supported by the community and wanted by the community," vice president and chief marketing officer for the monorail Ingrid Reisman said.
Tourists generally support the idea.
"It is a lot easier than trying to wait for a shuttle or taxi," Ian Baum, who is visiting from New Hampshire, said.
"It'd be handy," Alistair McGechen, visiting from Canada, said.
Transportation strategist Tom Skancke says southern Nevada also needs to address transportation infrastructure needs not only around the Strip, but around the valley.
Reducing congestion and improving mobility, he says, is a must.
"We got to think bigger. We got to find the necessary funding, and we need to do more. at the end of the day, our community could start losing out," Skancke said.
It all could start with growing the monorail, but for this project to take off, southern Nevada must be on board.
The project would take about 40 months to complete. Enticing new private investors to put money into an airport extension will be the hard part. At least 80 percent of the investors on the original $650 million monorail bond suffered a big loss.
The major rating services stopped issuing ratings for the monorail after it hit junk bond status during the 2010 bankruptcy. In October, Fitch called it a risky investment.
Major Metro track work hits riders on all but the Green and Silver lines this weekend. Among the effects: no rail service to or from Reagan National Airport.
WASHINGTON — Major Metro track work hits riders on all but the Green and Silver lines this weekend.
In Virginia, the Blue and Yellow lines are shut down Saturday and Sunday between Pentagon City and Braddock Road. That means no rail service to or from Reagan National Airport.
In the District, a Red Line work zone near Rhode Island Avenue reduces scheduled service along the entire line to every 24 minutes all weekend.
In Maryland, single-tracking on the Orange Line between Cheverly and New Carrollton reduces scheduled service to every 20 minutes.
Blue and Yellow line shutdown
Crystal City and Reagan National Airport rail stations are closed Saturday and Sunday.
Free shuttle buses are scheduled to run between Pentagon City, Crystal City, the airport and Braddock Road stations. Metro suggests riders expect to add 15 minutes to their trips for each stop on the shuttle.
Regular Metroway and other Metro, ART or DASH bus service may be faster for some riders.
Between Pentagon City and Mt. Vernon Square or Largo Town Center, trains are scheduled every 12 to 15 minutes this weekend on each of the Blue and Yellow lines. From Braddock Road south, trains are scheduled every 15 minutes on each line.
Due to the work on the crumbling platform at the airport and to install communications cables along the closed stretch of tracks, the last Blue and Yellow Line trains are scheduled to leave all stations between Franconia-Springfield or Huntington and King Street 30 minutes earlier than usual Saturday and Sunday.
On the Blue Line, that means the last train is scheduled to leave Franconia-Springfield at 11:56 p.m. Saturday and at 9:56 p.m. Sunday.
On the Yellow Line, the last train is scheduled to leave Huntington at 11:55 p.m. Saturday and 9:55 p.m. Sunday (Metro now runs until 1 a.m. Fridays and Saturdays and runs 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Sundays).
The last trains are scheduled to leave stations north of Pentagon City at the usual times.
Dulles Toll Road detour Friday night for Silver Line work
From 10 p.m. Friday until 6 a.m. Saturday, drivers on the westbound Dulles Toll Road are scheduled to be detoured onto Reston Parkway (Route 602).
After turning south on the parkway, west on Sunrise Valley Drive, and north on the Fairfax County Parkway, drivers will return to the toll road. The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority said drivers would not have to pay an additional toll.
The Dulles Access Highway will remain open during the installation of a pedestrian bridge to what will become the Silver Line's Reston Town Center station.

An attack on the Chinese artist's installation in Miami has been condemned as an act of vandalism. Why is smashing art only acceptable if an acclaimed global artist does it?
A "protest" at a Miami art museum raises some questions about what exactly art is, now.
On Sunday, a man called Maximo Caminero has smashed an artwork by Ai Weiwei, one of the most famous artists of this century and a hero to many for his defiance of the Chinese state. Cue appalled face. But this is not such a simple story. Caminero's proclaimed motive – that the Perez Museum in Miami should be showing local, not global, art – is pretty daft (I didn't know they had Ukip in Florida), but he has accidentally punched a massive hole in the logic of contemporary art.
For the "vase" that was smashed is actually a Han dynasty urn that Ai Weiwei "appropriated" for his own art by painting on it. The Han era in China was contemporary with the Roman Empire in the west. In other words, this is a major antiquity made by a Chinese artisan roughly 2,000 years ago. But that's not why the urn is valued at $1m or why its destruction is world news.
No – it's because it was part of an installation by Ai Weiwei. It is the Ai Weiwei artwork, not the Han dynasty object, that is being mourned. Perhaps it is not really an antique at all. If it's a fake, that makes the entire installation more likable. If it's not a fake, then surely Ai Weiwei, and not Caminero, is the vandal who ruined a whole bunch of antiquities by painting them whimsical colours?
I certainly would love to believe that Ai Weiwei only uses fake Han urns. I mean, why would he actually wreck real ones?
In the exhibition Ai Weiwei: According to What?, at which the vase was smashed, an array of repainted "Han urns" are shown in front of a sequence of black-and-white photographs of the artist smashing one.
This artwork is called Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn and for me it is Ai Weiwei's most provocative gesture. I feel highly provoked. It shows the artist letting go of an elegant object made with intelligence, imagination and love more than 2,000 years ago and letting it smash to bits on the ground.
Much as I wish there were, there is no apparent doubt about the authenticity of the Han artefacts Ai Weiwei uses in his art. He bought a batch of them in the 1990s and started by painting them before creating his photographed performance Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn in 1995.
What does his attack on Han art mean? I must admit I'm confused. I want to see it as a devastating satire on the modern world's alienation from the past. Ever since the Chinese Revolution began in the early 20th century, political and economic ruptures have cut off China in particular from its ancient culture. Is Ai Weiwei parodying that? Or is he mocking western art-lovers who think all Chinese art is ancient (as they may have, back in 1995)?
Ai Weiwei certainly does capture the industrial world's disconnection from making, our loss of crafts and even of basic respect for them. But he also embodies these cynical attitudes as he smashes that lovely old vase. He seems to invite further violence to art – even his own.
For this is not the first time an Ai Weiwei appropriation of a Han urn has been smashed. In 2012, art collector Uli Sigg was filmed smashing an urn in emulation of Ai Weiwei – except the one he smashed was one of Ai Weiwei's most famous works, Coca-Cola Urn. Since Uli Sigg owned it, he was free to do so.
So – smashing art is interesting if an acclaimed global artist does it, and even if an art collector does it. But the guy who walks into a museum and smashes it is a vandal.
Could it be that smashing masterpieces is never interesting? That this illegal attack on art exposes the shallowness of the high end of contemporary art, where it's cool to smash Han antiquities or doodle on Goya prints?
Ai Weiwei is courageous and eloquent but this incident and his response – for he has condemned the vandal – make me wonder about the rules of art right now. The reasons for condemning one destructive act and celebrating another don't seem clear. Suddenly, the world's most respected artist looks a bit conceptually fragile.
"500 Bags of Summer" (Photo by Mark Sebastian via the Creative Commons on Flickr)
I have bad news for you, if you were hoping to reenact your favorite scenes from (500) Days of Summer that take place on top of Angel's Knoll: you'll no longer be able to share a tender moment with someone special (or tell your ex the brutal truth that he was never good enough for you) on the park's iconic bench.
Access to Angel's Knoll and the bench inside has been blocked off by a gate since July 30, and The Downtown News has a recent article explaining why (h/t Curbed LA).
Angel's Knoll was always supposed to be a temporary park, but it sounds like its demise was hastened by the death of the state's redevelopment agencies and complaints from neighbors. That strip of land was set aside for skyscrapers that never ended up materializing thanks to a bum market for office space—and to this day there still aren't any concrete plans for developing it.
The Community Redevelopment Agency that owned the land passed it on to a "successor agency," and that agency says that lately they've been getting an increase in complaints about trash, litter and loitering at the park. They decided to just fence the whole thing off in order to "enable the asset's value to be maintained." The plan temporarily backfired: someone forgot to empty the trash cans inside the park. The first fence put up didn't have a gate, so the trash sat there long enough for an infestation of rats to find it. Whoops.
You can still hit up Angel's Flight and the neighboring stairwell.
Lambdas can be made to play nicely with C callbacks.
Many C APIs have callback arguments in the form of function pointers.
Consider:
void nifty_thing_doer ( void ( * callback )( int ));
In the first post in this series we saw that captureless lambdas can automatically convert to function pointers. Thus, we can easily pass nifty_thing_doer() a captureless lambda like so:
:: nifty_thing_doer ([]( int i ){ /* admire i */ });
However, lambdas with non-empty capture lists are not convertible to function pointers and thus cannot be inserted as such.
:: nifty_thing_doer ([ & ]( int i ){ /* admire i */ }); // :-( //> error: cannot convert '<lambda(int)>' to 'void (*)(int)'
So what is one to do if said callback needs to capture state?
(I am assuming here that we cannot change the API that we are using itself).
📞
User Data
Fortunately, C-style callback APIs typically accept an additional callback argument of type void* user_data :
void nifty_thing_doer2 ( void ( * callback )( int , void * user_data ), void * user_data ) { //... callback ( nifty_i , user_data ); }
If we want to pass extra variables to the callback, we cannot do it via the capture list. Instead, we can do it via the opaque user_data pointer.
Here's one C++11-ish way of doing it:
void f () { // local variables int x = 0 ; float y = 1 ; // locally defined uncopyable, unmovable type struct MtEverest { MtEverest () = default ; MtEverest ( const MtEverest & that ) = delete ; // no copy MtEverest ( const MtEverest && that ) = delete ; // no move } mt_everest ; // create "user-data" payload auto payload = std :: tie ( x , y , mt_everest ); :: nifty_thing_doer2 ([]( int i , void * userdata ) { auto & payload_tup = * reinterpret_cast < decltype ( payload ) *> ( userdata ); auto & xx = std :: get < 0 > ( payload_tup ); auto & yy = std :: get < 1 > ( payload_tup ); auto & me = std :: get < 2 > ( payload_tup ); /* admire i */ }, & payload ); // <<= Pass the payload }
Here, std::tie is used to create a tuple of references to the local variables. This also means that we can bind uncopyable, unmovable types like MtEverest .
In the second post in the series, we saw that there are multiple entities that can be accessed from a captureless lambda, and that these are governed by the so called ODR-use rule.
Inside our lambda we need to cast the type-erased user_data to our payload type. Although we do not capture payload (this is a captureless lambda), we can still use it within a non-ODR-use such as in decltype(payload) to get the correct type of our tuple. From there all that is left to do is create handy aliases for the tuple elements.
With C++17 Structured Bindings (a.k.a. destructuring) we might be able to write something like this: auto & payload_tup = * reinterpret_cast < decltype ( payload ) *> ( userdata ); auto & [ xx , yy , me ] = payload_tup ; or maybe even: auto & [ xx , yy , me ] = * reinterpret_cast < decltype ( payload ) *> ( userdata ); I have not tried this, so if not, illuminate me.
CAVEAT: In this example, we are passing references to local variables to the callback. This is only valid if the callback will always be called within the lifetime of the referenced variables. If the callback might be called after the termination of our function or e.g. asynchronously do not bind references. This is a general rule with references.
This cool Bannalia blog post shows another way of passing capturing lambdas to a callback by passing the capturing lambda itself as the user_data and another captureless lambda thunk for the conversion.
📞
Statics and Globals
But what are you going to do when your callback API does not support void* user_data , and you still need to pass state variables to your callback?
In this case we are left with globals and their static cousins. Any function, including captureless lambdas can access and use global variables without capturing them. The same goes for static members of class types.
We could use globals to store pointers to our internal state but that messes up the code, polluting the global namespace, increasing the chance for collisions, increases coupling and all the rest of the reasons not to use globals.
This leaves static members.
What we'd like to do is to somehow create localized types with static members that can be set to allow us to inject state into a captureless lambda.
namespace // anonymous namespace, everything stays in the translation unit { template < typename T > struct payload_injector { static T val ; }; template < typename T > T payload_injector < T >:: val ; // static variable definition for linker } int main () { // local variables as before... // create payload as before auto payload = std :: tie ( x , y , mt_everest ); // declare/instantiate new payload injector type using payload_ptr_t = payload_injector < decltype ( payload ) *> ; // ptr to payload type #1 payload_ptr_t :: val = & payload ; // set the injector val to ref the local payload #2 :: nifty_thing_doer ([]( int i ) // << captureless lambda { auto & payload_tup = * payload_ptr_t :: val ; // << type not even erased #3 auto & xx = std :: get < 0 > ( payload_tup ); auto & yy = std :: get < 1 > ( payload_tup ); auto & me = std :: get < 2 > ( payload_tup ); /* admire i */ }); }
The payload_injector<> template has a static member of type T , it along with its static member val are defined inside an anonymous namespace so that there are no ODR-violations with other translation units for this static variable when the template is instantiated.
When we need to inject some state through a static we instantiate the template type (#1), and set the static value to our desired value (#2). In our case we are taking a pointer to the payload type.
Essentially, payload_ptr_t::val is just like user_data above, except:
It does not have to be passed as a function parameter; It is not type-erased
Inside our captureless lambda, we can directly retrieve the payload without even needing the reinterpret_cast<> (#3)!
CAVEAT: If payload_injector<> is ever instantiated with the same type for T , e.g. from different calling sites, there will be only one payload_injector<>::val defined. This might lead to collisions in certain situations. More on why this isn't necessarily an issue in a moment.
Coming Full Circle
Now that we have the payload_injector<> facility, we can do even better!
Why go to all the trouble with creating payload with std::tie at all and pass that around?
auto my_callback = [ & ]( int i ) // the capturing callback we wanted all along { auto z = x + y ; // use x, y, and mt_everest as desired // continue to admire i ... }; // declare/instantiate new payload injector type using payload_ptr_t = payload_injector < decltype ( my_callback ) *> ; // ptr to my_callback payload_ptr_t :: val = & my_callback ; :: nifty_thing_doer ([]( int i ) { // trivial thunk just calls lambda ( * payload_ptr_t :: val )( i ); });
Now isn't that cool?
Instead of injecting the variable bundle into the captureless lambda, something that requires updating as the lambda changes, we can just create a capturing lambda and inject that lambda object itself into a simple captureless “thunk” lambda that simply calls it!
This approach is also superior to the above one since lambdas always have unique types, so there can never be collisions for the static variable payload_injector<>::val as each instantiated template has its own type.
Loose Ends
Even if we prefer to use the first approach and inject a tuple, we could extend payload_injector with a tag type template parameter or a non-type template parameter and pass that the current line or some other local unique tag to avoid collisions.
However, even that does not necessarily solve the collision problem since multithreaded code might have the same lambda running asynchronously on multiple threads. All these runs will try to modify and use the same static variable and may cause severe havoc. This is the usual caveat with using static variable and members in multithreaded code.
But, C++11 gives us thread_local so that each thread will actually use its own copy of the static variable:
namespace // annonymous namespace { template < typename T > struct payload_injector { thread_local static T val ; }; template < typename T > thread_local T payload_injector < T >:: val ; }
To summarize, how do we create per-lambda “static” state?
Use anonymous namespace to prevent link-level ODR-violations across translation units
Each .cpp will get its own copy of the static variable. Use thread_local instead of static so that each thread gets its own copy of the variable. By passing the lambdas themselves, each lambda gets its own template type instantiation and thus its own variable.
As usual, comments are most welcomed!

The black sports bra and matching leggings that Under Armour began selling Monday don't look particularly distinctive from the rest of the workout attire on its website.
But, in fact, the garments are different in a key way: They were made in the United States, marking a key milestone in the company's ambitious bid to significantly rethink its manufacturing strategy.
They are the first batch of clothing to be made at UA Lighthouse, a sprawling Under Armour facility that opened this summer in Baltimore. A 35,000-square-foot design and product development hub, it is an anchor of Under Armour's attempt to figure out how to make clothing in the United States — an unusual venture in an industry where manufacturing has largely been done overseas for a generation. About 97 percent of clothing sold in the United States is imported, according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association.
Just 2,000 of the garments are available for sale — 1,000 each of the bras and leggings — so it's a small-scale start. But the process of creating them offers a look at what the future of Under Armour — and the wider apparel industry, for that matter — might look like. The company says that it was able to operate on a sharply shorter timeline for bringing the gear to market, and it says it believes the Lighthouse setup is cost neutral compared to making clothing overseas.
With President Trump talking frequently of finding ways to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, Under Armour's experiment might end up drawing particularly close observation from retailers and Washington alike to see if it can be a blueprint for similar initiatives.
Kevin Haley, Under Armour's president of innovation, said that the process for creating garments such as the bra and leggings would typically take 18 to 20 months. For the Baltimore-made pieces, though, it took just three months.
Haley said that's because the Lighthouse setup has enabled the company to compress the creation process in several ways. Perhaps most important, when designers and manufacturers are in the same building instead of on different continents, they can combine their contributions to the supply chain into a single step.
“The designer is sitting in the Lighthouse facility with the person who's actually going to perform the operations to assemble that garment,” Haley said. “So the person who's actually going to be putting it together is effectively going to be teaching the designer, ‘Look, here's how to simplify this design and do it more efficiently.' ”

Haley also said that the technology in the Baltimore facility has enabled speedier garment production. By using 3D body scanners, Under Armour can figure out how a certain piece of clothing is going to fit and flatter a body without going the traditional route of producing a physical prototype.
The company also hopes this setup will generally enable it to work in a more iterative way on clothing, allowing the team to fine-tune pieces after they've started to hit stores. In the future, Under Armour might ship out a small batch of clothes from Lighthouse and see how customers react to the gear before making tens of thousands of pieces of it. If shoppers, for example, say that a waistband is fitting a little snugly on a pair of shorts, they could tweak that for a bigger production run of that item. And being able to adapt to that feedback in real time could be powerful: It could be the difference between selling thousands of those shorts at full price, or having to mark them all down because shoppers were just lukewarm about them.
Here's why it matters that making clothes in Baltimore could shave time off Under Armour's speed-to-market process: because doing so has become something of a holy grail in the retail world. Because of social media, live-streamed runway shows and other cultural changes, fashion trends go boom and bust faster than ever before.
You might be tempted to think these tectonic shifts mostly matter for fashion companies and not for performance athletic brands such as Under Armour. But, in fact, exercise attire has become a deeply trend-driven business. Printed yoga pants, leggings with mesh paneling, workout tanks with strategically-placed cutouts: These popular looks are all riffs on what's happening on the catwalk.
“It enables us to effectively pull forward materials, fabrics, textiles, yarns that the consumer maybe wasn't going to see until 2018, 2019 — and bring that into 2017,” Haley said.
But speed-to-market wasn't the only reason Under Armour pursued U.S. manufacturing capabilities. The company has a lofty goal of contributing to a revitalization of Baltimore by creating jobs at Lighthouse and a planned roster of other facilities.
So what kind of labor force was needed to create these garments? After all, jobs going overseas is only part of the reason that the United States' manufacturing industry has contracted — many such positions have been lost to automation.
The company said some 50 people worked on this particular garment collection, including design, manufacturing, marketing and other roles. Haley said the headcount of workers needed to create the products in Baltimore was “not all that different” from if they were made abroad.
“It's not like these are being made by a robot,” Haley said. “These are being made by human beings using advanced manufacturing methods.”
Lighthouse staffers also work on Under Armour sneakers, though, and that manufacturing process is one for which the company has been working for years to reduce the number of workers and steps needed.
Some competitors, Haley said, “could have 300 pairs of hands touching every shoe that moves down the line. Which is at some level crazy, in 2017, to be introducing all that room for margin for error at each step along the way.”
Ultimately, Under Armour hopes that Lighthouse is a proof of concept for a bigger global initiative to embrace “local for local” manufacturing. In other words, Under Armour gear sold in Brazil would be made in Brazil; gear sold in the United States would be made in the United States, and so on.
The goal, Haley said, is to show that “if we can make it here, we can make it anywhere. And if we can make it here, anyone can make any product here.”

Canada's spanking laws are set for an overhaul as part of the Liberal government's promise to adopt all of the recommendations stemming from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
One of the 94 "calls to action" after the six-year inquiry into widespread abuse at residential schools for indigenous children was to repeal section 43 of the Criminal Code, which allows parents and teachers to discipline children with "reasonable" force.
"At this point, we cannot speculate on potential legislative or policy approaches to address this issue. However the government is committed to implementing all of the 94 calls to action," said Christian Girouard, spokesman for Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould.
The "spanking law" was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2004, but set guidelines outlining "reasonable limits" to the act. In that decision, the court ruled that reasonable corrective force can be used against children between the ages of two and 12 years old.
The TRC recommendation has revived a heated national debate on the issue.
Ry Moran, director of the National Research Centre for Truth and Reconciliation at the University of Manitoba, said in indigenous cultures, children are regarded as gifts "on loan" from the creator, and are to be supported and protected. That means physical punishment is deemed inappropriate.
"If we hit a child, we're hitting creation, and that's something that's just not on. That is something that is not a traditional teaching or a traditional practice," he said.
Moran said the commission likely foresaw the potential broader consequences for all Canadians.
"I would think they would have thought this would have implications and reverberations throughout society," he said. And I would think... that they were aware of the fact they were putting something out there that had a degree of controversy around it but probably felt this was a necessary and important change to reflect on and implement."
'Risk factor' with spanking
Kathy Lynn of Corinne's Quest, an organization campaigning to end physical punishment of children, told CBC News Network's Power & Politics that corporal punishment is a practice that is both outdated and unnecessary. She asked why, in 2015, we are still permitting the "legalized abuse" of children.
"It sends a message that in our country we believe children should be hurt. And most importantly, research shows that every time we hit a child there is a risk factor involved," she said.
But Diane Watt of REAL Women of Canada, which describes itself as a "pro-family conservative women's movement," insisted it's necessary to protect parents, teachers and children.
"We're talking about reasonable, moderate, corrective force to improve behaviour and prevent harm that children can cause to one; to put a child in a car seat or remove them from a harmful situation," she said.
- Ten people are in custody and an estimated $4 million worth of heroin is off the streets after a massive drug bust in southeast DC.
Police say their investigation shows profits and payments from the heroin sales were funneled through personal and commercial bank accounts. The heroin came from India and Africa made its way to cities and suburbs across the country—including the District.
Investigators say the bust happened along Benning Road SE. Ten people were arrested and four search warrants were served in the investigation. More than 80 pounds of heroin was seized, and it's worth millions.
.
“I'm not surprised,” said Laveita Vaughn, a southeast DC resident who has called Benning Road home for more than 20 years. “Because I've seen certain things and people do things that I walk away from it because I know it affects all of us, but I'd rather not be around it.”
Another southeast resident, Deborah Williams, said the bust is a start, even though most agree there's still a long way to go.
“There's a whole lot more that could be done,” Williams said. “A whole lot of things that should have been done a long time ago. It just seems like poor neighborhoods are forgotten these days.”
“You can bust them, but there's always going to be another person that's going to sell, it's like a continuous cycle,” Vaughn said. “There's always someone who is going to use and there's always someone who is going to sell because they need to use.”
In fact, most residents who spoke to FOX 5 Tuesday night said they weren't surprised by the bust, and to them, it's just part of everyday life. Police say they are working to develop a new normal for these residents.
Greetings all - welcome once more to another glimpse into the depths of my hobby workings - this week will be a fairly short update, as is often the case when I get stuck into working on a single project that requires more effort! I'll be teasing you a little more too with my next project!First things first though, this week's has mainly been about Sire Gabriel, the first Knight out of the manufactorum for my collection. The second will begin construction upon completion of this frame, but I figured it would be best to learn the lessons of building and painting my first knight before I embark on the second.As you can see from the picture above, he's coming on nicely, though I had to put a significant effort into the heraldry on the tilting plate. Here's a close up, that represents nearly an hour's work.First this involved quite a bit of searching for an appropriate image, then rationalising that into something I thought I could realistically paint (however much my painting has improved I am still most definitely not an artist able to draw and paint complex freehand stuff).I'm not convinced by the top wings in the lighter blue, so I'll be re-doing these into the darker colour using the light blue for highlights only.Thanks to the careful use of magnets as you can see, the tilting plate and heavy stubber (and meltagun) are all interchangeable, as are the top canopy weapons options. This week I promise I'll be concentrating on getting the other leg finished so that I can get it mounted to the base, as having used it a couple of times in this state in games, it's rather wobbly!In other hobby news, I built another honour guard model last night for the Dusk Knights, which brings me up to 4. This guy is the bearer of the Chapter Banner, and whilst I need to do a little green stuff work around the joint of the banner I'm pretty happy with how he has turned out so far - photos next week when hopefully I'll have the whole squad built to show you.Finally then the next teaser for my Horus Heresy project, following on from last week's selections.The legion I've chosen are not afraid of getting up close and personal, wielding blades of some description. There's also a connection with a previous faction I've collected in 40k, though not necessarily a direct link between them.Funds are starting to build for this project though now that my Dark Eldar are beginning to sell so expect to see a big reveal before Hero for a Day.Speaking of which, I have now got 10 confirmed attendees (though I'm still waiting for payment from some, hint hint) to this event, so if you fancy making a real difference by raising money for an awesome charity, and doing so by playing some 40k (ok, a lot of 40k) then get in touch and reserve your place - there are only 10 tickets left and I know some of those are likely to be spoken for very soon! More details here Among the attendees are Rob Hill and his Blood Angels from 30k plus 40k , Mike and his White Scars from St Andrews Wargaming and Alex and his Tau from From the Fang . The raffle on the day is looking awesome at the moment, look out for an announcement on that tomorrow, with more prizes to come (including some from overseas)!Till next time,TBE
A former Miss America hopes this is the year Missouri passes legislation to require health insurance plans to cover the diagnosis and treatment of eating disorders.
Miss America 2008 Kirsten Haglund has visited the Missouri Capitol once again, urging state lawmakers to pass legislation that would require insurance plans go farther to help people fighting eating disorders.
Senate legislation on the issue is awaiting attention by the full chamber, while a House bill has been heard by a committee that hasn't voted on it.
Haglund told lawmakers at the Capitol that she, herself survived a struggle with an eating disorder.
“The reason I'm here is to say that treatment works and we need to be able to offer people the full spectrum of care covered by insurance because the costs to treat eating disorders can just devastate families.”
Haglund says there is a wide gap between what treatment for eating disorders is covered and what is not.
“They'll cover like 5 days of care or 7 days of care and then [their insurance company drops] coverage, or a girl or guy will get to 85- or 90-percent of their ideal body weight and then they drop coverage,” says Haglund. “You put that person back out into real life and you've only treated the body. You haven't treated the mental component, the psychological component. That's where the real problem lies and a lot of insurers want to get out of full coverage.”
The bill in the Senate is SB 769 and in the House is HB 1493.
The most striking image from yesterday's Toronto mayoral election wasn't one of a cheering crowd at a victory rally or long lines of voters eager to cast a ballot: it was the map of the results showing how Toronto has remained geographically divided in terms of mayoral candidate support.
However, the map didn't paint the usual picture of a left-wing downtown pitted against the conservative suburbs that analysts often used to simplify explanations of Toronto politics. While Doug Ford did win Etobicoke and Scarborough, and Olivia Chow won wards encompassing her old federal constituency (Trinity-Spadina), John Tory did very well not only in the old city of Toronto, but large parts of North York, as well.
Margin of victory by each candidate
A darker shade indicates greater voter concentration
If Toronto's current electoral map doesn't reflect the simple downtown-suburban narrative, is there a better explanation for the voting patterns underlying last night's election? In order to gain some understanding of the statistical patterns behind the map, we can combine census data from the 2011 National Household Survey with the election results broken down by ward to figure out if any socio-demographic indicators were correlated with the levels of support for the leading mayoral candidates.
This approach is often called ecological analysis. While it cannot tell us anything about the behaviour of voters as individuals, ecological analysis can tell us if candidates performed consistently well in areas with specific demographic characteristics. To simplify matters, I'll use a measure of performance comparing the electoral success of candidates in wards with certain characteristics (for instance, wards with above average income) to that candidate's level of support city-wide. For example, if Candidate X won 10 per cent of the city-wide vote, but won 30 per cent in wards with above-average Segway use, I'd say that Candidate X performed well in areas with above-average Segway use (+20 per cent).
The Tory voter
The image of soon-to-be-Mayor John Tory as a wealthy businessman is well-suited to the areas of the city where he performed strongly on election day. Tory did particularly well in wards with above average incomes (+14 per cent) and higher levels of education (+11 per cent). Conversely, Tory performed less well in wards with higher than average proportions of first generation Canadians (-9 per cent).
The Ford voter
The demographic picture that people have for the traditional Ford voter ("Ford Nation") varies wildly. Some people see the Fords as having an ideologically conservative support base, angry about the 'war on the car' and possessing an unusual enthusiasm for subways, while others think Ford Nation is to be found in the suburban parts of Toronto added to the city during amalgamation. The data suggest a somewhat different story, with Doug Ford having performed well in wards with higher numbers of first-generation Canadians (+14 per cent), lower than average levels of education (+14 per cent) and higher than average levels of home ownership (+3 per cent, the best relative performance of all three main candidates when using this indicator).
The Chow voter
In contrast to the support bases of Ford and Tory, socio-demographic factors were less important to understanding where Olivia Chow performed well. For instance, in wards with higher than average income, Chow did almost as well as she did city-wide (-1 per cent), which is in stark contrast to John Tory's performance in these same wards (+14 per cent). The most important factors favouring Chow were wards with higher than average proportions of renters (+4 per cent) and wards with lower than average numbers of first generation Canadians (+5 per cent). However, Chow's inability to gain support from the Torontonians she might have been expected to do well with – namely, traditional progressive voters – ultimately caused her defeat.
What does this suggest?
These three brief socio-demographic portraits of patterns of electoral support for Tory, Ford and Chow paint a more nuanced picture of the Toronto electorate than one that simply declares that it is a battle between the suburbs and downtown. Instead, the patterns suggest that the divisions in Toronto politics are more related to a more classic political division between more powerful in-groups and less powerful out-groups. Wards with attributes generally associated with having political power (for instance, groups with higher incomes and more education) tended to vote for John Tory, while wards with fewer of these attributes (for example, areas with lower incomes, and more first-generation Canadians) supported Doug Ford.
These patterns don't make sense if we want to see the politics of Toronto as one that pits a progressive downtown against the conservative suburbs. These patterns make much more sense if we instead see support for the Fords as an expression of the frustrations of some Torontonians who might feel alienated from political power.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A deal that President Barack Obama struck with Republicans to extend tax cuts for nearly every working American and spur job growth sailed through the Senate on Wednesday.

The Senate passed the legislation 81 to 19, with Democrats and Republicans delivering a rare display of bipartisanship.
The drama now moves to the House of Representatives, where many of Obama's fellow Democrats strongly oppose the measure as favoring the wealthy and are still angry with him for cutting the deal with Republicans without them.
The House will start debate on the tax deal on Thursday, a senior Democratic aide said, and is likely to approve it.
The legislation would extend for two years the income tax cuts enacted under Republican former President George W. Bush, with Democrats backing off their earlier fervent opposition to extending the cuts for the richest Americans. The Bush-era cuts are due to expire at the end of 2010 unless Congress acts.
The measure also would prevent a spike in taxes on capital gains and dividends, renew long-term unemployment insurance, and provide new tax relief for students, working families and businesses.
House Democrats are becoming more resigned to passage of the $858 billion package. Experts predict that the measures will probably boost economic growth but add to the $1.3 trillion budget deficit, which has unsettled the bond market.
“At the end of the day I think we are going to have to pass a bill,” said liberal Democratic Representative Henry Waxman.
Most of the 255 House Democrats may oppose the overall tax package, but it is expected to be approved with overwhelming support among the chamber's 179 Republicans.
Obama called on the House to approve the bill “as soon as possible” to avoid tax increases across the board in January.
Many economists predict the tax package could add up to 1 percentage point to economic expansion next year, due partly to a one-year cut in the payroll tax and removal of uncertainty about taxes in general.
Obama's position on taxes marked a huge shift in the debate from earlier this year when he and his fellow Democrats fought against renewing tax reductions for the wealthiest Americans — those with household incomes above $250,000 — while supporting continuation of the cuts for middle-class taxpayers.
At the time, they said that with budget deficits at record levels, the United States could not afford to give the tax breaks to the wealthiest.
But with Republicans drawing a line in the sand on the issue and scoring major victories in November 2 congressional elections — taking control of the House and making gains in the Senate — Obama acquiesced on tax cuts for upper-income Americans.
Democrats did win their desired extension of unemployment benefits that were expiring for millions of people shut out of jobs in the lackluster economy.
BUSINESS MEETING
In a parallel effort to get growth going, Obama met with top company CEOs and prodded them to dip into corporate cash piles to increase investment and U.S. hiring.
Worries about the tax bill's potential impact on the federal deficit prompted a two-day sell-off of U.S. Treasury bonds last week. On Wednesday treasuries prices fell as traders remained uncertain whether the selling pressure that has roiled the market in recent weeks has neared an end.
The measure passed by the Senate leaves out renewal of a popular bond program expiring this month, Build America Bonds, which funds infrastructure projects, favored by Democrats, cities and investors. It leaves intact an ethanol tax credit, thwarting efforts by some lawmakers to weaken it.
Particularly irksome to Democrats is a provision raising the exemption threshold for the estate tax from the 2009 policy of $3.5 million to $5 million, and cutting the tax rate from 45 percent to 35 percent.
“It's hard to believe they think it's wise to give a windfall to heirs such as Paris Hilton,” senior Democratic Representative Chris Van Hollen wrote in the Washington Post.
Democrats will likely try to change the tax bill with an amendment on the estate tax, though it is unclear if that could pass. MF Global analyst Chris Krueger said such a vote would be symbolic.

Representative Earl Pomeroy, the Democrat sponsor of a steeper estate tax proposal, told Reuters it was “unclear” if such a vote would pass.
He said Democrats will try because “some things are worth fighting for.” He then noted: “I will say this ... people want to get home and, you know sometimes, heading to the gate is a pretty powerful impetus to pass packages.”
